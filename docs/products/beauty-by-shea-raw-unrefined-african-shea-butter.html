            <li>I was thrilled to receive this organic butter and make recipes with it.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a Fair Trade product as well.</li>
            <li>I do not have the best skin and this really made a difference.</li>
            <li>I now have my own creamy blend to moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li>My opinion on her products are honest and unbiased.  </li>
            <li>My opinion on her products are honest and unbiased.  </li>
            <li>prefer to use mine after a nice warm bath and well dryed off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>The thoughts and opinions expressed in this review are my OWN and were no way swayed by my decision.</li>
            <li>It works great for mixing my own body butter and it is silky smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>Just warm it up between your palms and apply.</li>
            <li>It came in a plastic wrap which, in turn, was nicely packaged in a waterproof, airtight and resealable bag.  </li>
            <li>But after some advice here and trying it myself, I found that it just needed to get warm in my palm for a while.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice too, kinda nutty and buttery.  </li>
            <li>I use this in my hair and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>I was provided this product to review, and have stated my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to make my own body butter</li>
            <li>I have used it on my own skin and my husband puts it on his hands.</li>
            <li>Very nice and smooth for my DIY body lotion.</li>
            <li>exactly 16oz and product seems very good quality.  </li>
            <li>I experienced an earthy scent which goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Light, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good consistency for a lotion and easy to mix.</li>
            <li>I received it to try for free, but I honestly when I saw it, didn&#x27;t know if the review would be good.</li>
            <li>but it had a very strong odor, even after I added EOs.</li>
            <li>This is amazing to work with I love it.</li>
            <li>I also like that you get a huge block of the Shea butter for a good price</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s been wonderful.  </li>
            <li>You can melt it and pour it into tubes to make your own home made chap stick which will be much better for your lips than the stuff you find in stores.  </li>
            <li>The best.&lt;br /&gt;The most effective night cream in the universe.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use warm water to help it melt even faster.  </li>
            <li>The butter itself has a good texture and is absolutely free of any impurities.  </li>
            <li>I would also love to make my own bar soap using shea butter</li>
            <li>and I feel like this is going to give me the most effective moisturizing</li>
            <li>When I take a hot bath I put it on my legs and enjoy the best shave ever...</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and will look for this listing when I need more healthy shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels really good to know that my purchase is contributing to supporting Fair Trade business in Ghana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shea is so smooth, easy to use &amp; feels great.</li>
            <li>It arrived right on time and feels great.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light nutty aroma that I found blended well with most of the aroma oils I added!</li>
            <li>I love using shea butter, it has so many uses, and treats so many things!</li>
            <li>(I love natural oils best).</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this Shea butter is organic, better for me and better for the environment.</li>
            <li>This product is great, I bought this for my wife and she was hesitant at first.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, arrived timely, in great condition; a perfect, raw product.</li>
            <li>very light smoky smell.</li>
            <li>Very smooth.</li>
            <li>That is a very thoughtful jester.  </li>
            <li>My first great surprise after ordering shea butter from Healthy Life Essentials was that shipping and arrival of the package were speedier than anything else I have ordered on Amazon ...</li>
            <li>Those who wrote that it&#x27;s easy to warm weren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li>Love it just what I needed for my mixture.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it : )</li>
            <li>Overall I am very impressed with the quality and the results from the use of this product</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the smoothness and delivery quality.  </li>
            <li>A downfall of many beard oils for me is trying to get it off my hands after application.  </li>
            <li>With many oil products after you&#x27;ve over-done it you&#x27;re going to have to take a shower or walk around with oil-soaked beard/hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many sketchy online experiences with shea butters and their claims.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil works better and smells better.</li>
            <li>Sure am glad I did just that.</li>
            <li>Love the Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>I think I may need to do a bit more research before I use it again, although, some of my friends really enjoyed the body balm that I made.</li>
            <li>Love this shea butter</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>I enjoyed this butter all winter.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It mixed perfectly with my oils; no complaints over here.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way my skin tone has changed and even out.</li>
            <li>Love this Shea butter, but it seems to be out of stock a lot.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I will be able to order again soon.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I agreed to review this product.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling, it is not greasy like most creams, and lotions.</li>

            <li>will not lie, I love shea butter.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic for feet!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for more than that from a seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s safe to use on and around pets.</li>
            <li>The thicker, the better.</li>
            <li>So I get some heat going, scoop out a dime sized portion, place it on my palms, and rub some more.  </li>
            <li>Butter:&lt;br /&gt;It is unrefined Shea butter which is better for your skin.</li>
            <li>and it was okay</li>
            <li>Top quality and organic, just like it should be.</li>
            <li>I love that it is filtered twice - once in Ghana and once when it reaches the states.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this to make homemade body butter and the consistency is great and is going to mix up really well with Cocoa butter, etc.</li>
            <li>I love that it is unrefined and organic and contains no chemical or toxic substances.</li>
            <li>There are so many DIY products that you can do using this ingredient(and</li>
            <li>I have researched many recipes on how to use Shea Butter and plan on adding it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Nice smooth texture and smell.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizing blend as it leaves my skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li>recently is that it’s great for sunburns!</li>
            <li>I took quite awhile to decide what company I was going to buy from, and I&#x27;m glad I found Beauty By Shea</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>What I love best about Beauty by Shea is she provided an actual tin to store your creations in.  </li>
            <li>My favorite was the hair mask I have never thought about using Shea butter for the hair.  </li>
            <li>This is why you find these 2 vitamins in so many beauty products however they are spoiled with all chemicals that they put in them.  </li>
            <li>My skin and my hair thank you also.so many beauty products however they are spoiled with all chemicals that they put in them.  </li>
            <li>So, once I realized that it was in fact the way that it was &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be, I enjoyed</li>
            <li>I find that my skin is more supple to the products that I use and as we all know, sometimes water has a tendency to bring out the dryness in ANYTHING.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy, I really want to eventually experiment with some oils to get a &amp;#34;scented butter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried 100% authentic shea butter</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>Then, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect having never used a shea butter before.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly, it did not make my clothes &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>My hands are 80% better and my feet are too.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS TYPE FROM AMAZON?</li>
            <li>I have worked with Shea butters before and enjoy using them to create my own creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>I am in love...</li>
            <li>This is the purest, cleanest, most nourishing shea butter I have EVER purchased.</li>
            <li>love this product and would recommend it to anyone-</li>
            <li>Love Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I love how it is packaged in the reusable bag.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Extremely potent odor.  </li>
            <li>In addition, with many hand lotions I have tried, I need to re-apply each time</li>
            <li>I frequently enjoyed the opportunity to use body surfboards at Labadi Beach.  </li>
            <li>Hmmm, that gives me some ideas :)</li>
            <li>You really feel like you are doing something great for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I do love shea butter</li>
            <li>I do love creature comforts and I opened the bag and slathered up.  </li>
            <li>Some people use it for diaper rash, eczema, and of course many are using in on their less-than-lustrous hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this shea butter, and use it quite often.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels.  </li>

            <li>Texture is really smooth and I made body butter using the shea butter !</li>
            <li>I love to make DIY products at home</li>
            <li>I did some research on the many, many uses of this product and decided I would try two of them for this review.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this shea butter has a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell - it just would smell better with some lavender or eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>That said, this seems like a product I would be more inclined to use in the winter when my skin is at its driest</li>
            <li>LOVE this Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Love the consistency -</li>

            <li>This was some of the best shea butter I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.  </li>

            <li>I love shea butter and will enjoy using it.</li>

            <li>Smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, MANY lotions, creams, ointments, you name it, but none of them really made a huge difference in my skin.</li>

            <li>It also had a free tin</li>
            <li>I received this for free so that I could try it and review it, but my opinions are mine.</li>

            <li>Smooth texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the shea butter for about a week and have been so impressed that I don&#x27;t need to wait any longer to let everyone know how much I like this product.  </li>
            <li>Wash out in the morning, and hello gorgeous soft, shiny hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and  so far, so good, no peeling skin.  </li>
            <li>The bottle will likely tout the percentage of shea right on the front as being the most important ingredient (15% if its a good product), yet most of the bottle will be filled with chemicals...</li>
            <li>I love being able to use this raw Shea butter because it has a great effect on the skin.</li>
            <li>It had no strong scent, and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>As a strong supporter of organic, pure choices for our family, this shea butter is pure and a Fair Trade import product.</li>
            <li>It comes packaged in a very nice sealed back.</li>
            <li>I am very, very pleased and happy with the product and plan to purchase this item again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I mix it with cocoa butter and other oils for an incredible body butter.</li>
            <li>the best part, to me, is that is organic, raw, and unrefined.</li>
            <li>was I using Shea butter since I was pregnant, and even still use my whole body and hair, and I can say that it is best for your skin and hair during my pregnancy never left me stretch marks</li>
            <li>The scent is strong, but not really unpleasant.</li>
            <li>We have both been using it to moisturize our skin, it&#x27;s fantastic right after a shower or bath!  </li>
            <li>Great gift ideas for Christmas or a quick last minute gift!</li>
            <li>nuts are from a unique species of tree that lives over two hundred years, Vitellaria paradoxa.  </li>
            <li>There was a problem with the first 16 oz package that was ordered from Healthy Essentials (Beauty By Shea).</li>
            <li>Moisture rich but not greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Shae Butter is rich in Vitamins.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s just straight-up shea butter, with no weird chemicals or additives.</li>
            <li>I will celebrate my 60th birthday soon and was excited to try it&#x27;s vitamin rich moisturizing properties on my aging skin.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this so much!</li>
            <li>: a sample of this product was provided free of charge, however this is my true opinion regardless of cost.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very important to me to use a product that&#x27;s healthy and all natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super thrilled to get some of my very own 100% raw and unrefined shea butter.  </li>
            <li>(clean) hands&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just apply with clean hands onto your clean face.</li>
            <li>This product is great for anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>so I am always looking for more ways to replace hazardous chemicals, while saving money at the same time.</li>
            <li>Great for my skin in the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>Not grainy and works great on dry skin.</li>
            <li>It smelled nice and actually moisturized my skin better than any lotion has.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was super Eco friendly as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Healthy Life Essentials and this product, which I will continue to enjoy using.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, clean and has the right texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a great big brick, nothing pretty to look at, no fancy packaging but enclosed in plastic and inside a brown paper bag with the label.</li>
            <li>This butter smelled good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>This is true for any oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it, I used t for a week and my feet now is smooth.</li>
            <li>Inside the bag is the Shea butter, which is sealed separately, a nice round tin (for use when making your own products), and a card with instructions on how to claim your free Ebook.</li>
            <li>Not so good as a different brand I bought before in amazon.  </li>
            <li>but you never know the full amount and quality.</li>
            <li>However, having the earthy musk is reassuring that we are working with a true unrefined</li>
            <li>I was given 1lb of it to try complimentary which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am very hopeful this winter taht we will be able to keep everything under control.</li>
            <li>Although there is no use by date, when unrefined shea butter is stored in a cool place it has a shelf life up to 2</li>
            <li>I mix with Lavender essence and sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>My opinions are completely mine, and honest.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>Leaves my lips exfoliate, clean, and super moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;-Hair</li>
            <li>Shea Butter doesn&#x27;t really have an expiration date, and it remains in even better stature if you place it in the fridge after opening.</li>
            <li>I hope you love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I would have to say, this is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>and no painful hanging skin on the sides of my nails.</li>
            <li>I am very appreciative that the shea butter sold by Healthy Life Essentials is 100% organic, raw, unrefined, Grade A premium.  </li>
            <li>This product is perfect for my dry and sensitive diabetic skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the good batch that I received have a more nutty smell and is less waxy.</li>
            <li>But, I used this product for my first try, and it was so easy to do.  </li>
            <li>you are more creative, it would be a perfect base in many recipes for homemade lotions or balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My product came in great condition and the quality seems to be great compared to the yellow stuff I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>It was a great surprise because it&#x27;s just not very often that you get extras these days!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li>It melts quickly and it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild and somewhat earthy or nutty.</li>
            <li>It has a mild nutty smell, and is beige in color.</li>
            <li>Product works as promised making your skin smooth and hair soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It has a bit of a learning curve to use it, but a quick google search found lots of info.</li>
            <li>It is mild, nutty and moist.</li>
            <li>Mild smell.</li>
            <li>I have found that it is super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>To start with,  super gold stars for a delivery that came days before posted arrival.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li>I can make my own products knowing what is in them and make them to fit my needs with the addition of essential oils.</li>
            <li>However, after one use of this shea butter, my hair was noticeably softer, more moisturized, and more manageable the following morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packed.  </li>
            <li>Super moisturizing, healed up my cracked feet and knuckes.</li>
            <li>Cleopatra, last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, is still counted among the world&#x27;s greatest beauties centuries later.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I would highly recommend this product and the seller (Healthy Essentials/Beauty By Shea) as well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t promise your batch with be like mine, but I can assure you I just made gifts and personal products using what I have from this seller, and so far so good!</li>
            <li>This Shea butter is very unusual,  nothing but shea butter!  </li>
            <li>I was contacted about the shortage &amp; their customer service is very willing to help.    </li>
            <li>Good price for the amount you get and for my family it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about it for so long that I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how easy it was to scoop the Shea Butter out of the bag!</li>
            <li>I could smell the package as it lay on my counter when I passed by, and it wasn&#x27;t the pleasant smell I expected.  </li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of white chocolate, but not so sweet.</li>
            <li>I love the more youthful appearance that lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>And this is exactly it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely planning on purchasing more as I run out!</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I was excited but intimidated.</li>
            <li>It is much more creamy and easy to use than the yellow butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much a fragrance free kinda guy, and the shea butter has very distinct aroma.</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep it cool, if you live in hot climates like me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are tons of other uses and I&#x27;m just going to have to keep reading more and experimenting to get the full benefit</li>
            <li>Not to mention that this helps hard working people who create a wonderful and abundant product, if anyone can confirm that this goes right to the people and not a shady middle man somewhere, please let me know I would be glad to buy five to ten more for family and friends this summer.  </li>
            <li>It shipped fast and the packaging was secure.</li>
            <li>Any weather the Shea will act as a protectant,help me calm my skin prolems nd texture.</li>
            <li>It absorbed well and wasn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, my beard was feeling fantastic and has been since.  </li>
            <li>Please note I was offered this product, complimentary, as part of a product testing program.  </li>
            <li>It melts nicely and is not gritty at all.  </li>
            <li>fresh, not rancid (Shea Butter will eventually get rancid,</li>
            <li>It took hours before it was completely absorbed, but my skin was noticeably softer after two applications twelve hours apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural</li>
            <li>It smells divine, like fresh cashew butter and earth.</li>
            <li>use shea for tons of useful things, like...</li>
            <li>and mix 50/50 with your favorite natural oil to make a spreadable lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;DIsclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>It mixed well with my oils and maintain that nice nutty smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product but the only thing I don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li>It blends nicely with all carrier oils, beeswax, and essential oils.  </li>
            <li>This unrefined shea butter is a quality ingredient you can use to make your own personal care and beauty products.</li>
            <li>I like natural skin care products and noticed that some of my favorite products contain Shea Butter</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>If so inclined, this can be turned into your own homemade body butters, scented with essential oils if you wish.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it, wish that would have been made more clear by the seller.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Organic Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no expiration date, but either keep it in a cool dark place (fridge is good)</li>
            <li>I do scent with rose essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this to make my own body butter with essential oils.</li>
            <li>Arrived fresh and well sealed.</li>
            <li>I received this free from Beauty By Shea as a testing product and will most definitely purchase it again and again.</li>
            <li>This will help to keep it fresh and also did not ruin the bag in case it melted.</li>
            <li>During our North Texas [Dallas/Fort Worth] winters I have to apply all over.</li>
            <li>, I believe it is inherent to the product, but it&#x27;s noticeable and it took several hours after application for me to stop catching the scent.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and moisturizing and a great product to put on right before bed - my favorite is to apply it to my feet before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe that this shea butter smells like shea butter is supposed to smell, and that in order to produce a product with no scent would mean over-processing it to the point where it has lost most, if not all, of the components that make it good for you.</li>
            <li>Although you can use this as-is right on your skin, I prefer to add an essential oil (like lavender or gardenia) to it to give it a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I heard from some friends that pure shea butter might do the trick, so I was excited to try it for myself.</li>
            <li>I have found that a little of this wonderful shea butter goes a long way, so I may not need more very soon.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves a very pretty shine behind, so if you aren’t pregnant and just want to lovely glow to your skin, this would be a good product to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am excited to use the real, unrefined stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell right at all.</li>
            <li>you want to use it right away without whipping, you can take a hair dryer to a section for 10-15 seconds to soften it and just apply it to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>right soften like play doh.</li>
            <li>It looked as if it had been taken right from the Shea nut.</li>
            <li>He uses it every night right after his shower.  </li>
            <li>It seems to get kind of tacky and left a feeling of being coated… I took a hot bath afterward tho</li>
            <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t research enough to figure out that this has a very strong smoky smell.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Unlike the horror stories I have read about from other buyers after purchasing what was claimed to be &amp;#34;100% organic&amp;#34; but turned out to be a bag of &amp;#34;hot mess, &amp;#34; I am happy to report that this product is of great quality and far from a horror story.</li>
            <li>It is a high grade Shea Butter that applies smoothly to the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; and is very pure.</li>
            <li>other than that, it is a great product and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant  and the texture is soft not gritty.</li>
            <li>I use it as an eye cream too for those newly forming fine lines</li>
            <li>I am so happy I decided to try this brand and not let the brands in the past influence this for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a production date, but it smells fresh and exactly like</li>
            <li>The product itself is pretty cool- pure block of Shea butter that melts as you apply body heat by rubbing it on.</li>
            <li>In spite of that hypersensitivity to many things I apply topically, I had no bad reaction to this shea butter even after many days of daily use.  </li>
            <li>Seller thoughtfully included a new 2 oz.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it on my skin as a night time moisturizer and although it takes a long time for it to absorb, the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>Lavender essential oil    Measure and place all ingredients into a mixing bowl, then blend using a hand mixer until lump free and a smooth velvety texture.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t brave enough to add food coloring to it, I had fears of having blue skin forever.  </li>
            <li>I intend to make my own natural body butter, but so far have just used it neat.</li>
            <li>As a previous customer I was delighted to be given this product to review.</li>
            <li>it is important that it is white and smooth texture</li>
            <li>and I had applied the raw Shea Butter directly to my feet at night, slipped some socks on and in the morning my feet felt incredibly smooth (better than when I would go get pedicures)!!  </li>
            <li>The first time slathered it on, I used about a dime worth on both my feet and elbows and it was MORE than enough.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I am currently using the shea butter straight, as received, it can be a great base for many wonderful do-it-yourself personal pampering products, for which free information and recipes can be found online.  </li>
            <li>It came very fast and exceeded my expectations on the quality.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li>I feel glad to be using Shea and commenting about it for its such a good product I have a normal to dry skin and sometimes after cleansing, my Florida weather makes my skin lack lustre and moisture.</li>
            <li>I probably would have never bought this on my own but since this was a free sample I see why people are using raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>recommend this if you want a chemical free moisturizer in the winter or even summer, and you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I gotta say I tried many eye creams and none of them gave the same hydration as this butter!</li>
            <li>Wow the product is so smooth and buttery.  </li>
            <li>I only write this review because I am also drowning in a sea of frustration over which reviews are believable.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review - and will be purchasing more when we eventually run out.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>Bleeding stopped with the first application.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased shea butter</li>
            <li>my face is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love packaging, it&#x27;s a big part of what I look for in a products, as a consumer.</li>
            <li>This item has helped me out so much!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I try Shea Butter</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>It has a light, natural scent, which I would probably describe as earthy or nutty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a nutty smell at first, but it goes away after a couple of minuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My whole family loves it!</li>
            <li>Since I work with my hands a lot, this is pretty</li>
            <li>The first thing I decided to do was order a bunch of first grade or</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Since it is not infused with water for fast evaporation, it takes a bit longer to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>I have used many products that contained Shea Butter, especially for stretch marks for pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I use this on him at night for a foot massage &amp; it has really made a difference!</li>
            <li>so I gave her some to try out first.</li>
            <li>Thanks beauty by Shea!  </li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>No humidity and hot temperatures.</li>
            <li>Beauty By Shea&#x27;s wonderful product arrived, and following the directions, I scooped off a small amount and warmed it between my hands to soften before applying to my affected areas.</li>
            <li>I need consistent quality with my orders.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li>This one smelled funny compared to all the others.  </li>
            <li>However, I do look forward to re-ordering it from Healthy Life Essentials in the future.</li>
            <li>and this one is exactly that.</li>
            <li>While it may be greasy at first...</li>
            <li>I give the product 4 stars rather than 5 because as a skin lotion, it is more of a time-consuming process to use rather than simply squirting out a dab and rubbing it on.</li>
            <li>I would love to try adding some essential oils to it and then using it as a body lotion!</li>
            <li>I used to teach first grade</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;d ever seen and/or used Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>Nothing is added and that is especially important with shea butter as it loses a lot of its power once processed.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing Shea Butter</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to use half the Shea butter for the recipe and it made a very good size body scrub (definitely money saving).</li>
            <li>During the winter when dry, cracked skin sets in this Beauty by Shea African shea butter will be a welcome addition once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great shea butter, less pungent than the non-organic version, packaging a bit akward - can be fixed by re-packaging.</li>
            <li>Product seems very pure and very high quality.</li>
            <li>It came with a small tin can which is a perfect size to refill and carry on, filled it up and sure enough she grew into it and now uses this everyday as do I.  </li>
            <li>The shae butter, provided for free in exchange for an honest review, very neatly resolves that issue since it comes in a solid bar and one only has to pull off pieces and emolliate in order to apply.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and will last for a long time!Packaging is also great.</li>
            <li>You can use it as is or mix it with other ingredients to create your own products, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try using raw organic shea butter instead of my normal deep conditioner (which I am sure is processed more than I care to know!).</li>
            <li>product is a fantastic moisturizer and great for a wide variety of things, including dry skin, stretch marks, eczema, sunburns, and many other skin conditions - and I can even use it on the kids.  </li>
            <li>and her cracked hands have healed and stayed soft and her elbows are now soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I loved the little tin that accompanied it!</li>
            <li>It is EXACTLY what pure, unrefined ivory shea is supposed to smell like.</li>
            <li>However, it was strong the first day and the smell dissipated the second day.</li>
            <li>I figured I would give it a shot based on all the positive Amazon feedback.  </li>
            <li>silky smooth legs with no dry skin in sight!!</li>
            <li>I have a torn tendon in my left foot, and find it more comfortable to kneel than squat, especially when working in the garden, etc.  </li>
            <li>This natural, vitamin rich product is so much healthier to use!!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>This shea butter was much dirtier than the first pound.</li>
            <li>: I would much rather buy the ingredients in bulk and make the products myself so that I know exactly what&#x27;s going into my skin.</li>
            <li>The most beneficial thing about shea butter is that it does not clog pores and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The light, natural fragrance is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>butter is an effective natural moisturizer--which is why it is a common ingredient in many quality beauty products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this was my first use, the natural smell took some getting used to, but it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>The nutty smell is present, but it is a very pleasant, mellow smell, which I believe is the natural smell of a FRESH unrefined raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>effect seems to last as long as avocado oil&lt;br /&gt;Applies just easily as avocado oil, feels a bit more dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just cut off a tiny part and it easily melts in your</li>
            <li>Trust me, my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, you have super soft skin and the effect lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how long I had to rub it in my warm hands to get it melt to a usable liquid.</li>
            <li>In summary, shea is a pretty wonderful, all-natural way to moisturize your skin without having to put all these crazy chemicals on yourself.</li>
            <li>Which it did, I could easily reshape it back into a brick style</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product for my dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly and isn&#x27;t white (not bleached).</li>
            <li>It is imported as pure, organic Shea butter from Ghana &amp; is filtered  again in a USA lab &amp; formed into blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That means it&#x27;s going to be a pure product for me to use.</li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But when I need to, I will certainly reorder from this seller.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll buy a new package in a few days because it&#x27;s actually a good product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m very pleased that it is 100% organic, raw, and unrefined.  </li>
            <li>Supplied for reviewing purposes, I am VERY satisfied with the 100% organic raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>I am not sure who was more excited about this stuff me or my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Consistency was fine, but there was definitely something off about this one.</li>
            <li>Mainly, it was because it came in a brick form which she found funny because it reminded her of India and her village as this what their butter looks like.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Nice little freebie as well.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and silly texture great for multiple uses!</li>
            <li>fresh, soft, creamy...similar to Life-Flo Pure Shea, but much fresher.</li>
            <li>Therefore, due to the greasy and smelly nature I do not think it a great practical product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it’s hard to really know if something is helping with stretch marks, this seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li>It is a huge chunk you get too, and it should last a while.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well and has information with it.  </li>
            <li>I agree it smells much like you would expect a nut-oil to smell -- I rather like it.  </li>
            <li>One caution: Don&#x27;t use too much at once or you might end up with greasy feeling beard/hair.  </li>
            <li>It is not sticky at all even in a very humid country in Singapore.</li>
            <li>That said, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Shea Butter is a very versatile product and has a lot of benefits.</li>
            <li>I used this product to make magnesium lotion and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>appreciated the opportunity to barter this product for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>The smell is earthy and very grounding.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would absolutely recommend this for use in creating your homemade hand creams as well as using just as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works really well as a hair mask</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, maybe a hint of a nutty smell.  </li>
            <li>You can add essential oils to it or add a dollop to your bathtub to make the water smooth.</li>
            <li>I was really scared to order another shea butter online since I tried it once before (from another company) and it was delivered moldy with some hair in it.</li>
            <li>I really like the quality on this Shea Butter when I take it into my hands.</li>
            <li>the shea butter into a glass jar made it much easier to apply it after each shower.</li>
            <li>Feel free to experiment with the essential oils and even the carrier oils you prefer.</li>
            <li>Feel free to experiment with the essential oils and even the carrier oils you prefer.</li>
            <li>really like that this shea butter is 100%</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>it to make lip balm and perfume sticks; use it straight up on elbows and callouses, on rashy baby butts.</li>
            <li>Fast service, quality product, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need to mix or add anything else; chances are, it&#x27;ll solve your problem using it alone.</li>
            <li>and thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to products I use on my skin because of it&#x27;s sensitivity</li>
            <li>I found that within seconds the butter heats when rubbed in your hands and is ready to be applied.</li>
            <li>I’ve never used “straight” Shea Butter before.</li>
            <li>is an ivory color Shea butter which means it has been Boiled for a longer period of time mellowing out color to more milder light, its lightened color to allow absorbing into the skin faster with extra fluff.</li>
            <li>In the morning, the skin on my feet and heels are much softer.  </li>
            <li>and she confirmed that it smell different.</li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t wait a whole week.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s saying a whole lot since my skinwas beginning to feel like tree bark</li>
            <li>IT WAS SO SOFT AND FRESH...</li>
            <li>They probably used too much.</li>
            <li>I did make the mistake of putting too much in my hair as an after washing moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A lot of the skin products on the market contain all kinds of chemicals that users are absorbing into their bodies.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt linger so it doesnt bother me too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m questioning whether it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>It can soften in shipment, but in the summer months I&#x27;d go for fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>husbands hands from work get very chapped with cracks.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The butter came very well packaged.</li>
            <li>I massaged it in to my (damp) hair gently from roots to tips and let is sit for just about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, I will defiantly use all of what I have, I will absolutely recommend to others, and it&#x27;s something that I would buy for myself.</li>
            <li>It is helping to moisturize my heels very well.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li>Here, a dab is too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 2 weeks now and my skin feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>My skin really appreciates that.</li>
            <li>Very emollient and soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>a prior customer of another product from this seller, I was luckily enough given the opportunity to receive this item at no cost however all opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li>Nice to keep it simple and reinforce the basic nature of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 4 different Shea Butters and this is my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li>I love this for my older dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many products that CONTAINED Shea butter but not pure Shea butter.</li>
            <li>No nasty peeling dry skin or that feeling of your sheets catching on your dead prickly skin!</li>
            <li>I attended a fabulous school, where I met not only Ghanaian kids, but kids from many other nations.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to make my own homemade body butter with a few simple ingredients!  </li>
            <li>Application time has to be right as your skin will be sticky for a while, but once it penetrates your skin, it make it so soft.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers out there.</li>
            <li>Who knew that in it&#x27;s purest form this product that we have become so familiar with could be so different.</li>
            <li>Seller is extremely personable and just lovely to work with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoother and smells better than the other 3 I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My wife started using essential oils towards the beginning of the year, and originally she was mixing oils with coconut oil for lotions.</li>
            <li>In this house shea butter has alleviated that cracked skin, but other uses abound.  </li>
            <li>All these years of trying so many other lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This nutrient rich fat is derived from the nut of  the African shea tree and is used in any number of products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally rich in essential vitamins, that will nourish you skin with Vitamin A, E, F and K.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to buy a high quality unprocessed shea butter like this one from Beauty By Shea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy about the value you get in this product - this is enough to last you for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I have started using it in place of a hand lotion I was using before because my knuckles tend to get dry and bleed easily.  </li>
            <li>so I keep a jar next to the kitchen sink and apply after clean ups and dishes.</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed by the skin and not only improves the texture of dry skin, but makes it look better, too.  </li>
            <li>I make my own body care products and was nervous about ordering &amp;#34;sight unseen.&amp;#34; I took a chance and this product is now in my wishlist to pull out the next time I need to order, which won&#x27;t be long.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I fought my inclination to be cheap and spent an extra few bucks for this shea butter from this seller.</li>
            <li>There are a ton of recipes online, and it&#x27;s super easy to add Raw Shea butter to your beauty products.</li>
            <li>I tried making some natural deodorant with it and the smell is so strong that even after 40 drops of essential oils, all you could smell was the shea.</li>
            <li>If you have dry and/or itchy, sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll love shea butter.</li>
            <li>I was offered to try this free after I had ordered other amazing products as a previous customer.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>It has a very soft, smooth texture unlike the gritty product I have purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li>You will find that it doesn&#x27;t take long AT ALL to melt into your pores giving you really smooth</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>It was hot here when it came and the package contained it well, it wasn&#x27;t melted, was just soft.  </li>
            <li>Beauty By Shea offers shea butter that is both unrefined and 100% organic, with absolutely nothing added - a must for a product I am putting on my skin!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unrefined Shea Butter is naturally rich in vitamins A, E, F, and fatty acids that make it super nourishing and moisturizing while not clogging pores.</li>
            <li>and that is even though I am used to getting very prompt service, and even though this package was sent from New York State to Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She preferred the Shea Butter combination because it was less greasy and more of a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish.</li>
            <li>shea butter has an earthy, slightly wood stove-like scent that is quite appealing.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter is one of the main ingredients in lotions and chapsticks.</li>
            <li>Finding a good quality Shea butter is very critical when it comes to using it in your everyday products.</li>
            <li>Next, I&#x27;ll get into what may be more personal preference.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I got my money back from them</li>
            <li>I also use a tiny bit on my hair and it makes it super shiny.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a decent sized 1lb.</li>
            <li>I used to have such soft and smooth skin, however,</li>
            <li>I use it as the main ingredient for my body butter.</li>
            <li>However with this shea butter, my skin still feels soft and smooth after multiple hand-washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this shea butter is meant only for external use, it has a very pleasing natural aroma that makes it seem almost good enough to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mainly use it after the shower and before bed on my feet, hands, elbows, and as needed like my neck to help with shaving.</li>
            <li>I will just weigh packages in the future, but I know this shea is much better than others I have tried on here that have been very gritty.</li>
            <li>This particular brand is a high quality, and I adore the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only significant annoyance with those oils revolves around how easily the oil gets transferred back from my hands onto the bottle and, subsequently, anything else the bottle touches.</li>
            <li>and this seems to be of high quality organic product, from its color and consistency.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shea butter.</li>
            <li>High quality product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this shea butter to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM AMAZON?</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe, the first batch was bad because both of the free shea butter that I received on the second and third orders are quite excellent.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference with this butter as it seems to work well into my skin and blends much easier than all other shea butters I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other lotions i have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I seem to adapt to the smell rather quickly, he mentioned several hours of smelling the product, I rarely notice it after initial application unless I&#x27;m petting my beard.  </li>
            <li>It is completely pure and natural.  </li>
            <li>The good news is:  it&#x27;s 100% organic raw unrefined African shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Love the little bonus tin.</li>
            <li>But after some research I found SO MANY things you can do with it... and in order to soften it, all you need is a little warmth (like rubbing it with your hands).</li>
            <li>However, I found that if I mixed a bit of it with a few drops of a scented oil I do like, the result was a wonderful combination of the scent I added and the shea butter odor I had come to love in other shea butter products I&#x27;d tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>Butter is easy to work with and extremely versatile.</li>
            <li>Another great use I discovered (unfortunately)</li>
            <li>The texture is so soft and doesn&#x27;t require too much work to melt in your palms.</li>
            <li>(hope I remembered it correctly) and these are good for anti aging because they are small molecules which can go through the skin (some anti aging molecules like hyalyron acid for example have difficulties to go through the skin because they are too big).</li>
            <li>I am very critical of products that claim to be 100% organic or natural, especially shea butter because there are so many companies out here that supply</li>
            <li>Has helped with a fresh scar, stretch marks, and overall moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going camping in a few weeks and be sure I will bring some Shea along to test on bug bites etc.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a few days now and my skin is definitely better and time will tell if my stretch marks goes away.</li>
            <li>For all the many years that I have been a customer of Amazon, this is the first time that I actually complained to a seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Similar to coconut oil, shea butter is firm at most room temperatures, but melts in the heat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different moisturizers with varying success.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loaded with antioxidants and vitamins A, E, F and K along with healthy fatty acids and  phytonutrients.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the lasting all natural moisture our family&#x27;s skin and hair are treated to with the 100% Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter from Beauty by Shea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The amount you get is sure to last you quite a long time.</li>
            <li>your confused by the texture, please know THAT&#x27;s A GOOD THING.  </li>
            <li>Nice neutral smell  melted it down with coconut oil, cocoa butter, and some essential oils and whipped it for lotion for sons eczema</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy to blend with other oils.</li>
            <li>I can just imagine when it gets colder and my skin gets dry and itchy, that I&#x27;ll have something on hand to fix it right up!</li>
            <li>The shea butter has a nice mild smell, almost like a faint coco butter smell.  </li>
            <li>I just used Jojoba because it mimics the oils in our skin cells and absorbs easily, and selected the essential oils I did for their specific skin care benfits.  </li>
            <li>I just used Jojoba because it mimics the oils in our skin cells and absorbs easily, and selected the essential oils I did for their specific skin care benfits.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super soft when I use this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I no longer have smooth and soft skin, so I need a product like shea butter, that will seep into my pores and help to eliminate those dry</li>
            <li>live in Phoenix, and normally wouldn&#x27;t dare order shea butter during summer,</li>
            <li>Honestly, as it is right now, I will definitly be buying this in the future.  </li>
            <li>It truly works and I am going to use it only sparingly the remainder of the summer, saving it for the winter months when it gets very dry in my region and this will prove a lot more</li>
            <li>I will have to try experimenting with a smaller amount on my fine, dry, straight hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Took a little crumbly piece and rubbed it in, it melted on the back of my hands nicely.</li>
            <li>I had been in the market for something new to oil and maintain my beard, so</li>
            <li>My family and I live an organic/natural lifestyle</li>
            <li>this was new.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert.</li>
            <li>I was worried my order of Shea butter would melt, since I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>easy as it is to apply directly to the skin, you can use it for a variety of other purposes.  </li>
            <li>I gently softened some shea butter along with some coconut oil and blended in a couple drops of very high quality essential oil.</li>
            <li>And while I personally don&#x27;t care for it straight, I liked it very much mixed with other</li>
            <li>Lastly, I love that this is a raw, organic product.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a moisturizer on my elbows and knees, both of which get quite dry and absorbs the shea butter quickly.</li>
            <li>This particular shea butter is imported from Ghana, where women gather the nuts from wild trees, shell and roast them, and extract the oils by hand.  </li>
            <li>I used a lime essential oil because I love the scent, but be careful with citrus as it can increase effects of sun exposure.</li>
            <li>My skin is really dry, to the point that lotions absorb quickly and tend to do nothing for me but leave me with eczema all over my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it on dry skin anywhere and on my pregnant belly to soothe stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>It is a little sticky at first, but quickly absorbs into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was asked if I was interested in reviewing this product, I was so excited to see that it was 100% ORGANIC RAW UNREFINED  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very natural odor.  </li>
            <li>Although I am not allergic to any nuts, I do have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this natural lotion to treat or help prevent skin problems.</li>
            <li>Then it feels very soft and silky like it should.  </li>
            <li>so I could give a more complete one rather than just a first impression from only few days use.  </li>
            <li>I have never used raw organic Shea Butter before but was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>It quickly penetrates the skin to immediately protect and infuse with rich lasting moisture and it deeply nourishes and hydrates dry scalp or damaged hair which helps to reduce dryness and flakiness.</li>
            <li>but I rubbed a little into my hands in it&#x27;s raw form, as a lotion, and I think it&#x27;s great stuff.  </li>
            <li>This Shea Butter is 100% pure, organic, grade A all natural, double filtered, and a nice ivory color, so you can use it directly on your skin, or you can blend it with other carriers like almond, coconut, jojoba and essential oils</li>
            <li>This is great because next time when I use it, I will not only use less, but I know it will last along time.</li>
            <li>This shea butter is completely raw and unrefined, so it retains all of the delightful nutty fragrance, subtle yellow color, and natural texture of pure organic shea butter.  </li>
            <li>is so soft!</li>
            <li>My skin soaks it up and then feels as soft as butter!  </li>
            <li>As for my scars, I think a longer period of usage will be necessary to see if it actually diminishes them, however, the skin around them looks more supple and as a result they don&#x27;t look as obvious.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it was enough to really add heat!  </li>
            <li>and this has been the only one that works consistently.  </li>
            <li>Can I say WOW!  </li>
            <li>However, I guess since all other shea butter I have used was just one ingredient of many in one brand or another of shea butter, I was expecting it to smell differently than it did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to incorporate the essential oil if you first soften up the shea butter in the microwave.</li>
            <li>It has, however, improved  the overall condition and appearance of their skin more so than any other product we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Also, even though it is rich in vitamins A and E, it is only for external use.</li>
            <li>so some dirt may be present, but it was far more than expected.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>highly recommended for various uses, definitely a smart purchase that goes far!</li>
            <li>This is pure, all organic Shea Butter from Ghana, and it should last 12 - 18 months if resealed after use and stored in a cool dry</li>
            <li>There are hundreds of uses for raw shea butter and since this is unrefined from Ghana, it is refreshing and natural.</li>
            <li>It should be nutty and a little strong.</li>
            <li>(mine were super dry before applying)&lt;br /&gt;Great for feet - made the calluses soft and feet supple</li>
            <li>Being that this is organic, raw, and unrefined, I find that the natural health benefits from it are by far better than any store bought product that may contain shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only real downside is that you have to &#x27;warm&#x27; it up in your hands before you apply it or it is a big stiff.</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad thing, since it appears to be perfectly organic in origin, but lingering scents in general just aren&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But my skin looks great, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now everyday after washing my face, and as a lip balm it lasts a lot longer than chap stick (I tend to chew my lips) and creates plenty of moisture for your lips!</li>
            <li>This was a free sample from being a previous customer of another product I had bought.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was pretty much what I expected for moisturizing however, the fragrance was a bit unfavorable to my nostrils.</li>
            <li>The nuts contain a rich complex of five different fatty acids that are good for the skin:  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the high quality of Shea Butter I want to use when making my dry skin repair creams for friends and family.</li>
            <li>If you live in the warmer climate and the whole thing starts melting, you can always put it in the refrigerator and in no time it will be solid once again.</li>
            <li>This comes in a huge brick that will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it did seem to heal my dried skin and was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on skin, in many areas, dry skin, rough patches, cracked heels, etc.</li>
            <li>This is more white and less nutty in its smell.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t get the bag open quick enough to try this Shea Butter out.</li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin where i get like little &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; everywhere, i use this on my body and face after every shower and my skin gets super soft and looks so much</li>
            <li>Raw Shea Butter has an aroma that some people find mildly disagreeable, but it&#x27;s easy to make various skin care products with and you can alter the scent to your liking by adding some essential oils to your recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pure Shae Butter is used differently than lotion though.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was smart and simple...</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it as a base with essential oils to create our own deodorant and love how well it&#x27;s worked!  </li>
            <li>I really love the fact that it is 100% Organic Raw Unrefined!  </li>
            <li>Sassafras oil (wanted the warming of the sassafras, but wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work so only did a little).  </li>
            <li>Same for his brother who for most little ones get in the habit of licking around the lips</li>
            <li>This was such amazing quality Raw Shea!</li>
            <li>I took a poll on fave scents and ordered a few from a wholesale supplier including almonds,vanilla ,lavender and other pleasant basic scents.</li>
            <li>We spent the weekend at Daytona Beach &amp; no matter how much or how high of a SPF we used we STILL ended up burnt!</li>
            <li>My hands had recently been getting quite rough and literally one use of the shea butter made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>When it is soft, you can use it immediately like a cream.</li>
            <li>No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to make lotion bars so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is how shea is suppose to smell, but I can&#x27;t imagine using it in any natural recipes.</li>
            <li>It makes my hands, legs, and feet feel moisturized, glowy, and soft like butter.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the Shea butter also made my skin supper soft and silky.</li>
            <li>check out my youtube channel reviewing the item (naturally scattered_kay)</li>
            <li>soft hands&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>My brother got a sample of this product for me as I have stretch marks and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>wow..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the natural smelling fragrance it has going on.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The butter was completely melted, but after being in the Phoenix mailbox at over 100 degrees all day, the container was intact.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone compliments me on my soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use shea butter directly on my skin as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>It actually has softened my skin so much that my pedicurist couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  </li>
            <li>for myself as well as my 2year old.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gently melt some, add a bit of aloe gel, whip til solid.</li>
            <li>Heals the burn, keeps the skin soft and pliable, and is antiseptic.</li>
            <li>The fastest delivery thus far from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I plan to temper my shea butter and add oils for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>to make a soft all natural body butter.</li>
            <li>This product comes directly from Ghana.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This natural Shea butter has not, by any means, gotten rid of their severe eczema.</li>
            <li>My first experience with shea butter was not all that long ago, and I was so baffled by the hardness of it.  </li>
            <li>After 3 days of not using the butter my elbows still remained soft.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter is wow.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a plus because I am sensitive to perfumes in my skincare.</li>
            <li>I know that it&#x27;s supposed to be natural</li>
            <li>The texture is so soft and velvety.</li>
            <li>So far no adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li>eat only vegan food, use only vegan personal care products, and am concerned about the health and environmental effects of the additives in many commercial products, even those touted as \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>and this is by far the smoothest, softest, and purest.  </li>
            <li>When I am making a natural lip scrub I take sugar, honey, and shea butter.</li>
            <li>each and both issues were completely healed.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised when I could not sleep</li>
            <li>If you do want to use all natural products then Shea Butter is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Your natural curls will bounce and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin still felt soft in the morning after showering.  </li>
            <li>it is so soft and creamy.</li>
            <li>It’s a natural sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer for myself and also on my two year old daughters eczema.</li>
            <li>Melts almost instantly, leaving a nice, thick ointment.</li>
            <li>It is good but expensive.</li>
            <li>Several years back the veins in my lower right leg</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Real, unrefined shea butter is off white/ivory to light yellow in color and will be a bit grainy due to its natural texture.</li>
            <li>The smell is genuine but not strong.</li>
            <li>My skin has gotten pretty dry and my hands would literally hurt after washing if I didn&#x27;t apply some type of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so it mixed well with the other scents and it was smooth with no imperfections</li>
            <li>It is much softer than other products I have tried which makes it much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>The odour is first unusual, but not strong and then it reminds me at a mixture of nuts and hay, very natural.</li>
            <li>Well the day after, she had used only a very little bit on my granddaughter, but called to say the rash had lightened up considerably, and her eczema patch was much better as well.</li>
            <li>Possibly due to not being absorbed as quickly?&lt;br /&gt;Fragrant for longer than the avocado oil&lt;br</li>
            <li>Possibly due to not being absorbed as quickly?&lt;br /&gt;Fragrant for longer than the avocado oil&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it to melt down with cocoa butter and some essential oils to make solid lotions as Christmas gifts for my family and the consistency was lovely.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s also why 100% raw is important.</li>
            <li>* Disclosure: a sample of this product was provided free of charge, however all opinions are my own.e using this every day especially during our long New England winters, when my skin gets so dry.  </li>
            <li>I applied it twice the first day, and probably 5-6 times on the second day, and by the third day my skin started to recover and regenerate.</li>
            <li>It may or may not have helped any better than the usual lotion I use (either Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion or CeraVe Renewing SA Cream).</li>
            <li>This was my second time purchasing this item, but the quality was different from the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is an additional personal reason that I appreciate this particular shea butter.  </li>
            <li>My 12-year-old son, who has very dry skin and would probably benefit from using it, doesn&#x27;t care for the smell and hasn&#x27;t been willing to use it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the Shea Butter smell is very minimal compared to many other beard products.    </li>
            <li>I have used some high quality commercial body lotions containing Shea and thought I knew the texture.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Beauty by Shea Organic Unrefined African</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using shea butter as a deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>This stuff is exactly what it says it is, pure raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li>, it gets soft and creamy very quickly, but still thick.</li>
            <li>This particular Organic Raw Unrefined Shea Butter is imported directly from Ghana and it&#x27;s 100% pure!  </li>
            <li>The Shea butter goes a long way- don&#x27;t need much for each application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It certainly stopped my dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>It was also a little stickier than I imagined, although the stickiness goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you&#x27;ve never used raw shea butter before, you might wonder why I get so excited about it.</li>
            <li>I love this raw Shea butter!!  </li>
            <li>My feet are super soft all the time now and the skin on my face is softer, moister, and I have less red spots and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>It saturates the area upon which it is applied with moisture and really cures those pesky dry spots.</li>
            <li>My daughter has even been using it in her hair since she has very curly African American hair.  </li>
            <li>Most other lotions and creams I tried did not help my hands or last long enough.  </li>
            <li>The consistency was very soft, and the color was an ivory white.</li>
            <li>My skin has been feeling soft, rejuvenated and for the first time in forever, it doesn&#x27;t itch due to sensitivity!</li>
            <li>have largely used it on my feet, which, as an every day runner, outdoors, in the winter, are very dry.</li>
            <li>Not grainy and no foreign objects.  </li>
            <li>plus it gives moisture like no other.  </li>
            <li>Upon further research of the supplying company, Beauty by Shea, I found that they have teamed up with a supplier of this product that pays the tribal women directly for making the butter, this has made me a forever customer!</li>
            <li>In trusting the other fellow reviewers who normally never fail me, I knew she would grow into it.  </li>
            <li>It seems like my skin always gets irritated specially during the summer because there is little to no humidity out here in Texas!</li>
            <li>It is heavy duty, more like Vaseline (without the chemical ingredients or smell) than the regular commercial cream and the results seem to last longer.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it all over my body, and my rough patches (upper arms and back, from getting irritated by rougher material in clothing) have smoothed right up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of people using their kitchen mixer for this, but there are mixers made for this purpose (personally, i wouldn&#x27;t do it in quantities high enough to justify the purchase of the equipment).</li>
            <li>I have started to blend it with a few other oils to create my own dry hand treatment cream.</li>
            <li>and I apply it on my skin to prevent stretch marks and fade scars and to moisturize my skin in general.</li>
            <li>so it just smells, well, like nothing in general.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it did not leave my skin feeling the least bit greasy, just smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Product as expected and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It is only needed the size of a penny to completely cover all the skin on one fist.</li>
            <li>Hello, I&#x27;m a dude and never really had much use for lotions or skin care products.</li>
            <li>It was soft enough that I could take a spoon and scoop it in a container.</li>
            <li>and it left my skin feeling incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>But I recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin or any skin related issues.</li>
            <li>so far I definitely think everyone should go out and buy this!</li>
            <li>Our skin has actually been quite soft since using it.  </li>
            <li>No rancid smell, it isn&#x27;t bleached white, it isn&#x27;t weirdly soft.</li>
            <li>You will need a natural essential oil to add if you are making body butter and want it to smell like something store-bought.</li>
            <li>I mainly use if for my dry lips.</li>
            <li>I used it to make a simple lotion for my sensitive skin, by whipping it with 1.5 tbsp of olive oil, and storing it in an upcycled tostitos salsa jar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a totally natural scent that indicates to me that I&#x27;m not dealing with numerous additives.  </li>
            <li>No need to have multiple products in your beauty cabinet when you just need organic shea butter that can do what normally you might have several products for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure how I feel about this as this is my first time purchasing Shea Butter... is this normal?</li>
            <li>I enjoy it melting slowly in my hands before using</li>
            <li>also use a cup warmer to melt shea and cconut oil during winter when they get solid and difficult to scoop and apply.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the gifts of nature and do you body good at the same time.</li>
            <li>It melts in your hand very quickly and a little definitely goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>On my skin it took about five minutes before my skin absorbed it, then it left a slightly oily sheen.</li>
            <li>this comes in a big block which is economical but less practical when it comes to using in a family or while traveling.</li>
            <li>After just two uses I have noticed a big difference, especially on the back of my hands, which seem to dry more than other exposed places on my body - even in the humid Central Florida summers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I did add a little scent to it, to make it smell a little more feminine.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using organic raw shea butter and it far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>When it arrived it was very soft due to the heat but about 30 minutes in the fridge fixed it.  </li>
            <li>I live in the cold, dry Midwest, so am always looking for a good moisturizer, especially for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>If it becomes too soft or melts, you can simply put it in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour until solid again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It totally melts the most hardcore waterproof mascara and eyeliner without stripping your skin, without being irritating, and with the added moisturizing benefit.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying this out, especially for those trouble spots.</li>
            <li>I opened the newer pack this morning, excited as usual!</li>
            <li>The butter does leave a thicker layer at first, so clothing will catch a little if out on immediately after application.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it at night mixed with some of her usual cream to get a softer result and some fragrance while still getting the longer lasting results of the butter, as for me, I probably like it precisely because it doesn&#x27;t smell like regular cream</li>
            <li>There are so many things that this can be used for as a base or carrier agent and we will definitely be ordering more when we run out (which may not be too long!).</li>
            <li>Surprising, the other half of the bad batch mixed better with the same recipe on a second try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a few days, I ordered the free shea butter along with other items from Amazon and it all arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applying a small amount of shea butter and allowing the warmth of my hand to smooth the shea butter to penetrate into my skin gives a long lasting softness.</li>
            <li>My only significant complaint was that it seemed to take longer for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li>Several old scars have reduced in a short time, I found adding some alpha lipoic acid powder to the blend seemed to further speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li>and my feet are no long cracking and peeling.    </li>
            <li>but apparently that still wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>I live in very dry climate, and every once in a while my knuckles crack to the point they start to bleed.</li>
            <li>I really like it for dry hands, feet, knees, elbows, and my daughter&#x27;s dry eczema</li>
            <li>I have ordered other unrefined raw shea butter- ivory from another company but the smell was such so strong for me to the point of being rancid.</li>
            <li>I decided to apply it directly to my face as it gets really dry.</li>
            <li>I typically just buy a lotion on sale and forget to use it or stop because it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>The Beauty by Shea organic raw shea butter is very much as described.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it makes my face greasy to the touch for several hours after I put it on, but the benefits far outweigh this minor annoyance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good quality shea butter and works to moisturize my crazy dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am buying shea butter in raw form...</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used raw Shea butter...</li>
            <li>First time buying raw shea butter.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying Raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>finally fixed my dry skin!</li>
            <li>On one leg, she applied the Bath and Bodyworks normal lotion; on the other, she applied the Shea Butter mixed with a bit of lotion.</li>
            <li>and it gets very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I know that I will continue using this every day especially during our long New England winters, when my skin gets so dry.  </li>

            <li> Why spend a lot for something that isn&#x27;t as good or nearly as healthy as what you can make yourself?</li>

            <li> I was thrilled to receive this organic butter and make recipes with it.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a Fair Trade product as well.</li>
            <li> I do not have the best skin and this really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I now have my own creamy blend to moisturize my skin.  </li>

            <li> My opinion on her products are honest and unbiased.  </li>
            <li> prefer to use mine after a nice warm bath and well dryed off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;**I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> The thoughts and opinions expressed in this review are my OWN and were no way swayed by my decision.</li>
            <li> It works great for mixing my own body butter and it is silky smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just warm it up between your palms and apply.</li>
            <li> It came in a plastic wrap which, in turn, was nicely packaged in a waterproof, airtight and resealable bag.  </li>
            <li> But after some advice here and trying it myself, I found that it just needed to get warm in my palm for a while.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice too, kinda nutty and buttery.  </li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and it works nicely.</li>
            <li> I was provided this product to review, and have stated my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own body butter</li>
            <li> I have used it on my own skin and my husband puts it on his hands.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth for my DIY body lotion.</li>
            <li> exactly 16oz and product seems very good quality.  </li>
            <li> I experienced an earthy scent which goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Light, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good consistency for a lotion and easy to mix.</li>
            <li> I received it to try for free, but I honestly when I saw it, didn&#x27;t know if the review would be good.</li>
            <li> but it had a very strong odor, even after I added EOs.</li>
            <li> This is amazing to work with I love it.</li>
            <li> I also like that you get a huge block of the Shea butter for a good price</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s been wonderful.  </li>
            <li> You can melt it and pour it into tubes to make your own home made chap stick which will be much better for your lips than the stuff you find in stores.  </li>
            <li> The best.&lt;br /&gt;The most effective night cream in the universe.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use warm water to help it melt even faster.  </li>
            <li> The butter itself has a good texture and is absolutely free of any impurities.  </li>
            <li> I would also love to make my own bar soap using shea butter</li>
            <li> and I feel like this is going to give me the most effective moisturizing</li>
            <li> When I take a hot bath I put it on my legs and enjoy the best shave ever...</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and will look for this listing when I need more healthy shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels really good to know that my purchase is contributing to supporting Fair Trade business in Ghana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shea is so smooth, easy to use &amp; feels great.</li>
            <li> It arrived right on time and feels great.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light nutty aroma that I found blended well with most of the aroma oils I added!</li>
            <li> I love using shea butter, it has so many uses, and treats so many things!</li>
            <li> (I love natural oils best).</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this Shea butter is organic, better for me and better for the environment.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I bought this for my wife and she was hesitant at first.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, arrived timely, in great condition; a perfect, raw product.</li>
            <li> very light smoky smell.</li>
            <li> Very smooth.</li>
            <li> That is a very thoughtful jester.  </li>
            <li> My first great surprise after ordering shea butter from Healthy Life Essentials was that shipping and arrival of the package were speedier than anything else I have ordered on Amazon ...</li>
            <li> Those who wrote that it&#x27;s easy to warm weren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li> Love it just what I needed for my mixture.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it : )</li>
            <li> Overall I am very impressed with the quality and the results from the use of this product</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the smoothness and delivery quality.  </li>
            <li> A downfall of many beard oils for me is trying to get it off my hands after application.  </li>
            <li> With many oil products after you&#x27;ve over-done it you&#x27;re going to have to take a shower or walk around with oil-soaked beard/hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many sketchy online experiences with shea butters and their claims.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil works better and smells better.</li>
            <li> Sure am glad I did just that.</li>
            <li> Love the Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> I think I may need to do a bit more research before I use it again, although, some of my friends really enjoyed the body balm that I made.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>

            <li> I enjoyed this butter all winter.  </li>
            <li> and I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It mixed perfectly with my oils; no complaints over here.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way my skin tone has changed and even out.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter, but it seems to be out of stock a lot.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I will be able to order again soon.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>

            <li> This is my own opinion and I was given this product free of charge to test it.</li>

            <li> Love the stuff.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I agreed to review this product.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling, it is not greasy like most creams, and lotions.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is an ingredient that pops up in many products</li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> will not lie, I love shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for feet!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for more than that from a seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Thanks for great product.</li>
            <li> * Disclosure: a sample of this product was provided free of charge, however all opinions are my own.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s safe to use on and around pets.</li>
            <li> The thicker, the better.</li>
            <li> So I get some heat going, scoop out a dime sized portion, place it on my palms, and rub some more.  </li>
            <li> Butter:&lt;br /&gt;It is unrefined Shea butter which is better for your skin.</li>
            <li> and it was okay</li>
            <li> Top quality and organic, just like it should be.</li>
            <li> I love that it is filtered twice - once in Ghana and once when it reaches the states.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to make homemade body butter and the consistency is great and is going to mix up really well with Cocoa butter, etc.</li>
            <li> I love that it is unrefined and organic and contains no chemical or toxic substances.</li>
            <li> There are so many DIY products that you can do using this ingredient(and</li>
            <li> I have researched many recipes on how to use Shea Butter and plan on adding it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Nice smooth texture and smell.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizing blend as it leaves my skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li> recently is that it’s great for sunburns!</li>
            <li> I took quite awhile to decide what company I was going to buy from, and I&#x27;m glad I found Beauty By Shea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> What I love best about Beauty by Shea is she provided an actual tin to store your creations in.  </li>
            <li> My favorite was the hair mask I have never thought about using Shea butter for the hair.  </li>
            <li> This is why you find these 2 vitamins in so many beauty products however they are spoiled with all chemicals that they put in them.  </li>
            <li> My skin and my hair thank you also.so many beauty products however they are spoiled with all chemicals that they put in them.  </li>
            <li> So, once I realized that it was in fact the way that it was &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be, I enjoyed</li>
            <li> I find that my skin is more supple to the products that I use and as we all know, sometimes water has a tendency to bring out the dryness in ANYTHING.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy, I really want to eventually experiment with some oils to get a &amp;#34;scented butter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried 100% authentic shea butter</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> Then, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect having never used a shea butter before.  </li>
            <li> Interestingly, it did not make my clothes &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My hands are 80% better and my feet are too.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TYPE FROM AMAZON?</li>
            <li> I have worked with Shea butters before and enjoy using them to create my own creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> I am in love...</li>
            <li> This is the purest, cleanest, most nourishing shea butter I have EVER purchased.</li>

            <li> Love Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I love how it is packaged in the reusable bag.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Extremely potent odor.  </li>
            <li> In addition, with many hand lotions I have tried, I need to re-apply each time</li>
            <li> I frequently enjoyed the opportunity to use body surfboards at Labadi Beach.  </li>
            <li> Hmmm, that gives me some ideas :)</li>
            <li> You really feel like you are doing something great for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I do love shea butter</li>
            <li> I do love creature comforts and I opened the bag and slathered up.  </li>
            <li> Some people use it for diaper rash, eczema, and of course many are using in on their less-than-lustrous hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this shea butter, and use it quite often.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels.  </li>
            <li> This company provides such wonderful products.  </li>

            <li> It is so smooth!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this shea butter has a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell - it just would smell better with some lavender or eucalyptus.</li>

            <li> and  so far, so good, no peeling skin.  </li>
            <li> The bottle will likely tout the percentage of shea right on the front as being the most important ingredient (15% if its a good product), yet most of the bottle will be filled with chemicals...</li>

            <li> (clean) hands&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just apply with clean hands onto your clean face.</li>
            <li> This product is great for anyone with dry skin.  </li>

            <li> Packaging was super Eco friendly as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Healthy Life Essentials and this product, which I will continue to enjoy using.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth, clean and has the right texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a great big brick, nothing pretty to look at, no fancy packaging but enclosed in plastic and inside a brown paper bag with the label.</li>
            <li> This butter smelled good enough to eat.</li>
            <li> This is true for any oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth it, I used t for a week and my feet now is smooth.</li>
            <li> Inside the bag is the Shea butter, which is sealed separately, a nice round tin (for use when making your own products), and a card with instructions on how to claim your free Ebook.</li>
            <li> Not so good as a different brand I bought before in amazon.  </li>
            <li> but you never know the full amount and quality.</li>
            <li> However, having the earthy musk is reassuring that we are working with a true unrefined</li>
            <li> I was given 1lb of it to try complimentary which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am very hopeful this winter taht we will be able to keep everything under control.</li>
            <li> Although there is no use by date, when unrefined shea butter is stored in a cool place it has a shelf life up to 2</li>
            <li> I mix with Lavender essence and sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> My opinions are completely mine, and honest.</li>

            <li> I hope you love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I would have to say, this is my absolute favorite.  </li>

            <li> This product is perfect for my dry and sensitive diabetic skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the good batch that I received have a more nutty smell and is less waxy.</li>
            <li> But, I used this product for my first try, and it was so easy to do.  </li>
            <li> you are more creative, it would be a perfect base in many recipes for homemade lotions or balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My product came in great condition and the quality seems to be great compared to the yellow stuff I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> It was a great surprise because it&#x27;s just not very often that you get extras these days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li> It melts quickly and it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild and somewhat earthy or nutty.</li>
            <li> It has a mild nutty smell, and is beige in color.</li>
            <li> Product works as promised making your skin smooth and hair soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> It has a bit of a learning curve to use it, but a quick google search found lots of info.</li>
            <li> It is mild, nutty and moist.</li>
            <li> Mild smell.</li>
            <li> I have found that it is super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> To start with,  super gold stars for a delivery that came days before posted arrival.</li>

            <li> I received it quickly and it was well packaged.</li>

            <li> This Shea butter is very unusual,  nothing but shea butter!  </li>
            <li> I was contacted about the shortage &amp; their customer service is very willing to help.    </li>
            <li> Good price for the amount you get and for my family it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about it for so long that I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how easy it was to scoop the Shea Butter out of the bag!</li>
            <li> I could smell the package as it lay on my counter when I passed by, and it wasn&#x27;t the pleasant smell I expected.  </li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of white chocolate, but not so sweet.</li>
            <li> I love the more youthful appearance that lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> And this is exactly it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely planning on purchasing more as I run out!</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I was excited but intimidated.</li>
            <li> It is much more creamy and easy to use than the yellow butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much a fragrance free kinda guy, and the shea butter has very distinct aroma.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are tons of other uses and I&#x27;m just going to have to keep reading more and experimenting to get the full benefit</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product but the only thing I don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li> It blends nicely with all carrier oils, beeswax, and essential oils.  </li>
            <li> This unrefined shea butter is a quality ingredient you can use to make your own personal care and beauty products.</li>
            <li> I like natural skin care products and noticed that some of my favorite products contain Shea Butter</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> If so inclined, this can be turned into your own homemade body butters, scented with essential oils if you wish.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it, wish that would have been made more clear by the seller.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Organic Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no expiration date, but either keep it in a cool dark place (fridge is good)</li>
            <li> I do scent with rose essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to make my own body butter with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Arrived fresh and well sealed.</li>
            <li> I received this free from Beauty By Shea as a testing product and will most definitely purchase it again and again.</li>
            <li> This will help to keep it fresh and also did not ruin the bag in case it melted.</li>
            <li> During our North Texas [Dallas/Fort Worth] winters I have to apply all over.</li>
            <li> , I believe it is inherent to the product, but it&#x27;s noticeable and it took several hours after application for me to stop catching the scent.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and moisturizing and a great product to put on right before bed - my favorite is to apply it to my feet before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe that this shea butter smells like shea butter is supposed to smell, and that in order to produce a product with no scent would mean over-processing it to the point where it has lost most, if not all, of the components that make it good for you.</li>
            <li> Although you can use this as-is right on your skin, I prefer to add an essential oil (like lavender or gardenia) to it to give it a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I heard from some friends that pure shea butter might do the trick, so I was excited to try it for myself.</li>
            <li> I have found that a little of this wonderful shea butter goes a long way, so I may not need more very soon.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves a very pretty shine behind, so if you aren’t pregnant and just want to lovely glow to your skin, this would be a good product to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am excited to use the real, unrefined stuff.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell right at all.</li>
            <li> you want to use it right away without whipping, you can take a hair dryer to a section for 10-15 seconds to soften it and just apply it to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> right soften like play doh.</li>
            <li> It looked as if it had been taken right from the Shea nut.</li>
            <li> He uses it every night right after his shower.  </li>
            <li> It seems to get kind of tacky and left a feeling of being coated… I took a hot bath afterward tho</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t research enough to figure out that this has a very strong smoky smell.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Unlike the horror stories I have read about from other buyers after purchasing what was claimed to be &amp;#34;100% organic&amp;#34; but turned out to be a bag of &amp;#34;hot mess, &amp;#34; I am happy to report that this product is of great quality and far from a horror story.</li>
            <li> It is a high grade Shea Butter that applies smoothly to the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; and is very pure.</li>
            <li> other than that, it is a great product and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant  and the texture is soft not gritty.</li>
            <li> I use it as an eye cream too for those newly forming fine lines</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to try this brand and not let the brands in the past influence this for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a production date, but it smells fresh and exactly like</li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty cool- pure block of Shea butter that melts as you apply body heat by rubbing it on.</li>
            <li> In spite of that hypersensitivity to many things I apply topically, I had no bad reaction to this shea butter even after many days of daily use.  </li>
            <li> Seller thoughtfully included a new 2 oz.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it on my skin as a night time moisturizer and although it takes a long time for it to absorb, the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> Lavender essential oil    Measure and place all ingredients into a mixing bowl, then blend using a hand mixer until lump free and a smooth velvety texture.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t brave enough to add food coloring to it, I had fears of having blue skin forever.  </li>
            <li> I intend to make my own natural body butter, but so far have just used it neat.</li>
            <li> As a previous customer I was delighted to be given this product to review.</li>
            <li> it is important that it is white and smooth texture</li>
            <li> and I had applied the raw Shea Butter directly to my feet at night, slipped some socks on and in the morning my feet felt incredibly smooth (better than when I would go get pedicures)!!  </li>
            <li> The first time slathered it on, I used about a dime worth on both my feet and elbows and it was MORE than enough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I am currently using the shea butter straight, as received, it can be a great base for many wonderful do-it-yourself personal pampering products, for which free information and recipes can be found online.  </li>
            <li> It came very fast and exceeded my expectations on the quality.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li> I feel glad to be using Shea and commenting about it for its such a good product I have a normal to dry skin and sometimes after cleansing, my Florida weather makes my skin lack lustre and moisture.</li>
            <li> I probably would have never bought this on my own but since this was a free sample I see why people are using raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> recommend this if you want a chemical free moisturizer in the winter or even summer, and you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I gotta say I tried many eye creams and none of them gave the same hydration as this butter!</li>
            <li> Wow the product is so smooth and buttery.  </li>
            <li> I only write this review because I am also drowning in a sea of frustration over which reviews are believable.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review - and will be purchasing more when we eventually run out.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> Bleeding stopped with the first application.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased shea butter</li>
            <li> my face is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love packaging, it&#x27;s a big part of what I look for in a products, as a consumer.</li>
            <li> This item has helped me out so much!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I try Shea Butter</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> It has a light, natural scent, which I would probably describe as earthy or nutty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a nutty smell at first, but it goes away after a couple of minuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My whole family loves it!</li>
            <li> Since I work with my hands a lot, this is pretty</li>
            <li> The first thing I decided to do was order a bunch of first grade or</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Since it is not infused with water for fast evaporation, it takes a bit longer to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have used many products that contained Shea Butter, especially for stretch marks for pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I use this on him at night for a foot massage &amp; it has really made a difference!</li>
            <li> so I gave her some to try out first.</li>
            <li> Thanks beauty by Shea!  </li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> No humidity and hot temperatures.</li>
            <li> Beauty By Shea&#x27;s wonderful product arrived, and following the directions, I scooped off a small amount and warmed it between my hands to soften before applying to my affected areas.</li>
            <li> I need consistent quality with my orders.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li> This one smelled funny compared to all the others.  </li>
            <li> However, I do look forward to re-ordering it from Healthy Life Essentials in the future.</li>
            <li> and this one is exactly that.</li>
            <li> While it may be greasy at first...</li>
            <li> I give the product 4 stars rather than 5 because as a skin lotion, it is more of a time-consuming process to use rather than simply squirting out a dab and rubbing it on.</li>
            <li> I would love to try adding some essential oils to it and then using it as a body lotion!</li>
            <li> I used to teach first grade</li>
            <li> Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever seen and/or used Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Nothing is added and that is especially important with shea butter as it loses a lot of its power once processed.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing Shea Butter</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to use half the Shea butter for the recipe and it made a very good size body scrub (definitely money saving).</li>
            <li> During the winter when dry, cracked skin sets in this Beauty by Shea African shea butter will be a welcome addition once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great shea butter, less pungent than the non-organic version, packaging a bit akward - can be fixed by re-packaging.</li>
            <li> Product seems very pure and very high quality.</li>
            <li> It came with a small tin can which is a perfect size to refill and carry on, filled it up and sure enough she grew into it and now uses this everyday as do I.  </li>
            <li> The shae butter, provided for free in exchange for an honest review, very neatly resolves that issue since it comes in a solid bar and one only has to pull off pieces and emolliate in order to apply.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and will last for a long time!Packaging is also great.</li>
            <li> You can use it as is or mix it with other ingredients to create your own products, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try using raw organic shea butter instead of my normal deep conditioner (which I am sure is processed more than I care to know!).</li>
            <li> product is a fantastic moisturizer and great for a wide variety of things, including dry skin, stretch marks, eczema, sunburns, and many other skin conditions - and I can even use it on the kids.  </li>
            <li> and her cracked hands have healed and stayed soft and her elbows are now soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> I loved the little tin that accompanied it!</li>
            <li> It is EXACTLY what pure, unrefined ivory shea is supposed to smell like.</li>
            <li> However, it was strong the first day and the smell dissipated the second day.</li>
            <li> I figured I would give it a shot based on all the positive Amazon feedback.  </li>
            <li> silky smooth legs with no dry skin in sight!!</li>
            <li> I have a torn tendon in my left foot, and find it more comfortable to kneel than squat, especially when working in the garden, etc.  </li>
            <li> This natural, vitamin rich product is so much healthier to use!!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> This shea butter was much dirtier than the first pound.</li>
            <li> : I would much rather buy the ingredients in bulk and make the products myself so that I know exactly what&#x27;s going into my skin.</li>
            <li> The most beneficial thing about shea butter is that it does not clog pores and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The light, natural fragrance is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> butter is an effective natural moisturizer--which is why it is a common ingredient in many quality beauty products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this was my first use, the natural smell took some getting used to, but it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The nutty smell is present, but it is a very pleasant, mellow smell, which I believe is the natural smell of a FRESH unrefined raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> effect seems to last as long as avocado oil&lt;br /&gt;Applies just easily as avocado oil, feels a bit more dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just cut off a tiny part and it easily melts in your</li>
            <li> Trust me, my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, you have super soft skin and the effect lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how long I had to rub it in my warm hands to get it melt to a usable liquid.</li>
            <li> In summary, shea is a pretty wonderful, all-natural way to moisturize your skin without having to put all these crazy chemicals on yourself.</li>
            <li> Which it did, I could easily reshape it back into a brick style</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product for my dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly and isn&#x27;t white (not bleached).</li>
            <li> It is imported as pure, organic Shea butter from Ghana &amp; is filtered  again in a USA lab &amp; formed into blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That means it&#x27;s going to be a pure product for me to use.</li>
            <li> and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But when I need to, I will certainly reorder from this seller.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll buy a new package in a few days because it&#x27;s actually a good product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m very pleased that it is 100% organic, raw, and unrefined.  </li>
            <li> Supplied for reviewing purposes, I am VERY satisfied with the 100% organic raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> I am not sure who was more excited about this stuff me or my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Consistency was fine, but there was definitely something off about this one.</li>
            <li> Mainly, it was because it came in a brick form which she found funny because it reminded her of India and her village as this what their butter looks like.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Nice little freebie as well.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and silly texture great for multiple uses!</li>
            <li> fresh, soft, creamy...similar to Life-Flo Pure Shea, but much fresher.</li>
            <li> Therefore, due to the greasy and smelly nature I do not think it a great practical product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it’s hard to really know if something is helping with stretch marks, this seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> It is a huge chunk you get too, and it should last a while.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well and has information with it.  </li>
            <li> I agree it smells much like you would expect a nut-oil to smell -- I rather like it.  </li>
            <li> One caution: Don&#x27;t use too much at once or you might end up with greasy feeling beard/hair.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky at all even in a very humid country in Singapore.</li>
            <li> That said, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Shea Butter is a very versatile product and has a lot of benefits.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make magnesium lotion and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> appreciated the opportunity to barter this product for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> The smell is earthy and very grounding.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this for use in creating your homemade hand creams as well as using just as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works really well as a hair mask</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, maybe a hint of a nutty smell.  </li>
            <li> You can add essential oils to it or add a dollop to your bathtub to make the water smooth.</li>
            <li> I was really scared to order another shea butter online since I tried it once before (from another company) and it was delivered moldy with some hair in it.</li>
            <li> I really like the quality on this Shea Butter when I take it into my hands.</li>
            <li> the shea butter into a glass jar made it much easier to apply it after each shower.</li>
            <li> Feel free to experiment with the essential oils and even the carrier oils you prefer.</li>
            <li> Feel free to experiment with the essential oils and even the carrier oils you prefer.</li>
            <li> really like that this shea butter is 100%</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> it to make lip balm and perfume sticks; use it straight up on elbows and callouses, on rashy baby butts.</li>
            <li> Fast service, quality product, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need to mix or add anything else; chances are, it&#x27;ll solve your problem using it alone.</li>
            <li> and thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to products I use on my skin because of it&#x27;s sensitivity</li>
            <li> I found that within seconds the butter heats when rubbed in your hands and is ready to be applied.</li>
            <li> I’ve never used “straight” Shea Butter before.</li>
            <li> is an ivory color Shea butter which means it has been Boiled for a longer period of time mellowing out color to more milder light, its lightened color to allow absorbing into the skin faster with extra fluff.</li>
            <li> In the morning, the skin on my feet and heels are much softer.  </li>
            <li> and she confirmed that it smell different.</li>
            <li> Thanks..</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait a whole week.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s saying a whole lot since my skinwas beginning to feel like tree bark</li>
            <li> IT WAS SO SOFT AND FRESH...</li>
            <li> They probably used too much.</li>
            <li> I did make the mistake of putting too much in my hair as an after washing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A lot of the skin products on the market contain all kinds of chemicals that users are absorbing into their bodies.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt linger so it doesnt bother me too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m questioning whether it&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> It can soften in shipment, but in the summer months I&#x27;d go for fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> husbands hands from work get very chapped with cracks.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The butter came very well packaged.</li>
            <li> I massaged it in to my (damp) hair gently from roots to tips and let is sit for just about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, I will defiantly use all of what I have, I will absolutely recommend to others, and it&#x27;s something that I would buy for myself.</li>
            <li> It is helping to moisturize my heels very well.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li> Here, a dab is too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 2 weeks now and my skin feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> My skin really appreciates that.</li>
            <li> Very emollient and soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li> a prior customer of another product from this seller, I was luckily enough given the opportunity to receive this item at no cost however all opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li> Nice to keep it simple and reinforce the basic nature of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 different Shea Butters and this is my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li> I love this for my older dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many products that CONTAINED Shea butter but not pure Shea butter.</li>
            <li> No nasty peeling dry skin or that feeling of your sheets catching on your dead prickly skin!</li>
            <li> I attended a fabulous school, where I met not only Ghanaian kids, but kids from many other nations.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to make my own homemade body butter with a few simple ingredients!  </li>
            <li> Application time has to be right as your skin will be sticky for a while, but once it penetrates your skin, it make it so soft.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers out there.</li>
            <li> Who knew that in it&#x27;s purest form this product that we have become so familiar with could be so different.</li>
            <li> Seller is extremely personable and just lovely to work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother and smells better than the other 3 I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My wife started using essential oils towards the beginning of the year, and originally she was mixing oils with coconut oil for lotions.</li>
            <li> In this house shea butter has alleviated that cracked skin, but other uses abound.  </li>
            <li> All these years of trying so many other lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This nutrient rich fat is derived from the nut of  the African shea tree and is used in any number of products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally rich in essential vitamins, that will nourish you skin with Vitamin A, E, F and K.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to buy a high quality unprocessed shea butter like this one from Beauty By Shea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy about the value you get in this product - this is enough to last you for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have started using it in place of a hand lotion I was using before because my knuckles tend to get dry and bleed easily.  </li>
            <li> so I keep a jar next to the kitchen sink and apply after clean ups and dishes.</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed by the skin and not only improves the texture of dry skin, but makes it look better, too.  </li>
            <li> I make my own body care products and was nervous about ordering &amp;#34;sight unseen.&amp;#34; I took a chance and this product is now in my wishlist to pull out the next time I need to order, which won&#x27;t be long.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I fought my inclination to be cheap and spent an extra few bucks for this shea butter from this seller.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of recipes online, and it&#x27;s super easy to add Raw Shea butter to your beauty products.</li>
            <li> I tried making some natural deodorant with it and the smell is so strong that even after 40 drops of essential oils, all you could smell was the shea.</li>
            <li> If you have dry and/or itchy, sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll love shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was offered to try this free after I had ordered other amazing products as a previous customer.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> It has a very soft, smooth texture unlike the gritty product I have purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li> You will find that it doesn&#x27;t take long AT ALL to melt into your pores giving you really smooth</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> It was hot here when it came and the package contained it well, it wasn&#x27;t melted, was just soft.  </li>
            <li> Beauty By Shea offers shea butter that is both unrefined and 100% organic, with absolutely nothing added - a must for a product I am putting on my skin!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unrefined Shea Butter is naturally rich in vitamins A, E, F, and fatty acids that make it super nourishing and moisturizing while not clogging pores.</li>
            <li> and that is even though I am used to getting very prompt service, and even though this package was sent from New York State to Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She preferred the Shea Butter combination because it was less greasy and more of a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish.</li>
            <li> shea butter has an earthy, slightly wood stove-like scent that is quite appealing.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter is one of the main ingredients in lotions and chapsticks.</li>
            <li> Finding a good quality Shea butter is very critical when it comes to using it in your everyday products.</li>
            <li> Next, I&#x27;ll get into what may be more personal preference.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I got my money back from them</li>
            <li> I also use a tiny bit on my hair and it makes it super shiny.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a decent sized 1lb.</li>
            <li> I used to have such soft and smooth skin, however,</li>
            <li> I use it as the main ingredient for my body butter.</li>
            <li> However with this shea butter, my skin still feels soft and smooth after multiple hand-washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this shea butter is meant only for external use, it has a very pleasing natural aroma that makes it seem almost good enough to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mainly use it after the shower and before bed on my feet, hands, elbows, and as needed like my neck to help with shaving.</li>
            <li> I will just weigh packages in the future, but I know this shea is much better than others I have tried on here that have been very gritty.</li>
            <li> This particular brand is a high quality, and I adore the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only significant annoyance with those oils revolves around how easily the oil gets transferred back from my hands onto the bottle and, subsequently, anything else the bottle touches.</li>
            <li> and this seems to be of high quality organic product, from its color and consistency.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shea butter.</li>
            <li> High quality product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this shea butter to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM AMAZON?</li>
            <li> I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe, the first batch was bad because both of the free shea butter that I received on the second and third orders are quite excellent.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference with this butter as it seems to work well into my skin and blends much easier than all other shea butters I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any other lotions i have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I seem to adapt to the smell rather quickly, he mentioned several hours of smelling the product, I rarely notice it after initial application unless I&#x27;m petting my beard.  </li>
            <li> It is completely pure and natural.  </li>
            <li> The good news is:  it&#x27;s 100% organic raw unrefined African shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Love the little bonus tin.</li>
            <li> But after some research I found SO MANY things you can do with it... and in order to soften it, all you need is a little warmth (like rubbing it with your hands).</li>
            <li> However, I found that if I mixed a bit of it with a few drops of a scented oil I do like, the result was a wonderful combination of the scent I added and the shea butter odor I had come to love in other shea butter products I&#x27;d tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> Butter is easy to work with and extremely versatile.</li>
            <li> Another great use I discovered (unfortunately)</li>
            <li> The texture is so soft and doesn&#x27;t require too much work to melt in your palms.</li>
            <li> (hope I remembered it correctly) and these are good for anti aging because they are small molecules which can go through the skin (some anti aging molecules like hyalyron acid for example have difficulties to go through the skin because they are too big).</li>
            <li> I am very critical of products that claim to be 100% organic or natural, especially shea butter because there are so many companies out here that supply</li>
            <li> Has helped with a fresh scar, stretch marks, and overall moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going camping in a few weeks and be sure I will bring some Shea along to test on bug bites etc.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few days now and my skin is definitely better and time will tell if my stretch marks goes away.</li>
            <li> For all the many years that I have been a customer of Amazon, this is the first time that I actually complained to a seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Similar to coconut oil, shea butter is firm at most room temperatures, but melts in the heat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different moisturizers with varying success.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loaded with antioxidants and vitamins A, E, F and K along with healthy fatty acids and  phytonutrients.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the lasting all natural moisture our family&#x27;s skin and hair are treated to with the 100% Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter from Beauty by Shea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The amount you get is sure to last you quite a long time.</li>
            <li> your confused by the texture, please know THAT&#x27;s A GOOD THING.  </li>
            <li> Nice neutral smell  melted it down with coconut oil, cocoa butter, and some essential oils and whipped it for lotion for sons eczema</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to blend with other oils.</li>
            <li> I can just imagine when it gets colder and my skin gets dry and itchy, that I&#x27;ll have something on hand to fix it right up!</li>
            <li> The shea butter has a nice mild smell, almost like a faint coco butter smell.  </li>
            <li> I just used Jojoba because it mimics the oils in our skin cells and absorbs easily, and selected the essential oils I did for their specific skin care benfits.  </li>
            <li> I just used Jojoba because it mimics the oils in our skin cells and absorbs easily, and selected the essential oils I did for their specific skin care benfits.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super soft when I use this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I no longer have smooth and soft skin, so I need a product like shea butter, that will seep into my pores and help to eliminate those dry</li>
            <li> live in Phoenix, and normally wouldn&#x27;t dare order shea butter during summer,</li>
            <li> Honestly, as it is right now, I will definitly be buying this in the future.  </li>
            <li> It truly works and I am going to use it only sparingly the remainder of the summer, saving it for the winter months when it gets very dry in my region and this will prove a lot more</li>
            <li> I will have to try experimenting with a smaller amount on my fine, dry, straight hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took a little crumbly piece and rubbed it in, it melted on the back of my hands nicely.</li>
            <li> I had been in the market for something new to oil and maintain my beard, so</li>
            <li> My family and I live an organic/natural lifestyle</li>
            <li> this was new.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert.</li>
            <li> I was worried my order of Shea butter would melt, since I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> easy as it is to apply directly to the skin, you can use it for a variety of other purposes.  </li>
            <li> I gently softened some shea butter along with some coconut oil and blended in a couple drops of very high quality essential oil.</li>
            <li> And while I personally don&#x27;t care for it straight, I liked it very much mixed with other</li>
            <li> Lastly, I love that this is a raw, organic product.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a moisturizer on my elbows and knees, both of which get quite dry and absorbs the shea butter quickly.</li>
            <li> This particular shea butter is imported from Ghana, where women gather the nuts from wild trees, shell and roast them, and extract the oils by hand.  </li>
            <li> I used a lime essential oil because I love the scent, but be careful with citrus as it can increase effects of sun exposure.</li>
            <li> My skin is really dry, to the point that lotions absorb quickly and tend to do nothing for me but leave me with eczema all over my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry skin anywhere and on my pregnant belly to soothe stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> It is a little sticky at first, but quickly absorbs into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I was asked if I was interested in reviewing this product, I was so excited to see that it was 100% ORGANIC RAW UNREFINED  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very natural odor.  </li>
            <li> Although I am not allergic to any nuts, I do have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this natural lotion to treat or help prevent skin problems.</li>
            <li> Then it feels very soft and silky like it should.  </li>
            <li> so I could give a more complete one rather than just a first impression from only few days use.  </li>
            <li> I have never used raw organic Shea Butter before but was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> It quickly penetrates the skin to immediately protect and infuse with rich lasting moisture and it deeply nourishes and hydrates dry scalp or damaged hair which helps to reduce dryness and flakiness.</li>
            <li> but I rubbed a little into my hands in it&#x27;s raw form, as a lotion, and I think it&#x27;s great stuff.  </li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is 100% pure, organic, grade A all natural, double filtered, and a nice ivory color, so you can use it directly on your skin, or you can blend it with other carriers like almond, coconut, jojoba and essential oils</li>
            <li> This is great because next time when I use it, I will not only use less, but I know it will last along time.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is completely raw and unrefined, so it retains all of the delightful nutty fragrance, subtle yellow color, and natural texture of pure organic shea butter.  </li>
            <li> is so soft!</li>
            <li> My skin soaks it up and then feels as soft as butter!  </li>
            <li> As for my scars, I think a longer period of usage will be necessary to see if it actually diminishes them, however, the skin around them looks more supple and as a result they don&#x27;t look as obvious.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it was enough to really add heat!  </li>
            <li> and this has been the only one that works consistently.  </li>
            <li> Can I say WOW!  </li>
            <li> However, I guess since all other shea butter I have used was just one ingredient of many in one brand or another of shea butter, I was expecting it to smell differently than it did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to incorporate the essential oil if you first soften up the shea butter in the microwave.</li>
            <li> It has, however, improved  the overall condition and appearance of their skin more so than any other product we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Also, even though it is rich in vitamins A and E, it is only for external use.</li>
            <li> so some dirt may be present, but it was far more than expected.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> highly recommended for various uses, definitely a smart purchase that goes far!</li>
            <li> This is pure, all organic Shea Butter from Ghana, and it should last 12 - 18 months if resealed after use and stored in a cool dry</li>
            <li> There are hundreds of uses for raw shea butter and since this is unrefined from Ghana, it is refreshing and natural.</li>
            <li> It should be nutty and a little strong.</li>
            <li> (mine were super dry before applying)&lt;br /&gt;Great for feet - made the calluses soft and feet supple</li>
            <li> Being that this is organic, raw, and unrefined, I find that the natural health benefits from it are by far better than any store bought product that may contain shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only real downside is that you have to &#x27;warm&#x27; it up in your hands before you apply it or it is a big stiff.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad thing, since it appears to be perfectly organic in origin, but lingering scents in general just aren&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But my skin looks great, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now everyday after washing my face, and as a lip balm it lasts a lot longer than chap stick (I tend to chew my lips) and creates plenty of moisture for your lips!</li>
            <li> This was a free sample from being a previous customer of another product I had bought.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was pretty much what I expected for moisturizing however, the fragrance was a bit unfavorable to my nostrils.</li>
            <li> The nuts contain a rich complex of five different fatty acids that are good for the skin:  </li>
            <li> This is exactly the high quality of Shea Butter I want to use when making my dry skin repair creams for friends and family.</li>
            <li> If you live in the warmer climate and the whole thing starts melting, you can always put it in the refrigerator and in no time it will be solid once again.</li>
            <li> This comes in a huge brick that will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it did seem to heal my dried skin and was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on skin, in many areas, dry skin, rough patches, cracked heels, etc.</li>
            <li> This is more white and less nutty in its smell.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t get the bag open quick enough to try this Shea Butter out.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin where i get like little &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; everywhere, i use this on my body and face after every shower and my skin gets super soft and looks so much</li>
            <li> Raw Shea Butter has an aroma that some people find mildly disagreeable, but it&#x27;s easy to make various skin care products with and you can alter the scent to your liking by adding some essential oils to your recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pure Shae Butter is used differently than lotion though.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was smart and simple...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it as a base with essential oils to create our own deodorant and love how well it&#x27;s worked!  </li>
            <li> I really love the fact that it is 100% Organic Raw Unrefined!  </li>
            <li> Sassafras oil (wanted the warming of the sassafras, but wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work so only did a little).  </li>
            <li> Same for his brother who for most little ones get in the habit of licking around the lips</li>
            <li> This was such amazing quality Raw Shea!</li>
            <li> I took a poll on fave scents and ordered a few from a wholesale supplier including almonds,vanilla ,lavender and other pleasant basic scents.</li>
            <li> We spent the weekend at Daytona Beach &amp; no matter how much or how high of a SPF we used we STILL ended up burnt!</li>
            <li> My hands had recently been getting quite rough and literally one use of the shea butter made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> When it is soft, you can use it immediately like a cream.</li>
            <li> No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to make lotion bars so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is how shea is suppose to smell, but I can&#x27;t imagine using it in any natural recipes.</li>
            <li> It makes my hands, legs, and feet feel moisturized, glowy, and soft like butter.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the Shea butter also made my skin supper soft and silky.</li>
            <li> check out my youtube channel reviewing the item (naturally scattered_kay)</li>
            <li> soft hands&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> My brother got a sample of this product for me as I have stretch marks and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> wow..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the natural smelling fragrance it has going on.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> The butter was completely melted, but after being in the Phoenix mailbox at over 100 degrees all day, the container was intact.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone compliments me on my soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use shea butter directly on my skin as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> It actually has softened my skin so much that my pedicurist couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  </li>
            <li> for myself as well as my 2year old.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gently melt some, add a bit of aloe gel, whip til solid.</li>
            <li> Heals the burn, keeps the skin soft and pliable, and is antiseptic.</li>
            <li> The fastest delivery thus far from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I plan to temper my shea butter and add oils for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> to make a soft all natural body butter.</li>
            <li> This product comes directly from Ghana.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This natural Shea butter has not, by any means, gotten rid of their severe eczema.</li>
            <li> My first experience with shea butter was not all that long ago, and I was so baffled by the hardness of it.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days of not using the butter my elbows still remained soft.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter is wow.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a plus because I am sensitive to perfumes in my skincare.</li>
            <li> I know that it&#x27;s supposed to be natural</li>
            <li> The texture is so soft and velvety.</li>
            <li> So far no adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li> eat only vegan food, use only vegan personal care products, and am concerned about the health and environmental effects of the additives in many commercial products, even those touted as \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> and this is by far the smoothest, softest, and purest.  </li>
            <li> When I am making a natural lip scrub I take sugar, honey, and shea butter.</li>
            <li> each and both issues were completely healed.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised when I could not sleep</li>
            <li> If you do want to use all natural products then Shea Butter is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Your natural curls will bounce and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin still felt soft in the morning after showering.  </li>
            <li> it is so soft and creamy.</li>
            <li> It’s a natural sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer for myself and also on my two year old daughters eczema.</li>
            <li> Melts almost instantly, leaving a nice, thick ointment.</li>
            <li> It is good but expensive.</li>
            <li> Several years back the veins in my lower right leg</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Real, unrefined shea butter is off white/ivory to light yellow in color and will be a bit grainy due to its natural texture.</li>
            <li> The smell is genuine but not strong.</li>
            <li> My skin has gotten pretty dry and my hands would literally hurt after washing if I didn&#x27;t apply some type of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so it mixed well with the other scents and it was smooth with no imperfections</li>
            <li> It is much softer than other products I have tried which makes it much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> The odour is first unusual, but not strong and then it reminds me at a mixture of nuts and hay, very natural.</li>
            <li> Well the day after, she had used only a very little bit on my granddaughter, but called to say the rash had lightened up considerably, and her eczema patch was much better as well.</li>
            <li> Possibly due to not being absorbed as quickly?&lt;br /&gt;Fragrant for longer than the avocado oil&lt;br</li>
            <li> Possibly due to not being absorbed as quickly?&lt;br /&gt;Fragrant for longer than the avocado oil&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it to melt down with cocoa butter and some essential oils to make solid lotions as Christmas gifts for my family and the consistency was lovely.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s also why 100% raw is important.</li>
            <li> * Disclosure: a sample of this product was provided free of charge, however all opinions are my own.e using this every day especially during our long New England winters, when my skin gets so dry.  </li>
            <li> I applied it twice the first day, and probably 5-6 times on the second day, and by the third day my skin started to recover and regenerate.</li>
            <li> It may or may not have helped any better than the usual lotion I use (either Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion or CeraVe Renewing SA Cream).</li>
            <li> This was my second time purchasing this item, but the quality was different from the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is an additional personal reason that I appreciate this particular shea butter.  </li>
            <li> My 12-year-old son, who has very dry skin and would probably benefit from using it, doesn&#x27;t care for the smell and hasn&#x27;t been willing to use it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the Shea Butter smell is very minimal compared to many other beard products.    </li>
            <li> I have used some high quality commercial body lotions containing Shea and thought I knew the texture.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Beauty by Shea Organic Unrefined African</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using shea butter as a deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> This stuff is exactly what it says it is, pure raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> , it gets soft and creamy very quickly, but still thick.</li>
            <li> This particular Organic Raw Unrefined Shea Butter is imported directly from Ghana and it&#x27;s 100% pure!  </li>
            <li> The Shea butter goes a long way- don&#x27;t need much for each application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It certainly stopped my dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It was also a little stickier than I imagined, although the stickiness goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you&#x27;ve never used raw shea butter before, you might wonder why I get so excited about it.</li>
            <li> I love this raw Shea butter!!  </li>
            <li> My feet are super soft all the time now and the skin on my face is softer, moister, and I have less red spots and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> It saturates the area upon which it is applied with moisture and really cures those pesky dry spots.</li>
            <li> My daughter has even been using it in her hair since she has very curly African American hair.  </li>
            <li> Most other lotions and creams I tried did not help my hands or last long enough.  </li>
            <li> The consistency was very soft, and the color was an ivory white.</li>
            <li> My skin has been feeling soft, rejuvenated and for the first time in forever, it doesn&#x27;t itch due to sensitivity!</li>
            <li> have largely used it on my feet, which, as an every day runner, outdoors, in the winter, are very dry.</li>
            <li> Not grainy and no foreign objects.  </li>
            <li> plus it gives moisture like no other.  </li>
            <li> Upon further research of the supplying company, Beauty by Shea, I found that they have teamed up with a supplier of this product that pays the tribal women directly for making the butter, this has made me a forever customer!</li>
            <li> In trusting the other fellow reviewers who normally never fail me, I knew she would grow into it.  </li>
            <li> It seems like my skin always gets irritated specially during the summer because there is little to no humidity out here in Texas!</li>
            <li> It is heavy duty, more like Vaseline (without the chemical ingredients or smell) than the regular commercial cream and the results seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it all over my body, and my rough patches (upper arms and back, from getting irritated by rougher material in clothing) have smoothed right up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of people using their kitchen mixer for this, but there are mixers made for this purpose (personally, i wouldn&#x27;t do it in quantities high enough to justify the purchase of the equipment).</li>
            <li> I have started to blend it with a few other oils to create my own dry hand treatment cream.</li>
            <li> and I apply it on my skin to prevent stretch marks and fade scars and to moisturize my skin in general.</li>
            <li> so it just smells, well, like nothing in general.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it did not leave my skin feeling the least bit greasy, just smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Product as expected and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is only needed the size of a penny to completely cover all the skin on one fist.</li>
            <li> Hello, I&#x27;m a dude and never really had much use for lotions or skin care products.</li>
            <li> It was soft enough that I could take a spoon and scoop it in a container.</li>
            <li> and it left my skin feeling incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> But I recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin or any skin related issues.</li>
            <li> so far I definitely think everyone should go out and buy this!</li>
            <li> Our skin has actually been quite soft since using it.  </li>
            <li> No rancid smell, it isn&#x27;t bleached white, it isn&#x27;t weirdly soft.</li>
            <li> You will need a natural essential oil to add if you are making body butter and want it to smell like something store-bought.</li>
            <li> I mainly use if for my dry lips.</li>
            <li> I used it to make a simple lotion for my sensitive skin, by whipping it with 1.5 tbsp of olive oil, and storing it in an upcycled tostitos salsa jar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a totally natural scent that indicates to me that I&#x27;m not dealing with numerous additives.  </li>
            <li> No need to have multiple products in your beauty cabinet when you just need organic shea butter that can do what normally you might have several products for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about this as this is my first time purchasing Shea Butter... is this normal?</li>
            <li> I enjoy it melting slowly in my hands before using</li>
            <li> also use a cup warmer to melt shea and cconut oil during winter when they get solid and difficult to scoop and apply.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the gifts of nature and do you body good at the same time.</li>
            <li> It melts in your hand very quickly and a little definitely goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> On my skin it took about five minutes before my skin absorbed it, then it left a slightly oily sheen.</li>
            <li> this comes in a big block which is economical but less practical when it comes to using in a family or while traveling.</li>
            <li> After just two uses I have noticed a big difference, especially on the back of my hands, which seem to dry more than other exposed places on my body - even in the humid Central Florida summers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I did add a little scent to it, to make it smell a little more feminine.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using organic raw shea butter and it far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was very soft due to the heat but about 30 minutes in the fridge fixed it.  </li>
            <li> I live in the cold, dry Midwest, so am always looking for a good moisturizer, especially for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> If it becomes too soft or melts, you can simply put it in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour until solid again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It totally melts the most hardcore waterproof mascara and eyeliner without stripping your skin, without being irritating, and with the added moisturizing benefit.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying this out, especially for those trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I opened the newer pack this morning, excited as usual!</li>
            <li> The butter does leave a thicker layer at first, so clothing will catch a little if out on immediately after application.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it at night mixed with some of her usual cream to get a softer result and some fragrance while still getting the longer lasting results of the butter, as for me, I probably like it precisely because it doesn&#x27;t smell like regular cream</li>
            <li> There are so many things that this can be used for as a base or carrier agent and we will definitely be ordering more when we run out (which may not be too long!).</li>
            <li> Surprising, the other half of the bad batch mixed better with the same recipe on a second try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days, I ordered the free shea butter along with other items from Amazon and it all arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applying a small amount of shea butter and allowing the warmth of my hand to smooth the shea butter to penetrate into my skin gives a long lasting softness.</li>
            <li> My only significant complaint was that it seemed to take longer for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li> Several old scars have reduced in a short time, I found adding some alpha lipoic acid powder to the blend seemed to further speed up the healing process.</li>
            <li> and my feet are no long cracking and peeling.    </li>
            <li> but apparently that still wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> I live in very dry climate, and every once in a while my knuckles crack to the point they start to bleed.</li>
            <li> I really like it for dry hands, feet, knees, elbows, and my daughter&#x27;s dry eczema</li>
            <li> I have ordered other unrefined raw shea butter- ivory from another company but the smell was such so strong for me to the point of being rancid.</li>
            <li> I decided to apply it directly to my face as it gets really dry.</li>
            <li> I typically just buy a lotion on sale and forget to use it or stop because it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> The Beauty by Shea organic raw shea butter is very much as described.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it makes my face greasy to the touch for several hours after I put it on, but the benefits far outweigh this minor annoyance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good quality shea butter and works to moisturize my crazy dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am buying shea butter in raw form...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used raw Shea butter...</li>
            <li> First time buying raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> finally fixed my dry skin!</li>
            <li> On one leg, she applied the Bath and Bodyworks normal lotion; on the other, she applied the Shea Butter mixed with a bit of lotion.</li>
            <li> and it gets very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I know that I will continue using this every day especially during our long New England winters, when my skin gets so dry.  </li>
            <li> Also I live in South Dakota so winter is pretty tough on your skin.</li>
            <li> Raw shea butter is chock full of vitamins like A, E, F and K that can be lost with exposure to heat and other processing means.</li>
            <li> It has a low melting point, blends well with other carrier and essential oils, and works on my complicated skin that would let me know if this wasn&#x27;t pure (cocoa butter is my enemy, as are many other things).</li>
            <li> I live in a VERY dry climate, so my skin always seems dry.</li>
            <li> you ONLY need a little... it does melt and absorb rather quickly leaving an &#x27;earthy nut odor that does fade after a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is very high quality raw and unrefined shea butter,  </li>
            <li> The smell does take some getting used to, as it is not scented other than the natural--</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about Raw Shea Butter, but did some research</li>
            <li> I not only noticed a difference on my face, but it is something affordable that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> but when I first got the product, I used it in all its \\&quot;raw glory\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve highly recommended it to all my friends and a few of them use it now as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> first, the scent is a little foreign.</li>
            <li> and that is pretty messy especially when you get down to last bit.</li>
            <li> It just smells kind of unpleasant</li>
            <li> She apologized and said that this was the first time a customer had complained about the product.</li>
            <li> this amount will last a long time.</li>
            <li> 1lb will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long been fighting &amp;#34;dry knee caps&amp;#34; and this stuff has been terrific.</li>
            <li> I will keep in my fridge for long lasting.</li>
            <li> because I wanted to actually get a chance to try it long term.  </li>
            <li> minor annoyance with the shea butter is related to the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use a moisturizer and ten minutes later my hands are painfully dry again!</li>
            <li> This particular Shea butter was a lighter creamier color than others I have used in the past which tended to be a darker yellow.</li>
            <li> When I first received it, it was a little squishy, I mean I live in Alabama, so this humdity can melt even the hardest of substances.  </li>
            <li> It is a natural luxury, quite different from the homogenized, over-processed commercial products that contain only a small percentage of chemically-refined shea oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been a fan of any products with shea butter as the main ingredient, so I decided to do all my beauty regimen home made by using unrefined  raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> My knuckles are no longer white and dry looking.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely dry skin especially during the winter.  </li>
            <li> You could do the same thing with your hands if you are prone to dry hands.</li>
            <li> I use it personally to battle dry skin, cracked heels, balms, lotions, creams, and lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I cut it in half and gave it to my daughter to use, and she tried it on my 11 month old granddaughter who has eczema and also at the time, a diaper rash.</li>
            <li> This bar will last a long long time.</li>
            <li> It is a fatty cream good for protection against the cold and windy weather.</li>
            <li> It should NOT be rancid, too strong, unscented, or smell stale.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that the Beauty by Shea butter is 100% raw and unrefined, something that is highly desirable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to make some lotion bars due to my very dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It has an oder but to call the smell unappealing is kind of mean.</li>
            <li> The natural scent is not strong but a bit too earthy for me, I like to add essential oils like jasmine and rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has very dry skin on her hands and elbows - especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> She rubbed some in my hair also and it was soft and easier then usual to brush the next morning.</li>
            <li> my son ever overcomes his disliked for this natural, unperfumed moisturizer, I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gotten relief but never for long.</li>
            <li> This product comes as a solid, sealed carefully in a 16oz bag.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it in too long.</li>
            <li> help to heal and protect skin naturally and with out harsh chemicals or</li>
            <li> I was also surprised at how much trouble I had getting the Shea Butter to melt.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take long for it to &amp;</li>
            <li> If you have long fingernails as I do you might want to use something like a popsicle stick for scooping.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly, thick, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin or rough feet, or can&#x27;t find anything to even out your skin tone on your face, I definitely recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> have tried other shea butters in the past, and I can tell that this one is very high quality.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit to saturate one&#x27;s hands so a one pound brick will last a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been dry for so long and since he rubbed this butter on me my skin has been hydrated for over 5 days now.  </li>
            <li> I also used it once on my hair, which is long and sometimes gets dry and rather frizzy.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter actually recovers from this situation rather well, just keep rubbing it around and transferring it to other hair/skin.</li>
            <li> I will even put a little extra left over on my hands for my hair.</li>
            <li> A nickle sized piece of Shea butter was enough for my face, hands, cuticles, d&amp;eacute;colletage, and arms with a little left for my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heated it up over low heat and melted it in with the other ingredients, and there hasn&#x27;t been any of the grittiness that some Shea butter causes.</li>
            <li> caused my skin to dry up and itch even further due to an artery problem.</li>
            <li> I am a Shea butter fanatic, and this is my new go-to!</li>
            <li> Raw shea butter even offers protection from ultraviolet rays.</li>
            <li> They were dry, cracked, to the point of bleeding.</li>
            <li> I have patches of dry skin on my face which the butter did wonders for.</li>
            <li> My husband and kids have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> My hands get extremely dry, cracked, which cause a lot of pain to the point</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry feet and elbows.  </li>
            <li> daughter wanted some dry skin rescue cream for her dry cracked heels, so here&#x27;s the recipe I used in the video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Suck it, dry itchy skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (helps with cracked dry skin, sunburn, eczema,  psoriasis, chapped lips, elbows, heels, cuticles &amp; even insect bites)  </li>
            <li> I use it for insect bites, dry skin, sunburn, shaving cream, and I am told by friends that it works on poison ivy or oak.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also tend to get dry knees and elbows and chapped lips this time of year.</li>
            <li> My skin is always dry.</li>
            <li> My hands were so dry that the skin at the knuckles cracked and bled and literally my hands felt like sandpaper, and</li>
            <li> and I hadn&#x27;t had a dry skin day since.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower, after the shower, at night on my hair, any place on my body that is dry, and I even add it in to my body scrubs and lip scrubs.</li>
            <li> have always struggled with dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> It relieved my dry skin immediately.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> Out here dry skin is a way of life.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so I imagine that the amount that I received will last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shea butter can be used directly to the skin by getting a small piece and rubbing it into your skin.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter can be used directly to the skin by getting a small piece and rubbing it into your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but after using it for a few days I am IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love this product, have tried other shea butter that claim to be organic they are tough and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> With a daily and nightly routine Beauty by Shea Organic Raw Unrefined African Shea Butter has given me relief beyond explanation.</li>
            <li> The key is to give it time to absorb in your skin as it does go on oily and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used it to heal our grandson&#x27;s split dry lip that had bled!  </li>
            <li> Bye bye dry skin!</li>
            <li> If you do not want shiny skin, you only need less.</li>
            <li> However, I only used it one time as I disliked the strange smell</li>
            <li> As a previous customer, to have had this African Shea Butter  provided to me for review was so timely.</li>
            <li> Just rub a wee bit in your palms and apply to damp hair after you shampoo, comb with a wide tooth comb, scrunch with a towel and let air dry.</li>
            <li> I had very dry knees and elbows and a couple of eczema pathches on my legs that I had tried everything on, inlcuding coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I intended to use this product to help treat very dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have been using this on my feet and hands nightly before bed -</li>
            <li> I have very dry elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li> First, for other buyers, I have NOT been contacted for a review, nor do I have reason to leave a false or tainted review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colour is a little darker than nature white.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different</li>
            <li> The little bit of coconut oil made it lighter and slicker but still have the lasting power of the butter.  </li>
            <li> melt a little bit of shea butter with beeswax and place it in a jar for later use.</li>
            <li> you decide to use this product by itself, you only need a little bit at a time.  </li>
            <li> One simple solution: Before bedtime, I rub a little shea butter on my feet then put on a pair of cotton socks.</li>
            <li> you have never used unrefined Shea Butter, I should mention it is a little different in texture than you might expect.</li>
            <li> This brand is double prices of the other I bought before, but the oil quality is less than that.  </li>
            <li> Other times of the year I usually only need to apply to my face to fix a few dry spots each morning.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how many uses there are for this product.  </li>
            <li> not sure how long this brick will last, but I&#x27;m guessing three or four months!  </li>
            <li> This winter has been extremely harsh on my hands especially.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin is usually rough, but this has been beneficial and she is not longer scratching all day</li>
            <li> found that out with some that came with a bodhran drum we traded for a few years back!).  </li>
            <li> The skin on my feet becomes rough and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I have used it in a few different ways</li>
            <li> I mixed mine with a few drops of peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> My feet are rather rough from months of sandal wearing and going barefoot.</li>
            <li> Mylar Exterior: craft-style brown bag w/pretty pink label.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times as it is</li>
            <li> and my husband used it all last winter to prevent heavy cracking in his heels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is not your usual hand cream, it is exactly as the header says: raw and unrefined, it comes in the shape of a brick and has no fragrance added, it does take a few times to get used to the texture.</li>
            <li> Only need very small amount for entire body application</li>
            <li> for dry elbows&lt;br /&gt;Great to keep the frizzies down on your hair</li>
            <li> A very small amount makes my face feel soft</li>
            <li> as I&#x27;ve aged my skin has decided to develop into a dry mess.  </li>
            <li> Beauty By Shea&#x27;s Raw Organic Shea Butter comes double bagged with a resealable outer bag, and mine arrived sealed well.</li>
            <li> have received 100% Organic Raw Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter for the purpose of facilitating this review.</li>
            <li> After days of using 100% Organic Raw Unrefined African Shea Butter by Beauty by Shea, I started feeling a bit of relief.</li>
            <li> I received my organic raw unrefined African shea butter before the scheduled delivery date.</li>
            <li> I received one bag of Beauty By Shea Organic Raw Unrefined African Shea Butter to review!  </li>
            <li> To use this as body lotion I just took a very small amount - a little goes a long way folks - and rubbed it between my palms until it was warmed and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had such dry skin during my pregnancy and now this time of year when it&#x27;s cold out has really taken a toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus a little goes a REALLY long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way to the point that a couple of  pea sized amounts can cover both arms and legs.</li>
            <li> A little dab rubbed in the palm of my hands goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> find that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would get a bit of the product (a little goes a long way) and use it all over my body before I showered or took a bubble bath.</li>
            <li> to be on the cleaner side while handling the butter I used a cold spoon to scoop out a portion into a smaller bag and set the bag in hot water so that I can blend the melted mixture with other oils for my scalp.  </li>
            <li> My skin went from dry and sometimes painful to smooth and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also received emails from other sellers asking for reviews for other products.</li>
            <li> and we switched to other products and now those are wearing off.</li>
            <li> Other than that, you get 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hands but had to wash it off due to the greasy nature of it and not wanting to leave its residue on my things around the house.</li>
            <li> Id like to mention that after buying some other things from them I was provided this item for review by the seller, but will be buying some when we finish this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten temporary help from other lotions</li>
            <li> did notice the nutty smell that other people had commented on.  </li>
            <li> If you read the other reviews, you know that packaging is just a ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, because I&#x27;ve used shea butter before.  </li>
            <li> definate alternative to other cosmetics</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see Shea Butter in them, but too often they&#x27;ll have other ingredients that spoil everything like parabens or petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see Shea Butter in them, but too often they&#x27;ll have other ingredients that spoil everything like parabens or petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> For a small amount, it was enough for my face, as well as two babies</li>
            <li> I received a small container with this product that I didn&#x27;t know I would receive big plus</li>
            <li> This product was not grainy like other shea butters that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I had no issues melting this, and adding other ingredients to it.  </li>
            <li> I only apply a small amount and let it soften from the warmth of my skin before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks and feels almost completely solid, however, just take a small portion and rub it on your palms and the heat of your body warms it up and melts it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other organic unrefined Shea butter</li>
            <li> As soon as I can think of other ways for me to use this stuff</li>
            <li> It takes such a small amount, just rub between palms and it melts and can be used on arms or legs.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve purchased other brands of Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I usually have raw nails and cracked skin on my hands by the end of the summer or any busy cleaning period.</li>
            <li> The first bad batch had a very smoky smell, was too waxy and half of the product did not mix well with my usual Shea butter mixture.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with coconut oil, almond oil and a few drops of sandalwood oil, whipped it into a fluffy body butter.  </li>
            <li> I have notice that a little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> little girl has very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am still branching out and slowly trying it with other uses such as conditioners and make-up.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced raw shea butter, but have always bought it with ingredients mixed in from a major company.</li>
            <li> You can cut a little piece and put it in your hand, where it begins to melt immediately or you can heat it carefully in a plastic bag in a waterbath.</li>
            <li> When I agreed to accept a review sample I knew very little about this other than it may help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is one big solid piece with even structure because now in wintertime it is cold outside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been crickets and now it&#x27;s too late to return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> As a buyer we definitely expect to be buying and receiving at least the correct amount, as well as the product we are visibly seeing online which can be a risk now a days buying online</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it comes in zip lock bag</li>
            <li> So much has been written about her and her ill fated attempt to rule Egypt that records of her beauty records survive today.</li>
            <li> I have contact dermatitis, on my hands, therefore my skin is in rough shape all year round.</li>
            <li> so I use it as the base for many of my home made skin creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> My husband on the other hand LOVES this product!  </li>
            <li> You can use it to relax curly hair, to condition your hair, to restore dull hair, to heal dry cracked skin and about a zillion other things.</li>
            <li> I have been using it every other day for three weeks now on my face, my feet, and on a few scars.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few other types of shea butter</li>
            <li> I used a small, resealable container for daily use and again, very little shea butter is needed.</li>
            <li> and I have to put it on less often.</li>
            <li> Less richer oil.</li>
            <li> As a previous customer I was asked to test and rate this product.  </li>
            <li> Half shea, half aloe, generous dashes of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin softer and showing a slight sheen.</li>
            <li> and I noticed it had an odd smell.</li>
            <li> It did not smell like the previous blocks of shea butter.</li>
            <li> I applied it all over my body but the odd smell did not go away.</li>
            <li> only suggestion would be an option of an add-on small jar that would enable easier transport and use of small amounts of the product-</li>
            <li> And, I received the product in less than a week</li>
            <li> I rubbed the butter into my hair and waited half an hour and then shampooed my hair.</li>
            <li> I typically use Avocado or Jojoba oil to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> a previous customer I obtained this product for review&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> Natural Shea does have a natural, raw odor, but not an unpleasant one.</li>
            <li> As for the product itself:  I found the butter felt dry and flaky at first and thought I got a bad one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple other beard oils that smell worse and linger all day.  </li>
            <li> My curly hair gets very tangled overnight and is often dry and almost impossible to comb when I awake.  </li>
            <li> Recommend storing in air tight container.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and leaves a greasy residue so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You have to let this stuff melt in your hands a little before you rub it in-</li>
            <li> so it takes a little work.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter came with a little tin to keep some in</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to rub it in evenly and it does leave a little &#x27;greasy&#x27; residue but eventually, that soaks in.</li>
            <li> You just need a little bit to add moisture to your hair, or to use as lotion.</li>
            <li> Then, I ordered a couple of little plastic containers to mix the shea butter and scent and coconut oil in.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little effort to use shea butter</li>
            <li> I just rub a little into my palm and apply it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Smells a little bit like clay, and you have to melt it between your fingers before applying.</li>
            <li> I take some of this, and mix it in with a little bit of olive oil, and place it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Before bed rubbed a little all around.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the little things, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, unlike the oil, if I applied it just before getting dressed, my skin was a bit tackier and my clothes would grab a little as I was putting them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The visible cracks went away in a few days, the pain was gone almost instantly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think the Shea butter is just too heavy for my hair type, but I can see it benefiting those with thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to use it again for a few days</li>
            <li> Put in the fridge or freezer to firm up</li>
            <li> I then apply this to my knees and elbows - my trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> Some say it&#x27;s anti-aging too, but I need to test it for a few weeks before I&#x27;ll agree with that claim.</li>
            <li> I intend to do quite a few)</li>
            <li> You can even thin it out a bit by wetting your hands prior to using.  </li>
            <li> so you can put a few ounces of the butter in it and leave the rest in the bag.  </li>
            <li> and we basically use harsh chemicals all year.</li>
            <li> Plus my toe nails look way cleaner since there isn&#x27;t as much dead skin build up in the corners.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday with my vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for all the rhetorical questions, but seriously, this is such a deal I can hardly believe my eyes.</li>
            <li> A little about Beauty By Shea Organic Raw Shea</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s raw and messy, as it should be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the raw Shea Butter from this company a few times before</li>
            <li> The product lasts for months, so I just finished up my past block a few days ago.</li>
            <li> This product comes in the plastic packaging inside the sealed bag, and it is truly raw unrefined Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s raw</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s RAW and ORGANIC.  </li>
            <li> raw Shea should smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;1/2 cup Beauty By Shea&#x27;s Raw Organic Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup Jojoba oil  1/2 cup Beauty By Shea&#x27;s Raw Organic Shea Butter  </li>
            <li> Beauty By Shea Organic Raw Shea Butter is unrefined</li>
            <li> However, I did not know that you can purchase 100% Organic Raw Shae Butter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The 100% Organic Raw Shae Butter retails for $10 on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> 100% raw organic?</li>
            <li> If you have never tried raw shea butter, I suggest you do so now.</li>
            <li> I started by using the Raw Shea Butter as a night cream.</li>
            <li> I will be using raw shea butter for years to come.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beauty By Shea imports its 100% organic raw shea butter from Ghana to the US where it is filtered, packaged, and heat sealed to ensure quality and purity.</li>
            <li> I let it sit there for at least a half hour, and sometimes I will even let it sit on overnight.</li>
            <li> This is way softer than the other brand I ordered!!!</li>
            <li> a small amount of spf&lt;br /&gt;- and is non-comodogenic.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if this product would do for me, as a man, what it might for the ladies.  </li>
            <li> No more marks</li>
            <li> Use a SMALL amount of the Beauty by Shea , shea butter.  </li>
            <li> There is a small &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell to it</li>
            <li> I take a small amount, maybe the size of a dime and rub it on my skin - it will melt on your skin as it warms up.  </li>
            <li> I make small batches at a time and keep them in a small jar.</li>
            <li> Unrefined Shea butter is preferable to refined because refined shea oil is usually bleached, deodorized &amp; neutralized with lye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> Take a small amount, dime or nickle sized, &amp; let it melt in the palms of your hand.</li>
            <li> Also they provided a small tin like container to carry your Shea butter in your purse.  </li>
            <li> As per instructions I took a small amount rubbed it in my hand and applied to my face.</li>
            <li> I started using a small amount of this on my skin instead of lotion after the shower.  </li>
            <li> You need to put a small amount of the product in your hands and rub them together.  </li>
            <li> All three of my kids suffer from severe atopic dermatitis against which topical steroids have proven useless.</li>
            <li> Included inside the package was the Shea butter, and a small twist-able metal tin and a business card.  </li>
            <li> Basically, the shea butter is inside a ziplock-style bag which is inside a small brown paper bag.</li>
            <li> In the day time I like to apply a small amount to my crow&#x27;s feet and aging skin on my neck.</li>
            <li> My Shea Butter arrived on time in a small box w/sufficient packaging.</li>
            <li> It also came with a small tin as promised...which has inspired me to make a lip balm.</li>
            <li> I received the block with directions in a zip bag that was in a reclosable foil lined pouch with a small tin to fill for convenience...</li>
            <li> My itch is no more and my skin on my hand, face, and legs feel revitalized.</li>
            <li> Getting calloused, peeling skin - a real mess.  </li>
            <li> Chief among them is a common cosmetic we all know - raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about this one due to receiving very poor quality in the past.</li>
            <li> But, for me at least, it is not overwhelming, and it is not vile.</li>
            <li> The smell is also creamy and delicate - not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> You can grease squeaky cage doors with it, and not be terrified the dumb little muffins will lick it and be poisoned.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I was experiencing uncomfortable split ends and dry skin under my beard.  </li>
            <li> Hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend giving this a try if you&#x27;re having a hard time finding something that moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> We talked about the tackiness (it made it hard for her to rub) and both thought adding coconut oil might help.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard, but as soon as you hold it in the palm of your hand, it starts to soften.  </li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t let it get too hard), and then whip thoroughly with a hand mixer.  </li>
            <li> The smell was hardly there</li>
            <li> 4 hours late the soreness and achiness was leaving.  </li>
            <li> My skin glistens as it slowly soaks in the butter.</li>
            <li> butter melts at skin temperature - slowly.  </li>
            <li> my feet...really thick sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is:  it&#x27;s 100% organic raw unrefined African shea butter.  </li>
            <li> This includes varying strengths of topical steroids, and very expensive barrier creams from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Use very small amounts and rub it in well.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent also</li>
            <li> I use it for my super nasty feet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I was a little skeptical about this when I agreed to review it I am sold on it now.</li>
            <li> I had been trying out different products to try and help ease the painful itchiness that affects my legs, arms, and feet</li>
            <li> I use it on cracking fingers this bitter cold midwestern winter.  </li>
            <li> use this on my feet where it&#x27;s really dry and unpleasant..</li>
            <li> But the second time I ordered, it did not include that :(</li>
            <li> at least 75% of soreness was gone!  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and suffer from badly cracked, dry skin, pick this up and use it.</li>
            <li> This way, whenever I washed my hands I could apply it immediately and avoid the dry, cracked, painful hands.  </li>
            <li> It acts like a protective barrier that my sensitive skin badly needs!</li>
            <li> This winter has been tough on my skin but this shea butter has helped immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and is an off-white/ivory color with a nutty smell.</li>
            <li> I expected some earthy scent, but this was so bad.</li>
            <li> It gets even worse during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> Some areas are worse than others.</li>
            <li> The coconut oil was really not a great solution.</li>
            <li> Use it topically on lips, skin, and hair or use it as a base for homemade soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li> Summers are the worst for my hair because of the humidity, so I try to deep condition at least twice a month.</li>
            <li> No discoloration or bad odor, which seems to indicate it was, in fact, raw and unrefined.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how much Raw Shea Butter was sent to me to try out.</li>
            <li> No more painful scabs</li>
            <li> I thought about forewarning you that I had a kitchen scale as I was skeptical and man</li>
            <li> It’s not that it’s difficult, it just takes a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to have not taken before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> All I can say is you cannot go wrong if you try this.  </li>
            <li> Like others have stated it does have a weird scent kinda like a greasey smell</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> At the time I was desperate</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago, I stopped putting anything on my skin that had artificial ingredients, chemicals, fragrances, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfume like or artificial</li>
            <li> I am addicted!!</li>
            <li> (he notes that it isn&#x27;t a bad odor).  </li>
            <li> I waited to return to amazon because the company offered to replace it because it may have been a bad batch.</li>
            <li> but it is nothing bad.</li>
            <li> We have really bad eczema.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so bad.  </li>
            <li> I turned to Amazon but was worried because there were a lot of bad reviews for buying shea butter online.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or</li>
            <li> I use a lot of it to keep my nasty feet from being worse..</li>

            <li> Shea butter is great!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It came with a metal container so you can put your diy stuff into it. convenient. I did not have to go buy another container.&lt;br /&gt;-It is easy to use. Just cut off a tiny part and it easily melts in your (clean) hands&lt;br /&gt;-It does not clog pores. Just apply with clean hands onto your clean face. Trust me, my skin is super sensitive. This does not clog pores. However, everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently. Just test it on one area to see if your skin likes it or not.&lt;br /&gt;-Fair trade&lt;br /&gt;-Arrived fast&lt;br /&gt;-Good to massage into hair ends, moisturizer for face, use it to make body lotion, hand lotion&lt;br /&gt;-No added chemicals&lt;br /&gt;-Has a small amount of spf&lt;br /&gt;- and is non-comodogenic.  It has a comodogenic(spelling?) rate of 0, so it is not likely to clog pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None. A bit waxy before it melts. But that does not bother me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this if you want a chemical free moisturizer in the winter or even summer, and you have sensitive skin. It is also a good ingredient for lip balms, glosses, lotion, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought with my own money. I am not paid to review it. I personally hate reviews like that</li>
            <li> We mix Shea butter with Aquaphor for my son&#x27;s eczema. It seems to help keep it under control.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this in any lotion or soap recipes yet (though that is the plan) but I rubbed a little into my hands in it&#x27;s raw form, as a lotion, and I think it&#x27;s great stuff.  It absorbed well and wasn&#x27;t greasy.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what kind of things I can concoct with it!</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it to make homemade chapstick. Shea butter is one of the main ingredients in lotions and chapsticks. It feels relly good on your skin. Try it out, its a great value.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have tried other shea butter that claim to be organic they are tough and hard to apply. This one melts easily in your hands applies easily. Only need very small amount for entire body application</li>
            <li> I make my own deodorant and will be making my own soaps. This shea butter is wonderful! Melts like a dream &amp; my.skin is so soft! I loved the little tin that accompanied it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good product. It is one big solid piece with even structure because now in wintertime it is cold outside. in summer it is probably softer. You can cut a little piece and put it in your hand, where it begins to melt immediately or you can heat it carefully in a plastic bag in a waterbath. When it is soft, you can use it immediately like a cream. It is a fatty cream good for protection against the cold and windy weather. If you do not want shiny skin, you only need less. The colour is a little darker than nature white. The odour is first unusual, but not strong and then it reminds me at a mixture of nuts and hay, very natural. I will experiment with other ingredients like coconut oil, sweet almond oil and so to make it a wonderful cream for my body and face. It contains a lot of vitamins, for example C and E (hope I remembered it correctly) and these are good for anti aging because they are small molecules which can go through the skin (some anti aging molecules like hyalyron acid for example have difficulties to go through the skin because they are too big).</li>
            <li> Looks, feels and smells very nice.  Packaged very well and has information with it.  Also got an email from the seller with information.</li>
            <li> Love it just what I needed for my mixture.</li>
            <li> used for making homemade lip balm, and it worked well!</li>
            <li> came in a nice package, and the product smells great. I used it to make shea butter for kids, and their skin has improved greatly this winter. It works better than any other lotions i have tried so far. Will definitely buy again when our current jar of shea butter runs out.</li>
            <li> Nice neutral smell  melted it down with coconut oil, cocoa butter, and some essential oils and whipped it for lotion for sons eczema so we will see how that works but love the way it feels and excited to keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! It&#x27;s so nourishing and organic. I&#x27;m pregnant so it&#x27;s very important to me to use a product that&#x27;s healthy and all natural. And this is exactly it!  I&#x27;ve had such dry skin during my pregnancy and now this time of year when it&#x27;s cold out has really taken a toll on my skin. But I slather this stuff on and it does miracles!  I&#x27;m so grateful to have discovered it! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product! You won&#x27;t be sorry!! You&#x27;ll love it : )</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am buying shea butter in raw form...I was very skeptical but after using it for a few days I am IN LOVE! I even ordered some for my sister and mom! So far I have used it on my skin as a night time moisturizer and although it takes a long time for it to absorb, the results are amazing! I use it as an eye cream too for those newly forming fine lines and I gotta say I tried many eye creams and none of them gave the same hydration as this butter! I also use this butter as a moisturizer on skin after shaving and on my hands as they chap during winter a lot. I plan on using it on my lip and even making home made lip balms with it. Overall I am very impressed with the quality and the results from the use of this product and I have been bragging to everyone around me about it already.</li>
            <li> This was some of the best shea butter I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.  This butter smelled good enough to eat. I fell in love with the smoothness and delivery quality.  You can tell the company took pride in the appearance &amp; how it would arrive to the customer.  I will order from this company again, no doubt!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shea butter! I have started to blend it with a few other oils to create my own dry hand treatment cream. The key is to give it time to absorb in your skin as it does go on oily and a little goes a long way. The natural scent is not strong but a bit too earthy for me, I like to add essential oils like jasmine and rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Posted by Jeff C&#x27;s wife)</li>
            <li> Great quality! Just like most reviews stated! It just smells kind of unpleasant but I think that&#x27;s a good thing because that&#x27;s what real shea butter is supposed to smell like. I just mask it with essential oil when I make my diy stuff. Would totally buy it again!</li>
            <li> Product as expected and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my sister and she loves it. The smell is pleasant  and the texture is soft not gritty. It melts quickly and it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> The shea butter arrived inside a resealable plastic bag inside a tall brown package just as shown in the product picture. The fragrance is mild and somewhat earthy or nutty. My 12-year-old son, who has very dry skin and would probably benefit from using it, doesn&#x27;t care for the smell and hasn&#x27;t been willing to use it. I find it somewhat pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have largely used it on my feet, which, as an every day runner, outdoors, in the winter, are very dry. It is an excellent moisturizer and skin conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are more creative, it would be a perfect base in many recipes for homemade lotions or balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my son ever overcomes his disliked for this natural, unperfumed moisturizer, I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review **</li>
            <li> No complaints thus far. It shipped fast and the packaging was secure. I&#x27;ve used it to make lotion bars so far. It works great in my recipe.</li>
            <li> This works great for beard care.  I was experiencing uncomfortable split ends and dry skin under my beard.  I started using this myself after purchasing it for my girlfriend for Christmas.  I had been in the market for something new to oil and maintain my beard, so I figured I would give it a shot based on all the positive Amazon feedback.  Sure enough, my beard was feeling fantastic and has been since.  It&#x27;s so simple to massage a bit into your beard, and the hair absorbs the Shea Butter so well you don&#x27;t end up with greasy hands after you apply.  A downfall of many beard oils for me is trying to get it off my hands after application.  There is no issue with Shea Butter.    Another review mentions that it has an odor for about two hours (he notes that it isn&#x27;t a bad odor).  I agree it smells much like you would expect a nut-oil to smell -- I rather like it.  It&#x27;s a very natural odor.  I seem to adapt to the smell rather quickly, he mentioned several hours of smelling the product, I rarely notice it after initial application unless I&#x27;m petting my beard.  I&#x27;ve had multiple other beard oils that smell worse and linger all day.  In my opinion the Shea Butter smell is very minimal compared to many other beard products.    I recommend this for anyone with a beard (or any hair for that matter).  One caution: Don&#x27;t use too much at once or you might end up with greasy feeling beard/hair.  This is true for any oil.  With many oil products after you&#x27;ve over-done it you&#x27;re going to have to take a shower or walk around with oil-soaked beard/hair.  Shea Butter actually recovers from this situation rather well, just keep rubbing it around and transferring it to other hair/skin.</li>
            <li> This is amazing to work with I love it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product at awesome price!!Would recommend! !</li>
            <li> I loved the packaging and the product smelled wonderful. However, the shea butter had a gritty consistency to it. I couldn&#x27;t use it for the body butters that I planned on making. It could be used when melted, however.</li>
            <li> This product has been great in cosmetics and soaps.  It has a mild nutty smell, and is beige in color. This was a very good value...this amount will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Please note I was offered this product, complimentary, as part of a product testing program.  Its been a week since this product has been shipped to me.  I didn&#x27;t know much about Raw Shea Butter, but did some research and this seems to be of high quality organic product, from its color and consistency.  It has been used a skin moisturizer and hair conditioner.  Product works as promised making your skin smooth and hair soft and healthy.  Application time has to be right as your skin will be sticky for a while, but once it penetrates your skin, it make it so soft.</li>
            <li> I am so very satisfied with my order, that i will soon place an or for mango butter as well.</li>
            <li> Great!! Used it for body butter and it turned out amazing!! Great gift ideas for Christmas or a quick last minute gift!</li>
            <li> Wow the product is so smooth and buttery.  We used it to make homemade deodorant which worked great with lavender oil.  The butter itself smells a bit &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; but after incorporating all the ingredients for the deodorant it turned out wonderful.  This stuff would work fine by itself for skin softener if you don&#x27;t mind the earthy smell.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly - great moisturizer</li>
            <li> First, for other buyers, I have NOT been contacted for a review, nor do I have reason to leave a false or tainted review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I can say the block I received seems legit. It smells strongly and isn&#x27;t white (not bleached). It&#x27;s raw and messy, as it should be. I&#x27;ve not found any pieces of shea nut in it yet. It has a low melting point, blends well with other carrier and essential oils, and works on my complicated skin that would let me know if this wasn&#x27;t pure (cocoa butter is my enemy, as are many other things). I&#x27;ve read many sketchy online experiences with shea butters and their claims. I&#x27;ve also received emails from other sellers asking for reviews for other products. I only write this review because I am also drowning in a sea of frustration over which reviews are believable. I can&#x27;t promise your batch with be like mine, but I can assure you I just made gifts and personal products using what I have from this seller, and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Unlike the horror stories I have read about from other buyers after purchasing what was claimed to be &amp;#34;100% organic&amp;#34; but turned out to be a bag of &amp;#34;hot mess, &amp;#34; I am happy to report that this product is of great quality and far from a horror story. I make my own body care products and was nervous about ordering &amp;#34;sight unseen.&amp;#34; I took a chance and this product is now in my wishlist to pull out the next time I need to order, which won&#x27;t be long.  I highly recommend this shea butter. It is smooth, clean and has the right texture. Not grainy and no foreign objects.  This is a worry-free buy.</li>
            <li> Hard to rub in.  Coconut oil works better and smells better.</li>
            <li> My skin soaks it up and then feels as soft as butter!  I live in a VERY dry climate, so my skin always seems dry. You have to let this stuff melt in your hands a little before you rub it in- so it takes a little work.  But no lotion ever worked this well for me.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product. Sure am glad I did just that. I had very dry knees and elbows and a couple of eczema pathches on my legs that I had tried everything on, inlcuding coconut oil. Also I live in South Dakota so winter is pretty tough on your skin. This stuff worked wonderfully! The smell is a little different and I know I could change that by adding some lavender oil to it but so far I&#x27;m fine with it. Even worked well on my kids chapped cheeks from playing outside in the snow. I would recommend giving this a try if you&#x27;re having a hard time finding something that moisturizes.  I noticed a difference immediatley. A little goes a long way. This comes in a huge brick that will last a very long time. Definitely worth buying!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to make some lotion bars due to my very dry sensitive skin.  Love the Shea Butter.  It is perfect!</li>
            <li> love it! easy to cut it and apply it to my skin. It has a subtle scent also</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with this product. I think I may need to do a bit more research before I use it again, although, some of my friends really enjoyed the body balm that I made.</li>
            <li> fresh, soft, creamy...similar to Life-Flo Pure Shea, but much fresher. very light smoky smell. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shea butter. I ordered 3 different shea butters to compare them...</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth for my DIY body lotion. It is not sticky at all even in a very humid country in Singapore. It absorb well into my skin almost instantaneously!</li>
            <li> This winter has been extremely harsh on my hands especially. They were dry, cracked, to the point of bleeding. I had had this Shae Butter for a while but had given it to my wife. I have no use for that, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;One day I came in from work and was complaining about my knuckles hurting and my wife suggested I put the shae butter on my hands. At the time I was desperate and so I did. The Shae Butter did wonders. The visible cracks went away in a few days, the pain was gone almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and suffer from badly cracked, dry skin, pick this up and use it. You will not be unhappy you did! Thanks! Great product.&lt;br /&gt;As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review and I&#x27;m thankful I did!</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife.  She has very dry skin on her hands and elbows - especially during the winter months.  She started using this and her cracked hands have healed and stayed soft and her elbows are now soft and healthy looking.  She loves it.  A little bit goes a very long way.  I have started using it in place of a hand lotion I was using before because my knuckles tend to get dry and bleed easily.  My knuckles are no longer white and dry looking.  This is a great product!  As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review - and will be purchasing more when we eventually run out.  I also plan to buy some as gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The only comment I have is that the first time I purchased this it came with a small tin can. But the second time I ordered, it did not include that :(</li>
            <li> This product is great for anyone with dry skin.  I have patches of dry skin on my face which the butter did wonders for. However I had to stop using it because I also have patches of oily skin which didn&#x27;t work wonders on. My husband on the other hand LOVES this product!  He uses it all over and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  The smell is nutty but if you don&#x27;t like it you can put in an oil you do like.  As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, my whole family is using it.  I love it and will be purchasing some more</li>
            <li> Good product and packaging. Nice little freebie as well.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality of the shea butter. It has a very soft, smooth texture unlike the gritty product I have purchased elsewhere. When I make body butter again, this is definitely the product I will use.</li>
            <li> Been a fan of any products with shea butter as the main ingredient, so I decided to do all my beauty regimen home made by using unrefined  raw shea butter. I have ordered other unrefined raw shea butter- ivory from another company but the smell was such so strong for me to the point of being rancid. I tried ordering from BEAUTY BY SHEA and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The nutty smell is present, but it is a very pleasant, mellow smell, which I believe is the natural smell of a FRESH unrefined raw shea butter. As I was contented with how it smelled, I then chipped off a bit from the block and tested it on my hand and it felt so smooth and refined without just one bit of residue. I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery!  Will buy again</li>
            <li> This product comes in the plastic packaging inside the sealed bag, and it is truly raw unrefined Shea butter. It says that it is organic, I can&#x27;t make that judgement myself because there is no stamp to confirm that on the packaging. As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review. That said, I really like this product. I live in very dry climate, and every once in a while my knuckles crack to the point they start to bleed. I used it in one of these occasions and was happy with its performance. I applied it twice the first day, and probably 5-6 times on the second day, and by the third day my skin started to recover and regenerate. Bleeding stopped with the first application. The smell is nutty/earthy, definitely doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance to it, which would confirm that is unrefined. It is only needed the size of a penny to completely cover all the skin on one fist. It only takes couple seconds to heat up the butter in the palm of your hand to get start melting. 1lb will last you a long time. If you live in the warmer climate and the whole thing starts melting, you can always put it in the refrigerator and in no time it will be solid once again.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. I really love the tin that comes with it so I can take it on the go.</li>
            <li> Hello, I&#x27;m a dude and never really had much use for lotions or skin care products. Often I feel the chemicals in the lotions irritate my skin and I have to wash it off. This Shea Butter is great as it gives a natural most prizing feeling. I will even put a little extra left over on my hands for my hair. I&#x27;ve used it to massage my wife&#x27;s feet to.</li>
            <li> Shea butter has many properties and it is known to help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. It quickly penetrates the skin to immediately protect and infuse with rich lasting moisture and it deeply nourishes and hydrates dry scalp or damaged hair which helps to reduce dryness and flakiness. I am very critical of products that claim to be 100% organic or natural, especially shea butter because there are so many companies out here that supply it.&lt;br /&gt;Real, unrefined shea butter is off white/ivory to light yellow in color and will be a bit grainy due to its natural texture. This product fits that criteria and I am glad to have bought it! I even had my dad smell it (we&#x27;re Nigerian) and he said it smells just like the shea butter back home! The shea butter came with a little tin to keep some in and I thought that was really nice! The product is very thick and is an off-white/ivory color with a nutty smell. Just how shea butter should be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair and skin regimen, I also use shea butter to protect and seal my ends to prevent split ends and I apply it on my skin to prevent stretch marks and fade scars and to moisturize my skin in general. I have an ample supply of shea butter and essential oils, so I made a few jars of shea butter creme and they turned out really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me at a low cost. All thoughts are unbiased and of my own opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product I Love it</li>
            <li> This was a free sample from being a previous customer of another product I had bought.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my feet where it&#x27;s really dry and unpleasant.. It&#x27;s raw so it does take an extra step of heating through with ur hands to let it melt then applying it. It&#x27;s so worth it, I used t for a week and my feet now is smooth. I do a lot of house work and my hands get toughened up so I keep a jar next to the kitchen sink and apply after clean ups and dishes. I probably would have never bought this on my own but since this was a free sample I see why people are using raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It has a bit of a learning curve to use it, but a quick google search found lots of info. I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing product fast delivery! I will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I love this item I was sent this for free because of the 20 Oz bottle I got and I love it makes my skin so smooth and I would say if you like massages and like an oil being rubbed on this feels great to</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this butter all winter.  It kept my hands and everything else from cracking and I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in a different container, like a jar instead of a bag, but the product itself is great.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased shea butter so I have nothing to compare it to. It was easy to work with and made my homemade beauty products turned out great.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how easy it was to scoop the Shea Butter out of the bag! It was soft enough that I could take a spoon and scoop it in a container. It mixed perfectly with my oils; no complaints over here.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this product would do for me, as a man, what it might for the ladies.  I was pleasantly surprised that it did seem to heal my dried skin and was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea Butter that I have ever used in my life! It is much more creamy and easy to use than the yellow butter. It has a light nutty/smoke smell that is easy to mask with perfume. I LOVE the way my skin tone has changed and even out. No blemish No more marks</li>
            <li> My husband and kids have extremely dry skin and this has been wonderful for them. The scent is strong, but not really unpleasant. My daughter&#x27;s skin is usually rough, but this has been beneficial and she is not longer scratching all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**As a prior customer, I was provided this product to review. However this my honest feedback on the product**</li>
            <li> I make my own hair products and this works great.</li>
            <li> Great for bath products!</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter, but it seems to be out of stock a lot.  Hopefully I will be able to order again soon.</li>
            <li> I will repurchase this product. Has helped with a fresh scar, stretch marks, and overall moisture. It is thick and leaves a greasy residue so a little goes a long way. Best to use at night before bed.</li>
            <li> Though shea butter is not my favorite scent, it is an incredible butter for many skin needs. I mix it with cocoa butter and other oils for an incredible body butter. This is a wonderful value for organic. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have long been fighting &amp;#34;dry knee caps&amp;#34; and this stuff has been terrific. I rub it on every night and morning and simply feels great. I have no issues with it coming in contact with any clothing, in fact I wear a suit to work daily. Love this product.</li>
            <li> was I using Shea butter since I was pregnant, and even still use my whole body and hair, and I can say that it is best for your skin and hair during my pregnancy never left me stretch marks, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am checking to see if I can return this. This shea butter has the most strong and pungent odor that is quite nauseating. I tried making some natural deodorant with it and the smell is so strong that even after 40 drops of essential oils, all you could smell was the shea. I only used 3 TBS in the recipe. I expected some earthy scent, but this was so bad. It doesn&#x27;t smell right at all. I don&#x27;t know if this is how shea is suppose to smell, but I can&#x27;t imagine using it in any natural recipes. This is definitely getting returned. Awful!  ***update*** I tried emailing customer service and have never received any response. I waited to return to amazon because the company offered to replace it because it may have been a bad batch. After FOUR emails, I haven&#x27;t heard anything back. The company commented saying my email wasn&#x27;t working. I have been receiving emails without issues.  I told them I&#x27;d email again so that we could work something out. It&#x27;s only been crickets and now it&#x27;s too late to return to Amazon. I am so frustrated! Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shea butter for almost a month now, and I must say that it softens my skin like nobody&#x27;s business.  It makes my hands, legs, and feet feel moisturized, glowy, and soft like butter.  The shea butter has a nice mild smell, almost like a faint coco butter smell.  A little bit goes a long way, so I imagine that the amount that I received will last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other shea butters in the past, and I can tell that this one is very high quality.  It melts nicely and is not gritty at all.  And, best of all, you really can use it from head to toe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must tell you that I did receive this promotionally for review, but I will not hesitate to purchase it again once I&#x27;ve run out of my initial stash.  This product makes my skin happy :-)</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product.  I have been using it every other day for three weeks now on my face, my feet, and on a few scars.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it makes my face greasy to the touch for several hours after I put it on, but the benefits far outweigh this minor annoyance.  I just put it on at night and by the morning my face is soft and smooth.  I love this stuff.  My feet are super soft all the time now and the skin on my face is softer, moister, and I have less red spots and blemishes.  As for my scars, I think a longer period of usage will be necessary to see if it actually diminishes them, however, the skin around them looks more supple and as a result they don&#x27;t look as obvious.  I also like that you get a huge block of the Shea butter for a good price and it will last for forever because you only need a pea sized amount for each body part.  An extra benefit is my hands are softer since I am using them to apply it elsewhere. I did try using it in my hair but my hair is really fine and I think the Shea butter is just too heavy for my hair type, but I can see it benefiting those with thicker hair.  If you have dry skin or rough feet, or can&#x27;t find anything to even out your skin tone on your face, I definitely recommend giving this a try! As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review.</li>
            <li> A good product. It may just be my sons skin, so I am doing four instead of five, but it worked great and then it sort of stopped and we switched to other products and now those are wearing off. The only real downside is that you have to &#x27;warm&#x27; it up in your hands before you apply it or it is a big stiff.</li>
            <li> I have never used raw organic Shea Butter before but was very excited to try it.  It did not disappoint!!!!  The one problem area that I have is my feet and I had applied the raw Shea Butter directly to my feet at night, slipped some socks on and in the morning my feet felt incredibly smooth (better than when I would go get pedicures)!!  I’m very impressed with this product however I do wish it would come with some “recipes” and tips and suggestions on uses (which I googled - hence the four star review) but other than that, it is a great product and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> finally fixed my dry skin!</li>
            <li> My family and I live an organic/natural lifestyle so I am always looking for more ways to replace hazardous chemicals, while saving money at the same time. Shea Butter is a very versatile product and has a lot of benefits. Finding a good quality Shea butter is very critical when it comes to using it in your everyday products. I was a little worried about this one due to receiving very poor quality in the past. I decided to try it out and I was more than pleased with this Shea butter. I love packaging, it&#x27;s a big part of what I look for in a products, as a consumer. The packaging on this product was beautiful. It comes packaged in a very nice sealed back. Inside the bag is the Shea butter, which is sealed separately, a nice round tin (for use when making your own products), and a card with instructions on how to claim your free Ebook. The Ebook contains tons of really amazing recipes you can make with your Shea butter. I decided to make the Light Vanilla Body Scrub, as I love scrubs. The Shea Butter was very easy to work with and the scrub turned out beautifully and took less than 10 minutes to make. I didn&#x27;t even have to use half the Shea butter for the recipe and it made a very good size body scrub (definitely money saving). Not to mention the Shea butter also made my skin supper soft and silky. There are tons of options for Shea butter available but this is by far the best I have come across! I am so happy I decided to try this brand and not let the brands in the past influence this for me. &amp;#34; I received this item at no cost in exchange for my honest review&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The product is overall just what I wanted, but I did read reviews prior to buying about their orders being short. I thought about forewarning you that I had a kitchen scale as I was skeptical and man I wish I did, it was .50 oz short. As a buyer we definitely expect to be buying and receiving at least the correct amount, as well as the product we are visibly seeing online which can be a risk now a days buying online and I understand that. Other than that, you get 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I intended to use this product to help treat very dry hands and feet. At room temperature it is like ultra packed brown sugar with finer granules, is stickier than brown sugar, and is off-white in color. Inside the brown sealed bag pictured it is in a ziplock-type plastic bag. When worked with your hands it becomes greasy like melted butter. I tried it on my hands but had to wash it off due to the greasy nature of it and not wanting to leave its residue on my things around the house. I did leave it on my feet with socks on. It may or may not have helped any better than the usual lotion I use (either Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion or CeraVe Renewing SA Cream). However, I only used it one time as I disliked the strange smell (it smelled all day being at home wearing socks over the lotion on my feet). Therefore, due to the greasy and smelly nature I do not think it a great practical product for dry skin. This is my own opinion and I was given this product free of charge to test it.</li>
            <li> This is not your usual hand cream, it is exactly as the header says: raw and unrefined, it comes in the shape of a brick and has no fragrance added, it does take a few times to get used to the texture. What I do is a put a pinch and put it on my palm and rub it with my thumb or index, it gets soft and creamy very quickly, but still thick. It is heavy duty, more like Vaseline (without the chemical ingredients or smell) than the regular commercial cream and the results seem to last longer. It smells woody to me, not &amp;#34;perfume woody&amp;#34; but &amp;#34;natural woody&amp;#34;. My wife uses it at night mixed with some of her usual cream to get a softer result and some fragrance while still getting the longer lasting results of the butter, as for me, I probably like it precisely because it doesn&#x27;t smell like regular cream and I have to put it on less often. Id like to mention that after buying some other things from them I was provided this item for review by the seller, but will be buying some when we finish this one.</li>
            <li> It is real unrefined shea butter and worked awesomely on my homemade soaps and creams.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make magnesium lotion and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> First…the quality of the product itself was excellent.  Light nutty scent…fresh, not rancid (Shea Butter will eventually get rancid, found that out with some that came with a bodhran drum we traded for a few years back!).  Took a little crumbly piece and rubbed it in, it melted on the back of my hands nicely. Next, I&#x27;ll get into what may be more personal preference.  Took the Shea Butter to my massage therapist and had her use it.  It seems to get kind of tacky and left a feeling of being coated… I took a hot bath afterward tho and it left my skin feeling incredibly soft.  Very nice, but if I hadn&#x27;t been able to bathe soon after I don&#x27;t think I would have like the feeling it left.  We talked about the tackiness (it made it hard for her to rub) and both thought adding coconut oil might help.  It took several weeks before we could meet again, but I mixed 1/2 c Shea butter, 1/4 organic Coconut oil and 1/4 tsp Sassafras oil (wanted the warming of the sassafras, but wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work so only did a little).  It worked wonderfully!  The little bit of coconut oil made it lighter and slicker but still have the lasting power of the butter.  Every once in a while I&#x27;d get a scent of the sassafras and think…mmmm root beer but I don&#x27;t think it was enough to really add heat!  She rubbed some in my hair also and it was soft and easier then usual to brush the next morning. I have even moisturized my drum heads again using the unmixed butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum it up. Excellent quality. And while I personally don&#x27;t care for it straight, I liked it very much mixed with other oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciated the opportunity to barter this product for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This item has helped me out so much!  I suffer from extremely dry skin especially during the winter.  The skin on my feet becomes rough and cracked.  I had been trying out different products to try and help ease the painful itchiness that affects my legs, arms, and feet and this has been the only one that works consistently.  I&#x27;ve gotten temporary help from other lotions but this one has maintained it nourished.  I just apply a bit of it at night and some in the morning and it lasts all day.  I waited a month to write a review so I could give a more complete one rather than just a first impression from only few days use.  My skin went from dry and sometimes painful to smooth and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice the nutty smell that other people had commented on.  It isn&#x27;t overwhelming and goes away after a bit.  But I did want to experiment a bit with it so I mixed the shea butter with coconut oil, some essential lavender oil, eucalyptus oil, and spearmint oil with a hand mixer.  I LOVED it.  I put some in a jar and carried it with me.  This way, whenever I washed my hands I could apply it immediately and avoid the dry, cracked, painful hands.  This winter has been tough on my skin but this shea butter has helped immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a prior customer of another product from this seller, I was luckily enough given the opportunity to receive this item at no cost however all opinions are my own.  I definitely recommend it as I was so happy and impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunet Delgado</li>
            <li> High quality product.  I liked that a tin was included.</li>
            <li> I use the shea butter when I make hair butters. Add some favorite essential oils, and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you read the other reviews, you know that packaging is just a ziplock bag. Recommend storing in air tight container.  The product itself is pretty cool- pure block of Shea butter that melts as you apply body heat by rubbing it on. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and feels good on skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it regularly enough on my eczema to review it&#x27;s effects yet, but will update with any later results.  * Disclosure: a sample of this product was provided free of charge, however all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I use this in my homemade body butters and lip balm. Good price for the amount you get and for my family it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it came in about 5 days and it was everything i thought i would be. im definitely going to continue purchasing this product. check out my youtube channel reviewing the item (naturally scattered_kay)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I use it for a number of things, basically from head to toe. Love the stuff. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not so good as a different brand I bought before in amazon.  This brand is double prices of the other I bought before, but the oil quality is less than that.  Less richer oil.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Silky soft hands&lt;br /&gt;Softened Cuticles Beautifully! (mine were super dry before applying)&lt;br /&gt;Great for feet - made the calluses soft and feet supple&lt;br /&gt;Used for dry elbows&lt;br /&gt;Great to keep the frizzies down on your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smell - I just didn&#x27;t like the smell but I am sensitive to smells. However, it was strong the first day and the smell dissipated the second day. I am thinking about adding a drop of some great smelling oil to it.</li>
            <li> When I agreed to accept a review sample I knew very little about this other than it may help my dry skin. That it does. After just two uses I have noticed a big difference, especially on the back of my hands, which seem to dry more than other exposed places on my body - even in the humid Central Florida summers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is interesting. It actually has the aroma of a food, which was a relief since I did not want to come across as feminine. At sixty five that would surely be a change in life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, for me it did take some work to rub in. On my skin it took about five minutes before my skin absorbed it, then it left a slightly oily sheen. It took hours before it was completely absorbed, but my skin was noticeably softer after two applications twelve hours apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I was a little skeptical about this when I agreed to review it I am sold on it now. It truly works and I am going to use it only sparingly the remainder of the summer, saving it for the winter months when it gets very dry in my region and this will prove a lot more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I awarded this five stars after only two uses is the immediate results I observed. This stuff is no hype. Plus it just feels good!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used raw Shea butter...so glad I was offered the opportunity to test it out.  I have used many products that CONTAINED Shea butter but not pure Shea butter. I got a bit of a sunburn on my shoulders while kayaking and was going to put some aloe on it but then I thought this would be a great opportunity to test this butter out. It was so smooth and soothing. I&#x27;m going camping in a few weeks and be sure I will bring some Shea along to test on bug bites etc. This bar will last a long long time. So cheap when you compare it to the product that CONTAINS Shea butter. Very good product very fair price.</li>
            <li> My brother got a sample of this product for me as I have stretch marks and sensitive skin. I have used it for a few days now and my skin is definitely better and time will tell if my stretch marks goes away. But I recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin or any skin related issues.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is thoroughly luxurious from the smell to how my skin absorbs it. My skin glistens as it slowly soaks in the butter. I’ve only applied it once a day for 3-4 days and found my hands are noticeably softer and my cuticles are no longer cracking! The smell is earthy and very grounding. I enjoy it melting slowly in my hands before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this for use in creating your homemade hand creams as well as using just as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; and is very pure. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This works really well as a hair mask and you do not need a lot. I am happy with how it works and love that it is just one simple organic ingredient and nothing else. I also use it as a moisturizer on my elbows and knees, both of which get quite dry and absorbs the shea butter quickly. It also works well to moisturize your feet. Just rub on your feet before bedtime and cover with socks and allow to absorb over night. You could do the same thing with your hands if you are prone to dry hands. No need to have multiple products in your beauty cabinet when you just need organic shea butter that can do what normally you might have several products for.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer - I did receive this product for free for the purpose of reviewing it. No monetary compensation was received.</li>
            <li> Very high quality. I love it.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is completely raw and unrefined, so it retains all of the delightful nutty fragrance, subtle yellow color, and natural texture of pure organic shea butter.  It is a natural luxury, quite different from the homogenized, over-processed commercial products that contain only a small percentage of chemically-refined shea oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea nuts are from a unique species of tree that lives over two hundred years, Vitellaria paradoxa.  The nuts contain a rich complex of five different fatty acids that are good for the skin:  palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and arachidic.  This particular shea butter is imported from Ghana, where women gather the nuts from wild trees, shell and roast them, and extract the oils by hand.  It smells delicious, and it is indeed used as a food in Africa, as well as a source of income.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is solid&amp;mdash;but not hard&amp;mdash;at room temperature, and liquefies at body temperature, so it is easy to apply.  It is quickly absorbed by the skin and not only improves the texture of dry skin, but makes it look better, too.  I like to apply it after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty by Shea provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample from the seller to test this product and write my honest reivew. This shea butter is so smooth &amp; luxurious.This is the first time I am using organic raw shea butter and it far exceeded my expectations. wow..It is soo good. Everyone in my family started using it. Can greatly feel the difference in my skin and hair in couple of uses. It is mild, nutty and moist. Skin does not feel greasy as the skin absorbs within minutes. I&#x27;m very impressed &amp; thankful for this product!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.  Weighed exactly 16oz and product seems very good quality.  It was hot here when it came and the package contained it well, it wasn&#x27;t melted, was just soft.  Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Best unrefined shea butter I&#x27;ve used! Great for my skin in the dry winter months. I prefer this over the gold shea butter. Great base for my diy whipped shea butter for hair moisture. This 16 Oz package lasted 9 months including making whipped badges for friends and family. A staple for moisturization.</li>
            <li> Can I say WOW!  I am so glad I agreed to review this product. I have contact dermatitis, on my hands, therefore my skin is in rough shape all year round. My hands get extremely dry, cracked, which cause a lot of pain to the point I can not even close my hands. So I have tried every lotion, cream, ointments, even prescription creams. I have gotten relief but never for long. When the mailman handed the package to me and i realized what it was , I couldn&#x27;t get the bag open quick enough to try this Shea Butter out. When I was asked if I was interested in reviewing this product, I was so excited to see that it was 100% ORGANIC RAW UNREFINED  Shea Butter. I love the feeling, it is not greasy like most creams, and lotions. I don&#x27;t mind the natural smelling fragrance it has going on. Im not into the fragrant lotions, that can make my skin roar in pain  eek!!! Ive only used this twice now, and my hands look like my hands again. I can say I am hooked.  I will definitely be talking about this product to all my friends. I know they will be happy that I have found a product to help with my skin condition... Because they always hear me complaining either about my pain, or a product that I bought and tried that didn&#x27;t work lol</li>
            <li> This butter is fantastic. Mild smell. Not grainy and works great on dry skin. I use it on everything!!</li>
            <li> My daughter enjoys this product. On one leg, she applied the Bath and Bodyworks normal lotion; on the other, she applied the Shea Butter mixed with a bit of lotion. She preferred the Shea Butter combination because it was less greasy and more of a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish. It also felt a lot smoother over the next couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Disclaimer, I was presented a sample of this product to test and review.)</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this stuff.  I was skeptical at first, because I&#x27;ve used shea butter before.  This shea butter is different.  It&#x27;s RAW and ORGANIC.  I noticed that as soon as touched it.  It&#x27;s hard, but as soon as you hold it in the palm of your hand, it starts to soften.  The warmth of your skin makes it easier to use.  Use a SMALL amount of the Beauty by Shea , shea butter.  The first time slathered it on, I used about a dime worth on both my feet and elbows and it was MORE than enough.  So now I use a pea size and it&#x27;s perfect.  The smell is light.  It&#x27;s not fragrant like a flower.  It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell, maybe a hint of a nutty smell.  I do not smell it on myself though after application.  I used this on my feet and I didn&#x27;t have to use it again for a few days, that&#x27;s how good this shea butter is.  I have chronic dry feet and elbows.  Nothing worked before this.  I hope I never run out, and if I do, I will be back! Thank you for letting me review your Shea Butter for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Wow. Who knew that in it&#x27;s purest form this product that we have become so familiar with could be so different. Shea butter is an ingredient that pops up in many products but you never know the full amount and quality. So to have it in such a basic form (and it is basic!) is great. You can use it as is or mix it with other ingredients to create your own products, lotions, etc. I&#x27;ve been using it as is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the scent is a little foreign. It is nutty and earthy and not &#x27;fragranced&#x27; at all, something we have come to look for in health and beauty aids. However, having the earthy musk is reassuring that we are working with a true unrefined product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a great big brick, nothing pretty to look at, no fancy packaging but enclosed in plastic and inside a brown paper bag with the label. Nice to keep it simple and reinforce the basic nature of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on skin, in many areas, dry skin, rough patches, cracked heels, etc. It takes a little bit to rub it in evenly and it does leave a little &#x27;greasy&#x27; residue but eventually, that soaks in. In the meantime, you have super soft skin and the effect lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are tons of other uses and I&#x27;m just going to have to keep reading more and experimenting to get the full benefit but for now, I&#x27;m happy with the results so far. I was provided a sample for testing.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how much Raw Shea Butter was sent to me to try out. I was given 1lb of it to try complimentary which is fantastic. With only using a dime sized amount for lotion on my husbands feet, I will never run out. I am still branching out and slowly trying it with other uses such as conditioners and make-up. You can add essential oils to it or add a dollop to your bathtub to make the water smooth. There are hundreds of uses for raw shea butter and since this is unrefined from Ghana, it is refreshing and natural. There are no added scents to it so it just smells, well, like nothing in general. There is a small &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell to it but it is nothing bad. I have used it in a few different ways and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the butter. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out in other ways and see what I like best but so far I definitely think everyone should go out and buy this!</li>
            <li> Thank you BEAUTY BY SHEA for sending me this awesome Shea Butter to test out for you!  I am not sure who was more excited about this stuff me or my daughter.  We have both been using it to moisturize our skin, it&#x27;s fantastic right after a shower or bath!  My daughter has even been using it in her hair since she has very curly African American hair.  I really love the fact that it is 100% Organic Raw Unrefined!  As an added bonus a little goes a REALLY long way.  This will be now be a staple in our household!! Love it :)</li>
            <li> I was asked to review this shea butter for my blog.&lt;br /&gt;I will not lie, I love shea butter. I use it for my super nasty feet. I use a lot of it to keep my nasty feet from being worse..they crack and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I melt a little bit of shea butter with beeswax and place it in a jar for later use. This is fantastic for feet! This particular brand is a high quality, and I adore the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Phoenix, and normally wouldn&#x27;t dare order shea butter during summer, but for this review I needed to. It didn&#x27;t leak at all! The butter was completely melted, but after being in the Phoenix mailbox at over 100 degrees all day, the container was intact. It didn&#x27;t blow up or leak in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting it sit in the AC for a while it was back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I try Shea Butter and it is awesome! When it arrived it was very soft due to the heat but about 30 minutes in the fridge fixed it.  I did some research so that I knew what to look for and this product meets all the quality requirements.  It smelled nice and actually moisturized my skin better than any lotion has.  I have even used it on my face.  The scars on my legs are noticeably lighter as are my stretch marks.  I have been using this product for about 4 weeks now.  I have notice that a little goes a very long way! Packaging is simple yet sturdy.  Shea Butter is actually inside another sealed bag inside.  You also get a recipe book that gives you different ways to use it.  I mixed mine with a few drops of peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> This is just what my kids and I needed.  We have really bad eczema.  It gets even worse during the winter months.  We have constantly been battling it . Trying to find ways to keep our skin from drying out.  In the winter, my kids bleed it&#x27;s so bad.  We have been using this and so far it&#x27;s been wonderful.  Our skin has actually been quite soft since using it.  I am very hopeful this winter taht we will be able to keep everything under control.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and the customer service has been outstanding. There was a problem with the first 16 oz package that was ordered from Healthy Essentials (Beauty By Shea). For all the many years that I have been a customer of Amazon, this is the first time that I actually complained to a seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Kristen (owner/customer service) about this and was promptly given a refund and a coupon for free Shea butter. She apologized and said that this was the first time a customer had complained about the product. I sent her pictures and descriptions of the problem. After a few days, I ordered the free shea butter along with other items from Amazon and it all arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, the first batch was bad because both of the free shea butter that I received on the second and third orders are quite excellent. The first bad batch had a very smoky smell, was too waxy and half of the product did not mix well with my usual Shea butter mixture. Surprising, the other half of the bad batch mixed better with the same recipe on a second try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the good batch that I received have a more nutty smell and is less waxy. I am very, very pleased and happy with the product and plan to purchase this item again in the near future. I would highly recommend this product to others. Kristen was very courteous, professional and handled the matter promptly. You can&#x27;t ask for more than that from a seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I would highly recommend this product and the seller (Healthy Essentials/Beauty By Shea) as well.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is amazing!!! I was really scared to order another shea butter online since I tried it once before (from another company) and it was delivered moldy with some hair in it. Luckily I got my money back from them but I decided not to use that brand ever again. So I wanted to try another brand from Amazon and this one is a winner. It&#x27;s a really good quality shea butter and works to moisturize my crazy dry skin and hair. Yay!</li>
            <li> As a product tester,i was asked to use the product and comment on it.I feel glad to be using Shea and commenting about it for its such a good product I have a normal to dry skin and sometimes after cleansing, my Florida weather makes my skin lack lustre and moisture.This is a skin reliever as it has vitamin E,vitamin A which heals and soothes my skin.Any weather the Shea will act as a protectant,help me calm my skin prolems nd texture.I use it a soothing balm for my lips,as a chapped cream for my elbows and knees and as a night cream for my face after cleansing.Natural,of course is another plus to add to its reditability.&lt;br /&gt;A definate alternative to other cosmetics and i would srely buy them in bulk!</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality pure shea butter! Best I&#x27;ve ever ordered! Seller is extremely personable and just lovely to work with. Wish there were more products and sellers like this! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The good news is:  it&#x27;s 100% organic raw unrefined African shea butter.  The bad news is:  it&#x27;s 100% organic raw unrefined African shea butter.  Honestly, I&#x27;m very pleased that it is 100% organic, raw, and unrefined.  However, I guess since all other shea butter I have used was just one ingredient of many in one brand or another of shea butter, I was expecting it to smell differently than it did.  I found the smell a bit of a turn-off.  I could smell the package as it lay on my counter when I passed by, and it wasn&#x27;t the pleasant smell I expected.  However, I found that if I mixed a bit of it with a few drops of a scented oil I do like, the result was a wonderful combination of the scent I added and the shea butter odor I had come to love in other shea butter products I&#x27;d tried in the past.  As others have mentioned, it did not leave my skin feeling the least bit greasy, just smooth and moisturized.  And that smoothness and moisturization lasted for a number of hours.  Although I am not allergic to any nuts, I do have very sensitive skin.  In spite of that hypersensitivity to many things I apply topically, I had no bad reaction to this shea butter even after many days of daily use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Melted smoothly and worked well in my homemade deodorant recipe, smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li> I received this free for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I love this Shea butter! It is authentic, and perfect for whipping up into a nice body butter!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use it right away without whipping, you can take a hair dryer to a section for 10-15 seconds to soften it and just apply it to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great for eczema!</li>
            <li> Ohhh the magic of shea butter (:&lt;br /&gt;This will leave your skin silky smooth and smelling like heaven!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone compliments me on my soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also like using this on my lips after I exfoliate them and may make a lip scrub with it.&lt;br /&gt;I have natural, curly hair and this works great on my curls.&lt;br /&gt;So highly recommended for various uses, definitely a smart purchase that goes far!</li>
            <li> I really like the quality on this Shea Butter when I take it into my hands. Letting it warm up a bit, and then apply to skin - joy !&lt;br /&gt;Transferring the shea butter into a glass jar made it much easier to apply it after each shower. Thanks for great product.</li>
            <li> This product comes as a solid, sealed carefully in a 16oz bag.  It has a light, natural scent, which I would probably describe as earthy or nutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raw shea butter is a great natural product.  Beauty By Shea offers shea butter that is both unrefined and 100% organic, with absolutely nothing added - a must for a product I am putting on my skin!  About 10 years ago, I stopped putting anything on my skin that had artificial ingredients, chemicals, fragrances, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to coconut oil, shea butter is firm at most room temperatures, but melts in the heat.  If it becomes too soft or melts, you can simply put it in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour until solid again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to use this product by itself, you only need a little bit at a time.  I take a small amount, maybe the size of a dime and rub it on my skin - it will melt on your skin as it warms up.  It is very thick and moisturizing and a great product to put on right before bed - my favorite is to apply it to my feet before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As easy as it is to apply directly to the skin, you can use it for a variety of other purposes.  You can use it for your own homemade soaps, lotions, conditioners, and so on.  I was excited to make my own homemade body butter with a few simple ingredients!  There are lots of great recipes out there with various combinations of ingredients.  I melted 1/2 cup shea butter with 1/4 cup coconut oil, then mixed in 1/4 cup almond oil and some essential oil.  Put in the fridge or freezer to firm up (don&#x27;t let it get too hard), and then whip thoroughly with a hand mixer.  I save mine in a glass jar and it is great for after showering and before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a fantastic moisturizer and great for a wide variety of things, including dry skin, stretch marks, eczema, sunburns, and many other skin conditions - and I can even use it on the kids.  I use it for moisturizing after I take a shower and on my hands and feet before bed.  I know that I will continue using this every day especially during our long New England winters, when my skin gets so dry.  I love that it is all natural and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting chemicals on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Disclosure: a sample of this product was provided free of charge, however all opinions are my own.e using this every day especially during our long New England winters, when my skin gets so dry.

            <li> [[VIDEOID:67cfb0fd8039f98b700c376a1468fbbc]] Beauty By Shea&#x27;s Raw Organic Shea Butter comes double bagged with a resealable outer bag, and mine arrived sealed well. This Shea Butter is 100% pure, organic, grade A all natural, double filtered, and a nice ivory color, so you can use it directly on your skin, or you can blend it with other carriers like almond, coconut, jojoba and essential oils like I do to make lotions and creams for everything from acne treatment, eczema relief, sunburn relief, to anti-aging creams. I don&#x27;t see a production date, but it smells fresh and exactly like raw Shea should smell.  This is pure, all organic Shea Butter from Ghana, and it should last 12 - 18 months if resealed after use and stored in a cool dry place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unrefined Shea Butter is naturally rich in vitamins A, E, F, and fatty acids that make it super nourishing and moisturizing while not clogging pores. so I use it as the base for many of my home made skin creams and lotions. This is exactly the high quality of Shea Butter I want to use when making my dry skin repair creams for friends and family. Raw Shea Butter has an aroma that some people find mildly disagreeable, but it&#x27;s easy to make various skin care products with and you can alter the scent to your liking by adding some essential oils to your recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter is easy to work with and extremely versatile. You can melt it and pour it into tubes to make your own home made chap stick which will be much better for your lips than the stuff you find in stores.  You can use it to relax curly hair, to condition your hair, to restore dull hair, to heal dry cracked skin and about a zillion other things. Don&#x27;t feel overwhelmed though, there are plenty of free recipes on Pinterest and you also get a free eBook filled with recipes to help you get started after you purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter wanted some dry skin rescue cream for her dry cracked heels, so here&#x27;s the recipe I used in the video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup Coconut oil (not fractionated)&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup Jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup Beauty By Shea&#x27;s Raw Organic Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;4 drops Tamanu essential oil&lt;br /&gt;4 drops Bergamot essential oil&lt;br /&gt;4 drops Lavender essential oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Measure and place all ingredients into a mixing bowl, then blend using a hand mixer until lump free and a smooth velvety texture.

I just used Jojoba because it mimics the oils in our skin cells and absorbs easily, and selected the essential oils I did for their specific skin care benfits.  Feel free to use this recipe or play around with it to customize it for yourself however you like.  Once the consistancy was what I wanted I simply portioned it into two 4 ounce opaque plastic containers with an inner seal that I bought here on Amazon. It took all of about ten minutes to do and it would have cost about $30 to buy a similar product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look around at some of the best beauty products sometime and you&#x27;ll see Shea Butter in them, but too often they&#x27;ll have other ingredients that spoil everything like parabens or petroleum jelly.

            <li> My husband gave me a back rub with this Shea Butter and I never felt better.  My skin has been dry for so long and since he rubbed this butter on me my skin has been hydrated for over 5 days now.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product from the supplier for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used this type of product before, but after using it for about a week I&#x27;m hooked! A little goes a long way to the point that a couple of  pea sized amounts can cover both arms and legs. A very small amount makes my face feel soft a well nourished.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a nutty smell at first, but it goes away after a couple of minuts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use shea butter after my shower from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality shea butter. I use shea butter directly on my skin as a moisturizer and I also make homemade soaps and lotions with it. This shea butter is nice and creamy. It is soft and rubs into the skin very nicely. My skin is super soft when I use this on a regular basis. Although you can use this as-is right on your skin, I prefer to add an essential oil (like lavender or gardenia) to it to give it a nice fragrance. It&#x27;s easier to incorporate the essential oil if you first soften up the shea butter in the microwave. Don&#x27;t leave it in too long. You just want to microwave it enough to soften it up so you can stir it easily. It just takes seconds. I make small batches at a time and keep them in a small jar. The amount of essential oil to use depends on personal preference and you will have to experiment to get the fragrance you want.&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this shea butter is 100% organic.&lt;br /&gt;Sample product provided for review.</li>
            <li> Very nice goes on very smooth and evaporates into my skin very nicely highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This was amazing. Very smooth. It cam faster then the estimated ship date and was in a wrapped block inside a lined paper ziplock pouch. I have been using it on my elbows and they are almost healed. I cannot wait to use this to do some DIY beauty products.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found Shea Butter earlier in my life! It smells wonderful. You just need a little bit to add moisture to your hair, or to use as lotion. I have a back oil that I purchase from a massage place. It doesn&#x27;t even compare to this Shea Butter! My whole family loves it!</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, was packaged nicely, Shea butter was intact and correct amount as advertised. I used mine to make homemade body butter and it worked wonderfully! Very smooth and silly texture great for multiple uses!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  The quality is so pure and when applied, it feels so good on your skin.  We&#x27;ve used it as a base with essential oils to create our own deodorant and love how well it&#x27;s worked!  There are so many things that this can be used for as a base or carrier agent and we will definitely be ordering more when we run out (which may not be too long!).</li>
            <li> As a previous customer I was asked to test and rate this product.  I&#x27;ve only been using the shea butter for about a week and have been so impressed that I don&#x27;t need to wait any longer to let everyone know how much I like this product.  I have very dry skin and have been using this on my feet and hands nightly before bed - the difference in my skin is absolutely amazing!  A little dab rubbed in the palm of my hands goes a long way.  It actually has softened my skin so much that my pedicurist couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  There is no greasy side effects or smell associated with this and I would highly recommend this shea butter to anyone.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is great. Came in a very short time and was neatly packaged.  It feels wonderful and it&#x27;s something I can&lt;br /&gt;use for myself as well as my 2year old.  I would recommend this to my family and friends.  It&#x27;s great to be able to use&lt;br /&gt;a product without all the junk in it plus it gives moisture like no other.  Will be ordering again and again.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I fought my inclination to be cheap and spent an extra few bucks for this shea butter from this seller. This stuff is the real deal. No rancid smell, it isn&#x27;t bleached white, it isn&#x27;t weirdly soft. It smells divine, like fresh cashew butter and earth. It leaves your skin feeling soft but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I use shea for tons of useful things, like... To remove waterproof eye makeup. Smear it around, let it set a while, then wipe your makeup off. It totally melts the most hardcore waterproof mascara and eyeliner without stripping your skin, without being irritating, and with the added moisturizing benefit. The best.&lt;br /&gt;The most effective night cream in the universe.  Gently melt some, add a bit of aloe gel, whip til solid. Win.&lt;br /&gt;Burn salve. Half shea, half aloe, generous dashes of tea tree oil. Heals the burn, keeps the skin soft and pliable, and is antiseptic. No more painful scabs and it greatly accelerates healing. Miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;Melt and mix 50/50 with your favorite natural oil to make a spreadable lotion. Suck it, dry itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;Use it to make lip balm and perfume sticks; use it straight up on elbows and callouses, on rashy baby butts. Work into your hair for a deep conditioning treatment. It&#x27;s safe to use on and around pets. You can grease squeaky cage doors with it, and not be terrified the dumb little muffins will lick it and be poisoned.&lt;br /&gt;And so on, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Have fun and be happy with this ridiculously useful, beneficial substance.</li>
            <li> I have very dry elbows and knees.  I have a torn tendon in my left foot, and find it more comfortable to kneel than squat, especially when working in the garden, etc.  Because of this, my knees are taking a beating. Getting calloused, peeling skin - a real mess.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different moisturizers with varying success.  The thicker, the better. So when I was offered this to try out, I jumped at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Grade A, unrefined. That means it&#x27;s only been processed with water. No chemicals. This also means that all the vitamins and fats are still present.  Grade A is considered the best for skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter melts at skin temperature - slowly.  I can generate a nice amount of heat rubbing my hands together (my GF loves that foe her shoulders!). So I get some heat going, scoop out a dime sized portion, place it on my palms, and rub some more.  Melts almost instantly, leaving a nice, thick ointment. I then apply this to my knees and elbows - my trouble spots.  Obviously my hands also get a great treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a noticeable immediate improvement.  Within a couple of days - applied twice per day - the callouses on my knees are invisible and the skin has stopped peeling.  My elbows no longer feel like coarse sandpaper. My hands are smoother than most women I know! Since I work with my hands a lot, this is pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long this brick will last, but I&#x27;m guessing three or four months!  Definitely worth trying this out, especially for those trouble spots.</li>
            <li> A little about Beauty By Shea Organic Raw Shea Butter:&lt;br /&gt;It is unrefined Shea butter which is better for your skin. It hydrates and has healing &amp; soothing properties. (helps with cracked dry skin, sunburn, eczema,  psoriasis, chapped lips, elbows, heels, cuticles &amp; even insect bites)  Some say it&#x27;s anti-aging too, but I need to test it for a few weeks before I&#x27;ll agree with that claim. It&#x27;s loaded with antioxidants and vitamins A, E, F and K along with healthy fatty acids and  phytonutrients. Unrefined Shea butter is preferable to refined because refined shea oil is usually bleached, deodorized &amp; neutralized with lye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Beauty By Shea Organic Raw Shea Butter is unrefined it has a light nutty scent.  Although there is no use by date, when unrefined shea butter is stored in a cool place it has a shelf life up to 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty By Shea Butter can also be used for crafting &amp; is an important ingredient in homemade lotions, soaps, &amp; conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that a little goes a long way. Take a small amount, dime or nickle sized, &amp; let it melt in the palms of your hand. Then apply to your skin.  A nickle sized piece of Shea butter was enough for my face, hands, cuticles, d&amp;eacute;colletage, and arms with a little left for my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Shea butter is for crafting, topical or hair use only. It is imported as pure, organic Shea butter from Ghana &amp; is filtered  again in a USA lab &amp; formed into blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the lasting all natural moisture our family&#x27;s skin and hair are treated to with the 100% Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter from Beauty by Shea. As a strong supporter of organic, pure choices for our family, this shea butter is pure and a Fair Trade import product. Applying a small amount of shea butter and allowing the warmth of my hand to smooth the shea butter to penetrate into my skin gives a long lasting softness. Nourishing Vitamins A, E, F and K help to heal and protect skin naturally and with out harsh chemicals or ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lined package the contains the 1 lb. brick of shea butter is kept stored in our refrigerator, as explained in the included instructions. I used a small, resealable container for daily use and again, very little shea butter is needed. I am very pleased with the value of the amount of high-quality, pure, organic shea butter that we received for the purchase price. The light, natural fragrance is subtle and pleasant. I look forward to further research on different uses for shea butter in soaps, lotions and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received 100% Organic Raw Organic Unrefined African Shea Butter for the purpose of facilitating this review.</li>
            <li> Fast service, quality product, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make homemade body butter and it&#x27;s great! I used to get my shea butter from the Rasta shop a couple cities over and it was okay but the shea started smelling not as great as when I used to start buying from there years ago. I turned to Amazon but was worried because there were a lot of bad reviews for buying shea butter online. This seller got great reviews and this is going to be another one. The smell is genuine but not strong. It is EXACTLY what pure, unrefined ivory shea is supposed to smell like. It should NOT be rancid, too strong, unscented, or smell stale. It should be nutty and a little strong. This butter is just that. I&#x27;m definitely recommending this</li>
            <li> Great, natural product. Works well to make my own body butter. NOTE: Natural Shea does have a natural, raw odor, but not an unpleasant one. You will need a natural essential oil to add if you are making body butter and want it to smell like something store-bought. I used a lime essential oil because I love the scent, but be careful with citrus as it can increase effects of sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I read reviews by folks from several different shea products for sale that spoke of a smell. My conclusion was that the product would contain an odor, and it did. But, for me at least, it is not overwhelming, and it is not vile. I believe that this shea butter smells like shea butter is supposed to smell, and that in order to produce a product with no scent would mean over-processing it to the point where it has lost most, if not all, of the components that make it good for you. Therefore, I am more than delighted with the product that I have received and DEFINITELY intend to order more.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great results on my psoriasis! Love the little bonus tin.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced raw shea butter, but have always bought it with ingredients mixed in from a major company. I was thrilled to receive this organic butter and make recipes with it. The first thing I decided to do was order a bunch of first grade or grade A fragrance to make shea butter creams with as presents for my friends and family. I took a poll on fave scents and ordered a few from a wholesale supplier including almonds,vanilla ,lavender and other pleasant basic scents. Then, I ordered a couple of little plastic containers to mix the shea butter and scent and coconut oil in.  (I love natural oils best). It was easy to use, arrived in a timely manner and worked well with my ingredients. Top quality and organic, just like it should be. I highly recommend this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It is good but expensive.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is amazing. I used it to make body butter for Christmas gifts. It whipped up fine and easily. It had no strong scent, and feels wonderful. No grittiness at all. I love that it is filtered twice - once in Ghana and once when it reaches the states. That means it&#x27;s going to be a pure product for me to use. I love that it is a Fair Trade product as well.</li>
            <li> The fastest delivery thus far from Amazon.  My product came in great condition and the quality seems to be great compared to the yellow stuff I have purchased in the past.  Also they provided a small tin like container to carry your Shea butter in your purse.  I plan to temper my shea butter and add oils for my natural hair.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Will buy again. Great quality, propmt shipping.</li>
            <li> If you have dry and/or itchy, sensitive skin, you&#x27;ll love shea butter. Do your research and you&#x27;ll see that all homemade beauty recipes for these skin problems include shea butter. You don&#x27;t really need to mix or add anything else; chances are, it&#x27;ll solve your problem using it alone. It certainly stopped my dry, itchy skin. As winter approaches, I&#x27;ll be using it every day. Always buy organic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to make homemade body butter and the consistency is great and is going to mix up really well with Cocoa butter, etc. to make a soft all natural body butter. I also can&#x27;t complain about the price!</li>
            <li> I love that it is unrefined and organic and contains no chemical or toxic substances. Without these additives, I can use it on sunburn, bites, etc. Since it is not infused with water for fast evaporation, it takes a bit longer to be absorbed. It leaves the skin softer and showing a slight sheen. I experienced an earthy scent which goes away quickly. I use it for insect bites, dry skin, sunburn, shaving cream, and I am told by friends that it works on poison ivy or oak. I highly recommend this natural lotion to treat or help prevent skin problems. It has melted beautifully in my hand and goes on smooth as I apply it. I will keep in my fridge for long lasting.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family has dry skin. My son has Eczema. This Shea Butter will help his crusty skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just right soften like play doh. Easy to apply on skin.  Moisture rich but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My little girl has very dry hair. I am going melt this Sea Butter and mix with hair styling lotion and use as hair moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product! and thank you for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my dry and sensitive diabetic skin. I tend to get rashes on my skin and it gets very dry and sensitive. It seems like my skin always gets irritated specially during the summer because there is little to no humidity out here in Texas! After days of using 100% Organic Raw Unrefined African Shea Butter by Beauty by Shea, I started feeling a bit of relief. There are so many DIY products that you can do using this ingredient(and I intend to do quite a few) but when I first got the product, I used it in all its \\&quot;raw glory\\&quot;! I would get a bit of the product (a little goes a long way) and use it all over my body before I showered or took a bubble bath. I let is seep through my skin for about 10 to 20 minutes then jump in the shower. It acts like a protective barrier that my sensitive skin badly needs! My skin has been feeling soft, rejuvenated and for the first time in forever, it doesn&#x27;t itch due to sensitivity! I don&#x27;t have enough great words to say about this product - I absolutely LOVE it! After my initial experiment with this product, I intend to use it to make body lotion, lip balm, hand cream, etc! I am very picky when it comes to products I use on my skin because of it&#x27;s sensitivity and I am so ecstatic that I found something that I can use that truly works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIsclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.

            <li> I am a huge fan of products that contain Shea Butter. When I was contacted by the company for a review, I jumped on the offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea Butter comes in simple boron bag. Inside the bag was a block of She Butter wrapped in a zipped bag. I have not used regular She Butter before so this was new. I decided to apply it directly to my face as it gets really dry. As per instructions I took a small amount rubbed it in my hand and applied to my face. For a small amount, it was enough for my face, as well as two babies and I still had some leftover. I only took a pea sized amount. This is great because next time when I use it, I will not only use less, but I know it will last along time. After about an hour I noticed my face feeling softer. I do not have the best skin and this really made a difference. I have researched many recipes on how to use Shea Butter and plan on adding it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this is a well worthwhile product. I not only noticed a difference on my face, but it is something affordable that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter. great value and great shipping amd product.</li>
            <li> I am addicted!! I mix with Lavender essence and sweet almond oil. When I take a hot bath I put it on my legs and enjoy the best shave ever... silky smooth legs with no dry skin in sight!!</li>
            <li> Disclosure - free sample provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used lotions and other products that contain Shae Butter and have always been impressed with them.  However, I did not know that you can purchase 100% Organic Raw Shae Butter.  I was shocked at how many uses there are for this product.  It can be used to soften your skin and hair.  This product comes directly from Ghana.  It is completely pure and natural.  I started using a small amount of this on my skin instead of lotion after the shower.  I also use a tiny bit on my hair and it makes it super shiny.  Pure Shae Butter is used differently than lotion though.  You need to put a small amount of the product in your hands and rub them together.  The warmth of your hands will then melt the product.  It is then easy to apply to wherever you want to use it.  I have found that it is super moisturizing.  I really like it for dry hands, feet, knees, elbows, and my daughter&#x27;s dry eczema patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100% Organic Raw Shae Butter retails for $10 on Amazon.  It comes in a decent sized 1lb. brick.  The Shae Butter comes in a plastic zip pouch, and then is in another zip pouch.  This makes it easy to store.  The raw Shae Butter has so many wonderful uses.  What would you use it on?  It is not only extra moisturizing, but it almost created a barrier on my skin that held in the moisture.  This Shae Butter is rich in Vitamins.  It contains Vitamins A, E, F, and K.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and will last for a long time!Packaging is also great. I received a small container with this product that I didn&#x27;t know I would receive big plus</li>
            <li> Nice smooth texture and smell. Package nicely! This product was not grainy like other shea butters that I&#x27;ve purchased. It mixed well with my oils and maintain that nice nutty smell. I will stick with this seller and hope the quality of the product remains.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. When I look around my house, I was amazed to all the products that have Shea Butter in them. From cosmetics to soap. I love being able to use this raw Shea butter because it has a great effect on the skin. This product comes nicely packaged and ready to use. I found that within seconds the butter heats when rubbed in your hands and is ready to be applied. I found no flaws in the Shea Butter, it was very smoothed and nicely processed.  I was provided this sample for review and would recommend it to everyone. I know this is now on my list of must have products.</li>
            <li> If you like to make body butter, or homemade body lotion, this shea butter is perfect.  I had never made body butter before.  But, I used this product for my first try, and it was so easy to do.  Be sure to keep it cool, if you live in hot climates like me.  If you don&#x27;t it gets all runny.  It feels wonderful on your feet, hands, and I love it on my hair.  You only need a tiny bit, so it will last forever too.  I wasn&#x27;t brave enough to add food coloring to it, I had fears of having blue skin forever.  However, I did add a little scent to it, to make it smell a little more feminine.  For disclaimer purposes, I was offered this product to test, and then do a review.  My opinions are completely mine, and honest.</li>
            <li> I am one of those who have realized the importance of removing chemicals from our foods and our environment, this includes in personal care products so I no longer buy commercially made \\&quot;creams\\&quot; or \\&quot;lotions\\&quot;. Supplied for reviewing purposes, I am VERY satisfied with the 100% organic raw shea butter. I gently softened some shea butter along with some coconut oil and blended in a couple drops of very high quality essential oil. I now have my own creamy blend to moisturize my skin.  I love this moisturizing blend as it leaves my skin silky smooth! Several old scars have reduced in a short time, I found adding some alpha lipoic acid powder to the blend seemed to further speed up the healing process. I am very satisfied and will look for this listing when I need more healthy shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those with nut allergies: Please use with caution, shea butter comes from the nut of the shea tree.</li>
            <li> I’ve never used “straight” Shea Butter before. I have used many products that contained Shea Butter, especially for stretch marks for pregnancy. I am on the verge of having my second child and I though now would be the perfect time to try Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn’t call the fragrance pleasant… It kind of reminds me of white chocolate, but not so sweet. I was also surprised at how much trouble I had getting the Shea Butter to melt. It’s not that it’s difficult, it just takes a while. I was surprised at how long I had to rub it in my warm hands to get it melt to a usable liquid. It was also a little stickier than I imagined, although the stickiness goes away quickly. I do end up using soap to wash my hands after applying it to my belly area.&lt;br /&gt;While it’s hard to really know if something is helping with stretch marks, this seems to be doing a good job. It leaves my skin feeling soft. It also leaves a very pretty shine behind, so if you aren’t pregnant and just want to lovely glow to your skin, this would be a good product to try.&lt;br /&gt;Sample received for review.</li>
            <li> I was given this to try out for free for a review. I LOVE THIS STUFF!! We use it on anything we can think of since it is an awesome moisturizer! I mainly use if for my dry lips. My hubs works outside on his feet all day &amp; has started to get calluses. I use this on him at night for a foot massage &amp; it has really made a difference! Another great use I discovered (unfortunately) recently is that it’s great for sunburns! We spent the weekend at Daytona Beach &amp; no matter how much or how high of a SPF we used we STILL ended up burnt! My niece was with us &amp; had it the worst so I gave her some to try out first. She sent me a message after we all returned home saying that she needs to get some Shea Butter since it worked so amazingly.</li>
            <li> I am a Shea butter fanatic, and this is my new go-to! 100% raw organic? At this price?! Are you kidding? And 1 pound of it?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for all the rhetorical questions, but seriously, this is such a deal I can hardly believe my eyes. Of course, if you&#x27;ve never used raw shea butter before, you might wonder why I get so excited about it. In summary, shea is a pretty wonderful, all-natural way to moisturize your skin without having to put all these crazy chemicals on yourself. And that&#x27;s also why 100% raw is important. If you have some shea lotion in your home (and the odds are that you do), read the ingredient list. The bottle will likely tout the percentage of shea right on the front as being the most important ingredient (15% if its a good product), yet most of the bottle will be filled with chemicals...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this 100% raw shea, you can easily go all natural with your skin care, which is great for you and great for the environment too!</li>
            <li> It arrived right on time and feels great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product but the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell.</li>
            <li> First time buying raw shea butter. I took quite awhile to decide what company I was going to buy from, and I&#x27;m glad I found Beauty By Shea, thier shea butter is everything they say it is, and a beautiful ivory color. Definitely will be buying from this company again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product. All three of my kids suffer from severe atopic dermatitis against which topical steroids have proven useless. This natural Shea butter has not, by any means, gotten rid of their severe eczema. It has, however, improved  the overall condition and appearance of their skin more so than any other product we&#x27;ve tried. This includes varying strengths of topical steroids, and very expensive barrier creams from the dermatologist. I&#x27;m sorry to have not taken before and after pictures. Also, the product packaging was excellent as was seller communication and feedback. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This shea butter by beauty by Shea is a great high quality product.  This Shea butter comes in a 1lb brick of Shea butter double wrapped in a plastic bag inside the seal-able packaging it came in.  Included inside the package was the Shea butter, and a small twist-able metal tin and a business card.  My Shea butter was softened from the heat during delivery,  However it does not affect the Shea butter one bit.  I&#x27;m just going to soften it myself to make several items.  I did however place it in the fridge for about 30-45 min to harden it back up.  Which it did, I could easily reshape it back into a brick style however I just left it alone.  Shea butter is a wonderful ingredient for many uses,  I use it personally to battle dry skin, cracked heels, balms, lotions, creams, and lip balm.  This Shea butter did not disappoint!  This is very high quality raw and unrefined shea butter,  I had no issues melting this, and adding other ingredients to it.  It blends nicely with all carrier oils, beeswax, and essential oils.  I have noticed a huge difference with this butter as it seems to work well into my skin and blends much easier than all other shea butters I have ever owned.  What I love best about Beauty by Shea is she provided an actual tin to store your creations in.  That is a very thoughtful jester.  She also included a business card that includes a FREE ebook filled with 30 recipes that you can use Shea butter for.  My favorite was the hair mask I have never thought about using Shea butter for the hair.  Thanks beauty by Shea!  Great recipe!&lt;br /&gt;This is an ivory color Shea butter which means it has been Boiled for a longer period of time mellowing out color to more milder light, its lightened color to allow absorbing into the skin faster with extra fluff. it Does not change the color of the skin and has a pleasant nutty smell that is more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;All shea butter is full of Vitamin E and Vitamin A which are great for the skin!  This is why you find these 2 vitamins in so many beauty products however they are spoiled with all chemicals that they put in them.  So its best just to buy directly and apply straight to your skin.  Shea butter can be used directly to the skin by getting a small piece and rubbing it into your skin.  It works fantastic like this and the nutty smell that it has it absorbs into your skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave the aroma on you!&lt;br /&gt;I received the Shea butter by Beauty by Shea at no cost for product testing and reviewing purposes.  My opinion on her products are honest and unbiased.  Thank you Beauty by Shea you have an amazing product.  My skin and my hair thank you also.so many beauty products however they are spoiled with all chemicals that they put in them.  So its best just to buy directly and apply straight to your skin.

            <li> My first experience with shea butter was not all that long ago, and I was so baffled by the hardness of it.  The guy who had made it, I guess thought I was an idiot and had no clue about anything because I was informed &amp;#34;It&#x27;s supposed to be hard&amp;#34;.  So, once I realized that it was in fact the way that it was &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be, I enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super thrilled to get some of my very own 100% raw and unrefined shea butter.  When I first received it, it was a little squishy, I mean I live in Alabama, so this humdity can melt even the hardest of substances.  However, I kept it in my room which is the coldest part of the house and it didn&#x27;t take long for it to &amp;#34;refirm&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this is like a Godsend!  I used to have such soft and smooth skin, however, as I&#x27;ve aged my skin has decided to develop into a dry mess.  I no longer have smooth and soft skin, so I need a product like shea butter, that will seep into my pores and help to eliminate those dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to use mine after a nice warm bath and well dryed off.  I find that my skin is more supple to the products that I use and as we all know, sometimes water has a tendency to bring out the dryness in ANYTHING.  I&#x27;m so happy, I really want to eventually experiment with some oils to get a &amp;#34;scented butter&amp;#34;.  If you&#x27;ve never tried 100% authentic shea butter and you get it and your confused by the texture, please know THAT&#x27;s A GOOD THING.  You will find that it doesn&#x27;t take long AT ALL to melt into your pores giving you really smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  The thoughts and opinions expressed in this review are my OWN and were no way swayed by my decision.</li>
            <li> This unrefined shea butter is a quality ingredient you can use to make your own personal care and beauty products. I like that it is organic and fair trade. I also like the simple, functional  packaging. Basically, the shea butter is inside a ziplock-style bag which is inside a small brown paper bag. It is easy to get into and out of which is great for this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter is an effective natural moisturizer--which is why it is a common ingredient in many quality beauty products. I intend to make my own natural body butter, but so far have just used it neat. My feet are rather rough from months of sandal wearing and going barefoot. One simple solution: Before bedtime, I rub a little shea butter on my feet then put on a pair of cotton socks. In the morning, the skin on my feet and heels are much softer.  I also tend to get dry knees and elbows and chapped lips this time of year. The shea butter has helped with that also. I only apply a small amount and let it soften from the warmth of my skin before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used unrefined Shea Butter, I should mention it is a little different in texture than you might expect. I have used some high quality commercial body lotions containing Shea and thought I knew the texture. It is a little sticky at first, but quickly absorbs into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter is extracted from nuts seed (African Karite tree) so please don&#x27;t use if you are allergic to nuts. If you are planning to use this to make gifts, please consider whether your prospective recipients have nut allergies. Also, even though it is rich in vitamins A and E, it is only for external use. The nutty smell is tempting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a 8 ounce bag of this product for a fair and honest review. I like natural skin care products and noticed that some of my favorite products contain Shea Butter so I am excited to use the real, unrefined stuff.</li>
            <li> Wonderful creamy texture and great addition to my lotion bars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the raw Shea Butter from this company a few times before and I didn&#x27;t have any issues. The product lasts for months, so I just finished up my past block a few days ago. I opened the newer pack this morning, excited as usual! I applied the butter to my skin and I noticed it had an odd smell. It did not smell like the previous blocks of shea butter. I applied it all over my body but the odd smell did not go away. I even asked my suster to try it and she confirmed that it smell different. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or what... I guess I&#x27;ll buy a new package in a few days because it&#x27;s actually a good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Smooth and creamy. Beauty by Shea has my future purchases of Shea Butter. Thanks..</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this product. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works awesome as it is pure UNrefined.  Only complaint is it comes in zip lock bag and that is pretty messy especially when you get down to last bit.</li>
            <li> As an avid shea butter user for more than 2 decades, this is a seller I have no problem purchasing from again and again!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth! Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 4 different Shea Butters and this is my favorite thus far. I will be ordering this one over and over. It&#x27;s smoother and smells better than the other 3 I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> To start with,  super gold stars for a delivery that came days before posted arrival. Then, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect having never used a shea butter before.  The package contained the butter in a plastic baggie and it looks similar to a big block of clay. If you never used this just follow the enclosed directions and you&#x27;ll do fine.  It melts in your hand very quickly and a little definitely goes a long way.  You can even thin it out a bit by wetting your hands prior to using.  Make sure you use warm water to help it melt even faster.  Shea butter is just that, butter. So expect it to feel oily.  Use very small amounts and rub it in well.  Interestingly, it did not make my clothes &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;.  Now for the skin test. I live in the desert. No humidity and hot temperatures. While the rest of the U.S. seems to be digging out of the ice, we have 90°. My skin is always dry. Some areas are worse than others. My hands were so dry that the skin at the knuckles cracked and bled and literally my hands felt like sandpaper, and my feet...really thick sandpaper.  So, day #1,  I rubbed in the butter twice. The skin on my legs and arms responded immediately. Day #2 My hands are 80% better and my feet are too. It takes a little effort to use shea butter but it is worth it.  I will update this after 1 week.  Oh, one thing. If you have long fingernails as I do you might want to use something like a popsicle stick for scooping. :)  Honestly, as it is right now, I will definitly be buying this in the future.  As a previous customer, to have had this African Shea Butter  provided to me for review was so timely. Thank you.  Couldn&#x27;t wait a whole week. After 2 days of use we went camping and I left the butter home. After 3 days of not using the butter my elbows still remained soft.  My feet are still healing and my hands as well. All I can say is you cannot go wrong if you try this.  It&#x27;s been about 6 weeks since I started using Shea Butter and I hadn&#x27;t had a dry skin day since.That&#x27;s saying a whole lot since my skinwas beginning to feel like tree bark and my feet are no long cracking and peeling.    Going to tey it on my hair next.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shea butter! It works great for mixing my own body butter and it is silky smooth on my skin. Great product!</li>
            <li> I received my organic raw unrefined African shea butter before the scheduled delivery date. When I opened the box I found a 2 ounce tin that wasn&#x27;t included in the order, but perfect for holding some of the lotion I make with this product for travel or in my purse! It was a great surprise because it&#x27;s just not very often that you get extras these days! Upon further research of the supplying company, Beauty by Shea, I found that they have teamed up with a supplier of this product that pays the tribal women directly for making the butter, this has made me a forever customer! I like knowing that the ingredients I use to make my products are obtained fairly.  The shea butter was perfect, exactly what it said it was going to be. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone on the market for shea butter!</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it as the main ingredient for my body butter.</li>
            <li> The consistency was great but it had a very strong odor, even after I added EOs. Not sure how I feel about this as this is my first time purchasing Shea Butter... is this normal?</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TYPE FROM AMAZON? IT WAS SO SOFT AND FRESH... HIGHLY RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM AMAZON?</li>
            <li> As a previous customer I was delighted to be given this product to review. I have worked with Shea butters before and enjoy using them to create my own creams and lotions. I liked the fact that this Shea butter is organic, better for me and better for the environment. This particular Shea butter was a lighter creamier color than others I have used in the past which tended to be a darker yellow. The shea butter was a nice light creamy color and blended well with my other ingredients creating some beautiful creams and lotions! It has a nice light nutty aroma that I found blended well with most of the aroma oils I added! I am very excited to be able to give the final products as gifts, or just save them for my own use! I would recommend this shea butter</li>
            <li> My skin is really dry, to the point that lotions absorb quickly and tend to do nothing for me but leave me with eczema all over my skin. The seller offered me this item to review, and I&#x27;m really glad I agreed! Shea butter works amazingly for me - I happen to shower at night, so I use it before bed and have no problems with tackiness in the morning. The butter does leave a thicker layer at first, so clothing will catch a little if out on immediately after application. It spreads easily enough; I just keep smoothing it over my skin with my hands, no heat necessary. So far I&#x27;ve used it all over my body, and my rough patches (upper arms and back, from getting irritated by rougher material in clothing) have smoothed right up. I&#x27;m definitely planning on purchasing more as I run out!</li>
            <li> great quality shea butter. Already purchased a second order to make into Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> great stuff.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Premium quality. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Beauty by Shea is great product. I am in love... Shea butter is wow.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried raw shea butter, I suggest you do so now. This has been a godsend for the escema on my hands. It looks and feels almost completely solid, however, just take a small portion and rub it on your palms and the heat of your body warms it up and melts it. It saturates the area upon which it is applied with moisture and really cures those pesky dry spots. If you want to try different scents, mixing it up with some essential oils can do just the trick. I&#x27;ve heard of people using their kitchen mixer for this, but there are mixers made for this purpose (personally, i wouldn&#x27;t do it in quantities high enough to justify the purchase of the equipment). I&#x27;m really happy about the value you get in this product - this is enough to last you for a very long time. I did receive this promotionally for review, but I&#x27;m really happy with it and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The best shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased yet.</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema on my hands, arms, and occasionally, my face. I have tried many, MANY lotions, creams, ointments, you name it, but none of them really made a huge difference in my skin. I heard from some friends that pure shea butter might do the trick, so I was excited to try it for myself. Beauty By Shea&#x27;s wonderful product arrived, and following the directions, I scooped off a small amount and warmed it between my hands to soften before applying to my affected areas. My skin just drank the moisture in, and I was amazed! I love that it&#x27;s just straight-up shea butter, with no weird chemicals or additives. The smell does take some getting used to, as it is not scented other than the natural-- but that&#x27;s a plus because I am sensitive to perfumes in my skincare. If so inclined, this can be turned into your own homemade body butters, scented with essential oils if you wish. I can just imagine when it gets colder and my skin gets dry and itchy, that I&#x27;ll have something on hand to fix it right up!</li>
            <li> This is the purest, cleanest, most nourishing shea butter I have EVER purchased. My son has a skin condition &amp; he got instant relief. I use it on my dreads &amp; it&#x27;s just perfect! The owner of the company even sent a &amp;#34;thank you for your purchase&amp;#34; email. Give it a try &amp; you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Raw Shea Butter. I will celebrate my 60th birthday soon and was excited to try it&#x27;s vitamin rich moisturizing properties on my aging skin. My skin has gotten pretty dry and my hands would literally hurt after washing if I didn&#x27;t apply some type of moisturizer. Most other lotions and creams I tried did not help my hands or last long enough.  I started by using the Raw Shea Butter as a night cream. I love the way I wake up with soft, smooth, more youthful looking skin! I also put it on my hands before bed and after showering in the morning. My hands feel SO much better! The moisture lasts through a couple of washings. In the day time I like to apply a small amount to my crow&#x27;s feet and aging skin on my neck. I love the more youthful appearance that lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Some people have commented that the product is too sticky. They probably used too much. I just rub a little into my palm and apply it sparingly. I did make the mistake of putting too much in my hair as an after washing moisturizer. My hair looked like I had put oil in it. I will have to try experimenting with a smaller amount on my fine, dry, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Since this was my first use, the natural smell took some getting used to, but it is not unpleasant. Lastly, I love that this is a raw, organic product. A lot of the skin products on the market contain all kinds of chemicals that users are absorbing into their bodies. This natural, vitamin rich product is so much healthier to use!!&lt;br /&gt;As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin loves it. This brand of Shea butter didn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I received my shea butter today. Like others have stated it does have a weird scent kinda like a greasey smell but it doesnt linger so it doesnt bother me too much. I made a lotion with it which came out perfect! Overall im happy with my purchase i would just buy scented oils to give my lotion a good scent. Would definitely recommend. It was also the cheapest price i found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other organic unrefined Shea butter and this does not appear as such. This is more white and less nutty in its smell. I&#x27;m questioning whether it&#x27;s the real stuff. I wanted it for my newborn&#x27;s skin but an scared to use it now. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My Shea Butter arrived on time in a small box w/sufficient packaging. Product was sealed in airtight Mylar pkg. w/oxygen absorber. Mylar Exterior: craft-style brown bag w/pretty pink label. The Shea Butter bar was inside a sealed zip-lock bag, smelled wonderful/fresh, was creamy (not gritty), weighed 1.025 lbs. &amp; was a creamy-white color. Seller thoughtfully included a new 2 oz. tin. I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li> excellent product.  works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this as a happy customer of another product by this company, in order to review it.  I&#x27;ve waited several months to post because I wanted to actually get a chance to try it long term.  I have nothing but great things to say.  Works so well to soothe, moisturize and soften skin.  Simple, no-fuss packaging. Light, pleasant scent.  Very effective. I use it on dry skin anywhere and on my pregnant belly to soothe stretch marks.  I use it on my eczema-prone kids too with no reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion would be an option of an add-on small jar that would enable easier transport and use of small amounts of the product- this comes in a big block which is economical but less practical when it comes to using in a family or while traveling.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described and is excellent! I have only used it a few times as it is and I am very impressed. I cant wait to make my own lotion with this awesome Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and it was well packaged. The product came in the tan bag and sealed again inside the bag. If you are looking to make a creamy  perfume with essential oils... this is perfect!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful Shea butter. I&#x27;ve been using it in my lip balm recipes. I&#x27;ve heated it up over low heat and melted it in with the other ingredients, and there hasn&#x27;t been any of the grittiness that some Shea butter causes. I&#x27;ve also used it as a moisturizer, and it works great for that too. Just warm it up between your palms and apply. Love it!</li>
            <li> I live in the cold, dry Midwest, so am always looking for a good moisturizer, especially for my hands and feet. I absolutely love this product for my dry, cracked heels. Sometimes I mix it with a dab of my lavender lotion or oil to add a scent - great stuff! My husband also is a fan- he is a bit of a backyard farmer and says it helps his skin on his hands rehydrate and become smooth again.  The Shea butter goes a long way- don&#x27;t need much for each application.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and would recommend it to anyone- I did receive it promotionally for review and it gets a thumbs up from me!</li>
            <li> This shea butter worked so well in my lotion bars, but next time I might go with the refined because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Great packaging. The weight was correct.  Shipped fast and it is smooth and lovely.</li>
            <li> I love this raw Shea butter!!  I use it for my beauty recipes!!</li>
            <li> Love Shea butter. Rub in fingers to soften</li>
            <li> This was my second time purchasing this item, but the quality was different from the first time. This shea butter was much dirtier than the first pound. I know that it&#x27;s supposed to be natural so some dirt may be present, but it was far more than expected. I have to filter this butter again before it can be used on my skin. The description states that it was already double filtered but apparently that still wasn&#x27;t enough. Because the quality of the butter changed so dramatically between this time and the last time I ordered it, I will be looking for another place to purchase my shea butter. I need consistent quality with my orders. Also, it came in a brown bag last time, but this time it came in a white bag like the one pictured. Overall, it&#x27;s not horrible but I wish I didn&#x27;t have to filter it myself.</li>
            <li> Almost odorless.  Great to use when making lotions!</li>
            <li> I was worried my order of Shea butter would melt, since I live in Florida.  The packaging was smart and simple...Shea butter intact and smelled wonderful. I just used some for homemade deodorant. It also came with a small tin as promised...which has inspired me to make a lip balm.🐝🐝🐝</li>
            <li> Love it! I love how it is packaged in the reusable bag. I love the product itself and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I&#x27;ve used this to make several salves and lotions and I will never go back to commercial lotions. I can make my own products knowing what is in them and make them to fit my needs with the addition of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I Need to buy more! 😊</li>
            <li> This shea butter is AWESOME. The texture is so soft and velvety. I used it to make a whipped body butter. LOVE IT! Will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Love my Shea Butter! So rich and moisturizing! Love it for my hair and body!</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t research enough to figure out that this has a very strong smoky smell. I couldn&#x27;t use it, wish that would have been made more clear by the seller.</li>
            <li> Loved this Shea butter! I used it to melt down with cocoa butter and some essential oils to make solid lotions as Christmas gifts for my family and the consistency was lovely. The smell was hardly there so it mixed well with the other scents and it was smooth with no imperfections</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this shea butter.  It came in a plastic wrap which, in turn, was nicely packaged in a waterproof, airtight and resealable bag.  It also had a free tin so you can put a few ounces of the butter in it and leave the rest in the bag.  As for the product itself:  I found the butter felt dry and flaky at first and thought I got a bad one.  But after some advice here and trying it myself, I found that it just needed to get warm in my palm for a while.  Then it feels very soft and silky like it should.  It smells nice too, kinda nutty and buttery.  I use this on my skin and my kids too.  So far no adverse reactions.  It feels so good.  \If you are looking for an all-natural moisturizer, get this one.  It is a huge chunk you get too, and it should last a while.</li>
            <li> I order a lot of shea butter.  This one smelled funny compared to all the others.  Extremely potent odor.  Consistency was fine, but there was definitely something off about this one.</li>
            <li> My first great surprise after ordering shea butter from Healthy Life Essentials was that shipping and arrival of the package were speedier than anything else I have ordered on Amazon ... and that is even though I am used to getting very prompt service, and even though this package was sent from New York State to Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second surprise was the super-speedy effectiveness of the shea butter on my skin.  My hands had recently been getting quite rough and literally one use of the shea butter made a huge difference.  In addition, with many hand lotions I have tried, I need to re-apply each time I wash my hands.  However with this shea butter, my skin still feels soft and smooth after multiple hand-washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third surprise was that after one application of the shea butter to my hair shortly before shampooing, the effects of my high-quality vegan hair products were immediately enhanced.  My curly hair gets very tangled overnight and is often dry and almost impossible to comb when I awake.  However, after one use of this shea butter, my hair was noticeably softer, more moisturized, and more manageable the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eat only vegan food, use only vegan personal care products, and am concerned about the health and environmental effects of the additives in many commercial products, even those touted as \\&quot;natural\\&quot;.  I am very appreciative that the shea butter sold by Healthy Life Essentials is 100% organic, raw, unrefined, Grade A premium.  The fact that it is a Fair Trade product increases its appeal for me.  Although this shea butter is meant only for external use, it has a very pleasing natural aroma that makes it seem almost good enough to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an additional personal reason that I appreciate this particular shea butter.  I have great memories of living in Accra -- the capital of Ghana -- when I was 9½ to 10½ years old.  I attended a fabulous school, where I met not only Ghanaian kids, but kids from many other nations.  I frequently enjoyed the opportunity to use body surfboards at Labadi Beach.  It feels really good to know that my purchase is contributing to supporting Fair Trade business in Ghana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am currently using the shea butter straight, as received, it can be a great base for many wonderful do-it-yourself personal pampering products, for which free information and recipes can be found online.  There are formulations for a variety of moisturizers (for both skin and hair), salves and lotions, soaps and shampoos, and preparations for specific conditions such as acne, eczema, stretch marks, sunburn, and wrinkles.  And of course, it is not too soon to start gathering supplies and information to create wonderful holiday gifts for loved ones.  Hmmm, that gives me some ideas :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Communication and service were excellent, and I obviously am very happy with the shea butter.  I highly recommend Healthy Life Essentials and this product, which I will continue to enjoy using.  I have found that a little of this wonderful shea butter goes a long way, so I may not need more very soon.  However, I do look forward to re-ordering it from Healthy Life Essentials in the future.</li>
            <li> This is super shea butter!  I have used a few other types of shea butter and this is by far the smoothest, softest, and purest.  You really feel like you are doing something great for your skin.  I make lip balm, deodorant, and sunscreen for my dog&#x27;s nose.  It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Is as described, I&#x27;m happy with it and will order again as needed.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said that it stank. It doesn&#x27;t stink to me. It has an oder but to call the smell unappealing is kind of mean. Now, what amazed me about this stuff is how easy it melts in your hand. Those who wrote that it&#x27;s easy to warm weren&#x27;t kidding. to be on the cleaner side while handling the butter I used a cold spoon to scoop out a portion into a smaller bag and set the bag in hot water so that I can blend the melted mixture with other oils for my scalp.  As soon as I can think of other ways for me to use this stuff I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next attempt will be with a conditioner blended in butter form to see if it will help with that hair itself. I&#x27;m looking forward to that one.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair and it works nicely. I mix it with avocado oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is exactly what it says it is, pure raw Shea butter. I used it to make a simple lotion for my sensitive skin, by whipping it with 1.5 tbsp of olive oil, and storing it in an upcycled tostitos salsa jar. Smells a little bit like clay, and you have to melt it between your fingers before applying. But my skin looks great, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now everyday after washing my face, and as a lip balm it lasts a lot longer than chap stick (I tend to chew my lips) and creates plenty of moisture for your lips! Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife started using essential oils towards the beginning of the year, and originally she was mixing oils with coconut oil for lotions. The coconut oil was really not a great solution. She started using this shea butter and it works great. It&#x27;s a good consistency for a lotion and easy to mix. I definitely recommend it &amp;#34;As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Organic Shea Butter. When it comes to shea butter it is important that it is white and smooth texture and this one is exactly that. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea butter, I&#x27;ve purchased. Very soft and easy to blend with other oils. I highly recommended it. It&#x27;s worth the price. the fact that it&#x27;s Organic make this a great product. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product.  I use it on cracking fingers this bitter cold midwestern winter.  My wife mixed in lavender essential oil and uses it like lotion.  The butter itself has a good texture and is absolutely free of any impurities.  Love the fact that it&#x27;s organic!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1H6S5VKW7IH31]]Shea butter has always been one of those ingredients people rave about when it&#x27;s found in lotions.  It has many uses, but soothing the skin is one of the more familiar ones to me.  I do love shea butter and my husband used it all last winter to prevent heavy cracking in his heels.  During the winter when dry, cracked skin sets in this Beauty by Shea African shea butter will be a welcome addition once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter has an earthy, slightly wood stove-like scent that is quite appealing.  It&#x27;s a totally natural scent that indicates to me that I&#x27;m not dealing with numerous additives.  It can soften in shipment, but in the summer months I&#x27;d go for fast shipping.  I do love creature comforts and I opened the bag and slathered up.  Shea butter is one of those feel good types of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter actually has a buttery look to it.  It only takes a little bit to saturate one&#x27;s hands so a one pound brick will last a long, long time.  I do like the fact that the Beauty by Shea butter is 100% raw and unrefined, something that is highly desirable.  In this house shea butter has alleviated that cracked skin, but other uses abound.  Some people use it for diaper rash, eczema, and of course many are using in on their less-than-lustrous hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used lotions with some Shea butter in them and loved them, but once I tried the unrefined I was hooked.  The Beauty by Shea butter has eco-friendly, minimalist packaging.  There&#x27;s no expiration date, but either keep it in a cool dark place (fridge is good) and it should last up to two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This product is great! The consistency was very soft, and the color was an ivory white. It looked as if it had been taken right from the Shea nut. In fact, it was amongst one of the softest and best quality of shea butter that I have ever received. And, the offer to receive 1 OZ free was excellent! And, I received the product in less than a week Wow! No kidding. I have never seen this happen, and I have been ordering Shea butter for years. This is an excellent product. And, I would definitely purchase it.</li>
            <li> Bomb!! This was such amazing quality Raw Shea! I was so impressed. Packaging was super Eco friendly as well. Not to mention that the seller was having a great sale so I got a pound for about $10.00. I&#x27;m gonna order more right now! Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I love using shea butter, it has so many uses, and treats so many things! It is truly a universal product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter is an essential part of my daily routine. I use it in the shower, after the shower, at night on my hair, any place on my body that is dry, and I even add it in to my body scrubs and lip scrubs. Being that this is organic, raw, and unrefined, I find that the natural health benefits from it are by far better than any store bought product that may contain shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some examples of how I use this.&lt;br /&gt;-Lip Scrubs. When I am making a natural lip scrub I take sugar, honey, and shea butter. Leaves my lips exfoliate, clean, and super moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;-Hair Mask. I take some of this, and mix it in with a little bit of olive oil, and place it on my hair. I let it sit there for at least a half hour, and sometimes I will even let it sit on overnight. Wash out in the morning, and hello gorgeous soft, shiny hair!&lt;br /&gt;-After Shower. When I get out of the shower, I immediately grab this shea butter, and put it on all over my skin. Locks in the moisture, and leaves my skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount you get is sure to last you quite a long time. Shea Butter doesn&#x27;t really have an expiration date, and it remains in even better stature if you place it in the fridge after opening. Therefore the value of shea butter from Beauty By Shea is outstanding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shea butter, and use it quite often. 5 stars from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this so much! I have always had sensitive skin where i get like little &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; everywhere, i use this on my body and face after every shower and my skin gets super soft and looks so much healthier!&lt;br /&gt;the best thing to do is to take a little piece and let it melt in your palms before you apply it.. works wonders</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Great on its own but wonderful for making lip balm and deoderant!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is very unusual,  nothing but shea butter!  It takes such a small amount, just rub between palms and it melts and can be used on arms or legs.  I love how it feels.  This company provides such wonderful products.  I am happy to be a tester of this item to give my honest opinion.  I hope you love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This product comes in a brick form, in a resealable plastic bag.  It is a lovely consistency.  I cut the brick into and put the two pieces in  ziploc bowls, so that I could have this in the bathroom for when I get out of the shower, and one for the bedroom.  It has a pleasant smell and just feels really nice.  Grade A is the best shea butter one can buy.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I was provided this product to review, and have stated my honest opinion.  Vicki</li>
            <li> This product is a godsend for DIY beauty divas like myself! I approach my beauty products as I do my food: I would much rather buy the ingredients in bulk and make the products myself so that I know exactly what&#x27;s going into my skin. I received this for free so that I could try it and review it, but my opinions are mine. All mine! I will be using raw shea butter for years to come. There are a ton of recipes online, and it&#x27;s super easy to add Raw Shea butter to your beauty products. My skin is so incredibly smooth now! I can&#x27;t wait to go &#x27;whip&#x27; up another batch of body butter, as soon as the newest essential oils that I ordered get here!</li>
            <li> I was offered to try this free after I had ordered other amazing products as a previous customer.&lt;br /&gt;On to the Shea butter.  It comes as described. I LOVE this shea butter. Wow!  While it may be greasy at first...you ONLY need a little... it does melt and absorb rather quickly leaving an &#x27;earthy nut odor that does fade after a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always struggled with dry cracked heels. NOT any more! The same for my husbands hands that get so chapped and cracked from his work.  We have tried many things but this works.  I have used it to heal our grandson&#x27;s split dry lip that had bled!  By morning it was almost healed!  Same for his brother who for most little ones get in the habit of licking around the lips and you know how red and sore they get.  Before bed rubbed a little all around.  By morning it was about healed.  One more application each and both issues were completely healed.  I have also used some of this shea butter to make body lotion using organic coconut oil.  It is wonderful! I do scent with rose essential oil.  I highly recommend Beauty by Shea Organic Unrefined African She Butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONAL INFO HERE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also I have a neuropathy that causes burning aching pain in my feet.  I was surprised when I could not sleep I got up and massage the shea butter on them.  I have done this about 3-4 times a night since I got it 2/5/15.  I am amazed that it takes the pain away so that I fall asleep.  So then I had sore neck and across my shoulder muscles from interior house painting.  My husband massaged the shea butter in.  4 hours late the soreness and achiness was leaving.  Hmm, so had him just rub some on before I went to bed.  Again amazed the next morning!  at least 75% of soreness was gone!  Worked on my husband sore mid back muscles too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husbands hands from work get very chapped with cracks.  He uses it every night right after his shower.  WHAT a difference!  All these years of trying so many other lotions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter works wonderful to make a lotion and body butter too.  I use essential oil to scent it.  I to get some skin cracking around my thumb nail.  Not any more.  I have tried many things.  Works as is but I do prefer my lotion I made with it.  It also works great in my homemade deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!make a lotion and body butter too.  I use essential oil to scent it.  I to get some skin cracking around my thumb nail.  Not any more.  I have tried many things.  Works as is but I do prefer my lotion I made with it.  It also works great in my homemade deodorant!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this soft textured, mild scented, and smooth melting Shea butter for making my creams &amp; lotions.  I&#x27;ve never bought shea butter before as I&#x27;m new to the process of making my own healthy body products...but I will definitely by this product again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased another product from this seller and I was given a chance to get this item at no cost. Before receiving this product , I had used Shea butter once. I used this product and the feeling was awesome! I would recommend this to everyone. Texture is really smooth and I made body butter using the shea butter ! Perfect for winters ! Bye bye dry skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to make my own body butter with essential oils. I love it!  It came very fast and exceeded my expectations on the quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected but maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly</li>
            <li> It was pretty much what I expected for moisturizing however, the fragrance was a bit unfavorable to my nostrils.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packed.  I love shea butter and will enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> If you do want to use all natural products then Shea Butter is the way to go. It is great for both skin and hair. I switched from using body butters to Shea a while ago and am very happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for hair especially if you have curly hair. Just rub a wee bit in your palms and apply to damp hair after you shampoo, comb with a wide tooth comb, scrunch with a towel and let air dry. Your natural curls will bounce and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a cup warmer to melt shea and cconut oil during winter when they get solid and difficult to scoop and apply.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the gifts of nature and do you body good at the same time.</li>
            <li> The Beauty by Shea organic raw shea butter is very much as described. I have been using it for about one month. I find it to be moisturizing, softening, smoothing to the skin. It does not have additional scent in it, so my husband and I both use it. He would not use it if it smelled perfumey. I also used it once on my hair, which is long and sometimes gets dry and rather frizzy. I rubbed the butter into my hair and waited half an hour and then shampooed my hair. It provided good conditioning for my hair. I plan to use it that way every 2-3 weeks. I give the product 4 stars rather than 5 because as a skin lotion, it is more of a time-consuming process to use rather than simply squirting out a dab and rubbing it on. As a prior customer, I was provided this product for review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! I bought this to make my own body butter and it worked out perfectly. Arrived fresh and well sealed. Super moisturizing, healed up my cracked feet and knuckes.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality shea butter. I used it to make whipped body butter and it&#x27;s divine! I also used it to make deodorant and it&#x27;s the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love to make DIY products at home and I&#x27;ve purchased other brands of Shea butter.  I would have to say, this is my absolute favorite.  I mixed it with coconut oil, almond oil and a few drops of sandalwood oil, whipped it into a fluffy body butter.  It relieved my dry skin immediately. My skin still felt soft in the morning after showering.  I also got a bit aggressive in the tanning booth  last night and used just this Shea butter on my burn and  so far, so good, no peeling skin.  I received this free from Beauty By Shea as a testing product and will most definitely purchase it again and again. Nice product, smooth, creamy,melts with the heat from your hands and the best part Organic!!</li>
            <li> As a past customer I was able to try this product for my feedback and boy am I happy! I typically just buy a lotion on sale and forget to use it or stop because it doesn&#x27;t do much. With this stuff though it&#x27;s a life saver at my job. I&#x27;m a janitor and we basically use harsh chemicals all year. Stripper for the floors and graffiti remover being the worst. If it gets on your skin and it always does it dries your skin out and it stays that way. I usually have raw nails and cracked skin on my hands by the end of the summer or any busy cleaning period. I&#x27;ll use a moisturizer and ten minutes later my hands are painfully dry again! With this stuff though I&#x27;ve lucked out. I mainly use it after the shower and before bed on my feet, hands, elbows, and as needed like my neck to help with shaving. My feet are actually in sandals shape for once. No nasty peeling dry skin or that feeling of your sheets catching on your dead prickly skin! Plus my toe nails look way cleaner since there isn&#x27;t as much dead skin build up in the corners. My hands aren&#x27;t cracking at all for once too and no painful hanging skin on the sides of my nails. Overall this stuff works (smells nice too if you ask me) and I find it best to use before bed for the best results. Or some on your hands and then wearing gloves works great too! I&#x27;m not worried about snow season and all the salt with this stuff now.</li>
            <li> Great shea butter, less pungent than the non-organic version, packaging a bit akward - can be fixed by re-packaging.</li>
            <li> The butter came very well packaged. When I opened up the bag, the butter was also inside a plastic bag as well. This will help to keep it fresh and also did not ruin the bag in case it melted. I did some research on the many, many uses of this product and decided I would try two of them for this review. My hair is very curly, thick, and frizzy. Summers are the worst for my hair because of the humidity, so I try to deep condition at least twice a month. I was really excited to try using raw organic shea butter instead of my normal deep conditioner (which I am sure is processed more than I care to know!). I used about 1/4 cup of shea butter. I massaged it in to my (damp) hair gently from roots to tips and let is sit for just about 30 minutes. Then I washed it out thoroughly in the shower. I am loving the feel of my hair right now! I cannot stop running my fingers through it! It is so smooth! I highly recommend using shea butter as a deep conditioner! Below are the before and after photos. To use this as body lotion I just took a very small amount - a little goes a long way folks - and rubbed it between my palms until it was warmed and soft. I then spread it on my arms, legs, and stomach. My skin felt renewed almost immediately. I would love to try adding some essential oils to it and then using it as a body lotion! I wouldn&#x27;t say this shea butter has a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell - it just would smell better with some lavender or eucalyptus. I would also love to make my own bar soap using shea butter - maybe that is next on my list!</li>
            <li> I typically use Avocado or Jojoba oil to moisturize my skin. During our North Texas [Dallas/Fort Worth] winters I have to apply all over. Other times of the year I usually only need to apply to my face to fix a few dry spots each morning. My only significant annoyance with those oils revolves around how easily the oil gets transferred back from my hands onto the bottle and, subsequently, anything else the bottle touches. The shae butter, provided for free in exchange for an honest review, very neatly resolves that issue since it comes in a solid bar and one only has to pull off pieces and emolliate in order to apply.  It&#x27;s the little things, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a couple of days I used only the shae butter and found that it moisturized just as well as my avocado oil. My only significant complaint was that it seemed to take longer for my skin to absorb. So, unlike the oil, if I applied it just before getting dressed, my skin was a bit tackier and my clothes would grab a little as I was putting them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My minor annoyance with the shea butter is related to the smell. I&#x27;m pretty much a fragrance free kinda guy, and the shea butter has very distinct aroma. It&#x27;s not perfume like or artificial, I believe it is inherent to the product, but it&#x27;s noticeable and it took several hours after application for me to stop catching the scent. Again, I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad thing, since it appears to be perfectly organic in origin, but lingering scents in general just aren&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I will defiantly use all of what I have, I will absolutely recommend to others, and it&#x27;s something that I would buy for myself. That said, this seems like a product I would be more inclined to use in the winter when my skin is at its driest and I feel like this is going to give me the most effective moisturizing possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Solid form is cleaner to deal with that avocado oil&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing effect seems to last as long as avocado oil&lt;br /&gt;Applies just easily as avocado oil, feels a bit more dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling a bit tacky for a longer time than avocado oil.

            <li> he shea butter came very quickly. It is helping to moisturize my heels very well. Just a warning, though. You don&#x27;t need to use too much. I used to teach first grade and I would tell the kids a dab will do ya when using glue. Here, a dab is too much. I don&#x27;t see myself needing to reorder anytime soon as a result. But when I need to, I will certainly reorder from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this for my older dry skin. It&#x27;s wonderful to find a product that really works !!  Highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I thought it would be in one block of.. mush? like a butter block, but it looks like when you mash up sticks of butter in a bowl and that crumbly look and then packaged. Otherwise, arrived timely, in great condition; a perfect, raw product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that works perfectly by itself or as an ingredient in combination with other products.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I bought this for my wife and she was hesitant at first.  In trusting the other fellow reviewers who normally never fail me, I knew she would grow into it.  Mainly, it was because it came in a brick form which she found funny because it reminded her of India and her village as this what their butter looks like.  It came with a small tin can which is a perfect size to refill and carry on, filled it up and sure enough she grew into it and now uses this everyday as do I.  Also, it smells great and I can&#x27;t stop kissing her cheeks because it&#x27;s almost an edible sensation that I get.  This is a great value, something which last a year with nightly use and would definitely make for a great gift.  Not to mention that this helps hard working people who create a wonderful and abundant product, if anyone can confirm that this goes right to the people and not a shady middle man somewhere, please let me know I would be glad to buy five to ten more for family and friends this summer.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is great. It has a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into the skin. Best of all it leaves my skin feeling smooth for hours on end. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 2 weeks now and my skin feels fantastic. I cant wait to see how it holds up in the winter.</li>
            <li> LOVE this Shea butter. I&#x27;ve used it to make lip balm and body butter, and it works perfectly. Love the consistency - I just want to eat it - it is so soft and creamy. The smell is also creamy and delicate - not overwhelming. This Shea butter is very soft and easy to use. Product seems very pure and very high quality. Customer service is great - I will definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever seen and/or used Shea Butter. I had heard good things about it for so long that I decided to give it a try. When it first arrived, I was excited but intimidated. It came in this huge brick and I thought &amp;#34;how am I supposed to rub this on my skin?&amp;#34; But after some research I found SO MANY things you can do with it... and in order to soften it, all you need is a little warmth (like rubbing it with your hands). the best part, to me, is that is organic, raw, and unrefined. My skin really appreciates that. I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve highly recommended it to all my friends and a few of them use it now as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: a sample of this product was provided free of charge, however this is my true opinion regardless of cost.</li>
            <li> Cleopatra, last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, is still counted among the world&#x27;s greatest beauties centuries later. So much has been written about her and her ill fated attempt to rule Egypt that records of her beauty records survive today. Chief among them is a common cosmetic we all know - raw shea butter. This nutrient rich fat is derived from the nut of  the African shea tree and is used in any number of products. It softens, nourishes and heals just as well today as it did in 26 BC. I have used it before to make soap and lotions and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty By Shea imports its 100% organic raw shea butter from Ghana to the US where it is filtered, packaged, and heat sealed to ensure quality and purity. Nothing is added and that is especially important with shea butter as it loses a lot of its power once processed. Raw shea butter is chock full of vitamins like A, E, F and K that can be lost with exposure to heat and other processing means. Raw shea butter even offers protection from ultraviolet rays. It’s a natural sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter can be very effective all by itself. Use it topically on lips, skin, and hair or use it as a base for homemade soaps and lotions. Just be sure to buy a high quality unprocessed shea butter like this one from Beauty By Shea.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter! It is much softer than other products I have tried which makes it much easier to apply. I use it as a moisturizer for myself and also on my two year old daughters eczema.</li>
            <li> Very happy that I chose this product..it&#x27;s worked for me when nothing else would after having facial laser peel equally impressed with the quality of customer care ,received a follow-up email with instuctions...I received the block with directions in a zip bag that was in a reclosable foil lined pouch with a small tin to fill for convenience...Very nice presentation</li>
            <li> I received one bag of Beauty By Shea Organic Raw Unrefined African Shea Butter to review!

            <li> Product was as advertised. I weighed it upon receipt and found that the weight was accurate.  No discoloration or bad odor, which seems to indicate it was, in fact, raw and unrefined.  I used it to make body butter and was pleased with the texture and moisturizing.  This was my first time purchasing Shea Butter but I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!!!!!  I have dry skin and hair.  This product is the best.  Wish I had known about it sooner.  No lotion or cream comes close compared to shea butter for me.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday with my vitamin E oil. It is a high grade Shea Butter that applies smoothly to the skin.</li>
            <li> Quality is fantastic! This is way softer than the other brand I ordered!!! The problem  Is that it&#x27;s supposed to be 1 lb!!! I was contacted about the shortage &amp; their customer service is very willing to help.    I will just weigh packages in the future, but I know this shea is much better than others I have tried on here that have been very gritty. This shea is so smooth, easy to use &amp; feels great.</li>
            <li> This was something I was looking forward to use. I received it to try for free, but I honestly when I saw it, didn&#x27;t know if the review would be good. It looked like a big block of butter. I cut it in half and gave it to my daughter to use, and she tried it on my 11 month old granddaughter who has eczema and also at the time, a diaper rash. Well the day after, she had used only a very little bit on my granddaughter, but called to say the rash had lightened up considerably, and her eczema patch was much better as well. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I have used it on my own skin and my husband puts it on his hands. I like it, and so does he. Very emollient and soothing to the skin. The true test of this though was my granddaughter Rose. I&#x27;m happy to say this product is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Awesome shea butter. It came beautifully packaged and it&#x27;s great quality. Love it</li>
            <li> This shea butter is just awesome! The texture is so soft and doesn&#x27;t require too much work to melt in your palms. It&#x27;s not as grainy as some shea butters I&#x27;ve used and the color is much more opaque. Would repurchase!</li>
            <li> I used this to make a body balm and it has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Smooth texture. Easy to blend on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have lived in Arizona for over 2 1/2 years. Out here dry skin is a way of life. Several years back the veins in my lower right leg caused my skin to dry up and itch even further due to an artery problem. The sun plus the pool chlorine enhanced the issue.My wife has given me any number of lotions that were just a temporary facade. With a daily and nightly routine Beauty by Shea Organic Raw Unrefined African Shea Butter has given me relief beyond explanation. My itch is no more and my skin on my hand, face, and legs feel revitalized. I strongly reccomend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;as a previous customer I obtained this product for review&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;John Corvo, Phoenix, AZ</li>
