            <li> Have used their products for 10 years or more and keep coming back</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just over a week now and so far so good! I use this oil in place of lotion to try to stay as natural as possible. I like how it smells good and isnt as greesy as other oils that i have tried. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchse and would consider buying this again.</li>
            <li> The scent quality is pretty good, could be stronger but over all for a massage oil nice.  The oil itself leaves a greasy feel to your skin but maybe if I use less and do it after baths it won&#x27;t do that.  Will surely use the oil I bought.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this for me because I wanted a deep, natural moisturizer for my skin after waxing.  This body oil is completely natural, smells amazing, isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I use it every day on my hair, face, body. . . everywhere!  I just emulsify it with some water in my hands and away I go.  Love this!!!!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This oil is so good. It smells fantastic. I like how it goes on and ou can massage or just enjoy that your skin is very hydrated. I have dry cuticles and it will make the appearance lovely. It is especially nice when you put it on after shaving the legs. If only the massage place would use this product it would be a slice of heaven. I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil every morning before work and before bed, on arms and legs and back. Since I am over 50, the oil seems to really help keep my skin looking good and leaves a nice shine on it (summer). My college daughter brags to her friends that my skin looks great because I oil up. The fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li> This oil is so deliciously smelling that it transports me instantly to a spa day.  It is incredibly relaxing.  I wear this daily.  Apply straight out of the shower while your skin is still damp and use just a few drops (it goes a long way) and your skin will be soft and smelling great all day.</li>
            <li> I use this in my massage practice. The aroma is awesome and the glide is perfect - not too oily</li>
            <li> Great product.  Smells wonderful!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about a month as an after bath/shower moisturizer.  I have sensitive skin &amp; will usually break out in eczema with other oil&#x27;s I&#x27;ve attempted to use in the past.  I wanted a moisturizer that was quick, sunk in fast w/o having to spend too much time rubbing in.  This oil is a little greasier if too much is used, so a little will go a long way.  The scent is pleasant and light &amp; it&#x27;s kept my skin moisturized and soft all day.  Definite plus in my book.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, not too strong. This oil is quickly absorbed by my skin without leaving an oily mess</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Item as described.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil, it is great for massage, not too slippery. I also use is on my skin in the dry months and it keeps it softer</li>
            <li> I am allergic to so many skin care products. The EO Body Oil &amp; Moisture, French Lavender was given to me as a gift, used the two bottles and order some for myself.  I was wanting to try some lavender on and around healed wounds, lavender is used to promote healing by some people.  I really liked the feel and smell, but it did not promote healing. So I had to change.</li>
