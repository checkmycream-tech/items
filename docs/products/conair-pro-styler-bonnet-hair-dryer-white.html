            <li>VERY happy:)</li>
            <li>PROS - Makes a good nail dryer with the air from the motor.     </li>
            <li>This is not made as good as the one I had to toss</li>
            <li>It is a good wattage and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Price was good though,</li>
            <li>Lightweight, inexpensive, and good for home use.</li>
            <li>It works but its not as good as described.</li>
            <li>She is delighted with this Conair</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this item.  </li>

            <li>I am very satisfied with the hair dryer.  </li>

            <li>Really nice dryer with good settings.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have gone to the salon and have to sit an hour or more under theirs!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my needs, and it is exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>was cheap!!</li>
            <li>The loudness of the dyer that most people complain about is Tolerable!</li>
            <li>I have a timer of my own.</li>
            <li>but it looks nice</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and works great!</li>
            <li>and it would be nice to adjust the hood</li>
            <li>To pay for gasoline, i need to color my own hair, and sit under a dryer.</li>
            <li>I do apt of road travel so this dryer works well.</li>
            <li>the seller did not tak elong at all to get my product out to me and it arrived packaged nicely and undamaged.</li>
            <li>But guess they liked it.</li>
            <li>This dryer is good because it&#x27;s easy to use, but, I have a couple of hang-ups about it though:</li>
            <li>It does a good job drying and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It could very easily break and be unrepairable.  </li>
            <li>Set-up is very easy.  </li>
            <li>REALLY GREAT GETS VERY HOT</li>
            <li>It was just what I was looking for, ,very good  thanks</li>
            <li>Not as many as features as I would have liked</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to still be able to find this product on the market.  </li>
            <li>It came a day earlier which was awesome because i was able to get my hairstyle for the weekend!</li>
            <li>for me this is great with my plastic cap just to activate my conditioning and hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>It appears that the product is very cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Very light and compact.</li>
            <li>I just got some HUGE ROLLERS and will let you know if it fits under it!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love being able to do something with my hands rather than holding the dryer.</li>
            <li>TABLE TOP HAIR DRYER</li>
            <li>Top of the head gets all the heat.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>but I was expecting a much better quality in the dryer.    </li>
            <li>I agree with all the criticisms of this dryer plus one more.</li>
            <li>The extension makes it most convenient to use while sitting on the floor, which can be convenient.</li>
            <li>But until I can find a better hooded dryer, I guess this will have to do.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made !</li>
            <li>The product was here fast and it works great.  </li>
            <li>could use some more air holes.  </li>
            <li>much better</li>
            <li>on the market any more so have to put up with what you can get.</li>
            <li>I have to turn even so often to make sure each section is drying.</li>
            <li>Its not terrible dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>nothing in-between, ok I did not like that feature</li>
            <li>A good useful product.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Anywho this is the best for deep conditioning!</li>
            <li>This dryer if fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It should have more adjustments to make it easier to use.  </li>
            <li>so glad I have it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to adjust the dryer to the height that I need.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>You do need to be a bit creative about where to put it I suppose.</li>
            <li>Its ok for its price.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love it ...</li>
            <li>Next best thing to being at the hair salon.  </li>
            <li>Have not had a chance to use much, but worked great the 2 times I used..</li>
            <li>Product came on time and I&#x27;m in love with this dryer.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I will continue my search for something better.</li>
            <li>I was happy to help her out&lt;br /&gt;much appreciated</li>
            <li>worked good...definitely does heat hte top more than the rest...</li>
            <li>HH320LR.. Could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>and I use it more than she does.</li>
            <li>I love the item.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s portable and amazing for freelance work specially since a travel loads I planes.</li>
            <li>It did a pretty good job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li>For the money it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Used a task chair to adjust to dry height this worked out great!</li>
            <li>I think it is excellent if you get the right position for the vents to have direct access to the hair.</li>
            <li>Lo setting is more comfortable.   </li>
            <li>I love the light weight and the size of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>If you do use this dryer make sure you have a comfortable chair.</li>
            <li>Plus my guts said \\&quot;go with it\\&quot; and honestly it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Adjustable hood height and plenty of room for a head full of rollers!</li>
            <li>This was my first hooded hair drier and I love it!</li>
            <li>This dryer makes it so that you can easily  watch tv or read a magazine while drying your hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to set up and is not as noisy as some dryers I have used.  </li>
            <li>blow holes are only at the top would be great if they were at the sides</li>
            <li>you can easily find ways to adjust this for your need s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high powered and good quality.</li>
            <li>I recommend spending more for a better product and keep one more appliance out of the garbage (recycle), which is where this one is going very soon.</li>
            <li>they sure dont make them like that anymore, that one provided FULL drying coverage</li>
            <li>i use it every sunday its nice and hot.</li>
            <li>If you have a chair that can raise up and down, that will be perfect.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>The lo setting works just fine</li>
            <li>The unit does the job of drying hair just fine, but would be easier to use if the dryer hood height was adjustable.</li>
            <li>Height is fine for my table</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>its works fine like a dryer in a salon</li>
            <li>But it adjusts just fine</li>
            <li>I just could not fix it anymore though the motor was fine.  </li>
            <li>Paid $25.00 with free shipping and the dryer still going strong.</li>
            <li>This dryer gets super hottttt!</li>
            <li>If you need cheap heat this is fine.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s so huge to store..</li>
            <li>skip it theirs a reason its priced so cheap</li>
            <li>Cheap made.</li>
            <li>My head doesn&#x27;t fit comfortable with rollers on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and it does the job.</li>
            <li>the chair you use in order to sit under the it comfortably.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel that I am fully under it comfortably.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to sit under and read your book while drying the hair.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t fit me , I WAS NOT TALL  </li>
            <li>TO FIT UNDER IT</li>
            <li>TO FIT MY HEAD UNDER IT .  </li>
            <li>It is fit for the recycle bin.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m comfortable under it.</li>
            <li>There are only two settings, however the temperatures are great.</li>
            <li>My previous dryer was great but it just stopped working after many year.  </li>
            <li>and I would love to have medium as it does get quite hot</li>
            <li>When it works its okay, but the hood has a habit of collapsing when it gets too hot.</li>
            <li>so im pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>and i was excited for it</li>
            <li>The cooler setting does not burn my scalp and the hotter setting is great for a quick blast to get drying started on my long hair.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but is a bit louder than I expected.</li>
            <li>But, for the price, and if you can find some comfortable way to sit, it is worth it for those days when you don&#x27;t have time to head to the hair salon.</li>
            <li>I love this in that it dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li>I wanted the old timey kind and this sort of fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>but that is true about everything...</li>
            <li>wave full sew in.</li>
            <li>I figured I would love this one just as much, NOT the case at all.  </li>
            <li>so i of course used hi for a full set of rollers.</li>
            <li>but it does not work too good because i am short and the dryer is designed for those who are taller.</li>
            <li>so far so good, thanks!</li>
            <li>the airflow is not bad either considering where the holes are place...</li>
            <li>There is no way to adjust the height, the plastic is cheap, cheap, cheap, and other than a great deal of noise, nothing much comes out of the hood.</li>
            <li>The old styles were more sturdy and strong.  </li>
            <li>I guess you may need to be creative to use it on a table top or maybe a ocunter of some sort but other than that I&#x27;m pleased for my intended purposes.</li>
            <li>even though the back doesnt get that hot as the front its very warm.</li>
            <li>LIGHT WEIGHT AND JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HEAT</li>
            <li>High is indeed very high heat and perfect for when i do my deep conditioning treatments...</li>
            <li>Otherwise folds nicely and not very heavy.</li>
            <li>It barely dries my hair, but it will burn a hole in at the top of my scalp!</li>
            <li>It dries hair quickly and has adjustable heat settings.  </li>
            <li>Conair is not a trust worthy manufacturer.</li>
            <li>My old dryer was from Conair and being that I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I found it at the price I wanted to pay.</li>
            <li>The shipment is very very fast and secure.  </li>
            <li>I liked the hairdryer, I wish it was a little more powerful, but it did get the job done and was easy to use</li>
            <li>this is only good for people with really straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good but the bottom of the hair does not dry.</li>
            <li>The hi setting does get very hot.</li>
            <li>1 dose not get very hot..</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect anything spectacular with this dryer,but i am satisfied with the product overall...</li>
            <li>Exactly!</li>
            <li>I love sitting under the dryer and being able to read or do handwork and getting my hair dried hands free.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, and I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and very stable when set up.</li>
            <li>Just know it&#x27;s worth the money, if it suits you.</li>
            <li>She owns a much older model (by a different maker) and loves it, but says this Conair dryer is much more powerful and dries her hair more quickly.  </li>
            <li>that was more than 40 yrs old...</li>
            <li>If you want to use rollers in your hair, be prepared to sit under this dryer as best as you can for a minimum of 2 1/2 hours, unless you have really thin hair.  </li>
            <li>So far i love this product.</li>
            <li>It darn near burned the top of my head</li>
            <li>worth upwards of 15 IQ points.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed it so far.  </li>
            <li>But for the price it is all worth it.  </li>
            <li>Gets super hot</li>
            <li>It works well, you just have to find a right chair and a surface with the right height</li>
            <li>Gets very hot at the top of the head and not  enough at the sides.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry hair effectively.</li>
            <li>It really works really well and is compact and light..</li>
            <li>Wish the younger generation would do their hair and look as beautiful as we did in those gone days of long ago.  </li>
            <li>It also works great for when I want to do a hot oil treatment or deep condition, I just throw on a shower cap put the heat on low</li>
            <li>Heat works well...not too hot.</li>
            <li>Hi setting is too hot</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect for my wife who recently broke a leg and obviously has had difficulty in performing basic functions like washing and drying her hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too much work done on my part!...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It only has holes at the top of the hat so the air is only released at the top of your head</li>
            <li>otherwise it is way too hot.  </li>
            <li>Years ago I got a remington hair dryer similar to this one and through the years and many moves it got lost.  </li>
            <li>WHICH OS TOO HOT</li>
            <li>The heat only comes out at the top and does not distribute evenly.  </li>
            <li>, what I did not like at all was the fact that the vents were only on the top of the hood</li>
            <li>Is portable and pretty.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using the dryer</li>
            <li>It gets hot where it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>It is the first one I have had and would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li>Must open vent at top to make it tolerable on either setting.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, there it was!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Conair and Amazon!  </li>
            <li>it wasnt just blowing heat out the top and with a prayer and tilt of head forward hopes it drys the back and sides of the head too....</li>
            <li>all around the top of the hood, and then the airflow from the opening in the back.</li>
            <li>does exactly what it should ....gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>Wife could not use it because it go to hot.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is short it dries the top</li>
            <li>This was my first hair dryer</li>
            <li>good product  but not a fit for my wife</li>
            <li>and I am good to go w/o having to spend another 20-30 bux at the salon or waste water steaming up the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I love to keep my hair looking shinny and healthy and in the winter it gets dull and in the summer it looks fried.  </li>
            <li>Flimsy, does not dry well, not adjustable, will easily collapse on your head.</li>
            <li>Other wise it heats just fine, also because I would imagine if my goal were to completely dry my hair</li>
            <li>This product is pretty much going out of the box and into the recycle.  </li>
            <li>It requires a tall person to fit her head under this dryer properly and even then, pillows to sit on will be most likely required.  </li>
            <li>First I would like to thank Amazon, for shipping it so fast.</li>
            <li>Usual good quality after all it is Conair</li>
            <li>I can actually see this doing a good job on my hair if i were to roller set and get under the dryer no problem...if you are just looking for a cheap but gets the job done such as deep conditioning with heat for 15-20 minutes type of hair dryer</li>
            <li>it gets really hot when on the high setting (not the air the dryer itself) and on first use it tripped my electrical plug.....</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this dryer has the option to open and close the vent on the top of the hood which is where other dryers lack.  </li>
            <li>Easy to open and close</li>
            <li>what can i say about Hair dryer why do you insist on making people write long review about somthing when i say it was good isnt that enough</li>
            <li>This hair dryer has a large hood</li>
            <li>The low setting gives a warm heat that does not dry my hair.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is nice and my hair is left dry and bouncy for the most part, but for some reason the bonnet doesn&#x27;t reach the back of my head.</li>
            <li>Cord does get   a little warm, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be any type of safety issue.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot on low after a while especially on the top your head.</li>
            <li>very noisy.</li>
            <li>BUT,WORK VERY SATISFACTORY.</li>
            <li>FOR THE MONEY MY MY WIFE IS VERY HAPPY.WOULD RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>this hooded hair dryer a reasonable price now</li>
            <li>This dryer works really well, just like the ones in salons.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfy with my order and it was delievery on time as promise.</li>
            <li>This is not a very fancy dryer but it sure works very well, the HI is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s also very noisy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t move around too much while you&#x27;re underneath the hood</li>
            <li>The adjustable length is not very practical and you have to be creative about where you put the dryer and</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and now I understand why.</li>
            <li>This dryer does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;m very disappointedin this Bonnet Hair Dryer</li>
            <li>It works very well with my hair style and even if I used rollers it would comply.  </li>
            <li>It heats ups fast and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Big Rollers fit well underneath it.</li>
            <li>Simply put, cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>If you so much as sneeze while under this dryer the hood will fall and hit you in the face.  </li>
            <li>I rarely used it, but lately since I&#x27;ve been trying to save money, I&#x27;ve started to do my own hair at home.    </li>
            <li>The plastic casing is more fragile than the old ones but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>you have to stick your head all the way to the top of the hood to really get the air on your hair, and since it only really comes out of a few holes on the top</li>
            <li>Very Please to say I got more than I expected</li>
            <li>I always used one like that since my younger years (I am 80 years old now) and as soon as I saw it advertized I sent for it as I had not seen one in many years.  </li>
            <li>Item gets very,very hot, and there is no thermostat, only vents to open on the top, and that doesnt&#x27;t work to reduce the temperature.</li>
            <li>More airflow outside of the dryer than what actually dries your hair.  </li>
            <li>This Conair dryer is decent.</li>
            <li>But the heat is steady and well distributed.  </li>
            <li>Love this dryer works great on drying my dread locks at the base.</li>
            <li>it is sturdy and hot enough without burning you to a crisp.</li>
            <li>Hood height is too high.  </li>
            <li>Hood is so  high  </li>
            <li>but it is still to high</li>
            <li>you my table is NOT that high</li>
            <li>High almost burns my scalp.  </li>
            <li>And yes, i recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>PLEASE DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li>The plastic switch that holds the hard hat up is kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li>My old dryer had cool, low, med and high settings.  </li>
            <li>So far, though, she REALLY likes it.  </li>
            <li>So far , I really like it</li>
            <li>That is when I discovered that this dryer was just a waste of space in the top of my closet.    </li>
            <li>The back of my neck did not get scorched which is rare with at home dryers.</li>
            <li>They are well worth the money and last!  </li>
            <li>On high, it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li>It takes some time to get your hair dry, depending on how many rollers you use and your hair type, but it definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I will say to be very careful with the plastic parts and it should be fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t leave it on high for very long because the cord gets very hot and starts to melt.</li>
            <li>No side vents, so the top of your head is dry first and becomes unbearably hot, while the sides and back are still wet.  </li>
            <li>As a pro hairstylist it&#x27;s I can&#x27;t live with out</li>
            <li>So it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>but I can live with that</li>
            <li>so i decided to just live with it and consider it a loss.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any one who needs a new dryer.  </li>
            <li>I live in California.  </li>
            <li>The low gets hot enough and the high gets hot.</li>
            <li>This dryer is also very loud.  </li>
            <li>It can get hot in there, but its the same hotness   </li>
            <li>A bit old fashioned, but I&#x27;ve had one around for years!  </li>
            <li>It gets so hot in the middle my head</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with the hair dryer is my cord gets extremely hot, that I do not want to use it anymore</li>
            <li>and it works the same as when I first received it.</li>
            <li>so i have pretty coarse hair and the dryer</li>
            <li>I can sit under it a full hour, and my hair in some sections will still be dripping wet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American Natural &amp; I purchased this hair dryer to get a better result out of my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>She loves the new one because it resembles the old one in so mnay ways but with improvements.  </li>
            <li>For years I used the Conair HH320LB Pro Styler Bonnet Dryer, and my hair dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li>dries as quickly as can be expected for the price we paid.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t a lot of hard hat hair dryers around any more.</li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer to replace my old, old, old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer was just too loud for me.</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>It is also quite loud.</li>
            <li>item arrived promptly and so far it works as promised.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and works as advertised with no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hairdryer as a gift for my 84 year old mom and it does not work as promised.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my daughter who has coarse and very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>...there are only two settings.which worked very well with my dreadlock..</li>
            <li>Just like our old one which is what we wanted</li>
            <li>incredibly loud too</li>
            <li>I have owned this dryer for nearly 5 yrs</li>
            <li>However I only wish it had an height adjustment, but for the price I really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised.  </li>
            <li>I used and dry the hair very fast</li>
            <li>It has become very much easier to dry my dreds.</li>
            <li>I am constantly moving my head left to right so that the heat can touch every side of my hair</li>
            <li>No holes to dry the bottom of your hair, only holes to dry the top.</li>
            <li>What can I say, this product does what it say it does - blows hot air to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer about a week ago because I&#x27;ve recently become natural and I needed a hooded dryer for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I went to Sally Beauty Supply, Target, and other Beauty Supply Stores...no success.  </li>
            <li>The scalp on the top of her head ended up burning while the back of her hair remained dripping down her back.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a decent hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive ones out there, including the Gold n&#x27; Hot (on  wheels &amp; the bonnet dryer).  </li>
            <li>This dryer has two speeds low and high</li>
            <li>The air blows only on the top of your head and not only dries it, it dries it out while leaving the back of your head soaking wet!  </li>
            <li>Got it quick, was just as described but a little on the noisy side.</li>
            <li>When mine finally conked out after about 10 years of use, I went to Walmart to purchase a new one; and to my surprise, they no longer carried them.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase my next dryer at store and not online to make sure that at least the dryer is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>This model doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as the previous one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>MORE than enough heat for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>Being a natural girl with African American hair, I do not like high heat on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair never got dry in the back and in the crown area when using the Gold n&#x27; Hot dryers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to wash your hair at home and get the same results as the salon in half the time and price!!</li>
            <li>Runs a little to hot on high, takes longer on low, no option to regulate</li>
            <li>The high and low settings only regulate the fan, not necessarly the heat.</li>
            <li>It only has two setting low and high.</li>
            <li>The low takes forever and the high could possibly burn your hair off.</li>
            <li>It has no heat selection, only settings of high or low for air flow.  </li>
            <li>The dryer can be adjusted but barely.</li>
            <li>I finally replaced my old hair dryer that I had for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>If you want your child to get a deep conditioning for 10 minutes on her natural hair, this dryer will not work at all.  </li>
            <li>It  has worked as expected and heats really well.  </li>
            <li>this dryer works well for me, no regrets</li>
            <li>I keep the vent closed for fast drying.  </li>
            <li>Like shop vac loud with a strained whistle going at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I normally wear my hair curly and did not bother to open the box and inspect it until now (4 months later)</li>
            <li>I finally convinced her it was time when the old one was broken in so many places</li>
            <li>It works really well and is extremely convenient.</li>
            <li>The only reason why i didnt give it five stars was because i kept having to turn on different sides to dry my whole head, i dont know if its</li>
            <li>Dryer does not dry my hair well at all.  </li>
            <li>I had to send this product back because the heat holes in the dryer head are to high to dry the back and sides of my head.</li>
            <li>While I did have straight hair when I first received this as a gift I did not find it as convenient to use because my hair was so thin it would literally feel like it was burning my scalp.</li>
            <li>High for very wet hair..low for styling.</li>
            <li>and it does not dry the back and lower sides of your hair properly.</li>
            <li>The same problem happens with Conair hard hat dryer as Laila Ali LADR5603--  too tall for short people because air flow only reached top half.</li>
            <li>If you are a die hard at home roller setter/wrapper/deep conditioner/wet setter/braid setter/twist outer/style molder/colorer then please spend a few extra coins for a better dryer.</li>
            <li>works great, stupid of me</li>
    </ol>

            <li> VERY happy:)</li>
            <li> PROS - Makes a good nail dryer with the air from the motor.     </li>
            <li> This is not made as good as the one I had to toss</li>
            <li> It is a good wattage and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Price was good though,</li>
            <li> Lightweight, inexpensive, and good for home use.</li>
            <li> It works but its not as good as described.</li>
            <li> She is delighted with this Conair</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with the results.  </li>

            <li> Really nice dryer with good settings.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I have gone to the salon and have to sit an hour or more under theirs!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my needs, and it is exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> was cheap!!</li>
            <li> The loudness of the dyer that most people complain about is Tolerable!</li>
            <li> I have a timer of my own.</li>
            <li> but it looks nice</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works great!</li>
            <li> and it would be nice to adjust the hood</li>
            <li> To pay for gasoline, i need to color my own hair, and sit under a dryer.</li>
            <li> I do apt of road travel so this dryer works well.</li>
            <li> the seller did not tak elong at all to get my product out to me and it arrived packaged nicely and undamaged.</li>
            <li> But guess they liked it.</li>
            <li> This dryer is good because it&#x27;s easy to use, but, I have a couple of hang-ups about it though:</li>
            <li> It does a good job drying and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It could very easily break and be unrepairable.  </li>
            <li> Set-up is very easy.  </li>
            <li> REALLY GREAT GETS VERY HOT</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for, ,very good  thanks</li>
            <li> Not as many as features as I would have liked</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to still be able to find this product on the market.  </li>
            <li> It came a day earlier which was awesome because i was able to get my hairstyle for the weekend!</li>
            <li> for me this is great with my plastic cap just to activate my conditioning and hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> It appears that the product is very cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> Very light and compact.</li>
            <li> I just got some HUGE ROLLERS and will let you know if it fits under it!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I love being able to do something with my hands rather than holding the dryer.</li>
            <li> TABLE TOP HAIR DRYER</li>
            <li> Top of the head gets all the heat.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> but I was expecting a much better quality in the dryer.    </li>
            <li> I agree with all the criticisms of this dryer plus one more.</li>
            <li> The extension makes it most convenient to use while sitting on the floor, which can be convenient.</li>
            <li> But until I can find a better hooded dryer, I guess this will have to do.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made !</li>
            <li> The product was here fast and it works great.  </li>
            <li> could use some more air holes.  </li>

            <li> Anywho this is the best for deep conditioning!</li>
            <li> This dryer if fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It should have more adjustments to make it easier to use.  </li>
            <li> so glad I have it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to adjust the dryer to the height that I need.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> You do need to be a bit creative about where to put it I suppose.</li>
            <li> Its ok for its price.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love it ...</li>
            <li> Next best thing to being at the hair salon.  </li>
            <li> Have not had a chance to use much, but worked great the 2 times I used..</li>
            <li> Product came on time and I&#x27;m in love with this dryer.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I will continue my search for something better.</li>
            <li> I was happy to help her out&lt;br /&gt;much appreciated</li>
            <li> worked good...definitely does heat hte top more than the rest...</li>
            <li> HH320LR.. Could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> and I use it more than she does.</li>
            <li> I love the item.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s portable and amazing for freelance work specially since a travel loads I planes.</li>
            <li> It did a pretty good job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li> For the money it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Used a task chair to adjust to dry height this worked out great!</li>
            <li> I think it is excellent if you get the right position for the vents to have direct access to the hair.</li>
            <li> Lo setting is more comfortable.   </li>
            <li> I love the light weight and the size of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> If you do use this dryer make sure you have a comfortable chair.</li>
            <li> Plus my guts said \\&quot;go with it\\&quot; and honestly it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Adjustable hood height and plenty of room for a head full of rollers!</li>
            <li> This was my first hooded hair drier and I love it!</li>
            <li> This dryer makes it so that you can easily  watch tv or read a magazine while drying your hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to set up and is not as noisy as some dryers I have used.  </li>
            <li> blow holes are only at the top would be great if they were at the sides</li>
            <li> you can easily find ways to adjust this for your need s</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high powered and good quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend spending more for a better product and keep one more appliance out of the garbage (recycle), which is where this one is going very soon.</li>
            <li> they sure dont make them like that anymore, that one provided FULL drying coverage</li>
            <li> i use it every sunday its nice and hot.</li>
            <li> If you have a chair that can raise up and down, that will be perfect.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The lo setting works just fine</li>
            <li> The unit does the job of drying hair just fine, but would be easier to use if the dryer hood height was adjustable.</li>
            <li> Height is fine for my table</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> its works fine like a dryer in a salon</li>
            <li> But it adjusts just fine</li>
            <li> I just could not fix it anymore though the motor was fine.  </li>
            <li> Paid $25.00 with free shipping and the dryer still going strong.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets super hottttt!</li>
            <li> If you need cheap heat this is fine.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s so huge to store..</li>
            <li> skip it theirs a reason its priced so cheap</li>
            <li> Cheap made.</li>
            <li> My head doesn&#x27;t fit comfortable with rollers on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and it does the job.</li>
            <li> the chair you use in order to sit under the it comfortably.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel that I am fully under it comfortably.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to sit under and read your book while drying the hair.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t fit me , I WAS NOT TALL  </li>
            <li> TO FIT UNDER IT</li>
            <li> TO FIT MY HEAD UNDER IT .  </li>
            <li> It is fit for the recycle bin.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m comfortable under it.</li>
            <li> There are only two settings, however the temperatures are great.</li>
            <li> My previous dryer was great but it just stopped working after many year.  </li>
            <li> and I would love to have medium as it does get quite hot</li>
            <li> When it works its okay, but the hood has a habit of collapsing when it gets too hot.</li>
            <li> so im pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> and i was excited for it</li>
            <li> The cooler setting does not burn my scalp and the hotter setting is great for a quick blast to get drying started on my long hair.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but is a bit louder than I expected.</li>
            <li> But, for the price, and if you can find some comfortable way to sit, it is worth it for those days when you don&#x27;t have time to head to the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I love this in that it dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li> I wanted the old timey kind and this sort of fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> but that is true about everything...</li>
            <li> wave full sew in.</li>
            <li> I figured I would love this one just as much, NOT the case at all.  </li>
            <li> so i of course used hi for a full set of rollers.</li>
            <li> but it does not work too good because i am short and the dryer is designed for those who are taller.</li>
            <li> so far so good, thanks!</li>
            <li> the airflow is not bad either considering where the holes are place...</li>
            <li> There is no way to adjust the height, the plastic is cheap, cheap, cheap, and other than a great deal of noise, nothing much comes out of the hood.</li>
            <li> The old styles were more sturdy and strong.  </li>
            <li> I guess you may need to be creative to use it on a table top or maybe a ocunter of some sort but other than that I&#x27;m pleased for my intended purposes.</li>
            <li> even though the back doesnt get that hot as the front its very warm.</li>
            <li> LIGHT WEIGHT AND JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HEAT</li>
            <li> High is indeed very high heat and perfect for when i do my deep conditioning treatments...</li>
            <li> Otherwise folds nicely and not very heavy.</li>
            <li> It barely dries my hair, but it will burn a hole in at the top of my scalp!</li>
            <li> It dries hair quickly and has adjustable heat settings.  </li>
            <li> Conair is not a trust worthy manufacturer.</li>
            <li> My old dryer was from Conair and being that I loved it so much</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I found it at the price I wanted to pay.</li>
            <li> The shipment is very very fast and secure.  </li>
            <li> I liked the hairdryer, I wish it was a little more powerful, but it did get the job done and was easy to use</li>
            <li> this is only good for people with really straight fine hair.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good but the bottom of the hair does not dry.</li>
            <li> The hi setting does get very hot.</li>
            <li> 1 dose not get very hot..</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect anything spectacular with this dryer,but i am satisfied with the product overall...</li>
            <li> Exactly!</li>
            <li> I love sitting under the dryer and being able to read or do handwork and getting my hair dried hands free.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, and I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and very stable when set up.</li>
            <li> Just know it&#x27;s worth the money, if it suits you.</li>
            <li> She owns a much older model (by a different maker) and loves it, but says this Conair dryer is much more powerful and dries her hair more quickly.  </li>
            <li> that was more than 40 yrs old...</li>
            <li> If you want to use rollers in your hair, be prepared to sit under this dryer as best as you can for a minimum of 2 1/2 hours, unless you have really thin hair.  </li>
            <li> So far i love this product.</li>
            <li> It darn near burned the top of my head</li>
            <li> worth upwards of 15 IQ points.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed it so far.  </li>
            <li> But for the price it is all worth it.  </li>
            <li> Gets super hot</li>
            <li> It works well, you just have to find a right chair and a surface with the right height</li>
            <li> Gets very hot at the top of the head and not  enough at the sides.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry hair effectively.</li>
            <li> It really works really well and is compact and light..</li>
            <li> Wish the younger generation would do their hair and look as beautiful as we did in those gone days of long ago.  </li>
            <li> It also works great for when I want to do a hot oil treatment or deep condition, I just throw on a shower cap put the heat on low</li>
            <li> Heat works well...not too hot.</li>
            <li> Hi setting is too hot</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect for my wife who recently broke a leg and obviously has had difficulty in performing basic functions like washing and drying her hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too much work done on my part!...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It only has holes at the top of the hat so the air is only released at the top of your head</li>
            <li> otherwise it is way too hot.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I got a remington hair dryer similar to this one and through the years and many moves it got lost.  </li>
            <li> WHICH OS TOO HOT</li>
            <li> The heat only comes out at the top and does not distribute evenly.  </li>
            <li> , what I did not like at all was the fact that the vents were only on the top of the hood</li>
            <li> Is portable and pretty.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using the dryer</li>
            <li> It gets hot where it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It is the first one I have had and would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> Must open vent at top to make it tolerable on either setting.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, there it was!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Conair and Amazon!  </li>
            <li> it wasnt just blowing heat out the top and with a prayer and tilt of head forward hopes it drys the back and sides of the head too....</li>
            <li> all around the top of the hood, and then the airflow from the opening in the back.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it should ....gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> Wife could not use it because it go to hot.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is short it dries the top</li>
            <li> This was my first hair dryer</li>
            <li> good product  but not a fit for my wife</li>
            <li> and I am good to go w/o having to spend another 20-30 bux at the salon or waste water steaming up the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love to keep my hair looking shinny and healthy and in the winter it gets dull and in the summer it looks fried.  </li>
            <li> Flimsy, does not dry well, not adjustable, will easily collapse on your head.</li>
            <li> Other wise it heats just fine, also because I would imagine if my goal were to completely dry my hair</li>
            <li> This product is pretty much going out of the box and into the recycle.  </li>
            <li> It requires a tall person to fit her head under this dryer properly and even then, pillows to sit on will be most likely required.  </li>
            <li> First I would like to thank Amazon, for shipping it so fast.</li>
            <li> Usual good quality after all it is Conair</li>
            <li> I can actually see this doing a good job on my hair if i were to roller set and get under the dryer no problem...if you are just looking for a cheap but gets the job done such as deep conditioning with heat for 15-20 minutes type of hair dryer</li>
            <li> it gets really hot when on the high setting (not the air the dryer itself) and on first use it tripped my electrical plug.....</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this dryer has the option to open and close the vent on the top of the hood which is where other dryers lack.  </li>
            <li> Easy to open and close</li>
            <li> what can i say about Hair dryer why do you insist on making people write long review about somthing when i say it was good isnt that enough</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has a large hood</li>
            <li> The low setting gives a warm heat that does not dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is nice and my hair is left dry and bouncy for the most part, but for some reason the bonnet doesn&#x27;t reach the back of my head.</li>
            <li> Cord does get   a little warm, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be any type of safety issue.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot on low after a while especially on the top your head.</li>
            <li> very noisy.</li>
            <li> BUT,WORK VERY SATISFACTORY.</li>
            <li> FOR THE MONEY MY MY WIFE IS VERY HAPPY.WOULD RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> this hooded hair dryer a reasonable price now</li>
            <li> This dryer works really well, just like the ones in salons.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfy with my order and it was delievery on time as promise.</li>
            <li> This is not a very fancy dryer but it sure works very well, the HI is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s also very noisy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t move around too much while you&#x27;re underneath the hood</li>
            <li> The adjustable length is not very practical and you have to be creative about where you put the dryer and</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and now I understand why.</li>
            <li> This dryer does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m very disappointedin this Bonnet Hair Dryer</li>
            <li> It works very well with my hair style and even if I used rollers it would comply.  </li>
            <li> It heats ups fast and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Big Rollers fit well underneath it.</li>
            <li> Simply put, cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> If you so much as sneeze while under this dryer the hood will fall and hit you in the face.  </li>
            <li> I rarely used it, but lately since I&#x27;ve been trying to save money, I&#x27;ve started to do my own hair at home.    </li>
            <li> The plastic casing is more fragile than the old ones but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> you have to stick your head all the way to the top of the hood to really get the air on your hair, and since it only really comes out of a few holes on the top</li>
            <li> Very Please to say I got more than I expected</li>
            <li> I always used one like that since my younger years (I am 80 years old now) and as soon as I saw it advertized I sent for it as I had not seen one in many years.  </li>
            <li> Item gets very,very hot, and there is no thermostat, only vents to open on the top, and that doesnt&#x27;t work to reduce the temperature.</li>
            <li> More airflow outside of the dryer than what actually dries your hair.  </li>
            <li> This Conair dryer is decent.</li>
            <li> But the heat is steady and well distributed.  </li>
            <li> Love this dryer works great on drying my dread locks at the base.</li>
            <li> it is sturdy and hot enough without burning you to a crisp.</li>
            <li> Hood height is too high.  </li>
            <li> Hood is so  high  </li>
            <li> but it is still to high</li>
            <li> you my table is NOT that high</li>
            <li> High almost burns my scalp.  </li>
            <li> And yes, i recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> The plastic switch that holds the hard hat up is kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li> My old dryer had cool, low, med and high settings.  </li>
            <li> So far, though, she REALLY likes it.  </li>
            <li> So far , I really like it</li>
            <li> That is when I discovered that this dryer was just a waste of space in the top of my closet.    </li>
            <li> The back of my neck did not get scorched which is rare with at home dryers.</li>
            <li> They are well worth the money and last!  </li>
            <li> On high, it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get your hair dry, depending on how many rollers you use and your hair type, but it definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I will say to be very careful with the plastic parts and it should be fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t leave it on high for very long because the cord gets very hot and starts to melt.</li>
            <li> No side vents, so the top of your head is dry first and becomes unbearably hot, while the sides and back are still wet.  </li>
            <li> As a pro hairstylist it&#x27;s I can&#x27;t live with out</li>
            <li> So it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> but I can live with that</li>
            <li> so i decided to just live with it and consider it a loss.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to any one who needs a new dryer.  </li>
            <li> I live in California.  </li>
            <li> The low gets hot enough and the high gets hot.</li>
            <li> This dryer is also very loud.  </li>
            <li> It can get hot in there, but its the same hotness   </li>
            <li> A bit old fashioned, but I&#x27;ve had one around for years!  </li>
            <li> It gets so hot in the middle my head</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with the hair dryer is my cord gets extremely hot, that I do not want to use it anymore</li>
            <li> and it works the same as when I first received it.</li>
            <li> so i have pretty coarse hair and the dryer</li>
            <li> I can sit under it a full hour, and my hair in some sections will still be dripping wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American Natural &amp; I purchased this hair dryer to get a better result out of my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> She loves the new one because it resembles the old one in so mnay ways but with improvements.  </li>
            <li> For years I used the Conair HH320LB Pro Styler Bonnet Dryer, and my hair dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li> dries as quickly as can be expected for the price we paid.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t a lot of hard hat hair dryers around any more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer to replace my old, old, old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer was just too loud for me.</li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> It is also quite loud.</li>
            <li> item arrived promptly and so far it works as promised.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and works as advertised with no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer as a gift for my 84 year old mom and it does not work as promised.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter who has coarse and very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> ...there are only two settings.which worked very well with my dreadlock..</li>
            <li> Just like our old one which is what we wanted</li>
            <li> incredibly loud too</li>
            <li> I have owned this dryer for nearly 5 yrs</li>
            <li> However I only wish it had an height adjustment, but for the price I really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised.  </li>
            <li> I used and dry the hair very fast</li>
            <li> It has become very much easier to dry my dreds.</li>
            <li> I am constantly moving my head left to right so that the heat can touch every side of my hair</li>
            <li> No holes to dry the bottom of your hair, only holes to dry the top.</li>
            <li> What can I say, this product does what it say it does - blows hot air to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer about a week ago because I&#x27;ve recently become natural and I needed a hooded dryer for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I went to Sally Beauty Supply, Target, and other Beauty Supply Stores...no success.  </li>
            <li> The scalp on the top of her head ended up burning while the back of her hair remained dripping down her back.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a decent hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive ones out there, including the Gold n&#x27; Hot (on  wheels &amp; the bonnet dryer).  </li>
            <li> This dryer has two speeds low and high</li>
            <li> The air blows only on the top of your head and not only dries it, it dries it out while leaving the back of your head soaking wet!  </li>
            <li> Got it quick, was just as described but a little on the noisy side.</li>
            <li> When mine finally conked out after about 10 years of use, I went to Walmart to purchase a new one; and to my surprise, they no longer carried them.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase my next dryer at store and not online to make sure that at least the dryer is adjustable.  </li>
            <li> This model doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as the previous one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> MORE than enough heat for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Being a natural girl with African American hair, I do not like high heat on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair never got dry in the back and in the crown area when using the Gold n&#x27; Hot dryers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to wash your hair at home and get the same results as the salon in half the time and price!!</li>
            <li> Runs a little to hot on high, takes longer on low, no option to regulate</li>
            <li> The high and low settings only regulate the fan, not necessarly the heat.</li>
            <li> It only has two setting low and high.</li>
            <li> The low takes forever and the high could possibly burn your hair off.</li>
            <li> It has no heat selection, only settings of high or low for air flow.  </li>
            <li> The dryer can be adjusted but barely.</li>
            <li> I finally replaced my old hair dryer that I had for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li> If you want your child to get a deep conditioning for 10 minutes on her natural hair, this dryer will not work at all.  </li>
            <li> It  has worked as expected and heats really well.  </li>
            <li> this dryer works well for me, no regrets</li>
            <li> I keep the vent closed for fast drying.  </li>
            <li> Like shop vac loud with a strained whistle going at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I normally wear my hair curly and did not bother to open the box and inspect it until now (4 months later)</li>
            <li> I finally convinced her it was time when the old one was broken in so many places</li>
            <li> It works really well and is extremely convenient.</li>
            <li> The only reason why i didnt give it five stars was because i kept having to turn on different sides to dry my whole head, i dont know if its</li>
            <li> Dryer does not dry my hair well at all.  </li>
            <li> I had to send this product back because the heat holes in the dryer head are to high to dry the back and sides of my head.</li>
            <li> While I did have straight hair when I first received this as a gift I did not find it as convenient to use because my hair was so thin it would literally feel like it was burning my scalp.</li>
            <li> High for very wet hair..low for styling.</li>
            <li> and it does not dry the back and lower sides of your hair properly.</li>
            <li> The same problem happens with Conair hard hat dryer as Laila Ali LADR5603--  too tall for short people because air flow only reached top half.</li>
            <li> If you are a die hard at home roller setter/wrapper/deep conditioner/wet setter/braid setter/twist outer/style molder/colorer then please spend a few extra coins for a better dryer.</li>
            <li> works great, stupid of me</li>
            <li> but it blows air hard enough that my hair gets dry just the same as my old dryer which I could rest really close to my head.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to the description, it is not adjustable, and it only has heating vents in the top making it difficult to get the back and sides of my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Ran really hot, or hardly at all.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m rating it four stars is that to me it feels quite cheap, the plastic is not very thick on the neck of the dryer and it&#x27;s a bit awkward to slip into the correct position.  </li>
            <li> To get a proper deep conditioning is next to impossible unless you only want the top of your head to be deep conditioned.  </li>
            <li> In spite of some of the negative reviews this dryer does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> And by that I mean hot air.</li>
            <li> and once again to quickly dry my boyfriends boxers last minute</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t dry the back of the hair.</li>
            <li> I sit on the toilet</li>
            <li> It dries my whole entire head compared to other people who have purchased this drier in the past.</li>
            <li> Hood is a bit too tall wish it could be lowered, a little loud simular to a blow dryer noise.</li>
            <li> I am a 27yr old black woman and i use this dryer to dry my 20in malaysian body</li>
            <li> I like the way it dries my hair, but it is difficult to find a place to sit where my head will fit up inside the hood.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for one a long time</li>
            <li> it dried my braids completely so if you&#x27;re wondering if it works for weave</li>
            <li> I like this dryer, but I have long hair and it does take a long time for my hair to get dry.</li>
            <li> It takes extremely long to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about it is the plastic smell which was overpowering the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li> There other featured I was totally displeased about</li>
            <li> so it falls over constantly and is EXTREMELY noisy.  </li>
            <li> Other places sale this unit for double the price, besides</li>
            <li> On-line with other companies, it sells for double.</li>
            <li> i used this dry proberbly 3 times in 3 months and it just stop working</li>
            <li> you head so that ever were can dry</li>
            <li> It did dry</li>
            <li> but when I dry my hair, the dryer goes on the table</li>
            <li> /&gt;Takes me longer to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> and I had to move my head around in circles to get the rest of my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use heat to dry my hair so</li>
            <li> but after that I have to move around to dry the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> The mechanism for adjusting the height is extremely difficult to use...and still doesn&#x27;t get it low enough to not have to sit on a stool or very high chair.</li>
            <li> and I rarely use it due to its poor performance.</li>
            <li> I wanted to dry my hair all over without having to hold the dryer!  </li>
            <li> Also the air only comes from out of the back, and not the front or the sides, and no matter what the setting is you&#x27;ll need to be under the dryer for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> i used it for 50 minute and instantly my hair dried</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected from Conair.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so much trouble I would send it back.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wanted to send it back to the manufacterer but I have no money to waste on shipping</li>
            <li> There is not much weight to it</li>
            <li> My hair is short - could be hard for someone with long hair.</li>
            <li> The adjustment for height is hard to use the dryer doesn&#x27;t dry the back of the hair, just the front.</li>
            <li> It usually takes my hair a long time to dry</li>
            <li> I know why, it is noisy and the air flow is too weak ,it takes too long to dry regular length hair</li>
            <li> I can see why other reviewers found the parts to be flimsy and plastic.  </li>
            <li> So while i&#x27;m twisting my head and separating my hair with one hand, i&#x27;m holding the bonnet up with the other.    </li>
            <li> I have had other dryers which&lt;br /&gt;were</li>
            <li> needs only a small place for storage..</li>
            <li> I take it with me for all of my side jobs as a stylist, and it&#x27;s small and portable enough to go everywhere.</li>
            <li> The heat distribution is not even as other reviewers have mentioned however</li>
            <li> , it is as advertized, i use this product every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I owned one from years past that had a larger hood and was easier to operate.</li>
            <li> This neat little gaget givese the conveinceof doing a deep condition at home for just the cost of the conditioner and a shower cap instead of paying those heavy prices at the salon.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not very good, it&#x27;s made of a thin plastic, looks like it would crack &amp; split if it got too hot.</li>
            <li> This is my third 1875 Watt Hard Hat Hair dryer by Conair Pro Style.  </li>
            <li> and  you have to have the recipt to return it is just not worth it</li>
            <li> and it your average hight table.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this to replace an old broken one.  </li>
            <li> was the fact that you can NOT adjust the hood at all its either up or down.  </li>
            <li> THE NECK PART WENT UP OR DOWN</li>
            <li> I wear small rollers and I have to hold the bonnet up to dry the end of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously considering sending it back.</li>
            <li> Works well for an item that cost less than 30.00.</li>
            <li> If you set it up before you sit under it and happen to tip it ever so slightly it will collapse.</li>
            <li> It is either hot or cold</li>
            <li> She has VERY thick, naturally curly shoulder length hair and due to health issues it is difficult for her to use a traditional hand held dryer.  </li>
            <li> so it does not feel like half your hear is not being dried.  </li>
            <li> It took about 20 minutes to dry my hair tho (which is weird, considering i almost burned myself the entire time)</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer a few years now</li>
            <li> and I can do it my PJ&#x27;s instead of getting all dressed up and and over paying a salon for what I can do for a few bucks.</li>
            <li> dried my hair within minutes (about 30 min).</li>
            <li> Overall, the workmanship is extremely poor.</li>
            <li> For the past few months I&#x27;ve been making do with it because I don&#x27;t have the receipt to return it.  </li>
            <li> this dryer is a waste of money, the hood does not adjust and it is difficult to get it positioned over your head so your hair actually dries.</li>
            <li> I miss my Lady Daisy terribly and this dryer makes me miss it more.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer replaced one my Mom had been using for the past 25 years or so.</li>
            <li> Not a very good product.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;she replaced her broken down model with it</li>
            <li> I needed a new one and was frustrated when I couldn&#x27;t find one in a brick and mortar store</li>
            <li> It is the noisest hard hat hair dryer I have ever heard.</li>
            <li> so it is to late to returen it which makes me want to kick myself for that.  </li>
            <li> and I have thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> WHICH IS TOO SLOW..</li>
            <li> You have to put it on high in order to get your hair dry and worst of all</li>
            <li> Not very happy with that.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how few holes there were for the air to come through in order to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I suspect this dryer is not good for any hair</li>
            <li> plus, it&#x27;s hard not to feel pampered when you&#x27;re sittin&#x27; under this beauty!</li>
            <li> Dryer works great, but bad bad bad design!</li>
            <li> The temperature is weak.</li>
            <li> Agonizingly slow!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer height is not adjustable making it very hard to use on my hair clients.</li>
            <li> Seems very dangerous I&#x27;m about to throw it away because the cord on the dryer and it currently looks melted and burnt too.</li>
            <li> Poor investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so annoying to have to rig up books to be tall enough to use it.</li>
            <li> Poorly made, did not work well at all.  </li>
            <li> So you have to reach up over and behind your head and the hood to fix</li>
            <li> False advertisement.  </li>
            <li> The worst part of it is that I found a dryer in my closet which I clearly forgot about</li>
            <li> Poor quality !</li>
            <li> Sadly it burnt my Mother in Laws scalp.</li>
            <li> This one is not too expensive and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER purchase a Conair product again since this company blatantly LIED about their product.  </li>
            <li> I failed to do that</li>
            <li> so ill keep it...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not a product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Once it is set up you must slide this terribly inadequate plastic catch up the back of the hood to hold it in place.  </li>
            <li> It would impossible to overstate the poor quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with this crap.</li>
            <li> but it is also potentially dangerous .</li>
            <li> Biggest piece of crap and worst money spent.</li>
            <li> i was afraid i was going to get shocked..</li>
            <li> i Read a lot of bad reviews about this product, but i went ahead and got it cause i needed one badly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that bad.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how flimsy it was.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to put a pillow under my butt and lower my head and just sit there for a while, and that cramps up my neck a lot :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointment.</li>
            <li> I HATE IT</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> and I hate it.</li>
            <li> I been using Conair hair dryers for years, but this one is the worst hair Dryer I ever used.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not the worst part    </li>
            <li> This dryer is terrible, there is no way to adjust the height of the dryer.</li>
            <li> Its the worst.</li>
            <li> I have this dyer and its the worst ever, it falls on your head</li>
            <li> I hate sitting under the dryer!</li>
            <li> Product us absolutely Terrible.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the worst ever made.  </li>
            <li> Terrible designing!!  </li>
            <li> Its smells real bad..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Biggest piece of crap and worst money spent. very noisy. Doesn&#x27;t have side air vents and doesn&#x27;t heat up well. Will be returning</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was just too loud for me. It did a pretty good job of drying my hair. I&#x27;m seriously considering sending it back.</li>
            <li> I love it. Its work immediately I turn on,it start to work . i used it for 50 minute and instantly my hair dried</li>
            <li> I love sitting under the dryer and being able to read or do handwork and getting my hair dried hands free. I do wish it had 3 settings instead of just the two. It is either hot or cold and I would love to have medium as it does get quite hot but I love being able to do something with my hands rather than holding the dryer.</li>
            <li> I been using Conair hair dryers for years, but this one is the worst hair Dryer I ever used.  It burns your hair. I didn&#x27;t have the box anymore, or I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> works well for color, conditioners, wetsets and perms.  Heat works well...not too hot. No timer, but don&#x27;t need one.  I have a timer of my own.</li>
            <li> TABLE TOP HAIR DRYER ONLY USED ONCE SO FAR BUT,WORK VERY SATISFACTORY. FOR THE MONEY MY MY WIFE IS VERY HAPPY.WOULD RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Not adjustable. My neck hurts.</li>
            <li> PROS - Makes a good nail dryer with the air from the motor.     CONS - Noisy.  More airflow outside of the dryer than what actually dries your hair.  Hood height is too high.  Hi setting is too hot and it&#x27;s too hot to the touch. Lo setting is more comfortable.   Hood is not adjustable.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on customer reviews. It would impossible to overstate the poor quality of this product. Doesn&#x27;t dry hair effectively. Hood is so  high  you need to sit on a stool. The mechanism for adjusting the height is extremely difficult to use...and still doesn&#x27;t get it low enough to not have to sit on a stool or very high chair. There are no air drying vents on the sides of the hood. Top of the head gets all the heat.  Poor investment. We had to return.</li>
            <li> Do  not buy this dryer it will stop working in 3 months i used this dry proberbly 3 times in 3 months and it just stop working and  you have to have the recipt to return it is just not worth it plus the heat come from one direction and you have to move you head so that ever were can dry skip it theirs a reason its priced so cheap</li>
            <li> I love the light weight and the size of the dryer.  It dries hair quickly and has adjustable heat settings.  I do wish that the dome had been made to adjust height.</li>
            <li> This dryer is good because it&#x27;s easy to use, but, I have a couple of hang-ups about it though: #1. it doesn&#x27;t have a timer. #2. the holes aren&#x27;t well distributed for even heat penetration. Overall, it&#x27;s a decent hair dryer. I use it to deep condition.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect for my wife who recently broke a leg and obviously has had difficulty in performing basic functions like washing and drying her hair. The convenience, performance and efficiency of this hair dryer has been a God send to her, and at such a bargain price.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how few holes there were for the air to come through in order to dry my hair.  It appears that the product is very cheap plastic.  It did dry ok but I was expecting a much better quality in the dryer.    Jean Cassada</li>
            <li> this hooded hair dryer a reasonable price now I know why, it is noisy and the air flow is too weak ,it takes too long to dry regular length hair I finished up drying my daughter&#x27;s hair with a hand held hair dryer!</li>
            <li> If you have all the time in the world…buy this hair dryer. Agonizingly slow!</li>
            <li> I agree with all the criticisms of this dryer plus one more. Adjustable? Huh? You can adjust your height under it but no instructions and no intuitive way to adjust the hight of the dryer. I have the more expensive Conair model as well and made the mistake of buying this one to keep at my kids&#x27; house for when I visit.</li>
            <li> Not a very good product.  Ran really hot, or hardly at all.</li>
            <li> This dryer works really well, just like the ones in salons. It can get hot in there, but its the same hotness   you would experience in a salon. Heat can be controlled by how deep you stick your head in there. Cord does get   a little warm, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be any type of safety issue. This dryer makes it so that you can easily  watch tv or read a magazine while drying your hair. I use them for my dreadlocks and it works great!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this rigid cover hair dryer for my wife.  She is very pleased with the results.  It works well for her.</li>
            <li> This Conair dryer is decent. The extension makes it most convenient to use while sitting on the floor, which can be convenient. Also the air only comes from out of the back, and not the front or the sides, and no matter what the setting is you&#x27;ll need to be under the dryer for at least an hour. But, for the price, and if you can find some comfortable way to sit, it is worth it for those days when you don&#x27;t have time to head to the hair salon.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price. Gets super hot so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I can see why other reviewers found the parts to be flimsy and plastic.  It could very easily break and be unrepairable.  But the heat is steady and well distributed.  The cooler setting does not burn my scalp and the hotter setting is great for a quick blast to get drying started on my long hair.  I will say to be very careful with the plastic parts and it should be fine.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it regularly. It does a good job drying and is easy to use. She actually sets up her art table and works while drying her hair!</li>
            <li> Item gets very,very hot, and there is no thermostat, only vents to open on the top, and that doesnt&#x27;t work to reduce the temperature. The high and low settings only regulate the fan, not necessarly the heat. It is also quite loud. What did I say?  Exactly! That&#x27;s my point. Cheaply made, and I am very dissapointed. Damm those Chinese. But until I can find a better hooded dryer, I guess this will have to do.</li>
            <li> Great! Everything I expected from Conair. MORE than enough heat for my thick curly hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my mother a while ago and to this day she uses it every week. Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> item arrived promptly and so far it works as promised. dries as quickly as can be expected for the price we paid.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this to replace an old broken one.  It arrived on time and works as advertised with no problems so far.  She said she likes it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is nice and my hair is left dry and bouncy for the most part, but for some reason the bonnet doesn&#x27;t reach the back of my head. I wear small rollers and I have to hold the bonnet up to dry the end of my hair. Just know it&#x27;s worth the money, if it suits you.</li>
            <li> The same problem happens with Conair hard hat dryer as Laila Ali LADR5603--  too tall for short people because air flow only reached top half.</li>
            <li> I bought the Conair Pro Style 1875 dryer about 6 months ago.    I rarely used it, but lately since I&#x27;ve been trying to save money, I&#x27;ve started to do my own hair at home.    That is when I discovered that this dryer was just a waste of space in the top of my closet.    It barely dries my hair, but it will burn a hole in at the top of my scalp! I am constantly moving my head left to right so that the heat can touch every side of my hair all while running my fingers through so the heat can get to the inside of the hair. It&#x27;s just too much work done on my part!...and that&#x27;s not the worst part    The dryer is CONSTANTLY COLLAPSING on my head!! Not once, not twice, but all the time I&#x27;m under the dryer. So while i&#x27;m twisting my head and separating my hair with one hand, i&#x27;m holding the bonnet up with the other.    PLEASE DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I liked the hairdryer, I wish it was a little more powerful, but it did get the job done and was easy to use</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer as a gift for my 84 year old mom and it does not work as promised. The adjustment for height is hard to use the dryer doesn&#x27;t dry the back of the hair, just the front.Also, it has collapsed while she was sitting under it , so not only doesn&#x27;t it work properly but it is also potentially dangerous . I would definitely not buy this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfy with my order and it was delievery on time as promise. Excellent Excelllent 10 Stars</li>
            <li> This dryer is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> No complaints, Swift delivery!</li>
            <li> J-U-N-K!!!!!!    This product is pretty much going out of the box and into the recycle.  The air blows only on the top of your head and not only dries it, it dries it out while leaving the back of your head soaking wet!  I bought it for my daughter who has coarse and very curly hair.  The scalp on the top of her head ended up burning while the back of her hair remained dripping down her back.  I recommend spending more for a better product and keep one more appliance out of the garbage (recycle), which is where this one is going very soon.</li>
            <li> Though i cut my lox... I still am using it for the next set of lox</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift (2015) for my mom, so I can&#x27;t speak of the longevity of this product just yet.  So far, though, she REALLY likes it.  She owns a much older model (by a different maker) and loves it, but says this Conair dryer is much more powerful and dries her hair more quickly.  She has VERY thick, naturally curly shoulder length hair and due to health issues it is difficult for her to use a traditional hand held dryer.  This item has been great for her.  The only reason I&#x27;m rating it four stars is that to me it feels quite cheap, the plastic is not very thick on the neck of the dryer and it&#x27;s a bit awkward to slip into the correct position.  Sturdier construction would make it a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> works great, stupid of me i didnt check power ratings, 110V, am using 240v here</li>
            <li> ...this dryer w/ bonnet provides excellent value for money and helps me achieve my one-of-a-kind coif (please see picture in profile)...plus, it&#x27;s hard not to feel pampered when you&#x27;re sittin&#x27; under this beauty!</li>
            <li> A bit old fashioned, but I&#x27;ve had one around for years!  They work for me!</li>
            <li> No holes to dry the bottom of your hair, only holes to dry the top. Height adjustment did not work. Cheap made.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made ! Poor quality !</li>
            <li> The product was received as advertised and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This is not a very fancy dryer but it sure works very well, the HI is quite reasonable.It gets the job done in an hour or so depending on how you position yourself and texture of hair.I think it is excellent if you get the right position for the vents to have direct access to the hair.It works well for the price.</li>
            <li> Flimsy, does not dry well, not adjustable, will easily collapse on your head.</li>
            <li> The product was here fast and it works great.  I would use them again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Excellent dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this in that it dries my hair fast. Hood needs to be deeper - but does the trick.  My hair is short - could be hard for someone with long hair.</li>
            <li> As a pro hairstylist it&#x27;s I can&#x27;t live with out it it&#x27;s portable and amazing for freelance work specially since a travel loads I planes. Check me out at AntonioBerducci. Com &amp;#34;the curly hair specialist&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works great, but is a bit louder than I expected.</li>
            <li> Sadly it burnt my Mother in Laws scalp. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> When it works its okay, but the hood has a habit of collapsing when it gets too hot. The part that holds up the hood does not keep the hood up.</li>
            <li> LIGHT WEIGHT AND JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HEAT</li>
            <li> I wanted to dry my hair all over without having to hold the dryer!  I wanted the old timey kind and this sort of fits the bill.  The plastic casing is more fragile than the old ones but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> this dryer is a waste of money, the hood does not adjust and it is difficult to get it positioned over your head so your hair actually dries. you have to stick your head all the way to the top of the hood to really get the air on your hair, and since it only really comes out of a few holes on the top it just burns a few spots and doest really affect the rest of your hair. this is only good for people with really straight fine hair. not for rollers or any types of styling .....</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser of 40+ years...needed this for my very occasional jobs at home...it will do the job...easy to store (biggest reason for this choice, over one on wheels)  Somewhat noisy (who cares) WONDERFUL heat...could use some more air holes.  This is not made as good as the one I had to toss that was more than 40 yrs old...but that is true about everything...can&#x27;t see how it adjusts in height</li>
            <li> I was given this dryer as a present. It does get very hot on low after a while especially on the top your head. I have had other dryers which&lt;br /&gt;were much better but they aren&#x60;t on the market any more so have to put up with what you can get. It&#x60;s also very noisy.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t a lot of hard hat hair dryers around any more. This one is not too expensive and gets the job done. My only complaint about it is the plastic smell which was overpowering the first few times I used it. I&#x27;m happy to say that did subside. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect!  Adjustable hood height and plenty of room for a head full of rollers!</li>
            <li> Not the best dryer but it gets the job done I guess. It only has two setting low and high. The low takes forever and the high could possibly burn your hair off. My head doesn&#x27;t fit comfortable with rollers on I have to turn even so often to make sure each section is drying. The dryer can be adjusted but barely. If you do use this dryer make sure you have a comfortable chair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t leave it on high for very long because the cord gets very hot and starts to melt. It melted one regular extention cord. Seems very dangerous I&#x27;m about to throw it away because the cord on the dryer and it currently looks melted and burnt too.</li>
            <li> This dryer is terrible, there is no way to adjust the height of the dryer. It&#x27;s so annoying to have to rig up books to be tall enough to use it. Dryer works great, but bad bad bad design!</li>
            <li> I wish i bought a bonnet dryer. Its the worst. It gets so hot in the middle my head and it doesnt matter if its on Hi or Lo. It took about 20 minutes to dry my hair tho (which is weird, considering i almost burned myself the entire time) the only reason i haven&#x27;t returned it is because i missed the return policy. But if u ignore the burning then its a great dryer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and it does the job. Not as many as features as I would have liked but it looks nice and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have this dyer and its the worst ever, it falls on your head and then you can&#x27;t adjust it.</li>
            <li> Very Please to say I got more than I expected...there are only two settings.which worked very well with my dreadlock..High for very wet hair..low for styling. needs only a small place for storage..lightweight, adjustable height.it replaced a hood dryer I had for 10 years. price was a go for! lol</li>
            <li> The plastic switch that holds the hard hat up is kind of flimsy. Don&#x27;t move around too much while you&#x27;re underneath the hood and you&#x27;ll be fine. If they can redesign the hood lock on this device, it&#x27;d be a five star item, because my roller sets come out swell when using it.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer a few years now and I rarely use it due to its poor performance. It only has holes at the top of the hat so the air is only released at the top of your head and it does not dry the back and lower sides of your hair properly. You have to keep turning and twisting your head to get some of the air to blow on each quadrant of your head. The adjustable length is not very practical and you have to be creative about where you put the dryer and the chair you use in order to sit under the it comfortably. Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> I like this dryer, but I have long hair and it does take a long time for my hair to get dry. I have to use it on low heat otherwise it is way too hot.  For the money it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I finally replaced my old hair dryer that I had for over 15 years.  This dryer works great.  I cannot adjust the height but it blows air hard enough that my hair gets dry just the same as my old dryer which I could rest really close to my head.  It is lightweight and only has high/low setting.  My old dryer had cool, low, med and high settings.  It does the job.</li>
            <li> Its not terrible dryer.  My only issue is that they listed &amp;#34;Adjustable Height Control&amp;#34; as a feature but YOU CANT ADJUST!!!!!!!! False advertisement.  I wouldnt have purchased it if there wasnt a way to control the height.</li>
            <li> Works great! I take it with me for all of my side jobs as a stylist, and it&#x27;s small and portable enough to go everywhere.</li>
            <li> Years ago I got a remington hair dryer similar to this one and through the years and many moves it got lost.  I had been looking for one a long time and I found it at Amazon.com.  I am very pleased with this item.  I would recommend the product and your service to anyone.</li>
            <li> Just like our old one which is what we wanted</li>
            <li> The hi setting does get very hot. The lo setting works just fine and I have thick, curly hair. It usually takes my hair a long time to dry but I can sit under this dryer 20 minutes. I hate sitting under the dryer! I have gone to the salon and have to sit an hour or more under theirs! Adjusting the height might be an issue for some. If you have a chair that can raise up and down, that will be perfect. Overall, I like this dryer. I use it about twice a month for deep conditioning treatments or to set twist styles. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> It works well, you just have to find a right chair and a surface with the right height so you would not have a sore neck from the use of it.</li>
            <li> It does what I need it to do. Really nice dryer with good settings. I save a lot of money and I still get the same salon quality.</li>
            <li> Lacks essentiel qualities like adjustability of the height, temperature. Gets very hot at the top of the head and not  enough at the sides.</li>
            <li> I am a 27yr old black woman and i use this dryer to dry my 20in malaysian body wave full sew in. it dried my braids completely so if you&#x27;re wondering if it works for weave yes. I&#x27;ve only used it once since i bought it and once again to quickly dry my boyfriends boxers last minute and it worked for that too lol so im pretty satisfied. so far so good, thanks!</li>
            <li> The unit does the job of drying hair just fine, but would be easier to use if the dryer hood height was adjustable.</li>
            <li> Product us absolutely Terrible. .I wanted to return it as soon as I iopened it..but big bulky box and time not a lixury of mine.. ad claimed 3settings. .OFF IS NOT A SETTING! .IT HAS 2 HI WHICH OS TOO HOT AND LOW WHICH IS TOO SLOW..incredibly loud too..I HATE IT</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with the hair dryer is my cord gets extremely hot, that I do not want to use it anymore</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works great!</li>
            <li> good product  but not a fit for my wife</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the worst ever made.  It&#x27;s height is not adjustable and it&#x27;s hood is not adjustable.  Conair lied about this product.  The heat only comes out at the top and does not distribute evenly.  It requires a tall person to fit her head under this dryer properly and even then, pillows to sit on will be most likely required.  To get a proper deep conditioning is next to impossible unless you only want the top of your head to be deep conditioned.  If you want your child to get a deep conditioning for 10 minutes on her natural hair, this dryer will not work at all.  If you want to use rollers in your hair, be prepared to sit under this dryer as best as you can for a minimum of 2 1/2 hours, unless you have really thin hair.  I suspect this dryer is not good for any hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, I opened this dryer two months after I purchased it so I think I have passed my time limit to return it to Amazon.  In any case, a lesson well learned.  I will purchase my next dryer at store and not online to make sure that at least the dryer is adjustable.  I would have never purchased this dryer if I knew it was not adjustable.  I will NEVER purchase a Conair product again since this company blatantly LIED about their product.  Conair is not a trust worthy manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It  has worked as expected and heats really well.  Wish the hood hiegbt was adjustable.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer to replace my old, old, old hair dryer.  My previous dryer was great but it just stopped working after many year.  So it was time for a new one.  This dryer has two speeds low and high nothing in-between, ok I did not like that feature but I can live with that, what I did not like at all was the fact that the vents were only on the top of the hood so there is no air flow around the sides of your head.  There other featured I was totally displeased about was the fact that you can NOT adjust the hood at all its either up or down.  I don&#x27;t know about you but when I dry my hair, the dryer goes on the table and I site facing the dryer and it would be nice to adjust the hood so it does not feel like half your hear is not being dried.  I did try to face fwd but it is still to high and I don&#x27;t feel that I am fully under it comfortably.  I had put something under it so it would tilt forward.  Mind you my table is NOT that high and it your average hight table.  Unfortunately I normally wear my hair curly and did not bother to open the box and inspect it until now (4 months later) so it is to late to returen it which makes me want to kick myself for that.  My old dryer was from Conair and being that I loved it so much I figured I would love this one just as much, NOT the case at all.  I am extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with this crap.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer works great on drying my dread locks at the base. I have owned this dryer for nearly 5 yrs and it works the same as when I first received it. The heat distribution is not even as other reviewers have mentioned however I like that because it drys my scalp and roots without drying out the rest of my lock. It also works great for when I want to do a hot oil treatment or deep condition, I just throw on a shower cap put the heat on low and I am good to go w/o having to spend another 20-30 bux at the salon or waste water steaming up the bathroom. While I did have straight hair when I first received this as a gift I did not find it as convenient to use because my hair was so thin it would literally feel like it was burning my scalp. When I had my afro it was a  perfect drying tool.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  Poorly made, did not work well at all.  I returned it.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Have had this for 2 years now. Paid $25.00 with free shipping and the dryer still going strong. VERY happy:)</li>
            <li> My wife wanted an &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; hair dryer so I bought her this one and she is a very happy camper.</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap. If it wasn&#x27;t so much trouble I would send it back. There is no way to adjust the height, the plastic is cheap, cheap, cheap, and other than a great deal of noise, nothing much comes out of the hood. And by that I mean hot air. Just gonna throw it away.</li>
            <li> Excellent item and excellent price!!!!  The shipment is very very fast and secure.  Is portable and pretty.  I used and dry the hair very fast</li>
            <li> I received it on time. It works really well and is extremely convenient. It is a good wattage and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Seems like it will last a while but only time can tell that. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Dryer does not dry my hair well at all.  I can sit under it a full hour, and my hair in some sections will still be dripping wet.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer about a week ago because I&#x27;ve recently become natural and I needed a hooded dryer for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning. This is my first time using the dryer and I hate it. The price was reasonable and now I understand why. It is so noisy I can&#x27;t take it. The worst part of it is that I found a dryer in my closet which I clearly forgot about and now i&#x27;m stuck with an overly noisy dryer that I will never use again. If you plan on buying a dryer please please read the product reviews from people who have purchased it. I failed to do that and if I did I wouldn&#x27;t be stuck with a noisy dryer.</li>
            <li> A good useful product. I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I would not advise anybody to buy this product. It is the noisest hard hat hair dryer I have ever heard. It takes extremely long to dry my hair. I wanted to send it back to the manufacterer but I have no money to waste on shipping so i decided to just live with it and consider it a loss.</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for, ,very good  thanks</li>
            <li> To pay for gasoline, i need to color my own hair, and sit under a dryer. This is perfect for my needs, and it is exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> overall i do like my purchase, it is as advertized, i use this product every other day.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has a large hood so I can use fat curlers.  It is easy to set up and is not as noisy as some dryers I have used.  It is light weight and very stable when set up. It is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This dryer does the job very well. It gets hot where it is supposed to. It is the first one I have had and would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> blow holes are only at the top would be great if they were at the sides</li>
            <li> No complaints does the job for me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaply made. They just don&#x27;t make them like they use too. I &#x27;m very disappointedin this Bonnet Hair Dryer</li>
            <li> No side vents, so the top of your head is dry first and becomes unbearably hot, while the sides and back are still wet.  On high, it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> I brought this dryer from walmart it was 25 with shipping.  Anywho this is the best for deep conditioning! even though the back doesnt get that hot as the front its very warm. So far i love this product.</li>
            <li> this dryer works well for me, no regrets</li>
            <li> The only con is that it doesn&#x27;t reach the back of my head. I&#x27;d have to put a pillow under my butt and lower my head and just sit there for a while, and that cramps up my neck a lot :(</li>
            <li> This dryer if fantastic!  It works very well with my hair style and even if I used rollers it would comply.  Set-up is very easy.  There is great heat control from the top of the hood as well as the knob.  Easy to open and close</li>
            <li> This was my first hooded hair drier and I love it! It dries my whole entire head compared to other people who have purchased this drier in the past. I deep condition my hair all the time with this wonderful Conair hair drier in about 30 mins or longer. Packaging and delvery was excellent without any problems from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great drier!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not very good, it&#x27;s made of a thin plastic, looks like it would crack &amp; split if it got too hot. I would not recommend this hair dryer for anyone.  I had to pay shipping charges to ship it back to the company that sells it. Not very happy with that. I am out shipping charges. Will definitely not use this company again.</li>
            <li> Had a Conair for 10 years that finally died.  This model doesn&#x27;t seem to be as powerful as the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;Takes me longer to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice dryer.  I would recommend it to any one who needs a new dryer.  It is comfortable to sit under and read your book while drying the hair.  Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Kathy in Vancouver, WA</li>
            <li> Perfect! Works great!</li>
            <li> I like the way it dries my hair, but it is difficult to find a place to sit where my head will fit up inside the hood.  I am short, and the neck of dryer is tall.  It should have more adjustments to make it easier to use.  Price was good though, so glad I have it.</li>
            <li> It has no heat selection, only settings of high or low for air flow.  High almost burns my scalp.  Low works but is slower.  Must open vent at top to make it tolerable on either setting.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, inexpensive, and good for home use. Got it quick, was just as described but a little on the noisy side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive ones out there, including the Gold n&#x27; Hot (on  wheels &amp; the bonnet dryer).  My hair never got dry in the back and in the crown area when using the Gold n&#x27; Hot dryers.  For years I used the Conair HH320LB Pro Styler Bonnet Dryer, and my hair dried very quickly.  When mine finally conked out after about 10 years of use, I went to Walmart to purchase a new one; and to my surprise, they no longer carried them.  I went to Sally Beauty Supply, Target, and other Beauty Supply Stores...no success.  Finally, I thought &amp;#34;Amazon--bet I can find it there.&amp;#34;  Sure enough, there it was!  I ordered it immediately!  I love the fact that this dryer has the option to open and close the vent on the top of the hood which is where other dryers lack.  I keep the vent closed for fast drying.  I am a licensed Cosmetologist who uses the commercial/industrial dryers at that salon, but at home, I use my Conair...works just as good!  Thanks Conair and Amazon!  Never stop making this product!...</li>
            <li> Very disappointment. I should have read the reviewer before I brought this dryer. Because of the price it caught my attention. but it doesn&#x27;t dry the back of the hair. Terrible designing!!  That all I have to say.</li>
            <li> I love my hair!!😃 thank you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what a difference it made when coloring hair at home.  Intensified the color and saturation of the&lt;br /&gt;home hair coloring process.  Great price on Amazon...</li>
            <li> Love it.  It really works really well and is compact and light..It heats ups fast and gets the job done.Thanks</li>
            <li> Use it weekly and I LUV it!!!  It&#x27;s so easy to wash your hair at home and get the same results as the salon in half the time and price!!</li>
            <li> sent back!! was cheap!!</li>
            <li> I love it works great. Height is fine for my table but I can see where others might have a problem</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t fit me , I WAS NOT TALL  TO FIT UNDER IT SO I HAD TO SIT ON A BIG CHAIR COUTON  TO FIT MY HEAD UNDER IT .  I HAD ONE BEFOR THAT THE NECK PART WENT UP OR DOWN AND I though this one did it too .</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it and I have had it over a year. Works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the hardest part I had was figuring out where to put it when I was finished using it</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS DRYER!!! I  purchased this dryer hoping that I could do my hair at home. The temperature is weak. You have to put it on high in order to get your hair dry and worst of all I have not been able to adjust the dryer to the height that I need. I wish I could get my money back. I won&#x27;t even give the dryer away. It is fit for the recycle bin.</li>
            <li> I love to keep my hair looking shinny and healthy and in the winter it gets dull and in the summer it looks fried.  I live in California.  This neat little gaget givese the conveinceof doing a deep condition at home for just the cost of the conditioner and a shower cap instead of paying those heavy prices at the salon. and it onlytakes 15 minutes and I can do it my PJ&#x27;s instead of getting all dressed up and and over paying a salon for what I can do for a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I still have this.  It works great.  I think I got a very good deal on this Conair pro style.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> what can i say about Hair dryer why do you insist on making people write long review about somthing when i say it was good isnt that enough Now if it was 1,000,000 than that is different but it was not and i am done wether you like it or not</li>
            <li> I needed a new one and was frustrated when I couldn&#x27;t find one in a brick and mortar store so I bought this one.  I was shocked at how flimsy it was.  There is not much weight to it so it falls over constantly and is EXTREMELY noisy.  It darn near burned the top of my head and I had to move my head around in circles to get the rest of my hair dry.  I&#x27;m the type of person who procrastinates in sending things back and ends up stuck with them but I put it immediately back in the box after using it and will make a point of sending it back before the week&#x27;s end.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectation.</li>
            <li> Excllent in all respects.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the hair dryer.  I always used one like that since my younger years (I am 80 years old now) and as soon as I saw it advertized I sent for it as I had not seen one in many years.  Seems like no one carries it anymore. They depend on hand held blowers but i needed this because i still roll my hair and the bonnet dryer is the best for drying with rollers. Wish the younger generation would do their hair and look as beautiful as we did in those gone days of long ago.  And yes, i recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> i wanted a bonnet hair dryer to deep condition my hair....i remember the one my mother had over 20 years ago...they sure dont make them like that anymore, that one provided FULL drying coverage it wasnt just blowing heat out the top and with a prayer and tilt of head forward hopes it drys the back and sides of the head too....which is what this one does...i was thinking of returning it but after researching others as it turns out they all seem to be like this...so ill keep it...it gets really hot when on the high setting (not the air the dryer itself) and on first use it tripped my electrical plug.....</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price.  Only drawback is lack of height adjustment.  This requires only that either the platform it&#x27;s resting on and/or the seating of the user be adjusted instead.  Excellent Winter head warmer and brain circulation stimulator worth upwards of 15 IQ points.</li>
            <li> It works fine i love it i use it every sunday its nice and hot. its works fine like a dryer in a salon</li>
            <li> In spite of some of the negative reviews this dryer does exactly what I need it to do. I&#x27;m an African American Natural &amp; I purchased this hair dryer to get a better result out of my deep conditioning treatments. I only gave this a 3 because it&#x27;s not mobile &amp; it&#x27;s so huge to store.. Other wise it heats just fine, also because I would imagine if my goal were to completely dry my hair it&#x27;d take a great deal of time but I don&#x27;t use heat to dry my hair so for me this is great with my plastic cap just to activate my conditioning and hot oil treatments. But it adjusts just fine &amp; I&#x27;m comfortable under it. You do need to be a bit creative about where to put it I suppose. I sit on the toilet w/it perched on my portable drawers I use for storage. I guess you may need to be creative to use it on a table top or maybe a ocunter of some sort but other than that I&#x27;m pleased for my intended purposes.</li>
            <li> Works well for an item that cost less than 30.00. Very light and compact. I do apt of road travel so this dryer works well.</li>
            <li> When you turn it on setting 2. Its smells real bad..&lt;br /&gt;There are no holes for the heat to come out in the sides. Setting. 1 dose not get very hot..&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to know one..</li>
            <li> What can I say, this product does what it say it does - blows hot air to dry your hair. However I only wish it had an height adjustment, but for the price I really don&#x27;t have any complaints. Other places sale this unit for double the price, besides you can easily find ways to adjust this for your need s</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect anything spectacular with this dryer,but i am satisfied with the product overall...the seller did not tak elong at all to get my product out to me and it arrived packaged nicely and undamaged. I am using the dryer now as i write this review and even though it is very cheaply made i am impressed with the heat settings. High is indeed very high heat and perfect for when i do my deep conditioning treatments...the airflow is not bad either considering where the holes are place...all around the top of the hood, and then the airflow from the opening in the back. I can actually see this doing a good job on my hair if i were to roller set and get under the dryer no problem...if you are just looking for a cheap but gets the job done such as deep conditioning with heat for 15-20 minutes type of hair dryer then i say buy this one. Its ok for its price.</li>
            <li> First I would like to thank Amazon, for shipping it so fast. It came a day earlier which was awesome because i was able to get my hairstyle for the weekend! So the hairdryer has two controls hi and lo so i of course used hi for a full set of rollers. Im african american so i have pretty coarse hair and the dryer dried my hair within minutes (about 30 min). The only reason why i didnt give it five stars was because i kept having to turn on different sides to dry my whole head, i dont know if its because i have a big head or the dryer needs adjusting ( which i havent figured out yet but i also havent read the manual) so hope i helped. I would recommend this to others! The back of my neck did not get scorched which is rare with at home dryers. :)</li>
            <li> Works great.  Just wish it had a medium setting.</li>
            <li> Love it ...does exactly what it should ....gets really hot.  Used a task chair to adjust to dry height this worked out great!</li>
            <li> It does the job.&lt;br /&gt;However, I owned one from years past that had a larger hood and was easier to operate.</li>
            <li> Next best thing to being at the hair salon.  Have not had a chance to use much, but worked great the 2 times I used..</li>
            <li> U get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Usual good quality after all it is Conair</li>
            <li> Product came on time and I&#x27;m in love with this dryer. Being a natural girl with African American hair, I do not like high heat on my hair. The low setting gives a warm heat that does not dry my hair. I am very pleased with this product and delivery time</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised.  My hairdresser recommended a home unit since I like to sit under her hairdryer and read.  A great treat at home!</li>
            <li> The hood collapses. The hood does not stay mounted</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to still be able to find this product on the market.  The price was terrific. I have enjoyed it so far.  Heats well</li>
            <li> This is my third 1875 Watt Hard Hat Hair dryer by Conair Pro Style.  They are well worth the money and last!  I bought this one so it could be sent to my summer vacation rental.</li>
            <li> Wife could not use it because it go to hot.</li>
            <li> i Read a lot of bad reviews about this product, but i went ahead and got it cause i needed one badly. Plus my guts said \\&quot;go with it\\&quot; and honestly it was worth it. I have the dyer for 4 months and i have no issues. The loudness of the dyer that most people complain about is Tolerable! Big Rollers fit well underneath it. I just got some HUGE ROLLERS and will let you know if it fits under it! AM a University Student, and its a great product for me!</li>
            <li> Hood is a bit too tall wish it could be lowered, a little loud simular to a blow dryer noise. Otherwise folds nicely and not very heavy.</li>
            <li> So far , I really like it</li>
            <li> It works but its not as good as described. Overall, the workmanship is extremely poor. Simply put, cheap plastic. Contrary to the description, it is not adjustable, and it only has heating vents in the top making it difficult to get the back and sides of my hair dry. Since my hair is short it dries the top ok but after that I have to move around to dry the rest of my hair. On second thought I should have returned it. Unfortunately, this is not a product I would recommend. I will continue my search for something better.</li>
            <li> REALLY GREAT GETS VERY HOT</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT CAN&#x27;T BE ADJUSTED FOR THE HEIGHT OF THE PERSON  I DO NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I guess I should say &amp;#34;Mom loves it&amp;#34;.  Met her needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> bought this for an elderly neighbor who does not do very&lt;br /&gt;much outside her home&lt;br /&gt;she replaced her broken down model with it&lt;br /&gt;so I was happy to help her out&lt;br /&gt;much appreciated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally decided to replace this dryer.  For the past few months I&#x27;ve been making do with it because I don&#x27;t have the receipt to return it.  This dryer hood does not click into place and is not height adjustable.  I will say again  -  This dryer hood does not click into place and is not height adjustable.  Once it is set up you must slide this terribly inadequate plastic catch up the back of the hood to hold it in place.  Oh and you have to do that after you are sitting under it.  So you have to reach up over and behind your head and the hood to fix (notice I didnt say &#x27;lock&#x27;)the hood in place. If you set it up before you sit under it and happen to tip it ever so slightly it will collapse. If you so much as sneeze while under this dryer the hood will fall and hit you in the face.  I have not used it one time without this happening.  I miss my Lady Daisy terribly and this dryer makes me miss it more.  This dryer is also very loud.  Like shop vac loud with a strained whistle going at the same time.  It&#x27;s just that bad.  I wish I never purchased it and can&#x27;t wait to replace it.  If you need cheap heat this is fine.  If you are a die hard at home roller setter/wrapper/deep conditioner/wet setter/braid setter/twist outer/style molder/colorer then please spend a few extra coins for a better dryer.</li>
            <li> Runs a little to hot on high, takes longer on low, no option to regulate</li>
            <li> worked good...definitely does heat hte top more than the rest...i had to recently throw out because i could see the electricity a bit through it...i was afraid i was going to get shocked..i threw it out</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift as well. But guess they liked it.</li>
            <li> No problems and drys my hair well. There are only two settings, however the temperatures are great. The low gets hot enough and the high gets hot. The shipment was really a big surprise. I received this product within two days time from ordering it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair dryer. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer height is not adjustable making it very hard to use on my hair clients.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer replaced one my Mom had been using for the past 25 years or so. I finally convinced her it was time when the old one was broken in so many places I just could not fix it anymore though the motor was fine.  She loves the new one because it resembles the old one in so mnay ways but with improvements.  She is delighted with this Conair HH320LR.. Could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This was my first hair dryer and i was excited for it but it does not work too good because i am short and the dryer is designed for those who are taller. It works pretty good but the bottom of the hair does not dry.</li>
            <li> I had to send this product back because the heat holes in the dryer head are to high to dry the back and sides of my head.</li>
            <li> My wife is very pleased with the dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets super hottttt! It arrived quickly and I found it at the price I wanted to pay.Great value.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mom and I use it more than she does. I can&#x27;t believe I purchased this dryer at the listed price. On-line with other companies, it sells for double. It&#x27;s high powered and good quality. I think I have to buy myself one.</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice but is doing the job.  It is definitely not like the ones they used to build before.  The old styles were more sturdy and strong.  Bought this for my mom who had a Westinghouse model that had been with her for over 30 years and now is when it broke.  But for the price it is all worth it.  I like the fact that you can fold it and close it.</li>
            <li> I love the item. It has become very much easier to dry my dreds. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get your hair dry, depending on how many rollers you use and your hair type, but it definitely gets the job done. it is sturdy and hot enough without burning you to a crisp.</li>
