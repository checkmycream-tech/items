            <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful product.</li>
            <li>These strips go great with the BodyHonee wax removal kit; I was so excited about the use of the wax removal kit that I had to buy more strips for extra use when I need it.</li>
            <li>also I am pretty sure there are more than 100 in the pack...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they are made of, but the quality is super!</li>
            <li>The wax also doesn&#x27;t &#x27;seep through&#x27; like with a lot of wax strips,  and for $10 you get 100 of them which is really a super deal!  </li>
            <li>This product was overall great and easy to use</li>
            <li>I have tried all the cheap stuff attempting to save money and they just kept tearing.</li>

            <li>Delivery was very fast and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>These are also good for lots of household chores that paper towels aren&#x27;t strong enough for.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>I reused the same strip more than 6 times or more!</li>

            <li>They are nice and thick and they were a great price.</li>
            <li>They are thick and have a good quality good for newbies like me</li>
            <li>Great product ...worked just as expected</li>
            <li>I love that they come with so many strips, you definitely get your monies worth!</li>
            <li>When you are trying to remove a wool sweater from ur guys back, you are going to need many more strips than what comes in the waxing kit.  </li>
            <li>just as advertised, easy to use, sturdy and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product, it may seem like just hair removal strips, however, it is the path to smooth skin, carefree feel, and with no hassle.</li>
            <li>The strips are soft to the skin and aren&#x27;t scratchy like most wax removal strips are.</li>
            <li>but it was worth</li>
            <li>All you men have fun with your girlfriends or wives</li>
            <li>This product is totally worth the money</li>
            <li>If you utilize it right, def worth the money</li>
            <li>For a long time I dreaded having to use any, but my experience using this product was much more pleasant than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>My experience has actually been good thus far, with these strips.</li>
            <li>These were fantastic - better than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>These are excellent strips that remove hair with ease without a big mess or ripping!</li>
            <li>They are good - could make them  a little longer</li>
            <li>My item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m completely satisfied even if I can only use them once per wax because they are washable!</li>
            <li>how many times I reused the same one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve even been able to use both sides to make them last longer.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>These are fairly thin strips - good for waxing those fine hairs on the face.  </li>
            <li>These may be a little pricier than other strips, but the quality is perfect.</li>
            <li>Just like the first product these work really well.  </li>
            <li>The material is also easy to cut which is helpful for waxing different areas.</li>
            <li>These were easily cut to shape and come in such a large pack that I didn&#x27;t worry about making mistakes.</li>
            <li>Item as described, but because of my lack of knowledge on use of the product, I found the product too large for my use.  </li>
            <li>Not much else to say, they grip the wax fine and seem well made!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much else.</li>
            <li>These strips will not tear and are VERY durable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>They work really well.</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely order it again.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the same ones that come with the kit, and they work fantastic.</li>
            <li>Work really well.</li>
            <li>I really like these strips.</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super gentle but also pretty durable at the same time.  </li>
            <li>This works better than any other brand i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Makes waxing simple and fairly straightforward.</li>
            <li>Decent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>high quality.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package I was surprised as I had not received wax strips but instead beading needles!!</li>
            <li>Its good for body hair removal as the strips are very thick and holds wax well off the skin.</li>
            <li>i tried tearing one just for the fun of it and NOPE, no tearing possible.</li>
            <li>Bodyhonee strips did not tear even once and are nice and thick</li>
            <li>You can easily maneuver or cut them down to side.</li>
            <li>I used nearly half a package, washed them with soap and water and once they dried they were good as new.</li>
            <li>As pain free as wax can, and very long lasting.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this wax kit; and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>They work really well with the bodyhonee wax and are the same as the ones in the kit.</li>
            <li>BodyHonee is batting 1000 with us so far</li>
            <li>I like that these come individual, so I don&#x27;t have to buy a whole kit every time.</li>
            <li>They are so cottony soft and work like a professional strip.</li>
            <li>Price is right and quality is what I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many kinds of strips for hair removal and these are by far durable and thick and grip the wax well!</li>
            <li>Really strong, thick strips.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of kits that included pretty flimsy strips that make the process not only more messy but also more painful.  </li>
            <li>I have only used a couple different types of wax strips and these are very high quality and are definitely washable/reusable.</li>
            <li>I do not have super coarse hair though, so I&#x27;m not sure if others have run into that.</li>
            <li>These strips, on the other hand, are thick and strong and never ever teared.</li>

            <li> Great product ...worked just as expected</li>
            <li> I love that they come with so many strips, you definitely get your monies worth!</li>
            <li> When you are trying to remove a wool sweater from ur guys back, you are going to need many more strips than what comes in the waxing kit.  </li>
            <li> just as advertised, easy to use, sturdy and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product, it may seem like just hair removal strips, however, it is the path to smooth skin, carefree feel, and with no hassle.</li>
            <li> The strips are soft to the skin and aren&#x27;t scratchy like most wax removal strips are.</li>
            <li> but it was worth</li>
            <li> All you men have fun with your girlfriends or wives</li>
            <li> This product is totally worth the money</li>
            <li> If you utilize it right, def worth the money</li>
            <li> For a long time I dreaded having to use any, but my experience using this product was much more pleasant than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> My experience has actually been good thus far, with these strips.</li>
            <li> These were fantastic - better than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> These are excellent strips that remove hair with ease without a big mess or ripping!</li>
            <li> They are good - could make them  a little longer</li>
            <li> My item is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m completely satisfied even if I can only use them once per wax because they are washable!</li>
            <li> how many times I reused the same one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve even been able to use both sides to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> These are fairly thin strips - good for waxing those fine hairs on the face.  </li>
            <li> These may be a little pricier than other strips, but the quality is perfect.</li>
            <li> Just like the first product these work really well.  </li>
            <li> The material is also easy to cut which is helpful for waxing different areas.</li>
            <li> These were easily cut to shape and come in such a large pack that I didn&#x27;t worry about making mistakes.</li>
            <li> Item as described, but because of my lack of knowledge on use of the product, I found the product too large for my use.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say, they grip the wax fine and seem well made!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much else.</li>
            <li> These strips will not tear and are VERY durable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> They work really well.</li>
            <li> and I would absolutely order it again.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the same ones that come with the kit, and they work fantastic.</li>
            <li> Work really well.</li>
            <li> I really like these strips.</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super gentle but also pretty durable at the same time.  </li>
            <li> This works better than any other brand i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Makes waxing simple and fairly straightforward.</li>
            <li> Decent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> high quality.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I was surprised as I had not received wax strips but instead beading needles!!</li>
            <li> Its good for body hair removal as the strips are very thick and holds wax well off the skin.</li>
            <li> i tried tearing one just for the fun of it and NOPE, no tearing possible.</li>
            <li> Bodyhonee strips did not tear even once and are nice and thick</li>
            <li> You can easily maneuver or cut them down to side.</li>
            <li> I used nearly half a package, washed them with soap and water and once they dried they were good as new.</li>
            <li> As pain free as wax can, and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this wax kit; and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> They work really well with the bodyhonee wax and are the same as the ones in the kit.</li>
            <li> BodyHonee is batting 1000 with us so far</li>
            <li> I like that these come individual, so I don&#x27;t have to buy a whole kit every time.</li>
            <li> They are so cottony soft and work like a professional strip.</li>
            <li> Price is right and quality is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many kinds of strips for hair removal and these are by far durable and thick and grip the wax well!</li>
            <li> Really strong, thick strips.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of kits that included pretty flimsy strips that make the process not only more messy but also more painful.  </li>
            <li> I have only used a couple different types of wax strips and these are very high quality and are definitely washable/reusable.</li>
            <li> I do not have super coarse hair though, so I&#x27;m not sure if others have run into that.</li>
            <li> These strips, on the other hand, are thick and strong and never ever teared.</li>
            <li> I wax my arms at home - I&#x27;m not a professional, but I think the item is as described.  </li>
            <li> Not too stiff but not to soft either.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing these to wax your hair, as it definitely didn&#x27;t do anything for me and simply made a mess instead.</li>
            <li> actually sticks to the wax to remove hair, was a little more expensive than other brands</li>
            <li> Will likely try their other hair removal products.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased other (cheaper) wax strips on Amazon before buying these.</li>
            <li> I only have to use them once every month and a half or so.</li>
            <li> The material was thick enough that the wax never oozed through, plus I could use the strip multiple times.  </li>
            <li> I cut these in half (hotdog) because they&#x27;re too long.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, you must use these when using sugar wax.  </li>
            <li> Been using them with BodyHonee wax and other heated waxes that I&#x27;ve purchased at Ulta.</li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t seep thru like those other wax strip and get your fingers all sticky.</li>
            <li> They are extremely durable...</li>
            <li> Seems like an endless supply.</li>
            <li> These strips have never let me down.</li>
            <li> I did, however, cut them down.</li>
            <li> I curt them in half to wax my brows and lip</li>
            <li> I have purchased cheaper strips for half the price and ended up throwing them in the&lt;br /&gt;trash</li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li> It really grabs the wax and makes it much less painful to do so.</li>
            <li> It used to be thick but my recent purchase of Non-woven Hair removal waxing strips were SO thin.</li>
            <li> These strips, while a little more&lt;br /&gt;expensive are made of a very thick, durable material.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all with the hard wax.</li>
            <li> Mine must have had at least 120 in the pack.</li>
            <li> Other strips I&#x27;ve tried were very weak and teared each time I pulled.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these strips and the wax kit to anyone who is serious about hair removal.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work with hard wax!</li>
            <li> They ripped me off almost every time and were so thin that the wax seeped through them.</li>
            <li> I just got started using wax because in the past I have been afraid of the pain.</li>
            <li> But for me, they were useless.</li>
            <li> but found them expensive.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are great quality. Hold up well and haven&#x27;t torn on me yet, have used it on two occasions until now.</li>
            <li> My item is exactly as described. Delivery was very fast and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a beautiful product. Everything is perfect!</li>
            <li> They are thick and have a good quality good for newbies like me</li>
            <li> These are great! I&#x27;ve used many kinds of strips for hair removal and these are by far durable and thick and grip the wax well!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok. When you are trying to remove a wool sweater from ur guys back, you are going to need many more strips than what comes in the waxing kit.  Glad I decided to order these on the side.  Came in handy.</li>
            <li> Its good for body hair removal as the strips are very thick and holds wax well off the skin. As I have a sensitive soft skin I found it harsh for my arms and legs area else it&#x27;s good quality product in non woven category.</li>
            <li> Wife is very satisfied with the quality of the product. It works well and it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> These do the job.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you must use these when using sugar wax.  The sugar wax only comes with a couple so this is simply a necessary accessory if you&#x27;re going to use sugar wax.  I cut these in half (hotdog) because they&#x27;re too long.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much else. I ordered a block of waxing strips. I gave it 4 stars because I felt they could have been cheaper.</li>
            <li> They are good - could make them  a little longer</li>
            <li> This product is the best available in market. Truly satisfied</li>
            <li> Superb waxing strips, just the kind of quality I was hoping for. Wax did not seep through the strip like others I have tried. Great quality overall and worked great with the wax.</li>
            <li> I use the BodyHone wax, so these are my go to strips. hese non woven strips are easy to press on and remove. I just got started using wax because in the past I have been afraid of the pain. My experience has actually been good thus far, with these strips. I especially love that they come in a pack of 100, which lasts me for a long time. You can easily maneuver or cut them down to side. I would recommend these strips to everyone.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and quality wax strips! They work really well with the bodyhonee wax and are the same as the ones in the kit. These strips will not tear and are VERY durable. I reused the same strip more than 6 times or more! Other strips I&#x27;ve tried were very weak and teared each time I pulled. Bodyhonee strips did not tear even once and are nice and thick so the wax never seeps through!</li>
            <li> Love these! Been using them with BodyHonee wax and other heated waxes that I&#x27;ve purchased at Ulta. I can cut them to what size I need so they&#x27;re going to last me a while. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this wax kit; and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the whole thing.  I was especially glad that the strips were as sturdy as they were.  I have used a lot of kits that included pretty flimsy strips that make the process not only more messy but also more painful.  No worries here.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I liked how I could customize my waxing experience based on the shape of the wax strip.  These were sturdy yes, but still malleable enough to be cut into perfectly-sized pieces.  This made it easy for me to remove hair from even the tiniest area on my body.  I would recommend these strips and the wax kit to anyone who is serious about hair removal.</li>
            <li> Best waxing strips to be used at home.</li>
            <li> This product worked great and was very easy to use! I loved that it came with a large amount of strips as well.  This product was overall great and easy to use and I would repurchase again when I run out of the ones I already have.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to wax!</li>
            <li> The non-woven hair removal wax strips are easy to use. They don&#x27;t tear apart or rip when you pull on them. The strips are soft to the skin and aren&#x27;t scratchy like most wax removal strips are. The wax stays on the strip and don&#x27;t drip wax all over like most strips do. These are excellent strips that remove hair with ease without a big mess or ripping! I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I ordered these strips at the same time I ordered the Body Honee Body Wax and I received it a day after I got the wax. When I opened the package I was surprised as I had not received wax strips but instead beading needles!! When I called amazon they said that they don&#x27;t package the product, Body Honee does so they can&#x27;t gaurantee if I ordered it again I&#x27;ll actually get what I want. I don&#x27;t even understand how a beauty supplier managed to ship me beading needles. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I need to order it again. These are excellent</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;d found the perfect in home waxing product, the strips were next on my list. These were easily cut to shape and come in such a large pack that I didn&#x27;t worry about making mistakes. These are the absolute perfect companion to the BodyHonee Wax.</li>
            <li> Great packaging and great product!</li>
            <li> Great product ...worked just as expected</li>
            <li> Good product, great price, fast shipping perfect!!</li>
            <li> It used to be thick but my recent purchase of Non-woven Hair removal waxing strips were SO thin. What happened???</li>
            <li> Great very happy with the quality</li>
            <li> These are what they say they are. Easily washable and reusable</li>
            <li> These wax strips are not fabric so they are not as flexible obviously, but they get the job done and I would probably repurchase them in the future. Each strip can also be used multiple times.</li>
            <li> I love these! I have only used a couple different types of wax strips and these are very high quality and are definitely washable/reusable. I just use them for myself so I like that I can wash them and they stay sturdy. They are nice and thick and they were a great price. I just re-read that these can be used 5x per wax and I haven&#x27;t tried that out yet but I&#x27;m completely satisfied even if I can only use them once per wax because they are washable! thank you!</li>
            <li> Great item.You can&#x27;t beat for the price. I use the microwaveable brazilin hit wax and it works awesome. No issues.</li>
            <li> So much better than most waxing strips I&#x27;ve used. It really grabs the wax and makes it much less painful to do so.</li>
            <li> actually sticks to the wax to remove hair, was a little more expensive than other brands but it was worth the money will be buying again</li>
            <li> I wax my arms at home - I&#x27;m not a professional, but I think the item is as described.  Sticks to the wax and rips out the hair!</li>
            <li> These strips have never let me down. They are durable enough to be reused a couple of times even with my coarse hair. The material is also easy to cut which is helpful for waxing different areas. I&#x27;ve now used them with three different waxes and never had an issue. Great value for the money and something I plan to keep stocked in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> Good price for a 100 pack, as I seem to go through them rather quickly. I use them with BodyHonee wax and have had no problems. Will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Decent. Not as smooth as most waxing cloth. Does the job.</li>
            <li> These stops work so much better than the ones you get with your wax. I cut these in 1/4 strip for easier manuverability. It&#x27;s high quality and the thickness is perfect. The wax doesn&#x27;t seep thru like those other wax strip and get your fingers all sticky. It&#x27;s a good price for how much you get. If you utilize it right, def worth the money</li>
            <li> These trips are great to work with. Not too stiff but not to soft either. I love that they come with so many strips, you definitely get your monies worth!</li>
            <li> These wax strips worked great! They are extremely durable...i tried tearing one just for the fun of it and NOPE, no tearing possible. I don&#x27;t know what they are made of, but the quality is super!</li>
            <li> This works better than any other brand i&#x27;ve tried. I have tried all the cheap stuff attempting to save money and they just kept tearing. These never teared and were very strong.</li>
            <li> These strips function as advertised.  Makes waxing simple and fairly straightforward.</li>
            <li> They work really well. My girlfriend loves torturing me waxing my chest and back with them. All you men have fun with your girlfriends or wives</li>
            <li> Great quality epilating strips! They did not tear once no matter how many times I reused the same one. Wax never seeped through the strips either...also I am pretty sure there are more than 100 in the pack...Mine must have had at least 120 in the pack. I 100% Recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I got wax recently for myself from BodyHonee and it worked so well that my girlfriend started using it.  We then saw here on Amazon that they had these waxing strips and, since their wax was so darn good, my sweetie decided to get these too for her legs.  Just like the first product these work really well.  They&#x27;re super gentle but also pretty durable at the same time.  She complains about wax strips that rip but not with these! The wax also doesn&#x27;t &#x27;seep through&#x27; like with a lot of wax strips,  and for $10 you get 100 of them which is really a super deal!  BodyHonee is batting 1000 with us so far and we both hope they keep it up.  Kudos to a great company and excellent products!</li>
            <li> Good quality wax strips.  They do not tear apart like the others out there on the market and shoot for the price...im in.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and can&#x27;t say if I like it or not yet</li>
            <li> shipped fast and work great too thanks for great product.</li>
            <li> Whenever I buy the Body Honee wax I always have extra wax. I like that these come individual, so I don&#x27;t have to buy a whole kit every time. Can&#x27;t beat them for the price. As a while, the kits work great. As pain free as wax can, and very long lasting. I only have to use them once every month and a half or so. Very easy to use. I recommend them to anyone who waxes.</li>
            <li> Did what they said they&#x27;d do</li>
            <li> Item as described, but because of my lack of knowledge on use of the product, I found the product too large for my use.  I did, however, cut them down.</li>
            <li> Very good quality - they really are durable and never ripped apart. Bonus: There is definitely more than 100 in the pack! Great, high quality strips and I will repurchase as soon as I need more.</li>
            <li> These are re-usable! I used nearly half a package, washed them with soap and water and once they dried they were good as new.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am very impressed with the quality of these hair removal strips. For a long time I dreaded having to use any, but my experience using this product was much more pleasant than I expected it to be. This product is totally worth the money and I would absolutely order it again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I highly recommend it. Worked better than the wax removal strips provided in the kit bought at a retail store. Will likely try their other hair removal products.</li>
            <li> These are also good for lots of household chores that paper towels aren&#x27;t strong enough for.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased other (cheaper) wax strips on Amazon before buying these. Let me tell you...you get what you pay for. They ripped me off almost every time and were so thin that the wax seeped through them. These strips, on the other hand, are thick and strong and never ever teared. Never had any wax seep through either. If you are considering wax strips, just remember you get what you pay for. These may be a little pricier than other strips, but the quality is perfect.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Really strong, thick strips. Seems like an endless supply. They work well. I curt them in half to wax my brows and lip but they are big enough for legs or arms.</li>
            <li> I obviously don&#x27;t know how to use these things.  They seem to have something to do with waxing, and I have no experience with waxing.  I ended up throwing them out.  Maybe for someone who knows about these things, they&#x27;re just the ticket.  But for me, they were useless.</li>
            <li> The strips are a great addition to the All Natural Body Honee Sugar Wax. They are so cottony soft and work like a professional strip. I had no problems with them. I do not have super coarse hair though, so I&#x27;m not sure if others have run into that. I am glad I bought a box because I will need them in addition to what came with the wax.</li>
            <li> These are very nice to use with the wax I purchased. I will be ordering these again when I need them.</li>
            <li> really good. but found them expensive. maybe a cheaper version is available</li>
            <li> I bought these as additional wax strips to go with the BodyHonee wax kit. They&#x27;re the same ones that come with the kit, and they work fantastic. Not much else to say, they grip the wax fine and seem well made!</li>
            <li> Truly are reusable and affordable.  Makes waxing at home a breeze.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Working for me as desired</li>
            <li> great quantity &amp; great product.</li>
            <li> Works great and I&#x27;ve even been able to use both sides to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work with hard wax! Useless.</li>
            <li> Daughter uses it to wax-- works great, according to her.</li>
            <li> works great. no ripping. high quality.</li>
            <li> It worked just the way it should.</li>
            <li> Work really well. Flexible</li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t waste your time with this product. These strips don&#x27;t stick to wax very well, and while they were a good deal, they aren&#x27;t very effective. I would not recommend purchasing these to wax your hair, as it definitely didn&#x27;t do anything for me and simply made a mess instead.</li>
            <li> These strips go great with the BodyHonee wax removal kit; I was so excited about the use of the wax removal kit that I had to buy more strips for extra use when I need it. I absolutely adore this product, it may seem like just hair removal strips, however, it is the path to smooth skin, carefree feel, and with no hassle. This is one product you do not have to worry about great results when it comes to hair removal! A must buy!</li>
            <li> This is good quality and good price. I recommend this product. I bought it to go with the wax warmer also purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just a wax strip. Did its job.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. And the amount of them there is perfect because they will last me a while. Fast shipping and overall happy with my product!</li>
            <li> These are fairly thin strips - good for waxing those fine hairs on the face.  Price is right and quality is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have purchased cheaper strips for half the price and ended up throwing them in the&lt;br /&gt;trash because they tore every time I used them! These strips, while a little more&lt;br /&gt;expensive are made of a very thick, durable material. My wax never soaks through and&lt;br /&gt;they don’t rip while I am using them. Recommend!</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Works well with any type of wax.</li>
            <li> just as advertised, easy to use, sturdy and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like these strips. I just cut them to what ever size that I need. They are so much better than the ones that come with the kit. I like that the wax doesn&#x27;t come through them and onto your fingers.</li>
            <li> These epilating strips were great. They&#x27;re the perfect size for any coverage, while offering plenty of gripping space. The texture was smooth and soft, which is ideal for sensitive areas. I used these strips with the BodyHonee Sugar Wax and the results were awesome.</li>
            <li> These were fantastic - better than I had expected.  The material was thick enough that the wax never oozed through, plus I could use the strip multiple times.  Excellent quality!</li>
            <li> These work very well. Very good quality. Good price for what you are getting.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all with the hard wax. Maybe just the way we used it.</li>
