            <li>Very coconut ( which is fine with me)</li>
            <li>This is a pollutant and a cheap alternative to real jojoba beads.</li>

            <li> The skin on my neck used to feel bumpy and dry and was not pleasant to touch.</li>
            <li> I usually use gloves but wanted a body wash.</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite small for the price.  </li>
            <li> You will be shocked when you apply this product because you will wonder why you didn&#x27;t bottle this stuff yourself on that last trip down to P.R.</li>
            <li> if you want some serious exfoliation, I think nothing comes close.</li>
            <li> Wish it were less expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read the reviews and was sold. I love to exfoliate and wanted to try a new product. I usually use gloves but wanted a body wash. Purchased this and used it right away. The smell is Okay, not as great as the reviews make it sound.  Very coconut ( which is fine with me) but with more of a plastic smell undertone. Meh. The bottle is quite small for the price.  The beads look more like tiny plastic beads and they don&#x27;t exfoliate all that great. My skin was not as soft as when I use other products, so I&#x27;ll stick to what works! Exfoliating gloves:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very  satisfied with this product. It makes my skin feel so soft. It has really made a difference on my neck and face. The skin on my neck used to feel bumpy and dry and was not pleasant to touch. It is now silky soft :)</li>
            <li> Great product and I will buy it again. Smell so good!</li>
            <li> Love the body scrub.  Fragrance is great and exfoliates as described.</li>
            <li> Smells great  I did not know it was only 8 ounces</li>
            <li> Average results that I could have received from much cheaper products.  I expected more for the money I paid.</li>
            <li> Good product and not to harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> This arrived well packaged within just a few days.  Have used four times since arrival and I love the way my 60+ skin feels after using this body scrub!  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> I used this with SmitCo LLC&#x27;s washable exfoliating gloves from Amazon.  It&#x27;s heaven in the shower to scrub, get rid of dead skin, and have a tingly clean body.  I even used with a very gentle circular motion on face &amp; neck  -  it worked just the same.  Plan to do once a month for face maintenance and as frequently as necessary for body.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love it! It smells very tropical! I also recommend this:  http://amzn.to/1HuUex6  if you want some serious exfoliation, I think nothing comes close. This:  http://amzn.to/1HuUex6  made my skin glow like I was back in my early 20s. I found out about it from a video that I watched and when I tried it, my dark spots are disappearing in a few weeks use, my skin became more radiant and so smooth! What I love about it ( http://amzn.to/1HuUex6  )  is that it&#x27;s not complicated, no chemicals, nothing! and I feel so pampered whenever I use it. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. It&#x27;s my absolute favorite skin product.</li>
            <li> It is a soft scrub with a great smell and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love the product but it&#x27;s too small for the high cost.</li>
            <li> The moment I start using this body scrub, the fragrance transports me to a luscious tropical island.  Additionally, this scrub really makes my skin soft and moisturized, I love it!!</li>
            <li> We purchased Coconut Surf Body Scrub about 1 month ago. Both my husband and I use it on a daily basis.  I use it on my arms, chest and back and have noticed significant improvement.  My husband uses it as a face wash.  We both like how refreshing it makes our skin feel and we love the fragrance. Reasonably priced! Purchasing another bottle today!</li>
            <li> I received my body scrub late last week and was looking forward to showering with it but I kept forgetting to put it in the shower. It was sitting on my counter so the other night I decided to try using it to wash my face before I went to bed - WOW, it made the skin on my face so soft, almost like I had just had a facial and when I lay down in bed I could still smell that incredible smell. I drifted off to sleep smelling the wonderful coconut aroma. The next morning I remembered to take it into the shower with me. I used it on my entire body and now ALL of my skin feels soft and my bathroom was filled with the incredible aroma of a tropical beach! I wish I knew about this stuff during the winter when I had such dry skin that even lotions didn&#x27;t help, I think it would have made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub. I have tried several scrubs and this one stands out because it does not feel oily on the skin and I like the fact that it foams up like soap. The fragrance is very light and pleasant. I have been using it every time I take a shower and it really lives up to the description.</li>
            <li> Amazing you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> used it a few times since purchased..LOVE the aroma and the whole scrub feeling  ..I really  love how my body feel after using that product..I am a creature of comfort and love care of myself while alive ..this is right up my street...try it you might like it ...:-)</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub! Summer days are too fleeting and this keeps the memories flowing throughout the year!</li>
            <li> Very good exfoliant by too pricey for its size!</li>
            <li> The second ingredient is polyethylene, plastic beads. This is a pollutant and a cheap alternative to real jojoba beads. Polyethylene beads get washed down the drain and into our oceans. I would love to use this product if it stopped using polyethylene.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful. It smells like you&#x27;re at the beach every time you get in the shower. Your skin feels baby soft after use. The bottle is tiny, though... the height of the bottle is close to the height of a deck of cards. Wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is really outstanding.  A very positive addition to my &amp;#34;home spa&amp;#34; routine!</li>
            <li> Scrub does smell delicious. I wish it made more suds. I mix with another body wash to make a little lasting.</li>
            <li> What I like about this scrub is that it doesn&#x27;t dissolve like most others ones once you start to massage onto the skin. The consistency is a great sandy coconut scrub that smells great and feels moisturizing at the same time. I was sold initially just with the fact that it contains sand, no better scrub than that for exfoliating.. FYI, I only use scrubs in general on arms, legs, and feet.. Other parts are prone to break out in general so just keep that in mind when using exfoliators containing oils or moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I definitely recommend! A little quarter size drop goes a long way.. Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my skin feel very soft</li>
            <li> This feels so wonderful and leaves my skin feeling so soft! The oils in the scrub are heavenly and the scent is so refreshing! Highly recommend this scrub!</li>
            <li> leaves your skin feeling smooth just like after spending a day at the beach!  You will be shocked when you apply this product because you will wonder why you didn&#x27;t bottle this stuff yourself on that last trip down to P.R.</li>
            <li> I purchased this body scrub after a friend recommended it to me.  I have to say I really like it.  The scrub foams up nicely, leaves my skin very soft and has a great scent!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best. It smells great and makes your skin feel so soft. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Item was promptly delivered and well-packaged.  I used the product the first day and am hooked!  The scrub feels great on my skin, and I love the scent.  I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this body scrub so I had to try it for myself.  The scrub made my skin feel so soft, and the aroma is amazing.</li>
