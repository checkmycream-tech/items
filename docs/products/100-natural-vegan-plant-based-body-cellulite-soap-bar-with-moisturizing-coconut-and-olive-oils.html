            <li> Very nice Soap, i Use it everyday  smells good and leave my skin nice and soft!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap in the shower with the Jalico cellulite massager and then finishing off with Naturalico cellulite cream after my shower and I am happy to say there has been a very noticeable decrease in the rippley look of my thighs. I will continue to use this product as well as the others.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the shower twice already and I have stretch marks and within these two showers my stretch marks have almost completely gone away!!! I am very very very pleased with this!!</li>
            <li> I like it, it leaves my skin soft and not with so many razor bumps, about cellulite I think is working but still to soon to see a big difference, I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> this soap is great all around, not just for cellulite / I use it in shower for general cleansing, it is nice and gentle/ sudsy and easy to hold / would order 3 more again, good price and great product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was surprised. I didn&#x27;t think it work as well as it has. I&#x27;ve used it over the last couple of months every other day on my thighs, butt, and stomach. It had drastically reduced the appearance of my cellulite spots and lines and helped tighten my skin. This though was alongside healthy eating, exercise.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see different yet .... one month ago now</li>
            <li> Amazing soap! Skin feels soft and not dryed out!</li>
            <li> Very effective--good for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I told you I was going to order me 3 more bars of that so it&#x27;s amazing I love it and I love the way my skin feels when I get out the shower</li>

            <li> I really like this soap. Initially, I was having a hard time using it in conjunction with the mesh that it comes with. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just a clumsy person or not but it just wasn&#x27;t working. Anyway, I&#x27;ve had better results using it with my exfoliating bath gloves. It lathers up like crazy and has a nice minty scent. After workouts it cleans you up very well and tingles all over. I do think it tightens up the skin so it probably will effect the appearance of cellulite over time. I just think it&#x27;s an amazing soap for toning/tightening.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! I have sensitive skin and it has helped with it!</li>
            <li> Is just soap didn&#x27;t do nothing for me</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap.  Makes skin feel soft and improves texture.  Will order again</li>
            <li> Love these, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s going to help reduce my cellulite but I like the soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, I ordered more after using my first barn definitely worth it. No strange ingredients, everything is natural and is not tested on animals. I would recommend I&#x27;m giving some to my mom!!</li>
            <li> Loved the product, my only problem was the string came out of the mesh bag it came with.</li>
            <li> Now, let me say this before I write anything else: ladies, I do not know if this will help cellulite. I am man, and if a dude has cellulite, I hope it is just a very light mobile phone. My decision to purchase this soap was based on 3 reasons: 1, it is 100% plant based, paraben, sulfate &amp; gluten free; 2, to add and assist with the exfoliating regimen I have in place daily and nightly, and 3, to help with razor bumps. For a few months now, razor bumps started appearing under my chin, an area I do not shave unless I use a straight razor to shape up my goatee. I cleanse my skin and my sanitize my razors thoroughly, but the problems started and I had no solution. So, in searching out all natural solutions to help me, I came across this and decided to add it to my new and improved step-by-step and to be patient for results. I have been using this now for 5 days, and the results are visible. My skin is smoother and I keep rubbing it like I&#x27;m trying to get a genie to pop out! &amp;#34;You have 3 wishes.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;For all my wishes, stay out of my chin!&amp;#34; And fellas, if you purchase this to aid in diminishing razor bumps like myself, decide that you will do nothing to irritate those areas even more so you give the product an opportunity to work. Indeed, I keep tweezers nearby, but with a proper cleansing regimen, the need to use tweezers has reduced greatly because I decided to allow what I use to work. Shave less and this will benefit, as well. Even down to what I drink and eat and the amount of rest I get, along with reducing stress on the body, these factors also have their place in making your skin healthier and keeping it that way. Remember, the skin is the biggest organ we have (thanks, SGL!) so whatever you put on the skin, it is literally drunk up! Now ladies, if you are looking to reduce and/or remove cellulite, it is simply because you want to keep your sexy. Keep that attitude, but be sure to halt the very things that are causing those problems in the first place. If you see it, so does the man you are hoping to attract. Be careful, though, his cellulite can take pictures and post them on facebook and Twitter!If you see it, so does the man you are hoping to attract. Be careful, though, his cellulite can take pictures and post them on facebook and Twitter!</li>
