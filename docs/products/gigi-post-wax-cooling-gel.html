            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Cooling sensation great after wax and leaves smooth skin.</li>
            <li>After waxing this is so nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Oil would probably work better...</li>
            <li>it takes the pain away and also the redness i love this gigi post waxing cooling gel</li>
            <li>pleased with the product it arrived on time and as it was described in the add.  </li>
            <li>its pretty good</li>
            <li>Cooling, refreshing, clean sensation.</li>
            <li>When I had the cooling gel applied in the salon it was a refreshing experience, however this Gigi post wax cooling gel almost burns before it begins to cool.  </li>
            <li>Love to use it right after brazilian wax&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found if I use After Wax Lotion first then the gel it is more cooling than stingy.  </li>
            <li>cool an</li>
            <li>but I even use it after quickly shaving.</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t need this big of a bottle, I should have paid more attention to the size.</li>
            <li>The bottles are large and you really get a lot of product.  </li>
            <li>and with it being such a huge bottle I do not foresee me paying out to get a brazilian any time soon.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really remove wax well.</li>
            <li>This is very soothing and calms the redness.  </li>
            <li>I wiped it off as fast as I could.</li>
            <li>This clear cooling gel works pretty well</li>
            <li>It does not really have a smell to it and that is fine with me.</li>
            <li>The bottle, which is not sealed, had opened, and half the following message:  &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Previously when I would go to a aesthetician to get it done she always applied something afterwards that felt very cool and soothing</li>
            <li>because it leaves behind a sticky feeling on your hands, similar to when you put gel in your hair which I don&#x27;t like but all in all, pretty good.</li>
            <li>I am a novice to home waxing but this gel really does seem to help cool the area down.</li>
            <li>Due to the high cost of brazilian waxing in my area (due to its novelty) I decided to start doing my own.</li>
            <li>But what it doesn&#x27;t say is that ALCOHOL is the second ingredient after the first ingredient, which is water.</li>
            <li>I must say it is a large bottle for a low price.</li>
            <li>YOU&#x27;RE BETTER OFF BUYING PLAIN OLD ALOE VERA GEL, which is what I use on my clients, and it actually DOES give a cooling effect, as opposed to a burning one.</li>
            <li>Normally shaving leaves my legs a little itchy/scratchy, but this helps calm the feeling.</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34; There was no further instruction on how to return.</li>
            <li>They turned out really well minus the redness afterwards.</li>
            <li>I had a tiny spot of blood from waxing a thick hair from my eyebrow and when I used this product, it made the spot bigger and made it bleed more.</li>
            <li>Another similar order from the same company placed the same day, also came unsealed and only 3/4 full, which I thought was odd, but wrote it off...</li>
            <li>Works well and fast at cooling my skin down after waxing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove wax well. Oil would probably work better... but somehow, I keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Worked great as described</li>
            <li> This is very soothing and calms the redness.  The menthol does sting slightly if you use it after epilating like I do.  I&#x27;ve found if I use After Wax Lotion first then the gel it is more cooling than stingy.  The bottles are large and you really get a lot of product.  No real distinguishing smell, just the natural smell of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  We use it on all of our skin conditions and it works.  Great for use after using an epilator.</li>
            <li> After waxing this is so nice on my skin. Pamper yourself after waxing. Cooling, refreshing, clean sensation. Big bottle goes a long way</li>
            <li> Due to the high cost of brazilian waxing in my area (due to its novelty) I decided to start doing my own. They turned out really well minus the redness afterwards. Previously when I would go to a aesthetician to get it done she always applied something afterwards that felt very cool and soothing and this is comparable to that and with it being such a huge bottle I do not foresee me paying out to get a brazilian any time soon.</li>
            <li> When I had the cooling gel applied in the salon it was a refreshing experience, however this Gigi post wax cooling gel almost burns before it begins to cool.  It&#x27;s not the soothing effect I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Yes the item was good the seller did a great job thank you</li>
            <li> Works well and fast at cooling my skin down after waxing. It does not really have a smell to it and that is fine with me. Don&#x27;t use too much because a little goes a long way. I will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> I just received this item via UPS in a damp box moments ago. The bottle, which is not sealed, had opened, and half the following message:  &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34; There was no further instruction on how to return. Another similar order from the same company placed the same day, also came unsealed and only 3/4 full, which I thought was odd, but wrote it off... I&#x27;ll now go review that, too.</li>
            <li> Used on sunburn today.  Works great and feels good.</li>
            <li> Did not provide the instant cooling I was looking for, nor did it reduce any redness from the irritation of waxing. It did help a little with the sting but not overly so.</li>
            <li> This clear cooling gel works pretty well, I haven&#x27;t been waxing lately but I even use it after quickly shaving. Normally shaving leaves my legs a little itchy/scratchy, but this helps calm the feeling. From me it gets 4* instead of 5* because it leaves behind a sticky feeling on your hands, similar to when you put gel in your hair which I don&#x27;t like but all in all, pretty good.</li>
            <li> it takes the pain away and also the redness i love this gigi post waxing cooling gel its pretty good</li>
            <li> The instruments needed.</li>
            <li> this does a great job</li>
            <li> Cooling sensation great after wax and leaves smooth skin. Would recommend to any waxer as an after wax cooling cream</li>
            <li> I am a novice to home waxing but this gel really does seem to help cool the area down. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I would give this product ZERO stars if there was that option. On the front of the bottle it says \\&quot;aloe Vera, cucumber, and menthol\\&quot; for soothing. But what it doesn&#x27;t say is that ALCOHOL is the second ingredient after the first ingredient, which is water. It burned the hell out of my eyebrows. I am a licensed Esthetician, and I would NEVER put an alcohol based product on a client after waxing any part of their body.  YOU&#x27;RE BETTER OFF BUYING PLAIN OLD ALOE VERA GEL, which is what I use on my clients, and it actually DOES give a cooling effect, as opposed to a burning one.</li>
            <li> This helps to keep the red down after waxing.  Although I don&#x27;t need this big of a bottle, I should have paid more attention to the size.</li>
            <li> pleased with the product it arrived on time and as it was described in the add.  Purchased with the gigi honee combo all purpose waxer.</li>
            <li> I must say it is a large bottle for a low price. But the description said nothing about having alcohol in it. Good thing I tried it on myself before I used it on anyone. It burned so bad. I wiped it off as fast as I could. I had a tiny spot of blood from waxing a thick hair from my eyebrow and when I used this product, it made the spot bigger and made it bleed more. I ended up with a bloody scab for 4 days.</li>
            <li> Love to use it right after brazilian wax&lt;br /&gt;Feels cool an i keep it in the fridge so it can be cold</li>
