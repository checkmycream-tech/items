            <li>Great grip.</li>

            <li>These are very nice.  </li>

            <li>It is the best I have ever used, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>The perforations make for a very good gripping surface.</li>
            <li>Feels good in your hands, quality material, and grasps well.  </li>
            <li>Plus, this seller had the best price with free shipping.</li>
            <li>seems to have good grabbing power  hoping it lasts for awhile, these chin hairs keep on comin&#x27;.....</li>
            <li>yeah, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>These are really good tweezers.  </li>
            <li>product - rough/sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot believe this product has any good reviews.</li>
            <li>These do the job of shaping my brows and have a good feel in my hand.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this tweezers.</li>
            <li>The first pair of tweezers that have impressed me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li>Really nice product.  </li>
            <li>lightweight but effective.  </li>
            <li>I am thinking about getting another pair because they are so nice.  </li>
            <li>, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t even own a pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li>They are made with precision and the kind of quality you expect from anything that is Swiss made.</li>
            <li>I own two now.</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers, they are the best and for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I find that my $8 pair from Walgreens is much more effective.</li>
            <li>I still have two great pairs of Green Bell tweezers that have been perfect for over 10 years now.</li>
            <li>I love this tweezer.</li>
            <li>This is the second pair of this tweezer I have bought and without doubt, the best tweezer out there.</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers...</li>
            <li>Need for more words before I can post this review...done.</li>
            <li>Love this brand better than tweezer man ....</li>
            <li>They were the best tweezers ever and one day, just out of the blue, they just stopped grabbing any hairs!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s able to take out the finest hairs.  </li>
            <li>Used to be able to pull any hair out, not so now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorites, and a better price than I used to pay at a beauty supply.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite tweezers of all time.</li>
            <li>You are able to grab the smallest hairs.</li>
            <li>My wife has cheap tweezers, and they don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>I read a lot of good things about this brand, but wasn&#x27;t sure if any tweezers were worth paying over $30 for.</li>
            <li>Much better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I have another pair of Mehaz made in Germany, but these grip much better.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try them out, and am sooo glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Much, much better than tweezerman.</li>
            <li>They are able to get fine hairs.</li>
            <li>First time I have bought this brand so far best tweezers I have bought...</li>
            <li>They are sharp at the tips, and the ends meet perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find some way of labeling one arm for easy recognition of which arm is which.</li>
            <li>I easily saved myself $13.00 after shipping by ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Lost my favorite pair and didn&#x27;t think I would find another that I liked as much.</li>
            <li>It is well made though and does a fine job with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>These little tweezers are really wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Rubis will sharpen them free and guarantee them for life.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought my sister another one.  </li>
            <li>Lifetime free sharpening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product because they are very effective.</li>
            <li>Good ones are worth the high price</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $$!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see them here</li>
            <li>I would rather pay more for a tool, and have something that was high quality and worth owning.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;i use it easily and successfully.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it with confidence.</li>
            <li>They are professional tweezers, very precise.</li>
            <li>Great grip, little pain, a must have for the man with ear hair (reading glasses optional)</li>
            <li>They are precision steel and their function is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li>Worth the purchase</li>
            <li>They come is a plastic case that they can be stored in, but it is kind of big to use to store them.  </li>
            <li>They are well worth the cost</li>
            <li>They are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>My old ones perform better than these after 15 years.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind I use.  </li>
            <li>After doing my research I decided these tweezers were worth the investment, and I was right.</li>
            <li>These are just as good, can grasp the small, fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>I was right</li>
            <li>If its&#x27; not broke don&#x27;t fix it - right?</li>
            <li>so I opted to purchase it rather than the exact one I had before.</li>
            <li>I hope these tweezers will last for many years.</li>
            <li>so that you can see easily whether you have them oriented properly.  </li>
            <li>And I certainly would not recommend them.</li>
            <li>(but it&#x27;s been a while since I had new ones, so my memory is a little unclear), and they&#x27;re much more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased a similar high end brand 15 years ago and they were not as good at holding on to fine hairs as they were in the past</li>
            <li>They are light weight, they only have holes on one side.  </li>
            <li>Now my mom wants a set.</li>
            <li>Just hope they don&#x27;t wear out as fast at the tweezerman and revelon diamond tip.</li>
            <li>Made in Switzerland of stainless.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>All in all much better than any other tweezer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I previously bought another Rubis tweezer and wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this Swiss Tweezer</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say 50% of the time I have to grab and re-grab at those little fine hairs as this one doesn&#x27;t cut it the first time.  </li>
            <li>I use them for tweezing my eyelashes and other facial hair, and they are amazing.  </li>
            <li>These are nice, but when they get dull I will have to pay to get them tuned up.</li>
            <li>This makes them uncomfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the tweezers are great.  </li>
            <li>I can truly say they are well worth spending the extra money.</li>
            <li>They are uncomfortable to hold and do not have strong gripping power.  </li>
            <li>but these are accurate and sharp tweezers.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use and sharp.</li>
            <li>so I decided to order a new pair.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll be at the grocery store stubbornly buying a new pair of cheapie&#x27;s in the next few weeks, i&#x27;ll own this pair when I&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li>Great for getting tiny brow hairs &amp; grasping the hard to reach facial hairs.</li>
            <li>The little holes in the handles make it easy to hold onto too.</li>
            <li>I think the tweezerman tweezers work just as good and are less expensive, and you get the free sharpening with tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>They work soooo much easier than my other pair, which I thought worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>As a professional Aesthetician, I use this style tweezer all the time.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t slip off of the hairs, or miss them completely.</li>
            <li>As a professional esthetician I&#x27;ve always used Mehaz Rubis #135.</li>
            <li>Have bought finger handled tweezers elsewhere to replace my old ones</li>
            <li>They can pick up every lash and hair, no matter how small or fine it might be.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering another pair in the near future to replace these.</li>
            <li>The only reason I needed to replace my old pair was because someone used it for a screwdriver and bent the tip.</li>
            <li>They are far and above any Tweezerman product I have used.</li>
            <li>Only gave it four stars because the old one I was replacing had finger handles.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews, and appeared the Mehaz Rubis was great at getting the fine little hairs we hate on our upper lips!!!</li>
            <li>The only tweezers that get those fine hairs and those thick, stubby, just broke thru the skin&#x27;s surface eyebrow hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>The tweezers are so sharp that if you miss picking up a hair you could puncture a whole in your eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>They are by far my favorite, but are really expensive at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Great product you won&#x27;t be disappointed in them.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the holes in one arm (but not the other)</li>

            <li> (but it&#x27;s been a while since I had new ones, so my memory is a little unclear), and they&#x27;re much more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a similar high end brand 15 years ago and they were not as good at holding on to fine hairs as they were in the past</li>
            <li> They are light weight, they only have holes on one side.  </li>
            <li> Now my mom wants a set.</li>
            <li> Just hope they don&#x27;t wear out as fast at the tweezerman and revelon diamond tip.</li>
            <li> Made in Switzerland of stainless.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> All in all much better than any other tweezer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I previously bought another Rubis tweezer and wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this Swiss Tweezer</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say 50% of the time I have to grab and re-grab at those little fine hairs as this one doesn&#x27;t cut it the first time.  </li>
            <li> I use them for tweezing my eyelashes and other facial hair, and they are amazing.  </li>
            <li> These are nice, but when they get dull I will have to pay to get them tuned up.</li>
            <li> This makes them uncomfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the tweezers are great.  </li>
            <li> I can truly say they are well worth spending the extra money.</li>
            <li> They are uncomfortable to hold and do not have strong gripping power.  </li>
            <li> but these are accurate and sharp tweezers.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use and sharp.</li>
            <li> so I decided to order a new pair.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;ll be at the grocery store stubbornly buying a new pair of cheapie&#x27;s in the next few weeks, i&#x27;ll own this pair when I&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li> Great for getting tiny brow hairs &amp; grasping the hard to reach facial hairs.</li>
            <li> The little holes in the handles make it easy to hold onto too.</li>
            <li> I think the tweezerman tweezers work just as good and are less expensive, and you get the free sharpening with tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> They work soooo much easier than my other pair, which I thought worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> As a professional Aesthetician, I use this style tweezer all the time.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t slip off of the hairs, or miss them completely.</li>
            <li> As a professional esthetician I&#x27;ve always used Mehaz Rubis #135.</li>
            <li> Have bought finger handled tweezers elsewhere to replace my old ones</li>
            <li> They can pick up every lash and hair, no matter how small or fine it might be.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering another pair in the near future to replace these.</li>
            <li> The only reason I needed to replace my old pair was because someone used it for a screwdriver and bent the tip.</li>
            <li> They are far and above any Tweezerman product I have used.</li>
            <li> Only gave it four stars because the old one I was replacing had finger handles.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews, and appeared the Mehaz Rubis was great at getting the fine little hairs we hate on our upper lips!!!</li>
            <li> The only tweezers that get those fine hairs and those thick, stubby, just broke thru the skin&#x27;s surface eyebrow hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The tweezers are so sharp that if you miss picking up a hair you could puncture a whole in your eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> They are by far my favorite, but are really expensive at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Great product you won&#x27;t be disappointed in them.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the holes in one arm (but not the other)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Revlon tweezers in the past as they are the most common to find in stores.</li>
            <li> And there is a little clear rubber cover to protect the tip.  </li>
            <li> I was given a hard time by my wife for paying this much money for a pair of tweezers, but I would pay it again.</li>
            <li> and i will continue to order them for as long as they have them here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long time to stay at it</li>
            <li> No more having to inspect the tips to decide how to turn them for proper use!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably go back to Mr. Tweezerman in the future.  </li>
            <li> The precision of these tweezers is unlike any other I&#x27;ve ever used in my life, and I do alot of plucking of facial hair!!</li>
            <li> I have heavy facial hair and this works well for long and short hairs.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, you&#x27;ll read lots of reviews about people who have purchased other tweezers that eventually lose their function - these precision instruments clearly trumpet the old saying, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my view on things; I look at this just like I do any other tool I have to buy.</li>
            <li> but I will buy the other brand this time.</li>
            <li> Keep the little plastic tip cover on that came with them and you will have them for a very long time.</li>
            <li> thought it was a little too expensive, but totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li> My wife is not easily impressed with gifts, but once she tried these, she was never going back to her old tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Surpasses any tweezers previously used including tweezerman &amp; other rubis.</li>
            <li> I need to use tweezers almost every second day for at least 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> but it helps that I found them for $10 cheaper than other sellers!</li>
            <li> But this model is sharp and can pluck every hair!  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and will get the finest hairs.  </li>
            <li> I wish the tip was slightly wider.  </li>
            <li> every little hair is subject to be tweezed into obscurity.  </li>
            <li> I just got these tweezers and couldn&#x27;t believe how easily they &amp;#34;seek and find&amp;#34; those annoying chin hairs.  </li>
            <li> I had another pair and misplaced them somewhere</li>
            <li> These tweezers function well, but the arms are so narrow, and the edges of the arms are so square, that when I exert pressure, the corners of the arms cut into my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea what I was missing out on before.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> A little disappointing with the high price.  </li>
            <li> At least these do the job.</li>
            <li> Not even comparable to the chinese crap they sell at walmart.  </li>
            <li> They are worse that a drug store variety.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with my eyebrows and have been so disappointed with several tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> They both pick up the tinest, finest hair without fail.</li>
            <li> , she was wrong, again.</li>
            <li> Badly made, very awkward to hold and extremely poorly finished</li>
            <li> I do have a bad habit of dropping them and ruining the tip, so this is a replacement.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the way these tweezers grab the hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> light,&lt;br /&gt;good quality,&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold,&lt;br /&gt;works very well.&lt;br /&gt;i use it easily and successfully.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it with confidence.</li>
            <li> best tweezer I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.  Feels good in your hands, quality material, and grasps well.  Worth the purchase and I would buy their merchandise again.</li>
            <li> These are great precision tweezers! I loved them but then lost them! I will be ordering another pair in the near future to replace these.</li>
            <li> rubis tweezer&#x27;s are still the gold standard of tweezers for me.  every little hair is subject to be tweezed into obscurity.  nothing beats rubis and their customer service.</li>
            <li> This tweezer is probably the third or fourth we&#x27;ve acquired and we&#x27;ll order again.  It&#x27;s a precision tool.  It lasts about 2 years until dulling of sorts takes place.  I&#x27;ve never experience a break.  All the Revlon-like stuff is way inferior.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the one I lost. I love this tweezer. It is the best one I have ever used. It grips even the smallest hair with ease and doesn&#x27;t break it off. I will be using this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the second pair of this tweezer I have bought and without doubt, the best tweezer out there. I also have a pair of Rubis pointed tweezers. They both pick up the tinest, finest hair without fail. You can see and feel the quality, Made in Switzerland. Rubis will sharpen them free and guarantee them for life. Plus, this seller had the best price with free shipping. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> lightweight but effective.  seems to have good grabbing power  hoping it lasts for awhile, these chin hairs keep on comin&#x27;.....</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers...I had another pair and misplaced them somewhere and I had to order a replacement because these tweezers are wonderful at plucking those pesky ear hairs.  Great grip, little pain, a must have for the man with ear hair (reading glasses optional)</li>
            <li> These are very nice.  I am thinking about getting another pair because they are so nice.  They come is a plastic case that they can be stored in, but it is kind of big to use to store them.  And there is a little clear rubber cover to protect the tip.  They are light weight, they only have holes on one side.  They are able to get fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I bought these for myself, and they worked so well I bought a set for my sisters birthday.  Now my mom wants a set. Not even comparable to the chinese crap they sell at walmart.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are best tweezers money can buy.  I had another pair for over 10 years but lost them while vacationing.  Keep the little plastic tip cover on that came with them and you will have them for a very long time.</li>
            <li> First time I have bought this brand so far best tweezers I have bought...Just hope they don&#x27;t wear out as fast at the tweezerman and revelon diamond tip.</li>
            <li> Well made and work great.  I wish the tip was slightly wider.  I would recommend.  Need for more words before I can post this review...done.</li>
            <li> Great product you won&#x27;t be disappointed in them.  I had my last ones for 50 years was time to improve.</li>
            <li> Love this brand better than tweezer man ....</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the way these tweezers grab the hair.  I find that my $8 pair from Walgreens is much more effective.</li>
            <li> They were the best tweezers ever and one day, just out of the blue, they just stopped grabbing any hairs! Not even the thickest ones. Cannot explain. Didn&#x27;t mind the price, just hoped they lasted. I still have two great pairs of Green Bell tweezers that have been perfect for over 10 years now. Do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever! I will buy them again but these seem to last forever and haven&#x27;t lost their sharpness or tweeze-ability.</li>
            <li> I think the tweezerman tweezers work just as good and are less expensive, and you get the free sharpening with tweezerman.  These are nice, but when they get dull I will have to pay to get them tuned up.</li>
            <li> I just got these tweezers and couldn&#x27;t believe how easily they &amp;#34;seek and find&amp;#34; those annoying chin hairs.  They work soooo much easier than my other pair, which I thought worked pretty well.  They are well worth the cost but it helps that I found them for $10 cheaper than other sellers!</li>
            <li> These tweezers function well, but the arms are so narrow, and the edges of the arms are so square, that when I exert pressure, the corners of the arms cut into my fingers.  This makes them uncomfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the tweezers are great.  (I would have given them a rating of 5, if it weren&#x27;t for the edges.)  I particularly like the holes in one arm (but not the other) so that you can see easily whether you have them oriented properly.  No more having to inspect the tips to decide how to turn them for proper use!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably go back to Mr. Tweezerman in the future.  I think they function as well (but it&#x27;s been a while since I had new ones, so my memory is a little unclear), and they&#x27;re much more comfortable to use.  I&#x27;ll find some way of labeling one arm for easy recognition of which arm is which.</li>
            <li> I previously bought another Rubis tweezer and wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  But this model is sharp and can pluck every hair!  Definitely a product I would buy again.</li>
            <li> by the precision! thought it was a little too expensive, but totally worth the price.  it&#x27;s able to take out the finest hairs.  when i&#x27;m done with my eyebrows it looks like it&#x27;s been threaded.  yeah, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> perfect edge, no problems here, but do not drop these or you may bend the tip.  That is why i had to replace</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers based on read reviews &amp; they did not disappoint. Great for getting tiny brow hairs &amp; grasping the hard to reach facial hairs. Surpasses any tweezers previously used including tweezerman &amp; other rubis.</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these tweezers. I keep one in each bathroom and one for travel--so I will not forget them. Seems a bit extravagant but these are accurate and sharp tweezers. Do not drop them. I keep the rubber protector tip on the ends.</li>
            <li> Had these a year and they&#x27;re losing their strength. Used to be able to pull any hair out, not so now. All in all much better than any other tweezer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> As a professional Aesthetician, I use this style tweezer all the time.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites, and a better price than I used to pay at a beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I had my last pair over 10 years, these work well if always used as tweezers.  The only reason I needed to replace my old pair was because someone used it for a screwdriver and bent the tip.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite tweezers of all time. They are professional tweezers, very precise. You are able to grab the smallest hairs. The tweezer is perfectly balanced. The slanted tips are perfectly aligned. They are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> These tweezers take the pain out of tweezing. Their grip is excellent and you don&#x27;t have to keep repositioning to get a good effect. Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I bought myself one these tweezers.  I liked it so much that I bought my sister another one.  Need I say more!!!</li>
            <li> I was given a hard time by my wife for paying this much money for a pair of tweezers, but I would pay it again. I am one of those guys with only one eyebrow so I have to go to town cleaning it up a couple of times a week, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t even own a pair of tweezers. Here&#x27;s my view on things; I look at this just like I do any other tool I have to buy. I would rather pay more for a tool, and have something that was high quality and worth owning. After doing my research I decided these tweezers were worth the investment, and I was right. They don&#x27;t slip off of the hairs, or miss them completely. They come together perfectly, and give you a perfect grip on whatever you&#x27;re trying to grab. They are made with precision and the kind of quality you expect from anything that is Swiss made. My wife has cheap tweezers, and they don&#x27;t work! I was right, she was wrong, again. Some things will never change. She&#x27;ll be at the grocery store stubbornly buying a new pair of cheapie&#x27;s in the next few weeks, i&#x27;ll own this pair when I&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, you&#x27;ll read lots of reviews about people who have purchased other tweezers that eventually lose their function - these precision instruments clearly trumpet the old saying, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;!  They are precision steel and their function is nothing short of amazing.  My wife is not easily impressed with gifts, but once she tried these, she was never going back to her old tweezers.  I bought two, so that if one needs to go back to the factory for renovation, my wife will always have one around.  This is a lifetime investment that will never disappoint!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good things about this brand, but wasn&#x27;t sure if any tweezers were worth paying over $30 for. I decided to give them a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did!! I had no idea what I was missing out on before. I definitely recommend this product because they are very effective.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Much better than I anticipated. The first pair of tweezers that have impressed me. Definitely worth the $$!</li>
            <li> These are really good tweezers.  I have another pair of Mehaz made in Germany, but these grip much better.  The little holes in the handles make it easy to hold onto too.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers ever.  I now have about 4 of them to have everywhere!  The precision of these tweezers is unlike any other I&#x27;ve ever used in my life, and I do alot of plucking of facial hair!!</li>
            <li> I have had many tweezers over the years but these are the best I have ever had. They are well crafted and make using them a pleasure. They are sharp at the tips, and the ends meet perfectly. I highly reccomend this Swiss Tweezer</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this tweezers. It is the best I have ever used, and I have tried many.  It is worth the money.  I am planning to buy one for my daughter as a gift.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a similar high end brand 15 years ago and they were not as good at holding on to fine hairs as they were in the past so I decided to order a new pair. I read excellent reviews of this product so I opted to purchase it rather than the exact one I had before. My old ones perform better than these after 15 years. Good ones are worth the high price but I will buy the other brand this time. If its&#x27; not broke don&#x27;t fix it - right?</li>
            <li> Made in Switzerland of stainless. Precision tip with perfect size slant.  Lifetime free sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd pair.  The only tweezers that get those fine hairs and those thick, stubby, just broke thru the skin&#x27;s surface eyebrow hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t drop them, especially on the bathroom tile and they will give you years of carefree tweezing.  Dropping puts them out of alignment.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers, they are the best and for a very reasonable price.  They are far and above any Tweezerman product I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Revlon tweezers in the past as they are the most common to find in stores. So I finally decided to upgrade based on the reviews I found online. These tweezers to not disappoint. The perforations make for a very good gripping surface. I hope these tweezers will last for many years.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews, and appeared the Mehaz Rubis was great at getting the fine little hairs we hate on our upper lips!!! I&#x27;d say 50% of the time I have to grab and re-grab at those little fine hairs as this one doesn&#x27;t cut it the first time.  A little disappointing with the high price.  It is well made though and does a fine job with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Badly made, very awkward to hold and extremely poorly finished product - rough/sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot believe this product has any good reviews.</li>
            <li> As a professional esthetician I&#x27;ve always used Mehaz Rubis #135. They are by far my favorite, but are really expensive at the beauty supply store. I easily saved myself $13.00 after shipping by ordering from Amazon. I was so excited to see them here and i will continue to order them for as long as they have them here.</li>
            <li> These are truly the best tweezers ever!  I use them for tweezing my eyelashes and other facial hair, and they are amazing.  They can pick up every lash and hair, no matter how small or fine it might be.  I can truly say they are well worth spending the extra money.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are so sharp that if you miss picking up a hair you could puncture a whole in your eyebrow.  They are uncomfortable to hold and do not have strong gripping power.  They are worse that a drug store variety. And I certainly would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> These little tweezers are really wonderful.  I used to use Tweezerman for years, but read a review raving about these.  I decided to try them out, and am sooo glad I did.  They will service the tweezers for a nominal price, as well.  I own two now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve aways used Tweezer man but I came across this and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try! effortlessly pick up the thinnest hair without ripping it!</li>
            <li> This tweezer works great.  I really like it.  I have heavy facial hair and this works well for long and short hairs.  I need to use tweezers almost every second day for at least 30 minutes.  It&#x27;s a long time to stay at it but these do grab well.  Only gave it four stars because the old one I was replacing had finger handles.  Because of the amount of time I use these at one sitting, I miss the handles which make it easier.  Have bought finger handled tweezers elsewhere to replace my old ones but they didn&#x27;t work at all.  At least these do the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent tweezer.  This is the only kind I use.  I do have a bad habit of dropping them and ruining the tip, so this is a replacement.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  They are very sharp and will get the finest hairs.  You can tell by the quality they were made in Switzerland.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with my eyebrows and have been so disappointed with several tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased.  I had a great pair that was given to me, I believe they were from Sephora, but ended up losing them on a trip.  These are just as good, can grasp the small, fine hairs.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Lost my favorite pair and didn&#x27;t think I would find another that I liked as much. These do the job of shaping my brows and have a good feel in my hand. Comfortable to use and sharp. Great grip. Much, much better than tweezerman.</li>
