            <li>It really does make a huge difference when straightening her hair.</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my hair soft and silky.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on professional styling every week, but it is important to me to have her hair looking nice everyday.  </li>
            <li>I found Beyond Straight when I bought my first Maxiglide</li>
            <li>It almost cut my straightening time in half and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Beyond Straight keeps my hair straight for 3-4 days, depending on how much time I spend outdoors.</li>
            <li>Beyond Straight* 8 oz</li>
            <li>The End* 1 oz, with a &amp;#34;Beyond Straight 8 oz&amp;#34; sticker on it.</li>
            <li>I have also used Maxius Beyond Straight to straighten my hair, and have identical performance.</li>
            <li>so the flakes were  very noticeable.</li>
            <li>It truly works miracles, turning beyond curly hair, straight.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>They keep my hair straight and silky, more so than other products.</li>
            <li>It used to work better when it had the other presentation, see trhough bottle with bownish gel.....</li>
            <li>I really liked this serum after using the small sample that came with my MaxiGlide.</li>
            <li>I apply this product on damp hair and let it air dry for smooth curls.</li>
            <li>, my daughter gets a sleek professional look every time!  </li>
            <li>and I only used this today for the first time.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and I wear it curly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft without feeling crunchy; and defines my curls while eliminating frizz.</li>
            <li>Soft &amp; silky</li>
            <li>Have been using this for years, love it for my rather thick wavy hair</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this product for so long, I&#x27;d forgotten how frizzy my hair really is.  </li>
            <li>I live in Houston, it&#x27;s extremely humid here.</li>
            <li>I suffered extreme frizzies for days until my new order arrived.  </li>

            <li> , then I section hair and distribute another quarter sized amount throughout followed by blow dryer on medium, let it rest then flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel like silk and takes 15 minutes off my flat ironing because I no longer have to struggle to untangle my hair.</li>

            <li> I have thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and then I leave it for a few days and it always looks the worst on day 1 when my hair is still freaking out from the heat shock, but it looks totally different today.</li>
            <li> I tired to brush the flakes out</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb if your hair hates humidity, so sad they are no longer producing it!</li>

            <li> I ordered *Beyond Straight* 8 oz and what I received was its companion product, *The End* 1 oz, with a &amp;#34;Beyond Straight 8 oz&amp;#34; sticker on it. Am I supposed to be too daft to notice? What is going on here?</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and I wear it curly. I have found this product to have excellent performance in a highly humid, tropical environment. It leaves my hair soft without feeling crunchy; and defines my curls while eliminating frizz. I have also used Maxius Beyond Straight to straighten my hair, and have identical performance.</li>
            <li> It used to work better when it had the other presentation, see trhough bottle with bownish gel.....now is not as good...that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I really liked this serum after using the small sample that came with my MaxiGlide. When I purchased the 8oz bottle I wasn&#x27;t all that excited. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it did a wonderful job making my hair look straight and shinny. The issue I had is the flakes that it left in my hair. I have black color hair so the flakes were  very noticeable. I tired to brush the flakes out but that did not work. It was almost as if the flakes were bounded to my hair. Oh well, at least I gave this product a chance. I don&#x27;t plan to buy this one again. Chi serum works best for me.</li>
            <li> Been buying this stuff for many years.</li>
            <li> I live in Houston, it&#x27;s extremely humid here. Beyond Straight keeps my hair straight for 3-4 days, depending on how much time I spend outdoors. Of course in other climates (specifically Vegas) it lasts all week. The shine is great - people notice it. I have shoulder length hair, I use a quarter sized amount all over, starting w/back, then I section hair and distribute another quarter sized amount throughout followed by blow dryer on medium, let it rest then flat iron.  It&#x27;s more economical purchasing through Amazon than through the manufacturer. It works for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It cuts down straightening your curly hair in half the time plus the hair remains straight. Love it! Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb if your hair hates humidity, so sad they are no longer producing it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years with Maxius Serum.  They keep my hair straight and silky, more so than other products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, the smell is nice and it makes my hair feel great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a different bottle but it&#x27;s the same thing as the photo. I love how this makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, coarse, hard-to-straighten, African-American hair.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on professional styling every week, but it is important to me to have her hair looking nice everyday.  I found Beyond Straight when I bought my first Maxiglide and I have been using it ever since! It really does make a huge difference when straightening her hair. I have used it before and after blow-drying and when flat-ironing and either way, my daughter gets a sleek professional look every time!  I continue to be impressed with Maxius Beauty products and I just wish they were more widely available.  I suggest, that if flat ironing is the only method of straightening you use (i.e. no perm), trying this product with a little Fantasia IC Hair Polisher Heat Protector Straightening Serum as well and you will not be disappointed!  There is not a lot of product build-up nor is there any kind of &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel.  It does not weigh the hair down and my daughter&#x27;s hair always has a bounce.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my coarse, curly Jewish hair for 6 years and I only used this today for the first time. I washed my hair last night, and left it in over night. My curls were insane this morning! It almost cut my straightening time in half and my hair looks amazing. I usually only have to straighten it once and then I leave it for a few days and it always looks the worst on day 1 when my hair is still freaking out from the heat shock, but it looks totally different today. It&#x27;s so soft, I can&#x27;t stop touching it and it smells amazing! Never going to back the Iron Guard from Chi. This stuff is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a hair product I cannot be without.  Recently, I ran out of it.  I thought I really didn&#x27;t need it anymore and tried to style my hair the usual way.  It was a disaster.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product for so long, I&#x27;d forgotten how frizzy my hair really is.  I suffered extreme frizzies for days until my new order arrived.  I hope to never run out of it again.  It truly works miracles, turning beyond curly hair, straight.</li>
            <li> This works amazing on natural, african-american hair.  Need to use additional heat-protectant though.  Will last a long time.  Better than all the temporary kits I have tried.</li>
            <li> Good product it works!!! Thanks Debra!!!</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy hair. I apply this product on damp hair and let it air dry for smooth curls.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money . Tried it once &amp; yuck .. my hair felt stiff and sticky . Never again .</li>
            <li> It works just like it is suppose to... I press my daughter&#x27;s hair with it and her hair stays for about two weeks...</li>
            <li> This is my third time using this product and it never ceases to amaze me. I have thick, course and very dry African American hair. This product makes my hair feel like silk and takes 15 minutes off my flat ironing because I no longer have to struggle to untangle my hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have thick, frizzy, wavy, hair. This product does wonders if I use a blow dryer and even better with a curling iron or flat iron. My hair lays smooth and silky easily and stays there.</li>
            <li> Use the end and beyond straight are great together!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product; works great in conjunction of the maxiglide straightener. No need to re-straighten hair days on time. Soft &amp; silky</li>
            <li> 1st it did not come in the container as shown above. Cheap clear plastic.  I have thick curly hair.  I was hoping to speed up the process and help it straighten out more with this product. However, not only did this product NOT help with that, it also left my hair sticky and tangled up. Using a blow dryer made it worse dry and hard. Didn&#x27;t like this at all!</li>
            <li> It came just has described loved it.</li>
            <li> love love this this is very very good on kids hair it make it very nice and pretty, I wish I had a case of this, this is very good and it hold your hair up for 3weeks.</li>
            <li> Sticky. I tried it a couple times and then threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years, love it for my rather thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I love this product, but this vendor sent old stock.  Manufacturer has not used this packaging for years.</li>
