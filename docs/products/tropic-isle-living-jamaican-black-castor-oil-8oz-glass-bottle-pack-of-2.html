            <li>I will update as time goes on on the progress, but so far I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Began using last year finding this product to be effective for my hair loss from 20 yrs.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels better and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>but I love the thickness and the ability to transform our natural hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the fact that it is all natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thankful to God for this and other products that naturally help us to be healthy in many ways and that help to build self esteem!</li>
            <li>I add a capful to my conditioner before co-washing and it leaves my hair super soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>You must be positive in you hair growth success.</li>
            <li>Just mix a little Into some leave in conditioner or good smelling oil product to mask the smell .</li>
            <li>I use a mixture of 3/4 olive oil and 1/4 castor (more castor if you want a deeper clean, but be careful because it can be drying on the face).  </li>
            <li>Those concerned with the smoky scent, I blend with other neutral oils (Grapeseed is great) and one key essential oil (e.g. lavender, which makes a statement but is not too strong and is not pungent) and the scent works out fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>so now i can see my hairline, my hair has thickened, and the overall health of my hair has improved and looks really healthy after including this oil in my hair regimen.  </li>
            <li>Ever since starting using it hair has been much more elastic</li>
            <li>Once Daily Multivitamins) that caused my eyebrows to become somewhat sparse (many didn&#x27;t notice</li>
            <li>JBCO is a great sealant for natural hair and with time and a little effort  will grow in edges.  </li>
            <li>I like to use it straight or mix it with either olive oil or coconut oil in an applicator bottle first.</li>
            <li>it also helps with hair growth, i had a bold spot from wearing quick weavs and braids and this helped with growing the hair back in.</li>
            <li>I am from Jamaican background and can remember when I was little and my mother made this oil on the stove top from the actual castor beans but living in the U.S. and having some difficulty getting the actual castor beans, this is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>naturally dry hair and scalp have become totally more moisturized since I started using JBCO on it.</li>
            <li>I have stretch marks on certain areas of my body, just went all-natural (hair)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and packaged</li>
            <li>online say it does; of course you will have oils that has no smell at all, and you will have oils that have a very perculiar smell, but not rancid.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell since it too soon.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>It really does smell .</li>
            <li>/&gt;shipping was fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this works fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this for the much needed moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product to my naturalists!</li>
            <li>However, I really wondered if it would do anything for my hair at all.</li>
            <li>It really seals the moisture in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was so fast that when I received he box, I didn&#x27;t have a clue what to expect inside.</li>
            <li>It was very well protected.</li>
            <li>It makes you hair soft and healthy looking, when used moderately.</li>
            <li>So far I like it!!!  </li>
            <li>i did find the in the beauty supply store near my house!!!</li>
            <li>Also, I warm up plain JBCO and apply it as a prepoo before I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>(more shea if you want it a little more solid) leaves my skin soft and supple without being oily.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for anyone needing more moisture in their hair and an oil that will not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I have read many reviews about Jamaican Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li>AND I DO PLAN ON ORDERING MORE OF THIS SAME PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>And, I can certainly say that this product barely has an odor to it at all.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This band is better than the other one to from the threads I read which is an extra bonus.</li>
            <li>i DEFINITELY seen some improvement i put it on my scalp every other day and my hair became more thicker and softer</li>
            <li>Everyone in my family is using it now as a pre condiationer before a hair wash and and the hair feels really soft!</li>
            <li>and I swear it is making my locs grow like wild!</li>
            <li>For anyone that is working to achieve as much length and health to their hair as possible, I highly recommend taking the plunge and trying this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used regular castor oil before but the Jamaican Black Castor Oil is better.  </li>
            <li>its a excellant sealer, my hair drinks oil so fast, this stuff actually stays in my hair for days (not heavy)</li>
            <li>It clears up blemishes and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>it just makes my hair incredibly soft, i will say USE AS A SEALER.</li>
            <li>I am a natural girl with 3C/4A hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to all natural haired ladies.</li>
            <li>i use this all the time on my natural hair</li>
            <li>but guess better late than ever.</li>
            <li>So far product has lived up to its name.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and lustrous.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it on those spots, &amp; so far we see improvement N</li>
            <li>; that didn&#x27;t look too cute when it healed; I began to use the oil everyday on her hairline; within 2 weeks I noticed that not only was her skin healing</li>
            <li>I compared the consistency of this one to my previous bottle of castor oil (same brand, different seller) and this twin pack has more fluidity and thinner.</li>
            <li>Next, I take a little bit more oil and run it thoughout the entire length of my hair.</li>
            <li>And, lastly, I cleanse my hair as normal with my cleansing conditioner of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also use modest amounts on my eyebrows--I recently had an iron deficiency (see my review on Nature&#x27;s Way Alive</li>
            <li>you know how to use Castor Oil and how much of the oil to use (a little goes a long way), it can be truly useful.</li>
            <li>I mix it with olive oil and use as a deep conditioner and it leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>A little early yet to say, however I have felt some itching of the scalp looking forward to see what will happen in a few more months.</li>
            <li>Love no strong smell use every other day no build up and noticed thickness</li>
            <li>I use this oil my natural hair various mixes.  </li>
            <li>Been using the castor oil for only a short while and I am beginning to see some signs on new hair growth on my hair line.</li>
            <li>i am an African american  that just started going natural i had just this product for  1 and 1/2 months</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair growth (been using about 6 months), but it does keep my hair shiny and moisturized; not so much my scalp, it just eats up this watered down oil.</li>
            <li>still...I like to begin with a thick, lush brow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use a tiny amount to blend into hot oil treatments and body oil</li>
    </ol>

            <li> love it got in a timely manner work miracles on my hair and daughter natural hair plus its a good moisturizer for the dry skin</li>
            <li> Although it is not a month yet im happy to see a little progress.</li>
            <li> This oil is a great addition to my natural hair care products (I am an AA female).</li>
            <li> I will update as time goes on on the progress, but so far I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Began using last year finding this product to be effective for my hair loss from 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels better and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> but I love the thickness and the ability to transform our natural hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the fact that it is all natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful to God for this and other products that naturally help us to be healthy in many ways and that help to build self esteem!</li>
            <li> I add a capful to my conditioner before co-washing and it leaves my hair super soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> You must be positive in you hair growth success.</li>
            <li> Just mix a little Into some leave in conditioner or good smelling oil product to mask the smell .</li>
            <li> I use a mixture of 3/4 olive oil and 1/4 castor (more castor if you want a deeper clean, but be careful because it can be drying on the face).  </li>
            <li> Those concerned with the smoky scent, I blend with other neutral oils (Grapeseed is great) and one key essential oil (e.g. lavender, which makes a statement but is not too strong and is not pungent) and the scent works out fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> so now i can see my hairline, my hair has thickened, and the overall health of my hair has improved and looks really healthy after including this oil in my hair regimen.  </li>
            <li> Ever since starting using it hair has been much more elastic</li>
            <li> Once Daily Multivitamins) that caused my eyebrows to become somewhat sparse (many didn&#x27;t notice</li>
            <li> JBCO is a great sealant for natural hair and with time and a little effort  will grow in edges.  </li>
            <li> I like to use it straight or mix it with either olive oil or coconut oil in an applicator bottle first.</li>
            <li> it also helps with hair growth, i had a bold spot from wearing quick weavs and braids and this helped with growing the hair back in.</li>
            <li> I am from Jamaican background and can remember when I was little and my mother made this oil on the stove top from the actual castor beans but living in the U.S. and having some difficulty getting the actual castor beans, this is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> naturally dry hair and scalp have become totally more moisturized since I started using JBCO on it.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks on certain areas of my body, just went all-natural (hair)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and packaged</li>
            <li> online say it does; of course you will have oils that has no smell at all, and you will have oils that have a very perculiar smell, but not rancid.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell since it too soon.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> It really does smell .</li>
            <li> /&gt;shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this works fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this for the much needed moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this product to my naturalists!</li>
            <li> However, I really wondered if it would do anything for my hair at all.</li>
            <li> It really seals the moisture in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast that when I received he box, I didn&#x27;t have a clue what to expect inside.</li>
            <li> It was very well protected.</li>
            <li> It makes you hair soft and healthy looking, when used moderately.</li>
            <li> So far I like it!!!  </li>
            <li> i did find the in the beauty supply store near my house!!!</li>
            <li> Also, I warm up plain JBCO and apply it as a prepoo before I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> (more shea if you want it a little more solid) leaves my skin soft and supple without being oily.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for anyone needing more moisture in their hair and an oil that will not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews about Jamaican Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li> AND I DO PLAN ON ORDERING MORE OF THIS SAME PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE!</li>

            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This band is better than the other one to from the threads I read which is an extra bonus.</li>

            <li> Everyone in my family is using it now as a pre condiationer before a hair wash and and the hair feels really soft!</li>
            <li> and I swear it is making my locs grow like wild!</li>
            <li> For anyone that is working to achieve as much length and health to their hair as possible, I highly recommend taking the plunge and trying this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used regular castor oil before but the Jamaican Black Castor Oil is better.  </li>
            <li> its a excellant sealer, my hair drinks oil so fast, this stuff actually stays in my hair for days (not heavy)</li>
            <li> It clears up blemishes and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> it just makes my hair incredibly soft, i will say USE AS A SEALER.</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl with 3C/4A hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all natural haired ladies.</li>
            <li> i use this all the time on my natural hair</li>
            <li> but guess better late than ever.</li>
            <li> So far product has lived up to its name.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and lustrous.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it on those spots, &amp; so far we see improvement N</li>
            <li> ; that didn&#x27;t look too cute when it healed; I began to use the oil everyday on her hairline; within 2 weeks I noticed that not only was her skin healing</li>
            <li> I compared the consistency of this one to my previous bottle of castor oil (same brand, different seller) and this twin pack has more fluidity and thinner.</li>
            <li> Next, I take a little bit more oil and run it thoughout the entire length of my hair.</li>
            <li> And, lastly, I cleanse my hair as normal with my cleansing conditioner of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also use modest amounts on my eyebrows--I recently had an iron deficiency (see my review on Nature&#x27;s Way Alive</li>
            <li> you know how to use Castor Oil and how much of the oil to use (a little goes a long way), it can be truly useful.</li>
            <li> I mix it with olive oil and use as a deep conditioner and it leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> A little early yet to say, however I have felt some itching of the scalp looking forward to see what will happen in a few more months.</li>
            <li> Love no strong smell use every other day no build up and noticed thickness</li>
            <li> I use this oil my natural hair various mixes.  </li>
            <li> Been using the castor oil for only a short while and I am beginning to see some signs on new hair growth on my hair line.</li>
            <li> i am an African american  that just started going natural i had just this product for  1 and 1/2 months</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair growth (been using about 6 months), but it does keep my hair shiny and moisturized; not so much my scalp, it just eats up this watered down oil.</li>
            <li> still...I like to begin with a thick, lush brow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use a tiny amount to blend into hot oil treatments and body oil</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to say that my edges are growing as of yet</li>
            <li> If you use this daily on your scalp you will probably see some increase hair growth, not much, but some.</li>
            <li> I had heard about it for so long and wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep selling this oil, I will keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> It lasts very long once you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> THATS HAS DRY BRITTLE HAIR, OR JUST TRYING TO GROW YOUR HAIR AND HAVE A HEALTY GLOW</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair or your hair isn&#x27;t breaking or it will not grow</li>
            <li> I know some have said that it goes away, but I cant get past putting it on my head, near my nose.  </li>
            <li> typically my hair grows SLOW but not anymore thanks to this.</li>
            <li> I use Castor oil predominately along the hairline  as it tends to weigh other parts of my hair down when used in larger</li>
            <li> I use it on my edges mixed with a little coconut oil before bed, and I add it to my homemade body butters.  </li>
            <li> It does not smell bad like most people</li>
            <li> Soft, subtle and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I use it about every other to everday usage on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using it for my hair as I intended because it smells like burning tires, but I will find other uses for it.  </li>
            <li> I use a little on my ends to seal them after washing (especially during the harsh winter months).</li>
            <li> This oil is thick so a little goes far</li>
            <li> The oil is thick and I would advise to research the other comments in advising what other oils this should be mixed with.</li>
            <li> Took little longer than expected.</li>
            <li> I really purchased the wrong one.</li>
            <li> be cutting my relaxed to a lil shorter to start fresh again</li>
            <li> I also water down my conditioner because I have locs.  </li>
            <li> This has never happened on my previous orders of JBCO ...</li>
            <li> For hair and skin , I noticed thicker hair in less than a month .</li>
            <li> /&gt;JBCO does have a slight nutty smell to it.</li>
            <li> It is a little too soon to see any benefits in terms of hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now to see if it helps grow my edges.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few week&#x27;s time on how it has worked for me and my family</li>
            <li> but since I normally a very full eyebrows, I felt like I looked sick!)</li>
            <li> IT WORKED WOUNDERS ON MY DRY WEAK HAIR.</li>
            <li> In fact, I was actually scared about how bad or not it would actually smell.</li>
            <li> this stuff has become a staple for my hair for the past year.</li>
            <li> However, in terms of length, I am not sure because i dont comb out my hair too</li>
            <li> Initially, I was quite skeptical about buying this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy</li>
            <li> and I have dark spots and blemishes all over my skin, as well as thin eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter under went a bad chemical burn due to leaving it on too long around the hariline</li>
            <li> i do NOT like the smell of it at all, so i put it in my hair at night, in the morning i can hardly smell it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> Late with my review</li>
            <li> It has helped my edges slowly grow in</li>
            <li> I noticed my roots is growing thick</li>
            <li> dont use this alone, it will be way too thick.</li>
            <li> makes my hair thick and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any problems with using this oil at all.  </li>
            <li> It comes well packaged so there won&#x27;t be any chances of leaks or bottles being broken in some ways.</li>
            <li> I notice the very slight fading of my stretch marks!!!</li>
            <li> I have used it when I had a painful upper respiratory condition (clogged painful ears, congestion, scratchy throat) by warming, soaking it up with cotton balls and placing in my ears.</li>
            <li> am someone that suffers with bad allergies.</li>
            <li> There are tons of products out there that I&#x27;ve tried that have smelled so bad till they either gave me a headache or made me feel sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> I never recieved it :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> my hair loves this.  I add a capful to my conditioner before co-washing and it leaves my hair super soft and clean.  I also water down my conditioner because I have locs.  I use it on my edges mixed with a little coconut oil before bed, and I add it to my homemade body butters.  Shea butter, coconut oil, and this oil (more shea if you want it a little more solid) leaves my skin soft and supple without being oily.  I actually glow.  I also use it to clean my face and remove make-up.  Castor oil is naturally cleansing and has all these wonderful healing properties.  I use a mixture of 3/4 olive oil and 1/4 castor (more castor if you want a deeper clean, but be careful because it can be drying on the face).  It clears up blemishes and leaves your skin soft. My teenage daughter started using this.  She had some problems with acne.  Within two days her skin cleared up.  I will never buy her anything else.  It will also grow your eyebrows and eyelashes.  Use sparingly.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Love this.  Truly.</li>
            <li> great for your hair recommended</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it said it would do. I seem results in about 3 weeks after I started using it. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  JBCO is a great sealant for natural hair and with time and a little effort  will grow in edges.  Fast delivery and packaged well.  This product was ordered Friday, shipped Sunday, and arrived at my home Wednesday.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. IT WORKED WOUNDERS ON MY DRY WEAK HAIR. I  WOULD TELL ANY ONE THATS HAS DRY BRITTLE HAIR, OR JUST TRYING TO GROW YOUR HAIR AND HAVE A HEALTY GLOW TO GIVE IT A TRY. GOOD PRODUT AND GOOD PRICE. WILL BUY MANY TIMES OVER.</li>
            <li> This oil is a great addition to my natural hair care products (I am an AA female). I mix it with olive oil and use as a deep conditioner and it leaves my hair very soft. I use a little on my ends to seal them after washing (especially during the harsh winter months). It has also increased the thickness of my hair. I have used it when I had a painful upper respiratory condition (clogged painful ears, congestion, scratchy throat) by warming, soaking it up with cotton balls and placing in my ears. Instant relief. Softens heels, elbows, and cuticles. Many, many uses. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this oil; I like the potence of the oil as well the peanut type smell. It does not smell bad like most people online say it does; of course you will have oils that has no smell at all, and you will have oils that have a very perculiar smell, but not rancid. This oil is great for you hair, skin, minor cuts, rash, and blemishes .I use use this oil on my hair and my daughters hair; I can say that it has thickened and strengthen our hair and the hair line. My daughter under went a bad chemical burn due to leaving it on too long around the hariline; that didn&#x27;t look too cute when it healed; I began to use the oil everyday on her hairline; within 2 weeks I noticed that not only was her skin healing but her hairline grew back emmensely thicker than before. She was very happy to see that. I still use the oils on our hair blended with either rich virgin oil, coconut oil, or jojoba oil. I like the potence of the oil because it shows the strength of the oil and that the product is good quality. I would definitely recommend this product for others to purchase. With all products, it takes time to see results. complaining about simple things are not going to get you know where. You must be positive in you hair growth success.</li>
            <li> Getting two bottles is a steal. I use this for the families hair and skin. Great price. Will buy again when it runs out. It was packaged well also.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a strong order,  it it works wonders for thinning edges! This was also a great deal on the combo pack.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell since it too soon. 3-6 months maybe By then I will see some results. Check back then.</li>
            <li> Hair growth is amazing, bouncing hair brings back any lost growth promotes not only growth but beautiful but makes the skin glow</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product,the price was affordable and it was received in a timely manner.Will definitely order this again and again</li>
            <li> End of Jan. shaved off all hair for a clean start! Mid March I have 2-1/2\\&quot; ! I&#x27;m so thankful to God for this and other products that naturally help us to be healthy in many ways and that help to build self esteem!</li>
            <li> Have been applying the oil to my eyebrows and thinned out area on my hairline nightly for a month now and already seeing a difference. The hair has grown back?! This product is great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now to see if it helps grow my edges. After dealing with hair loss (thru heredity) around my hairline, I researched and found that this product is supposed to help grow edges, so I am currently using. I have not been using it long enough to say that my edges are growing as of yet, however I have noticed that my edges are smoother and filling in somewhat. It makes you hair soft and healthy looking, when used moderately. I will update as time goes on on the progress, but so far I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use it for thickness of my hair. I use it about every other to everday usage on my scalp. I also spray a mixture, with this oil included, on my hair after washing while it&#x27;s still damp.</li>
            <li> love this castor oil now that i am natural works great for thinning hair</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it made my hair very soft.  I put it in at night with rosemary oil, and the next morning I shampoo it out,&lt;br /&gt;and that is where the softness comes in.  It great!!</li>
            <li> More than met my expectations. This oil is thick so a little goes far but it absorbs fast. I use it on my hair mostly and my eyebrow and lashes and they&#x27;re thicker and longer. I add it to my lotions too.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews about Jamaican Black Castor Oil and I truly believe that it has helped in aiding with my hair growth. I will continue using this product as part of my hair regime.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month at least twice a week. A little early yet to say, however I have felt some itching of the scalp looking forward to see what will happen in a few more months.</li>
            <li> Good, has thicken my hair and definitely improved it</li>
            <li> I never recieved it :( This has never happened on my previous orders of JBCO ... I was so disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whole tune has changed, I just checked the mail and whew there it is!! I&#x27;m so satisfied now!! I will be a life time customer!!!</li>
            <li> I love using this castor oil because my hair just loves it!  I have not experienced any problems with using this oil at all.  It has helped my edges slowly grow in so now i can see my hairline, my hair has thickened, and the overall health of my hair has improved and looks really healthy after including this oil in my hair regimen.  I would recommend this to my BFF.</li>
            <li> I really purchased the wrong one.I should have purchased the one with coconut oil. I will have to mix it in.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil,  I use it to seal my natural hair and it helped to regrow my eyebrows. I gave some to my aunt to help regrow her hair after chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> It helps with growth but it really doesnt smell all to pleasant . You dont not want to keep it in your hair if your going somewhere . It really does smell . But despite that, it works : ) Just mix a little Into some leave in conditioner or good smelling oil product to mask the smell .</li>
            <li> ...the smell, ugh.  I know some have said that it goes away, but I cant get past putting it on my head, near my nose.  I won&#x27;t be using it for my hair as I intended because it smells like burning tires, but I will find other uses for it.  Won&#x27;t order again though.</li>
            <li> I noticed my roots is growing thick that&#x27;s a good sign ! Although it is not a month yet im happy to see a little progress.</li>
            <li> I just started using JBCO about one month ago. So far I like it!!!  I mix this equal parts of JBCO with olive oil, coconut oil and essential oils; I massage this mixture into my scalp regularly.  Also, I warm up plain JBCO and apply it as a prepoo before I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for almost 2 years and I love it.  If you have dry hair or your hair isn&#x27;t breaking or it will not grow I recommend you to try this.  It may not work for everyone since everyone&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
            <li> It is a little too soon to see any benefits in terms of hair growth.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between this castor oil and the regular one.  It is very heavy</li>
            <li> this stuff has become a staple for my hair for the past year. its a excellant sealer, my hair drinks oil so fast, this stuff actually stays in my hair for days (not heavy) it just makes my hair incredibly soft, i will say USE AS A SEALER. dont use this alone, it will be way too thick. i do NOT like the smell of it at all, so i put it in my hair at night, in the morning i can hardly smell it. it works so well i dont even care about how it smells!!!! i did find the in the beauty supply store near my house!!! A++++</li>
            <li> Took little longer than expected. But all in all does wonders for hair!! (H didn&#x27;t joh firth hahahah huh dude)  lol.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!!!  This product is really good for your hair.  It thickens it if you are thinning and it makes your hair grow.  I will always keep JBCO on hand.....</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> JUST STARTED USING IT BUT SO FAR IT HAS BEEN GREAT FOR MY HAIR AND I DO PLAN ON ORDERING MORE OF THIS SAME PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE!</li>
            <li> Im so happy I found this I feel like a kid in the candy store. This band is better than the other one to from the threads I read which is an extra bonus. The price is basically unbeatable. I was paying almost $17 with tax at the BSS. Dam rip off. This is the place to get it and tell all your friends. I will buy from here forever!!!! Thank you</li>
            <li> it is proving to do everything it promised, I will tell everyone about this product. it is good for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl with 3C/4A hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years. I am not bothered by the smell or lack thereof. I mix sometimes with different carrier oils depending on the remedy I am seeking. I recommend this product to all natural haired ladies.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years , I use it on both of my daughetrs hair as well.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and my skin as well. I love this product! It comes well packaged so there won&#x27;t be any chances of leaks or bottles being broken in some ways.</li>
            <li> I like this oil it worked well on my hair and scalp I will buy this product again. I really love this oil !</li>
            <li> Has wonderful versatile use..... not just for conditioning and growing your hair!</li>
            <li> i use this all the time on my natural hair and i can&#x27;t get enough of it. definitely have noticed increased moisture retention, bounciness, and growth since i started using this over a year ago. 100% recommended but you have to use it consistently to see results!</li>
            <li> i am an African american  that just started going natural i had just this product for  1 and 1/2 months i DEFINITELY seen some improvement i put it on my scalp every other day and my hair became more thicker and softer the smell is a bit unflattering but i mixed it with coconut oil and i can&#x27;t even smell it! definitely a MUST but!!!!!-Sade</li>
            <li> Wow&lt;br /&gt;Jamaican Castor Oil great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it got in a timely manner work miracles on my hair and daughter natural hair plus its a good moisturizer for the dry skin</li>
            <li> Just got in the mail I&#x27;m sooo soo excited to use it .I&#x27;ll be cutting my relaxed to a lil shorter to start fresh again hopefully this oil can help me. I&#x27;m sure it will because I&#x27;ve heard nothing but great reviews on this!</li>
            <li> love this products&lt;br /&gt;really helps grow your hair trust me&lt;br /&gt;the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me i don&#x27;t even know why people mention it&lt;br /&gt;i have no complaints would recommend to anyone&lt;br /&gt;will be starting it along with my hair care regimen&lt;br /&gt;shipping was fast&lt;br /&gt;-very satisfied</li>
            <li> Late with my review but guess better late than ever. Purchase to help treat some hair loss around my edges. Began using last year finding this product to be effective for my hair loss from 20 yrs. ago.. Recommend this product to any one experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li> Love no strong smell use every other day no build up and noticed thickness</li>
            <li> This oil works wonders and God works miracles! If that makes sense at all. Great pack and price! Expect growth!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this daily and didn&#x27;t use it immediately, but I can say that I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is growing back around the edges.  I&#x27;d say this works fast considering I&#x27;m not a faithful user.  The product is a bit thick and it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell, but it dissipates after 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great product and quality!  Great for your edges and scalp.</li>
            <li> I compared the consistency of this one to my previous bottle of castor oil (same brand, different seller) and this twin pack has more fluidity and thinner. I do not like that. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair growth (been using about 6 months), but it does keep my hair shiny and moisturized; not so much my scalp, it just eats up this watered down oil. We know it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconuts, but it&#x27;s also not horrible...just wouldn&#x27;t want a man sniffing my hair. I&#x27;ll continue to use this for the much needed moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and excellent product for super hair growth and typically my hair grows SLOW but not anymore thanks to this. I will always buy this product as a staple for my hair care rituals.</li>
            <li> I love this castor oil.  the smell is not too strong and it really moisturizes my scalp and ends.  I think my hair has gotten a bit thicker.  However, in terms of length, I am not sure because i dont comb out my hair too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, what i love about this Castor Oil is that unlike coconut oil, it does not leave flakes after a while.</li>
            <li> Great product it really works and it grew my hair</li>
            <li> My Aunt and I love this oil. We use it in our hair and it feel great when I oil my scalp.</li>
            <li> This product did not grow my hair but it did make it thicker.</li>
            <li> Okay,  but very strong smell.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family is using it now as a pre condiationer before a hair wash and and the hair feels really soft!</li>
            <li> This product not only keeps your hair mositurized it also helps with hair growth, i had a bold spot from wearing quick weavs and braids and this helped with growing the hair back in. I absoutely love it.</li>
            <li> The is one of my favorite products. At this price it&#x27;s such a great deal. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this double pack again.</li>
            <li> JBCO is a great product for natural hair. It seals in moisture and softens my hair. I will highly recommend this product to my naturalists!</li>
            <li> Product was received on time, intact and was properly packaged.  I have already started using it, and am loving it.  Will update in a few week&#x27;s time on how it has worked for me and my family</li>
            <li> I use this to massage my scalp and I swear it is making my locs grow like wild! I am definitely stocking up on this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using JBCO for about 3 months now. It works wonders on my face and hair. I wish I would have started using it earlier.</li>
            <li> Been using the castor oil for only a short while and I am beginning to see some signs on new hair growth on my hair line. I will definitely continue.</li>
            <li> So far product has lived up to its name.  I will continue to buy, and also will tell my friends.</li>
            <li> loved it!  Highly recommend it for anyone needing more moisture in their hair and an oil that will not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s works well 9ntime my edges</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. It lasts very long once you use it sparingly. It helps to thicken hair and feels greât on my scalp. This is a staple of mines!</li>
            <li> Well packed and came on time. I use this oil my natural hair various mixes.  I use on face as well.</li>
            <li> Buying the pack of two is a great deal.  I really love this stuff and I use it on my hair and body mixed with jojoba oil and peppermint oil (for smell).  This stuff is a godsend.</li>
            <li> If you use this daily on your scalp you will probably see some increase hair growth, not much, but some.</li>
            <li> this is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve used this brand. This time around I 2 8oz. One for me and my grandmother. Great product</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and lustrous. I use it for deep conditioning as well as daily moisturizing. More than worth the money</li>
            <li> Great ! For hair and skin , I noticed thicker hair in less than a month . My edges grew in where they were once bald !!!</li>
            <li> My scalp feels better and my hair is soft and manageable. A must for those who are looking for a good treatment after breakage.</li>
            <li> It works great. I was reading reviews online about it helping with hair growth. Ever since starting using it hair has been much more elastic</li>
            <li> Way more than I thought I would get for the price. If I where any1 else I would by this. I&#x27;ve been helping my mother transition &amp; she had some breakage. We&#x27;ve been using it on those spots, &amp; so far we see improvement N those area&#x27;s. I use this oil as well &amp; a scalp message w/ this works great.</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t like the smell but I love the thickness and the ability to transform our natural hair. This is defenitely a staple product in our home. The 2 pack was a great investment!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was hope for cowlicks. The oil is thick and I would advise to research the other comments in advising what other oils this should be mixed with.</li>
            <li> I friggin love this oil!!! I had heard about it for so long and wanted to try it out. I purchased the 4oz bottle. I noticed drastic changes in my skin just from a 3 week use. I have stretch marks on certain areas of my body, just went all-natural (hair) and I have dark spots and blemishes all over my skin, as well as thin eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is where I noticed the change the most. Soft, subtle and I notice the very slight fading of my stretch marks!!! Now that is what makes me happy!! I love this product and the fact that it is all natural makes me even happier. As long as you keep selling this oil, I will keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and I cannot wait to receive my order!!! :-)</li>
            <li> Initially, I was quite skeptical about buying this stuff. I had read tons of reviews about it all over the internet. However, I really wondered if it would do anything for my hair at all. And after getting it home and using it, I quickly came to love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am someone that suffers with bad allergies. Also, I have very sensitive skin. And, I have had absolutely no bad reactions to this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JBCO does have a slight nutty smell to it. But, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger at all. In fact, I was actually scared about how bad or not it would actually smell. And, I can certainly say that this product barely has an odor to it at all. There are tons of products out there that I&#x27;ve tried that have smelled so bad till they either gave me a headache or made me feel sick to my stomach. This product doesn&#x27;t do either to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to apply the oil to my scalp once a week. I actually like to use it as a pre-treatment. I like to use it straight or mix it with either olive oil or coconut oil in an applicator bottle first. I then take a section of hair at a time, apply the oil to my scalp, massage the area, and then repeat the same process all over my entire head. Next, I take a little bit more oil and run it thoughout the entire length of my hair. I make sure that my whole head of hair has been thoroughly oiled. Afterwards, I put on a plastic cap and let the oil sit in my hair for 1 hour. And, lastly, I cleanse my hair as normal with my cleansing conditioner of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My naturally dry hair and scalp have become totally more moisturized since I started using JBCO on it. Also, my hair has gained greater shine to it too. And, I have seen a big reduction in shedded hairs since I started using this stuff as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, my hair is at mid-back length. However, I am working to grow it to even longer length (waist-length). For anyone that is working to achieve as much length and health to their hair as possible, I highly recommend taking the plunge and trying this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am 100% pleased with this product. And, I will definitely continue to purchase this stuff again and again!</li>
            <li> This is a prodcut that I was introduced to by a friend. I have been searching for it and found it on Amazon. The price was the push I needed to go forward with the purchase. I will definitely buy it again and recommend it to others as well.</li>
            <li> makes my hair thick and shiny.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product. I use it for lotion at bedtime to aid with arthritis symptoms. I keep it in in my house.</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil moisturizes my hair.  My hair has grown significantly since I have started using this castor oil.  I have used regular castor oil before but the Jamaican Black Castor Oil is better.  It really seals the moisture in my hair.  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it on my hair, as well as my two girls.</li>
            <li> I am from Jamaican background and can remember when I was little and my mother made this oil on the stove top from the actual castor beans but living in the U.S. and having some difficulty getting the actual castor beans, this is the next best thing.  I have Afro Caribbean textured hair but my hair is on the fine/thin side, so I use Castor oil predominately along the hairline  as it tends to weigh other parts of my hair down when used in larger quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use modest amounts on my eyebrows--I recently had an iron deficiency (see my review on Nature&#x27;s Way Alive Once Daily Multivitamins) that caused my eyebrows to become somewhat sparse (many didn&#x27;t notice but since I normally a very full eyebrows, I felt like I looked sick!) and I&#x27;ve noticed almost a full return to the lushness of my brows (yes, I will be tweezing (lol) but still...I like to begin with a thick, lush brow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use a tiny amount to blend into hot oil treatments and body oil (the kind you use on damp skin after a shower) and it&#x27;s fantastic in this regard.  Those concerned with the smoky scent, I blend with other neutral oils (Grapeseed is great) and one key essential oil (e.g. lavender, which makes a statement but is not too strong and is not pungent) and the scent works out fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know how to use Castor Oil and how much of the oil to use (a little goes a long way), it can be truly useful.</li>
            <li> Moisturized my hair the way I needed it to. It is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing out there for hair growth and fullness/volume. It also helps with aches and pains once applied to pan spot. Seller ships super quick. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast that when I received he box, I didn&#x27;t have a clue what to expect inside. No leaks or breakage of the glass bottles. It was very well protected. I can&#x27;t wait I begin using the oil.</li>
