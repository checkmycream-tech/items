            <li>It sounded great</li>

            <li>I am so happy for the good  idea</li>
            <li>Worked great and love that it&#x27;s so compact!</li>
            <li>This LED light works wonderful!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for traveling.</li>
            <li>I loved everything about it.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews that everyone wrote and thought it was a good product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and it fit perfectly over my toes to do my toenails.</li>
            <li>good news is that you can now use gel polish at home.</li>
            <li>Works perfect, no complaints &amp; the 45 second time lapse is a perfect amount of time.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for more gelish foundation, polish and top coat.  </li>
            <li>Great light!</li>
            <li>You have to do your 4 fingers and then your thumb, but it&#x27;s cute and portable and works great</li>
            <li>Very stylish and cute!</li>
            <li>&amp; I was beyond pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li>and I am a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>but I still love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I wiped more gel polish off my nails than having successful gel manicures.  </li>
            <li>Really love this one!</li>
            <li>Love!    </li>
            <li>smart gels- works great!!</li>
            <li>Works great, and light weight, mobile.</li>
            <li>I think the purple light is attractive as well.  </li>
            <li>This lamp is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What is great about this light is that it allows you to travel with your gel polish as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had never done my own gel nails before.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own when done.  </li>
            <li>It stores nicely in the box</li>
            <li>And was nicely told I was out of luck and that \\&quot;machine aging would make the item defective.\\</li>
            <li>Figured the compactness could come in handy as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li>but so far I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The light works fast &amp; does an amazing job!!!</li>
            <li>I would feel very comfortable taking this on a trip with me</li>
            <li>Works perfectly on Gelish nail polish or even regular polish for a quicker drying time.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for an led light for some time as I wanted to try my own gel mani.  </li>
            <li>I was able to do my mani in about an hour</li>
            <li>Love the built in timer.</li>
            <li>If the polish is tacky that is OK, however if it is runny then it&#x27;s not cured.  </li>
            <li>Product works for the most part.  </li>
            <li>Buy a better quality lamp.</li>
            <li>this cures my gel in 45 seconds, why wouldn&#x27;t I love it?</li>
            <li>lamp also comes with a nail buffer/ filer :)</li>
            <li>but I was ok with that.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact it turns off after 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li>and I love.</li>
            <li>wanted to love it, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d play it safe with this one.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the lamp has a timer.  </li>
            <li>I had to add this cute lamp to my mani/pedi tools.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I just received this item and was very excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It works pretty good, it does the job.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I haven&#x27;t had any problems since receiving the new lamp.</li>
            <li>Lovely and easy to carry anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I chose this light to replace the $75 one and it works better than the original!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with Gelish &amp; IBD brands so far, and it works great.</li>
            <li>Fantastic LED light!</li>
            <li>, however it is more comfortable to do the thumbs separately.</li>
            <li>Better than a UV light.</li>
            <li>LED was better for my hands rather than UV light.  </li>
            <li>I think it can fit most of hands according my experience.  </li>
            <li>Then I did some searching on the web and discovered you have to wipe the finished nails with rubbing alcohol to remove the &amp;#34;tackiness.&amp;#34; That solved my problem and I was glad I hadn&#x27;t returned the light.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it comes on more often than it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It is compact, so it is easy to store.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry.</li>
            <li>You can take it with you easily, now you don&#x27;t need to find any manicure salon while traveling, just take this lamp with you.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I did my toes with Gel polish &amp; they fit perfectly inside the mini lamp</li>
            <li>like I do, you can fit all 5 fingers in at once easily, but if you don&#x27;t be prepared to do your thumbs separately.</li>
            <li>i can put 4 fingers in just fine and</li>
            <li>This works fine for at home touch up with gelish....</li>
            <li>Either way is fine, it&#x27;s just what you prefer.  </li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE this nail dryer!! :)</li>
            <li>On a sticker, it says LED UV light.</li>
            <li>The brand name light lasted maybe four months.</li>
            <li>I can fit my fingers in this, but not my thumb.</li>
            <li>As a cosmetologist I needed an inexpensive light to use at home with my OPI gel colors.  </li>
            <li>so I can put all 5 fingers under the light at once</li>
            <li>This light works well.</li>
            <li>This light does in fact work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The misleading part about this light is it is NOT a LED light like advertised.  </li>
            <li>light anyway.  </li>
            <li>2-3x before I could get the light come on.  </li>
            <li>I rarely get more than 10 days on my gel manicures.  </li>
            <li>and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to fit any man hand in it though.</li>
            <li>This light works.</li>
            <li>I avoid the sun and UV light like a vampire.  </li>
            <li>This light didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>The light didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>The light does not have &#x27;bulbs&#x27; to break or burn out.</li>
            <li>Yeah not what i thought at all the script  of it adds what it dose not have and it feel so cheap like a toy</li>
            <li>I found that if I hold it over my hand while making &amp;#34;the claw&amp;#34; I can infact fit all 5 fingers in</li>
            <li>Cheap quality for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I was just at a beauty supply store and the clerk told me their UV light was &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; because it cured in &amp;#34;two minutes&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>works well but have to move my nails from side to side so that the light also hits the corner of my nails.  </li>
            <li>Apply a coat and put it under the light.</li>
            <li>You need to know that polish does not fully cure under the light, even in the salon.</li>
            <li>Because it feels so cheap, I don&#x27;t want to fool with trying a replacement unit.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Mini LED Light so I can take it on vacation with me...</li>
            <li>so you have to do one hand at a time but even so it&#x27;s soon much faster than uv!!!</li>
            <li>I was using a UV light, this one works much faster, doesn&#x27;t dry out my cuticles,  was a great price as well!</li>
            <li>quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I love this item very much.</li>
            <li>I had a super cheap UV light that never worked</li>
            <li>I was nervous &amp; excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little gel curing light!</li>
            <li>The price is SUPER cheap for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is great for gel nails especially with a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought my daughter a complete set for Christmas, so she could do her own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>(And just a tip: go after good quality LED/UV cure polished such as Gelish...</li>
            <li>This was such a good deal.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a reasonable price compared to Brand names.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and it works great, though I was going to go blind by how bright this was, I was expecting cheap UV LEDs in there</li>
            <li>I prefer a good book with a glass of wine and just take taking the extra time to do the thumbs separately.</li>
            <li>but you wouldn&#x27;t want your whole hand under unless you wanna tan your hand.  :-)  </li>
            <li>Good value for low cost lamp.</li>
            <li>Very small and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Had a UV light but with all the controversy over harmful rays AND a much longer drying time, I decided to invest in this LED light.</li>
            <li>It dries my nails quickly and I don&#x27;t feel the sticky residue I felt when using a UV lamp.</li>
            <li>I liked the size of it when I opened it, you can only fit four fingers in and do the thump separate</li>
            <li>I bought this light to do my own personal gel polish at home.</li>
            <li>Believe it when it says Super Mini.</li>
            <li>Works great and easy to store with small size.</li>
            <li>It also gets very hot with use,</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t fit the thumb, but it worked so fast that didn&#x27;t bother me one bit!</li>
            <li>I love doing my own gel nails, and you could tell I used it all the time because my previous lamp broke (the cord split right where it enters the light housing.)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t fit whole hand but still is a fairly quick process.</li>
            <li>When I moved it a certain way, the light would not turn on.</li>
            <li>great little product for the price.</li>
            <li>Great little portable gel nail dryer.</li>
            <li>any led light would cure nails much quicker than uv.</li>
            <li>I use OPI gel products and it works well and is MUCH cheaper than the OPI light.  </li>
            <li>, have to do my thumbs separately because the whole hand doesn&#x27;t fit under the lamp.</li>
            <li>It will fit your whole foot under if you are doing your feet</li>
            <li>You cannot fit your whole had under it.</li>
            <li>have tried this many times with many many different products and it ALWAYS left my nails tacky!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This light turns on with a push of the button on top and shuts off 45 seconds later or with another push on the button.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice on my nails and it did a great job for so much less than the competitors cost!  </li>
            <li>Timer helps get it right.</li>
            <li>Price was right</li>
            <li>It is more gentle on your nails, but it outlasts normal polish by miles.</li>
            <li>I love this little light!</li>
            <li>I took away one star for initially having to return the item, but overall I&#x27;m happy with the product &amp; the customer service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working for now, on me, but if I were to do someone else&#x27;s then, I would get a larger, more powerful one.</li>
            <li>Instead of laying 4 fingers on the table I just make a claw with my hands so I can cure my thumbs at the same time and hold the light with my free hand.</li>
            <li>I read some blog posts for tips before doing &amp; I need to make sure I have better lighting next time &amp; spend a little more time prepping my cuticles</li>
            <li>Very fast</li>
            <li>Great replacement for her Red Carpet kit light that broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time, I noticed a problem with the power cord.</li>
            <li>I also love how it is tiny and compact and not bulky.</li>
            <li>Wish I had gotten a bigger lamp with more lights</li>
            <li>Very quality product!</li>
            <li>which LEDs are not suppose to get hot.  </li>
            <li>It has an automatic timer built in which helps to much!</li>
            <li>I love it and totally recommend this over UV.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size, not too big and not so small that you bump your nails accidentally.  </li>
            <li>so I was able to get my entire hand in at one time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The timer is also exactly 45 seconds as it states.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Product works as designed, however, I wish I had bought one with more watts and one with different time settings.</li>
            <li>This goes for 45 seconds and for most gel polishes, it takes 30+ minutes per hand because it&#x27;s a low wattage lamp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first lamp</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want a larger one because then it&#x27;s more of a pain to lug around and to cure your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I would have kept it had it consistently worked.  </li>
            <li>This light worked just as expected and got the job done just fine...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really small, lightweight and stylish, most important it dry very fast!</li>
            <li>Very light and small so easy to store.</li>
            <li>It would be worth the extra money to buy a stronger light.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly and cures fast, I found nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li>product was not what I thought it would be not my finger tips fit inside the product, took double time for nails to dry, was more a burden than useful.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s Get Busy (I like the sheer sparkle) and ended up using the Izzy Wizzy on all of my nails as a touch up and did a fresh top coat on them all.  </li>
            <li>It feels like cheap junk, and apparently the one I got is, based on the on/off malfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Last night was the first time using this product and I love it so far!</li>
            <li>it has a preset time of 45 seconds, but I run my nails through two/ three times just to make sure they are dry.</li>
            <li>: I cure my first four fingers and stick my thumb of my other hand in there on top of my fingers to save a step.</li>
            <li>Bought this nail lamp, as a beginner, to avoid large outlay of cash and using too much counter space.  </li>
            <li>You cannot do your whole hand at once: you need to do your four fingers separate from your thumbs.</li>
            <li>I love the 30 sec cure time.</li>
            <li>The led lights don&#x27;t cure as fast as the 45 secs they claim.</li>
            <li>The light goes off automatically but one must still repeat for several rounds.</li>
            <li>light and simple.</li>
            <li>Dries nailes twice as fast.</li>
            <li>it really cost me about $10 for a shipping/return.  </li>
            <li>this unit works really well and is a steal for the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely cannot fit your entire 5 fingers under the led light at one time.</li>
            <li>So buyers beware, this is straight from the seller&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li>and you can put your whole hand in</li>
            <li>I purchased this item hoping to be LED light only.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing an LED LIGHT ONLY nail dryer at a brick and mortar store since there was no way I could have found out about this problem by reading the information on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is tiny, I can fit four fingers at a time.</li>
            <li>I used to use a uv lamp for curing my gelish mani/ pedis but didn&#x27;t like the fact that I was exposing myself so much to uv lights.</li>
            <li>is really a pain.</li>
            <li>but it still should be big enough to fit the whole hand in including the thumb without trying to contort my hand to make it fit.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well</li>
            <li>This product works so fast.</li>
            <li>Very practical for an inexpensive home manicure.  </li>
            <li>now I only use this light for my gel nails.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item a few months ago to start doing my own gel manicures at home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This dryer was supplied to me at the request for honest feedback on the product, good or bad.</li>
            <li>With this light you will have to double or even triple the time as it is no where near as strong as the major brand lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it is typically only applied at a salon because you need a special light to \\&quot;cure\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it ... ... ...</li>
            <li>It is small, nice and VERY portable and we&#x27;ll made.</li>
            <li>It is easy to dry four fingers then the thumb.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it my nails would not get completely set and I almost returned the lamp.  </li>
            <li>This works great, just doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough to dry.</li>
            <li>Light automatically shuts off when the polish is dry.</li>
            <li>I touched up the chipped nail (I do french manicures mostly) with Gelish Sheek White and then did a coat of Izzy Wizzy</li>
            <li>Have you ever heard of a machine becoming defective due to sitting unopened and un-used in a box?</li>
            <li>but this thing has 3 High Luminosity/Wattage LEDs, she loves it.</li>
            <li>I do have to keep my nails under the light a few extra rounds, but if ur looking for quick then u should search for a more powerful expensive light.</li>
            <li>I would recommend putting it on a flat surface and placing the hand beneath it because she tried to hold it over my hand in mid-air and even as quickly as it dries the nails</li>
            <li>I did one hand where I did the thumb separately, and one hand where I picked up the lamp and held it over my other hand (all five fingers cured just fine.)  </li>
            <li>If you are new to gel color you should read a tutorial about it as there is some confusion that if the polish is still tacky it&#x27;s not cured, which is incorrect.  </li>
            <li>bought new some where else.</li>
            <li>Small, true, but not so powerful.</li>
            <li>Love this little super-cute LED lamp!</li>
            <li>You definitely get what you pay for, cheap, unreliable, &amp; just flat</li>
            <li>Being an LED light you don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; your nails for half as long as if you use a simple UV light.  </li>
            <li>Super small, so I can travel with it, and it dries all my gel polish ridiculously fast!</li>
            <li>This is a UV lamp, it says so quite clearly on the label inside.  </li>
            <li>am a professional and want to use it wherever I go.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my old UV lamp, which I use at home with my Gelish kit.  </li>
            <li>I have used this item several times and really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>If you need an LED lamp, I would suggest NOT going with this model and trying the Vogue Professional lamp instead.</li>
            <li>But it only turns on when it wants to which</li>
            <li>So I ended up ordering the professional Harmony Gelish Led Dryer</li>
            <li>I have also had it turn off unexpectedly before the 45 seconds were up.  </li>
            <li>like that it makes the polish last so much longer</li>
            <li>So far it works as I needed it to</li>
            <li>UV looks cool in a dark room as well.</li>
            <li>It being LED is a huge bonus because it cures in half the time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to dry my nails for more than 3 hours with no success.</li>
            <li>It is easy to travel with because its so small..</li>
            <li>I can complete a quick mani and be out the door in less than 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Just ordered a new, more expensive lamp from Amazon and have my fingers crossed that I didn&#x27;t just waste more money.</li>
            <li>i followed directions to the letter and my nails were wet and sticky for a long time after putting my nails under the light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little short for my needs, but that is easily solved with an extension cord.  </li>
            <li>I have small hands, so I&#x27;m able to get entire hand in for drying at once, but someone with larger hands may have to do the thumb separately.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended for people who have extra small hands (child size)</li>
            <li>Very small, but it does the tricks and is easy to store.</li>
            <li>This little portable nail gel light is supposed to create hard dry nails when you use a nail gel that is made to be used with the ultraviolet light.  </li>
            <li>Just went to work on my nails tonight and the lamp completely died while doing my second hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken it completely apart and put it back together again</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t with an LED apparently.  </li>
            <li>You should be careful not to put very thick coats on as the polish will kind of lay on your nails rather than fully cure.</li>
            <li>No dry time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s powerful enough because my nails keep peeling off.</li>
            <li>The only disadvantage just like other people mentioned in a review is that you can&#x27;t do your fingers and thumb at the same time if you have big hands, but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Not the case if you buy a weak watt led light like this one.</li>
            <li>but I have to keep turning it on to cure the polish, 45 seconds is not long enough.</li>

            <li> I am so happy for the good  idea</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good for traveling.</li>
            <li> I loved everything about it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that everyone wrote and thought it was a good product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and it fit perfectly over my toes to do my toenails.</li>
            <li> good news is that you can now use gel polish at home.</li>

            <li> Really love this one!</li>
            <li> Love!    </li>
            <li> smart gels- works great!!</li>
            <li> Works great, and light weight, mobile.</li>
            <li> I think the purple light is attractive as well.  </li>
            <li> This lamp is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What is great about this light is that it allows you to travel with your gel polish as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had never done my own gel nails before.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own when done.  </li>
            <li> It stores nicely in the box</li>
            <li> And was nicely told I was out of luck and that \\&quot;machine aging would make the item defective.\\</li>
            <li> Figured the compactness could come in handy as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> but so far I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The light works fast &amp; does an amazing job!!!</li>
            <li> I would feel very comfortable taking this on a trip with me</li>
            <li> Works perfectly on Gelish nail polish or even regular polish for a quicker drying time.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an led light for some time as I wanted to try my own gel mani.  </li>
            <li> I was able to do my mani in about an hour</li>
            <li> Love the built in timer.</li>
            <li> If the polish is tacky that is OK, however if it is runny then it&#x27;s not cured.  </li>
            <li> Product works for the most part.  </li>
            <li> Buy a better quality lamp.</li>
            <li> this cures my gel in 45 seconds, why wouldn&#x27;t I love it?</li>
            <li> lamp also comes with a nail buffer/ filer :)</li>
            <li> but I was ok with that.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact it turns off after 45 seconds.  </li>
            <li> and I love.</li>
            <li> wanted to love it, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d play it safe with this one.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the lamp has a timer.  </li>
            <li> I had to add this cute lamp to my mani/pedi tools.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I just received this item and was very excited to use it.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say I haven&#x27;t had any problems since receiving the new lamp.</li>
            <li> Lovely and easy to carry anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I chose this light to replace the $75 one and it works better than the original!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with Gelish &amp; IBD brands so far, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Fantastic LED light!</li>
            <li> , however it is more comfortable to do the thumbs separately.</li>
            <li> Better than a UV light.</li>
            <li> LED was better for my hands rather than UV light.  </li>
            <li> I think it can fit most of hands according my experience.  </li>
            <li> Then I did some searching on the web and discovered you have to wipe the finished nails with rubbing alcohol to remove the &amp;#34;tackiness.&amp;#34; That solved my problem and I was glad I hadn&#x27;t returned the light.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it comes on more often than it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It is compact, so it is easy to store.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry.</li>
            <li> You can take it with you easily, now you don&#x27;t need to find any manicure salon while traveling, just take this lamp with you.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I did my toes with Gel polish &amp; they fit perfectly inside the mini lamp</li>
            <li> like I do, you can fit all 5 fingers in at once easily, but if you don&#x27;t be prepared to do your thumbs separately.</li>
            <li> i can put 4 fingers in just fine and</li>
            <li> This works fine for at home touch up with gelish....</li>
            <li> Either way is fine, it&#x27;s just what you prefer.  </li>
            <li> and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE this nail dryer!! :)</li>
            <li> On a sticker, it says LED UV light.</li>
            <li> The brand name light lasted maybe four months.</li>
            <li> I can fit my fingers in this, but not my thumb.</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist I needed an inexpensive light to use at home with my OPI gel colors.  </li>
            <li> so I can put all 5 fingers under the light at once</li>
            <li> This light works well.</li>
            <li> This light does in fact work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The misleading part about this light is it is NOT a LED light like advertised.  </li>
            <li> light anyway.  </li>
            <li> 2-3x before I could get the light come on.  </li>
            <li> I rarely get more than 10 days on my gel manicures.  </li>
            <li> and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to fit any man hand in it though.</li>
            <li> This light works.</li>
            <li> I avoid the sun and UV light like a vampire.  </li>
            <li> This light didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> The light didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The light does not have &#x27;bulbs&#x27; to break or burn out.</li>
            <li> Yeah not what i thought at all the script  of it adds what it dose not have and it feel so cheap like a toy</li>
            <li> I found that if I hold it over my hand while making &amp;#34;the claw&amp;#34; I can infact fit all 5 fingers in</li>
            <li> Cheap quality for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I was just at a beauty supply store and the clerk told me their UV light was &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; because it cured in &amp;#34;two minutes&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> works well but have to move my nails from side to side so that the light also hits the corner of my nails.  </li>
            <li> Apply a coat and put it under the light.</li>
            <li> You need to know that polish does not fully cure under the light, even in the salon.</li>
            <li> Because it feels so cheap, I don&#x27;t want to fool with trying a replacement unit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Mini LED Light so I can take it on vacation with me...</li>
            <li> so you have to do one hand at a time but even so it&#x27;s soon much faster than uv!!!</li>
            <li> I was using a UV light, this one works much faster, doesn&#x27;t dry out my cuticles,  was a great price as well!</li>
            <li> quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I love this item very much.</li>
            <li> I had a super cheap UV light that never worked</li>
            <li> I was nervous &amp; excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little gel curing light!</li>
            <li> The price is SUPER cheap for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is great for gel nails especially with a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought my daughter a complete set for Christmas, so she could do her own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li> (And just a tip: go after good quality LED/UV cure polished such as Gelish...</li>
            <li> This was such a good deal.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a reasonable price compared to Brand names.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and it works great, though I was going to go blind by how bright this was, I was expecting cheap UV LEDs in there</li>
            <li> I prefer a good book with a glass of wine and just take taking the extra time to do the thumbs separately.</li>
            <li> but you wouldn&#x27;t want your whole hand under unless you wanna tan your hand.  :-)  </li>
            <li> Good value for low cost lamp.</li>
            <li> Very small and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Had a UV light but with all the controversy over harmful rays AND a much longer drying time, I decided to invest in this LED light.</li>
            <li> It dries my nails quickly and I don&#x27;t feel the sticky residue I felt when using a UV lamp.</li>
            <li> I liked the size of it when I opened it, you can only fit four fingers in and do the thump separate</li>
            <li> I bought this light to do my own personal gel polish at home.</li>
            <li> Believe it when it says Super Mini.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to store with small size.</li>
            <li> It also gets very hot with use,</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t fit the thumb, but it worked so fast that didn&#x27;t bother me one bit!</li>
            <li> I love doing my own gel nails, and you could tell I used it all the time because my previous lamp broke (the cord split right where it enters the light housing.)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t fit whole hand but still is a fairly quick process.</li>
            <li> When I moved it a certain way, the light would not turn on.</li>
            <li> great little product for the price.</li>
            <li> Great little portable gel nail dryer.</li>
            <li> any led light would cure nails much quicker than uv.</li>
            <li> I use OPI gel products and it works well and is MUCH cheaper than the OPI light.  </li>
            <li> , have to do my thumbs separately because the whole hand doesn&#x27;t fit under the lamp.</li>
            <li> It will fit your whole foot under if you are doing your feet</li>
            <li> You cannot fit your whole had under it.</li>
            <li> have tried this many times with many many different products and it ALWAYS left my nails tacky!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This light turns on with a push of the button on top and shuts off 45 seconds later or with another push on the button.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice on my nails and it did a great job for so much less than the competitors cost!  </li>
            <li> Timer helps get it right.</li>
            <li> Price was right</li>
            <li> It is more gentle on your nails, but it outlasts normal polish by miles.</li>
            <li> I love this little light!</li>
            <li> I took away one star for initially having to return the item, but overall I&#x27;m happy with the product &amp; the customer service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working for now, on me, but if I were to do someone else&#x27;s then, I would get a larger, more powerful one.</li>
            <li> Instead of laying 4 fingers on the table I just make a claw with my hands so I can cure my thumbs at the same time and hold the light with my free hand.</li>
            <li> I read some blog posts for tips before doing &amp; I need to make sure I have better lighting next time &amp; spend a little more time prepping my cuticles</li>
            <li> Very fast</li>
            <li> Great replacement for her Red Carpet kit light that broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time, I noticed a problem with the power cord.</li>
            <li> I also love how it is tiny and compact and not bulky.</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten a bigger lamp with more lights</li>
            <li> Very quality product!</li>
            <li> which LEDs are not suppose to get hot.  </li>
            <li> It has an automatic timer built in which helps to much!</li>
            <li> I love it and totally recommend this over UV.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size, not too big and not so small that you bump your nails accidentally.  </li>
            <li> so I was able to get my entire hand in at one time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The timer is also exactly 45 seconds as it states.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Product works as designed, however, I wish I had bought one with more watts and one with different time settings.</li>
            <li> This goes for 45 seconds and for most gel polishes, it takes 30+ minutes per hand because it&#x27;s a low wattage lamp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first lamp</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want a larger one because then it&#x27;s more of a pain to lug around and to cure your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I would have kept it had it consistently worked.  </li>
            <li> This light worked just as expected and got the job done just fine...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small, lightweight and stylish, most important it dry very fast!</li>
            <li> Very light and small so easy to store.</li>
            <li> It would be worth the extra money to buy a stronger light.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and cures fast, I found nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> product was not what I thought it would be not my finger tips fit inside the product, took double time for nails to dry, was more a burden than useful.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s Get Busy (I like the sheer sparkle) and ended up using the Izzy Wizzy on all of my nails as a touch up and did a fresh top coat on them all.  </li>
            <li> It feels like cheap junk, and apparently the one I got is, based on the on/off malfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Last night was the first time using this product and I love it so far!</li>
            <li> it has a preset time of 45 seconds, but I run my nails through two/ three times just to make sure they are dry.</li>
            <li> : I cure my first four fingers and stick my thumb of my other hand in there on top of my fingers to save a step.</li>
            <li> Bought this nail lamp, as a beginner, to avoid large outlay of cash and using too much counter space.  </li>
            <li> You cannot do your whole hand at once: you need to do your four fingers separate from your thumbs.</li>
            <li> I love the 30 sec cure time.</li>
            <li> The led lights don&#x27;t cure as fast as the 45 secs they claim.</li>
            <li> The light goes off automatically but one must still repeat for several rounds.</li>
            <li> light and simple.</li>
            <li> Dries nailes twice as fast.</li>
            <li> it really cost me about $10 for a shipping/return.  </li>
            <li> this unit works really well and is a steal for the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely cannot fit your entire 5 fingers under the led light at one time.</li>
            <li> So buyers beware, this is straight from the seller&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> and you can put your whole hand in</li>
            <li> I purchased this item hoping to be LED light only.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing an LED LIGHT ONLY nail dryer at a brick and mortar store since there was no way I could have found out about this problem by reading the information on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is tiny, I can fit four fingers at a time.</li>
            <li> I used to use a uv lamp for curing my gelish mani/ pedis but didn&#x27;t like the fact that I was exposing myself so much to uv lights.</li>
            <li> is really a pain.</li>
            <li> but it still should be big enough to fit the whole hand in including the thumb without trying to contort my hand to make it fit.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well</li>
            <li> This product works so fast.</li>
            <li> Very practical for an inexpensive home manicure.  </li>
            <li> now I only use this light for my gel nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few months ago to start doing my own gel manicures at home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This dryer was supplied to me at the request for honest feedback on the product, good or bad.</li>
            <li> With this light you will have to double or even triple the time as it is no where near as strong as the major brand lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is typically only applied at a salon because you need a special light to \\&quot;cure\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it ... ... ...</li>
            <li> It is small, nice and VERY portable and we&#x27;ll made.</li>
            <li> It is easy to dry four fingers then the thumb.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it my nails would not get completely set and I almost returned the lamp.  </li>
            <li> This works great, just doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough to dry.</li>
            <li> Light automatically shuts off when the polish is dry.</li>
            <li> I touched up the chipped nail (I do french manicures mostly) with Gelish Sheek White and then did a coat of Izzy Wizzy</li>
            <li> Have you ever heard of a machine becoming defective due to sitting unopened and un-used in a box?</li>
            <li> but this thing has 3 High Luminosity/Wattage LEDs, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I do have to keep my nails under the light a few extra rounds, but if ur looking for quick then u should search for a more powerful expensive light.</li>
            <li> I would recommend putting it on a flat surface and placing the hand beneath it because she tried to hold it over my hand in mid-air and even as quickly as it dries the nails</li>
            <li> I did one hand where I did the thumb separately, and one hand where I picked up the lamp and held it over my other hand (all five fingers cured just fine.)  </li>
            <li> If you are new to gel color you should read a tutorial about it as there is some confusion that if the polish is still tacky it&#x27;s not cured, which is incorrect.  </li>
            <li> bought new some where else.</li>
            <li> Small, true, but not so powerful.</li>
            <li> Love this little super-cute LED lamp!</li>
            <li> You definitely get what you pay for, cheap, unreliable, &amp; just flat</li>
            <li> Being an LED light you don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; your nails for half as long as if you use a simple UV light.  </li>
            <li> Super small, so I can travel with it, and it dries all my gel polish ridiculously fast!</li>
            <li> This is a UV lamp, it says so quite clearly on the label inside.  </li>
            <li> am a professional and want to use it wherever I go.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old UV lamp, which I use at home with my Gelish kit.  </li>
            <li> I have used this item several times and really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> If you need an LED lamp, I would suggest NOT going with this model and trying the Vogue Professional lamp instead.</li>
            <li> But it only turns on when it wants to which</li>
            <li> So I ended up ordering the professional Harmony Gelish Led Dryer</li>
            <li> I have also had it turn off unexpectedly before the 45 seconds were up.  </li>
            <li> like that it makes the polish last so much longer</li>
            <li> So far it works as I needed it to</li>
            <li> UV looks cool in a dark room as well.</li>
            <li> It being LED is a huge bonus because it cures in half the time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to dry my nails for more than 3 hours with no success.</li>
            <li> It is easy to travel with because its so small..</li>
            <li> I can complete a quick mani and be out the door in less than 10 mins.</li>
            <li> Just ordered a new, more expensive lamp from Amazon and have my fingers crossed that I didn&#x27;t just waste more money.</li>
            <li> i followed directions to the letter and my nails were wet and sticky for a long time after putting my nails under the light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little short for my needs, but that is easily solved with an extension cord.  </li>
            <li> I have small hands, so I&#x27;m able to get entire hand in for drying at once, but someone with larger hands may have to do the thumb separately.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended for people who have extra small hands (child size)</li>
            <li> Very small, but it does the tricks and is easy to store.</li>
            <li> This little portable nail gel light is supposed to create hard dry nails when you use a nail gel that is made to be used with the ultraviolet light.  </li>
            <li> Just went to work on my nails tonight and the lamp completely died while doing my second hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken it completely apart and put it back together again</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t with an LED apparently.  </li>
            <li> You should be careful not to put very thick coats on as the polish will kind of lay on your nails rather than fully cure.</li>
            <li> No dry time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s powerful enough because my nails keep peeling off.</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage just like other people mentioned in a review is that you can&#x27;t do your fingers and thumb at the same time if you have big hands, but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Not the case if you buy a weak watt led light like this one.</li>
            <li> but I have to keep turning it on to cure the polish, 45 seconds is not long enough.</li>
            <li> If you leave the lamp sitting on a flat surface, it is difficult to put your entire hand under, making sure that each nail has cured.  </li>
            <li> Have to dry the thumb last.</li>
            <li> It only partially cured gel polish and didn&#x27;t work at all on regular polish.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this little lamp!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard (since you&#x27;re not supposed to wipe the sticky off until the very end).</li>
            <li> not a professional</li>
            <li> I hope it is durable and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:68e2f455bd0145d023618fe763361879]]DO NOT BUY, complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is: if you have the gelish nail polish it takes longer to dry, by the machine automatically shuts off every 45 sec</li>
            <li> Granted you can&#x27;t do your thumb on the same hand, the time it takes to cure outweighs that little set back.</li>
            <li> I only do my nails once a week or every other week</li>
            <li> Not sure on the longevity for professional use.</li>
            <li> Please note, unless you have child size hands, you will need to dry your thumbs separately due to the compact size of the machine.</li>
            <li> You can dry all your nails on one hand if you hold it with the other hand.  </li>
            <li> partial refund?</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> It has 110-240v so that it can travel world wide.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Gel polish doesn&#x27;t crack or chip even when you are rough on your polish.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough.</li>
            <li> It is very small - but it is advertised as such, although actual dimensions were not given.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for helping me keep what could be an expensive treat such as having to go to salon to get gel nails, extremely affordable!</li>
            <li> so I place 4 fingers of one hand, then the other, then both thumbs.  </li>
            <li> Other than the size, it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I agree with the other that ordered this lamp.</li>
            <li> I do my four fingers, then my two thumbs, then my other four fingers.</li>
            <li> This lamp saves a lot of time due to the shorter curing time.  </li>
            <li> I got it the other day</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I do one hand start-to-finish before doing the other.  </li>
            <li> But, my other observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have pointed out, the lamp actually says &amp;#34;UV&amp;#34; in a small sticker on the underside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to fit your fingers and thumb, but I knew that going in.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with anything other than the uv lights that the salons use, but I was disappointed to find that it took several cycles to dry each coat of polish.</li>
            <li> Very small you can only put maybe 3 fingers in, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when i first looked at this little unit, but gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Doing all five fingers together works, however I learned the hard way that if you don&#x27;t keep the thumb flat (if you pick up your hand to paint the other nails</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cord length.  </li>
            <li> I have been reading up and one thing I may need to do differently is buff my nails a bit before the foundation, but we travel at least twice a year</li>
            <li> It does take (3) 45-second time periods for each coat (maybe longer for dark colors)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li> The only negative is the lack of thorough instructions.  </li>
            <li> Not what i expected dident cure the polishes waste of me</li>
            <li> I do it all the way from base coat to top coat before moving to thumbs</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had waited past the 30-day guarantee period to open up the package, due to an unexpected family emergency, so I was not covered by the 30-day guarantee.</li>
            <li> That being said, it wells extremely well and cures my gelish nails!</li>
            <li> these items take less coats to get to the desired color.)</li>
            <li> By the time I was done an hour and a half went by and my nails were still sticky.</li>
            <li> (You will need to watch the clock on the steps that require less than 45 seconds)</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> The lights are very small and just not worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li> Broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It seems to be worse after using for a while and having turned it on several times.  </li>
            <li> the gel slides down and can get thick on the down side.</li>
            <li> It is a little small when trying to get 5 fingers in there at once.</li>
            <li> It is a little small</li>
            <li> my nail polish dried in the time it said it would!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small (hence &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; in the title)</li>
            <li> The lamp in only 6w which makes it difficult and timely.  </li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> I have had it in a box the past year from having to move a ton of times but use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This unit is extremely small, also.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and it&#x27;s small and convenient to carry from place to place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> I like how small it is</li>
            <li> The lamp is small so if you want to do all 5 nails at once, you have to hold the lamp in one hand while putting your polished nails in a claw shape with your palm facing up.  </li>
            <li> But it is just too small for my size 8M feet with toe</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard for both to be still that</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in late May and recieved no problem.</li>
            <li> However, I had to put my nails under it at least 8 times each hand in order for the gelish polish to cure.</li>
            <li> If I could of given this product a negative star, I would have.  </li>
            <li> It fits and stores in small spaces, and it works so well for curing Gelish polish!</li>
            <li> So small!</li>
            <li> However, the dryer itself is very small.</li>
            <li> If you have very small hands</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small drier.</li>
            <li> I used it after applying a thin coat of OPI gel polish at least 15 times each on my fingers and toes.  </li>
            <li> hate wasting money &amp; this has been a big waste!</li>
            <li> Not happy.  </li>
            <li> Apply thin coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works just like an expensive LED you would find in the salon.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because it took forever for my Harmony Gelish Polish to dry.  </li>
            <li> Of course it will take longer since it has a measly 6 bulbs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that this is falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> I was just generally disappointed.  </li>
            <li> And, I have no product for the money that I was charged.  :(</li>
            <li> I was so sad as I began to look for a replacement lamp, and was appalled that they all seemed to be something like $80!  </li>
            <li> and I hate to have one of my nails chip on me while I&#x27;m away.  </li>
            <li> but it can get annoying.</li>

            <li> great little product for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Very small, but it does the tricks and is easy to store.</li>
            <li> This LED light works wonderful!  It is compact, so it is easy to store. I was using a UV light, this one works much faster, doesn&#x27;t dry out my cuticles,  was a great price as well!</li>
            <li> Works great, and light weight, mobile. Works great with my gelish basix kit. Thankfully haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> Great light! Very light and small so easy to store. Works perfectly on Gelish nail polish or even regular polish for a quicker drying time. Had a UV light but with all the controversy over harmful rays AND a much longer drying time, I decided to invest in this LED light. Have been really happy with the purchase. Please note, unless you have child size hands, you will need to dry your thumbs separately due to the compact size of the machine. Not a problem since GEL polish cures in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few months ago to start doing my own gel manicures at home. When I used it for the first time, I noticed a problem with the power cord. When I moved it a certain way, the light would not turn on. I had to move it around multiple times in order to finish my nails. I emailed the seller &amp; informed them of the issue. I was contacted by one of their representatives the same day &amp; my product was replaced. I&#x27;m happy to say I haven&#x27;t had any problems since receiving the new lamp. I&#x27;ve used it with Gelish &amp; IBD brands so far, and it works great. I took away one star for initially having to return the item, but overall I&#x27;m happy with the product &amp; the customer service.</li>
            <li> You definitely get what you pay for, cheap, unreliable, &amp; just flat out bulls***.</li>
            <li> Very stylish and cute! The timer is a plus!!!</li>
            <li> just used it and for my money, i would recommend it...it is cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not a professional but it got the job done, and my nail polish dried in the time it said it would!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in late May and recieved no problem. It worked well.  After about 6 uses the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button broke and it is now unusable.</li>
            <li> Great little portable gel nail dryer. Works wonderfully. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Works great with china glaze gelaze polish. Cures perfect</li>
            <li> Can get my nails done quicker</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an led light for some time as I wanted to try my own gel mani.  I was happy to get this on amazon prime day for a good deal!  I was nervous &amp; excited to give it a try.  I had never done my own gel nails before.  I got a kit from a local beauty store &amp; followed the instructions!  I was able to do my mani in about an hour &amp; I was beyond pleased with the results!  They came out awesome!!!  I did my nails a week ago &amp; they still look great!  Honestly they look just like a salon gel mani!  I read some blog posts for tips before doing &amp; I need to make sure I have better lighting next time &amp; spend a little more time prepping my cuticles but honestly I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  The light works fast &amp; does an amazing job!!!</li>
            <li> Well, the lamp does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I cure my gel polish with one tap of the button, I think it is 45 seconds or so.  It turns off on it&#x27;s own when done.  It&#x27;s small (hence &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; in the title) so I place 4 fingers of one hand, then the other, then both thumbs.  My only complaint is the cord length.  It&#x27;s a little short for my needs, but that is easily solved with an extension cord.  Overall, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered my MelodySusie LED Nail Dryer and it works great! It dries my nails quickly and I don&#x27;t feel the sticky residue I felt when using a UV lamp. However, the dryer itself is very small. You cannot do your whole hand at once: you need to do your four fingers separate from your thumbs. Other than the size, it gets the job done and I am a satisfied customer! If they made a slightly bigger model and offered it at the same price, I would buy it.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected dident cure the polishes waste of me money</li>
            <li> Very simple to use! Love the built in timer. Light automatically shuts off when the polish is dry. Portable, lightweight! A must have for get polish! Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Product says LED. Not true. I agree with the other that ordered this lamp. On a sticker, it says LED UV light. But other than that, I did my toes with Gel polish &amp; they fit perfectly inside the mini lamp</li>
            <li> I bought my daughter a complete set for Christmas, so she could do her own gel nails at home. The brand name light lasted maybe four months. I chose this light to replace the $75 one and it works better than the original! I highly recommend this little lamp!</li>
            <li> I can fit my fingers in this, but not my thumb. I do my four fingers, then my two thumbs, then my other four fingers. I do it all the way from base coat to top coat before moving to thumbs so it&#x27;s hard (since you&#x27;re not supposed to wipe the sticky off until the very end). It&#x27;s a wonderful compact size.</li>
            <li> Worked great and love that it&#x27;s so compact! Yes it only does 4 fingers at a time and you have to do your thumb separate but I still love it!</li>
            <li> Very small and works perfectly. I love the 30 sec cure time.</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist I needed an inexpensive light to use at home with my OPI gel colors.  This light worked just as expected and got the job done just fine... It is easy to travel with because its so small.. It didnt bother me that I had to cure my thumbs separately.</li>
            <li> This product is great for gel nails especially with a reasonable price! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This item does not work at all. I&#x27;ve been trying to dry my nails for more than 3 hours with no success. It doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star.</li>
            <li> Small, true, but not so powerful. It&#x27;s working for now, on me, but if I were to do someone else&#x27;s then, I would get a larger, more powerful one. The led lights don&#x27;t cure as fast as the 45 secs they claim. The light goes off automatically but one must still repeat for several rounds.</li>
            <li> I love this item very much. Working great and the size is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Very light and simple. Only four fingers you can put inside machine at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional and want to use it wherever I go. Easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Last night was the first time using this product and I love it so far! It gets the job done! it has a preset time of 45 seconds, but I run my nails through two/ three times just to make sure they are dry. Only gave four stars because I have only used once. I will have to update this review later on. I also love how it is tiny and compact and not bulky. Love it!</li>
            <li> The lamp in only 6w which makes it difficult and timely.  Wish I had gotten a bigger lamp with more lights</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with the purchase! I have used it twice on my nails and it did a great job for so much less than the competitors cost!  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Fantastic LED light! Super small, so I can travel with it, and it dries all my gel polish ridiculously fast! Very quality product! Would recommend to anyone who is looking to learn to do the shellac/gel polish!</li>
            <li> product was not what I thought it would be not my finger tips fit inside the product, took double time for nails to dry, was more a burden than useful. Strongly recommended for people who have extra small hands (child size)</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for my OPI Gel Polish &amp; Harmony Gelish Polish. I have small hands so I can put all 5 fingers under the light at once, however it is more comfortable to do the thumbs separately. It stores nicely in the box it came in.</li>
            <li> This light works well. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to fit your fingers and thumb, but I knew that going in. Just takes longer to switch. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old UV lamp, which I use at home with my Gelish kit.  This lamp saves a lot of time due to the shorter curing time.  If you have very small hands like I do, you can fit all 5 fingers in at once easily, but if you don&#x27;t be prepared to do your thumbs separately.</li>
            <li> This light does in fact work.  Of course it will take longer since it has a measly 6 bulbs.  If you are new to gel color you should read a tutorial about it as there is some confusion that if the polish is still tacky it&#x27;s not cured, which is incorrect.  If the polish is tacky that is OK, however if it is runny then it&#x27;s not cured.  With this light you will have to double or even triple the time as it is no where near as strong as the major brand lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The misleading part about this light is it is NOT a LED light like advertised.  This is a UV lamp, it says so quite clearly on the label inside.  It also gets very hot with use, which LEDs are not suppose to get hot.  I&#x27;ve read up on the effects of UV lamps and wanted a LED just for safety purposes.  I&#x27;m very disappointed that this is falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> This works just like an expensive LED you would find in the salon. It has an automatic timer built in which helps to much! I love it and totally recommend this over UV. LED is way faster.. (And just a tip: go after good quality LED/UV cure polished such as Gelish... these items take less coats to get to the desired color.)</li>
            <li> Works perfect, no complaints &amp; the 45 second time lapse is a perfect amount of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter. She used it to do my nails, so bonus! It did all it was supposed to do. I would recommend putting it on a flat surface and placing the hand beneath it because she tried to hold it over my hand in mid-air and even as quickly as it dries the nails it&#x27;s hard for both to be still that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think she likes it, so I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Works great. Dries nailes twice as fast. Better than a UV light. You can dry all your nails on one hand if you hold it with the other hand.  Just turn your hands with your palms facing you and bend your fingers.</li>
            <li> This was such a good deal. I have had it in a box the past year from having to move a ton of times but use it all the time. Even having the cord bent and stuff, it still works great. It&#x27;s portable and big enough for regular hands. I love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> No problems with this LED lamp. Timer helps get it right. UV looks cool in a dark room as well.</li>
            <li> Price was right but I have to keep turning it on to cure the polish, 45 seconds is not long enough.</li>
            <li> I love this little light! It fits and stores in small spaces, and it works so well for curing Gelish polish! It being LED is a huge bonus because it cures in half the time!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  I wiped more gel polish off my nails than having successful gel manicures.  The lights are very small and just not worth the money spent.  This unit is extremely small, also. I got it because I thougth LED was better for my hands rather than UV light.  I bought gloves to go wiht the UV light anyway.  I was just generally disappointed.  I paid shipping for this coming and going so it really cost me about $10 for a shipping/return.  And, I have no product for the money that I was charged.  :(</li>
            <li> I bought this lamp to use with the Harmony Gelish nail polish system.  Being an LED light you don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;bake&amp;#34; your nails for half as long as if you use a simple UV light.  It is the perfect size, not too big and not so small that you bump your nails accidentally.  I think the purple light is attractive as well.  I have used this item several times and really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work great for gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! So small! And works good! Just what I wanted! You can take it with you easily, now you don&#x27;t need to find any manicure salon while traveling, just take this lamp with you.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for more gelish foundation, polish and top coat.  Best price around!!</li>
            <li> For someone looking to get started using gel polishes but on a budget, this device is ideal. Works great and easy to store with small size. I have small hands, so I&#x27;m able to get entire hand in for drying at once, but someone with larger hands may have to do the thumb separately.</li>
            <li> Product works for the most part.  I only had this for 2 months now and the on/off doesn&#x27;t always work.  I have to press on it 2-3x before I could get the light come on.  I also think the wiring is lose as I have to straighten the cord to make it work also.</li>
            <li> this unit works really well and is a steal for the price. If you are looking for a great starter lamp this is it</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I used it after applying a thin coat of OPI gel polish at least 15 times each on my fingers and toes.  It is still sticky!</li>
            <li> Works great. It is a little small when trying to get 5 fingers in there at once. Have to dry the thumb last. I guess I wouldn&#x27;t want it any bigger or I couldn&#x27;t throw it in my purse</li>
            <li> I rarely get more than 10 days on my gel manicures.  I have been reading up and one thing I may need to do differently is buff my nails a bit before the foundation, but we travel at least twice a year and I hate to have one of my nails chip on me while I&#x27;m away.  I just got this and tried it. I touched up the chipped nail (I do french manicures mostly) with Gelish Sheek White and then did a coat of Izzy Wizzy Let&#x27;s Get Busy (I like the sheer sparkle) and ended up using the Izzy Wizzy on all of my nails as a touch up and did a fresh top coat on them all.  It does take (3) 45-second time periods for each coat (maybe longer for dark colors) but this is the perfect size to travel with and so nice to know I can &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; if needed while away or just to extend the manicure.  I hope it is durable and lasts a long time but so far I am very happy with it.  It does say it only fits four fingers, but my hands are smaller so I was able to get my entire hand in at one time.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with anything other than the uv lights that the salons use, but I was disappointed to find that it took several cycles to dry each coat of polish.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Definitely cannot fit your entire 5 fingers under the led light at one time. You have to do your 4 fingers and then your thumb, but it&#x27;s cute and portable and works great so I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s powerful enough because my nails keep peeling off. But that&#x27;s probably the quality of the polish, not the dryer.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:68e2f455bd0145d023618fe763361879]]DO NOT BUY, complete waste of money. It did not work from the moment I took it out of the box. Unfortunately I had waited past the 30-day guarantee period to open up the package, due to an unexpected family emergency, so I was not covered by the 30-day guarantee. I did contact the seller and asked if we could do something about it -- return? exchange? refund? partial refund? And was nicely told I was out of luck and that \\&quot;machine aging would make the item defective.\\&quot; So buyers beware, this is straight from the seller&#x27;s mouth. Have you ever heard of a machine becoming defective due to sitting unopened and un-used in a box? Neither have I. If you need an LED lamp, I would suggest NOT going with this model and trying the Vogue Professional lamp instead. I got it the other day and it is fabulous. Very fast and you can put your whole hand in and it cures the gels in 30 seconds. http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CEIDWK6/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Great for the price. Don&#x27;t expect to fit any man hand in it though.</li>
            <li> Broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> for the price it&#x27;s great! have to do thumbs separate, but i knew that before i purchased so it&#x27;s no biggie</li>
            <li> I used this M.S mini led nail dryer in my best friend home. It&#x27;s really awesome so I bought it then I can do my nail whenever I want! It&#x27;s really small, lightweight and stylish, most important it dry very fast! I use it with Gelish polish and then it shine! The only disadvantage just like other people mentioned in a review is that you can&#x27;t do your fingers and thumb at the same time if you have big hands, but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me. I think it can fit most of hands according my experience.  I REALLY LIKE this nail dryer!! :)</li>
            <li> This works great, just doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough to dry. Have to keep turning it on</li>
            <li> So far so good! This light works. I love that it is a reasonable price compared to Brand names. Would recommend for home use. Not sure on the longevity for professional use.</li>
            <li> Had to send it back because it quit working after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for setting up the gel!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item hoping to be LED light only.  I avoid the sun and UV light like a vampire.  This nail dryer has a warning at the bottom that tells you that you will be getting UV radiation.  I will be purchasing an LED LIGHT ONLY nail dryer at a brick and mortar store since there was no way I could have found out about this problem by reading the information on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is tiny, I can fit four fingers at a time. It&#x27;s good for traveling. It works pretty good, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough. Returned.</li>
            <li> This light didn&#x27;t work for me.  It arrived (shipped by Amazon) with ripped and torn packaging and no directions.  Amazon offered me a 10% discount for the used item.  I was considering taking the discount, but then I tried using it. The light didn&#x27;t work.  It only partially cured gel polish and didn&#x27;t work at all on regular polish. Not happy.  Returning.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when i first looked at this little unit, but gave it a try.  This is a great little gel curing light! It is small, nice and VERY portable and we&#x27;ll made. Yes, you have to cure the finger nails and the thumb separately, but you should do this anyway so the gel stays level on the thumb...the gel is self leveling and if the thumbnail is tipped on the side during curing...the gel slides down and can get thick on the down side. The light does not have &#x27;bulbs&#x27; to break or burn out. The cord is the removable type. It has 110-240v so that it can travel world wide. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> does what it says.  i use gelish with it.  i can put 4 fingers in just fine and then the thumbs.  lightweight.  quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a couple uses. Buy a better quality lamp. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This does it&#x27;s job, but my understanding was any led light would cure nails much quicker than uv. Not the case if you buy a weak watt led light like this one. It would be worth the extra money to buy a stronger light.</li>
            <li> This Melody Susie stopped working after 3 min. I should have paid attention to the other reviews. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Yeah not what i thought at all the script  of it adds what it dose not have and it feel so cheap like a toy .&lt;br /&gt;I bought new some where else.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift and my wife says it takes forever to try her nails</li>
            <li> I loved everything about it. Product arrived on time and it&#x27;s small and convenient to carry from place to place. The only issue I have is: if you have the gelish nail polish it takes longer to dry, by the machine automatically shuts off every 45 sec you have to keep clicking the on button. Other than that I love it ... ... ... Great purchaseðŸ’–.</li>
            <li> Love this little super-cute LED lamp! Works like a charm! I&#x27;m very pleased with the sleek design as well! Ordered it because didn&#x27;t like the design of those, which are sold at drug stores. Really love this one!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and it works great, though I was going to go blind by how bright this was, I was expecting cheap UV LEDs in there but this thing has 3 High Luminosity/Wattage LEDs, she loves it.</li>
            <li> This thing is so great, I&#x27;ve got zero patience this cures my gel in 45 seconds, why wouldn&#x27;t I love it? Plus the LED doesn&#x27;t damage my nails! I found that if I hold it over my hand while making &amp;#34;the claw&amp;#34; I can infact fit all 5 fingers in</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy to receive this.  Great replacement for her Red Carpet kit light that broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I used to use a uv lamp for curing my gelish mani/ pedis but didn&#x27;t like the fact that I was exposing myself so much to uv lights. I switched to this mini led and I&#x27;m soon happy with it. It&#x27;s small so you have to do one hand at a time but even so it&#x27;s soon much faster than uv!!! I can complete a quick mani and be out the door in less than 10 mins. Instead of laying 4 fingers on the table I just make a claw with my hands so I can cure my thumbs at the same time and hold the light with my free hand. For 10, 20 or 30 secs.. Its really not a big deal. I would definitely pick this over uv any day</li>
            <li> Great lamp!! It is a little small so you have to do your thumb separately but its no biggiee, it fits 4 fingers perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The timer is also exactly 45 seconds as it states.&lt;br /&gt;The lamp also comes with a nail buffer/ filer :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with Gel polish. Cheap quality for the price I paid. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> When this product works its great.  But it only turns on when it wants to which is really a pain.</li>
            <li> I like how small it is but it still should be big enough to fit the whole hand in including the thumb without trying to contort my hand to make it fit.  That&#x27;s my only complaint so just keep that in mind when ordering if you have big hands it may not work.</li>
            <li> This little portable nail gel light is supposed to create hard dry nails when you use a nail gel that is made to be used with the ultraviolet light.  i followed directions to the letter and my nails were wet and sticky for a long time after putting my nails under the light.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to do gel polish at home. I use OPI gel products and it works well and is MUCH cheaper than the OPI light.  I do one hand start-to-finish before doing the other.  The only negative is the lack of thorough instructions.  The first time I used it my nails would not get completely set and I almost returned the lamp.  Then I did some searching on the web and discovered you have to wipe the finished nails with rubbing alcohol to remove the &amp;#34;tackiness.&amp;#34; That solved my problem and I was glad I hadn&#x27;t returned the light. The lamp is small so if you want to do all 5 nails at once, you have to hold the lamp in one hand while putting your polished nails in a claw shape with your palm facing up.  I prefer a good book with a glass of wine and just take taking the extra time to do the thumbs separately.</li>
            <li> Bought this to do gel at home. Figured the compactness could come in handy as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this many times with many many different products and it ALWAYS left my nails tacky!&lt;br /&gt;I have read &amp; reread directions, advice online etc....&lt;br /&gt;Never worked.&lt;br /&gt;I hate wasting money &amp; this has been a big waste!</li>
            <li> I liked the size of it when I opened it, you can only fit four fingers in and do the thump separate but I was ok with that. Shipping was fast as well and I love the fact it turns off after 45 seconds.  However, I had to put my nails under it at least 8 times each hand in order for the gelish polish to cure. By the time I was done an hour and a half went by and my nails were still sticky. It sounded great but it didn&#x27;t work well with me. So I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that everyone wrote and thought it was a good product.  However, the product did not meet my expectations.  I was very disappointed because it took forever for my Harmony Gelish Polish to dry.  So I ended up ordering the professional Harmony Gelish Led Dryer and I love.</li>
            <li> I bought this light to do my own personal gel polish at home. It works great for the price I paid! I do have to keep my nails under the light a few extra rounds, but if ur looking for quick then u should search for a more powerful expensive light.</li>
            <li> Product works as designed, however, I wish I had bought one with more watts and one with different time settings. This goes for 45 seconds and for most gel polishes, it takes 30+ minutes per hand because it&#x27;s a low wattage lamp.</li>
            <li> This lamp is amazing. Granted you can&#x27;t do your thumb on the same hand, the time it takes to cure outweighs that little set back. It&#x27;s INCREDIBLY faster than a UV lamp -- I was just at a beauty supply store and the clerk told me their UV light was &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; because it cured in &amp;#34;two minutes&amp;#34;.... MelodySusie LED cures in 45 SECONDS! The price is SUPER cheap for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first lamp and I have NO reason to buy a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: I cure my first four fingers and stick my thumb of my other hand in there on top of my fingers to save a step. Otherwise you&#x27;d have to cure four fingers, four fingers, and THEN your two thumbs. I wouldn&#x27;t want a larger one because then it&#x27;s more of a pain to lug around and to cure your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it fit perfectly over my toes to do my toenails.</li>
            <li> This couldn&#x27;t even cure my Sally Hansen gel polish.</li>
            <li> works well but have to move my nails from side to side so that the light also hits the corner of my nails.  Not so convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, have to do my thumbs separately because the whole hand doesn&#x27;t fit under the lamp. I only do my nails once a week or every other week so I don&#x27;t mind but it can get annoying.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t found gel nail polish, you are back in nail polish stone ages. Gel polish doesn&#x27;t crack or chip even when you are rough on your polish. The only drawback is that it is typically only applied at a salon because you need a special light to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how it works.  Apply a coat and put it under the light. It is set on auto-timer for 45 seconds. It will fit your whole foot under if you are doing your feet but you wouldn&#x27;t want your whole hand under unless you wanna tan your hand.  :-)  You&#x27;ll need to do your fingers then the thumbs separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you apply another coat and so on. You need to know that polish does not fully cure under the light, even in the salon. It does take some air time to cure as well so that should be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that you can now use gel polish at home. It is more gentle on your nails, but it outlasts normal polish by miles. You should be careful not to put very thick coats on as the polish will kind of lay on your nails rather than fully cure. Apply thin coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is great about this light is that it allows you to travel with your gel polish as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer was supplied to me at the request for honest feedback on the product, good or bad.</li>
            <li> Bought this nail lamp, as a beginner, to avoid large outlay of cash and using too much counter space.  The lamp does indeed cure OPI gel color.  However, the on/off switch works intermittently.  Sometimes the lamp will come on when the button is pressed, sometimes it won&#x27;t.  Fortunately, it comes on more often than it doesn&#x27;t.  It seems to be worse after using for a while and having turned it on several times.  I have also had it turn off unexpectedly before the 45 seconds were up.  Sort of acts like it&#x27;s overheating and shutting down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this reason alone, I am returning it and buying something else.  But, my other observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is very small - but it is advertised as such, although actual dimensions were not given.  It is easy to dry four fingers then the thumb.  But it is just too small for my size 8M feet with toe spreaders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It feels like cheap junk, and apparently the one I got is, based on the on/off malfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love it, but I don&#x27;t.  However, I would have kept it had it consistently worked.  Because it feels so cheap, I don&#x27;t want to fool with trying a replacement unit.</li>
            <li> Very small you can only put maybe 3 fingers in, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this lamp based on the seller&#x27;s description that it&#x27;s an LED lamp. I&#x27;ve read about the potential hazards of UV lamps, so I thought I&#x27;d play it safe with this one. As other reviewers have pointed out, the lamp actually says &amp;#34;UV&amp;#34; in a small sticker on the underside. It&#x27;s going back!</li>
            <li> This works fine for at home touch up with gelish....&lt;br /&gt;I like that it makes the polish last so much longer</li>
            <li> I used the MelodySusie lamp with the Gelish gel polish and it worked great!  If you leave the lamp sitting on a flat surface, it is difficult to put your entire hand under, making sure that each nail has cured.  I did one hand where I did the thumb separately, and one hand where I picked up the lamp and held it over my other hand (all five fingers cured just fine.)  Either way is fine, it&#x27;s just what you prefer.  Doing the thumb separate took an extra 30 seconds or so per coat.  Doing all five fingers together works, however I learned the hard way that if you don&#x27;t keep the thumb flat (if you pick up your hand to paint the other nails like I do), the paint gathers at the cuticle, which in turn will peel if you cure it on the cuticle.  I love the fact that the lamp has a timer.  I did my nails while watching TV and was done before I knew it.  No dry time.  Love!    Edit:  I&#x27;ve used the lamp about 15-20 times.  Just went to work on my nails tonight and the lamp completely died while doing my second hand.  I&#x27;ve taken it completely apart and put it back together again and it&#x27;s done.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I will not buy from this company again.  I searched for a way to replace bulbs but you can&#x27;t with an LED apparently.  Just ordered a new, more expensive lamp from Amazon and have my fingers crossed that I didn&#x27;t just waste more money.</li>
            <li> Lovely and easy to carry anywhere.  This product works so fast. Very practical for an inexpensive home manicure.  I am so happy for the good  idea I had to add this cute lamp to my mani/pedi tools.</li>
            <li> So far it works as I needed it to</li>
            <li> I purchased this Mini LED Light so I can take it on vacation with me...now I only use this light for my gel nails. Love it...it&#x27;s so portable and cures my nails in 45 seconds!</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and cures fast, I found nothing wrong with it. I love it</li>
            <li> Using with orly smart gels- works great!! Can&#x27;t fit whole hand but still is a fairly quick process. Good value for low cost lamp.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to get my nails done so I invested in this and it works just fine. I got the instructions on the Gelish website. This light turns on with a push of the button on top and shuts off 45 seconds later or with another push on the button. (You will need to watch the clock on the steps that require less than 45 seconds)</li>
            <li> Awesome! I had a super cheap UV light that never worked so I ordered this as it was the best rated of the cheaper LEDs. Cured Gelaze nail polish in 45 seconds! Couldn&#x27;t fit the thumb, but it worked so fast that didn&#x27;t bother me one bit! I would feel very comfortable taking this on a trip with me, it&#x27;s so compact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small drier. Believe it when it says Super Mini. You cannot fit your whole had under it. That being said, it wells extremely well and cures my gelish nails!</li>
            <li> I just received this item and was very excited to use it.  I turned it on twice and it never worked again.  I bought the product on Amazon and I paid for 2 day air and now I am out the money for shipping and then Amazon would not replace the product they would only take it back and then refund the money.  If I could of given this product a negative star, I would have.  Also, I will never buy a MelodySusie product again.</li>
            <li> It has defiantly served its purpose. I like it a lot. It is perfect for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Ordered this LED lamp to replace a lamp that I received with a Sephora gel LED lamp that I got as a gift over 2 years ago. I love doing my own gel nails, and you could tell I used it all the time because my previous lamp broke (the cord split right where it enters the light housing.) I was so sad as I began to look for a replacement lamp, and was appalled that they all seemed to be something like $80!  I found this on Amazon and was so happy! Great price, just for the lamp, and it works great! Thanks for helping me keep what could be an expensive treat such as having to go to salon to get gel nails, extremely affordable!</li>
