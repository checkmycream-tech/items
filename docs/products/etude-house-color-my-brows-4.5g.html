            <li>but it is the perfect shade.</li>
            <li>ITS JUST PERFECT!!!!</li>
            <li>Great product .but</li>
            <li>Great condition, product colors my eyebrows well.</li>
            <li>However, the product itself was a good color.  </li>
            <li>super pigmented and matches my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love the color!</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a real light brown and not beige, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the sample and the cute letter made my day!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>So many better brow products out there.</li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and well-packaged, but to be honest, I did not like it at all.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the light brown in this mascara for my eyebrows to give them more definition.  </li>
            <li>And so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Thought this was a great idea; but it was more red than light brown and it clumps as you put it on.  </li>
            <li>But, the product is fine.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars just for being cheap.</li>
            <li>I am really surprise with this product I  liked</li>
            <li>The color is not what I would call light brown.  </li>
            <li>But, this stuff was remarkably bad--very fake-looking--it was like cheap paint actually--</li>
            <li>OMG I AM IN LOVE , THIS AI A STRANGE WONDERFUL COLOR LIKE A GOLD BLONDE WITH A HINT OF GLITTER</li>
            <li>However, the company also shipped the product with cleanser samples and also a letter of thanks for shopping with them!</li>
            <li>I threw it away after the first use.  </li>
            <li>It was great to finally find something for my brows that was not so black.</li>
            <li>This works well, but I ordered light brown and it is really red.</li>
            <li>It stays really well.</li>
            <li>Really like it ..</li>
            <li>My whole face looks so much softer.</li>
            <li>It had a very orangish tint to it.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned this might be too light for me</li>
            <li>Picture should of  been clear on what They were selling..</li>
            <li>( I am a 58 year old man with dye resistant eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I barely had any on when I immediately removed it.  </li>
            <li>I expected the size of the brow mascara to be the size of any normal eye mascara</li>

            <li> I expected the size of the brow mascara to be the size of any normal eye mascara</li>
            <li> I have been buying make-up for about 40 years, both high-end and lower-priced make-up, and I usually either really like a product or just deem it &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Pity - back to the eyebrow pencil to fill in.</li>
            <li> The vendor packed it with care; however, it took an exceptionally long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> The formula is also very dry, and sometimes the scratchy applicator hurts as I put it on.</li>
            <li> not the color I expected</li>
            <li> I have other brow color gels that I prefer.</li>
            <li> A little bit dry when I got it.</li>
            <li> however it was almost half the size I expected.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hide my dark black eyebrows as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> all dried out could not use.  </li>
            <li> What a waste</li>
            <li> The color I received was NOT light brown but an orangish, tan, clay-like color.  </li>
            <li> the color was a reddish gold not light brown</li>
            <li> Used it for a few days; but no more.  </li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this at all.  </li>
            <li> Not a very good product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Also, SLOW to arrive.</li>
            <li> Not a good color at all.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s really hard to take off at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> It turned my eyebrows an orange color and looked really fake.  </li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> Atrocious color.</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing.  </li>

            <li> I don,t think any one has that Brow color. It wasn&#x27;t for me!!!</li>
            <li> This works well, but I ordered light brown and it is really red. Also, SLOW to arrive. I wouldn&#x27;t  order again because of the color discrepancy.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned this might be too light for me but it is the perfect shade. And so easy to use. Would order again.</li>
            <li> OMG I AM IN LOVE , THIS AI A STRANGE WONDERFUL COLOR LIKE A GOLD BLONDE WITH A HINT OF GLITTER I LOVE IT ON MY EYEBROWS . ITS JUST PERFECT!!!!</li>
            <li> Atrocious color. Non-human. And cheap-looking. So many better brow products out there.</li>
            <li> This is okay. It doesn&#x27;t hide my dark black eyebrows as well as I&#x27;d hoped. The formula is also very dry, and sometimes the scratchy applicator hurts as I put it on. It stays really well. In fact, it&#x27;s really hard to take off at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> I expected the size of the brow mascara to be the size of any normal eye mascara however it was almost half the size I expected.  It does the job however lacks amount in the product for what I wanted. However, the company also shipped the product with cleanser samples and also a letter of thanks for shopping with them! I enjoyed the sample and the cute letter made my day! I would definitely order from them again, even thoigh im aware of the small sizing</li>
            <li> all dried out could not use.  They don&#x27;t take returns.  What a waste and I waited weeks to get it.</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing.  I threw it away after the first use.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It turned my eyebrows an orange color and looked really fake.  I gave it 2 stars just for being cheap.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and well-packaged, but to be honest, I did not like it at all.  I have been buying make-up for about 40 years, both high-end and lower-priced make-up, and I usually either really like a product or just deem it &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  But, this stuff was remarkably bad--very fake-looking--it was like cheap paint actually--I barely had any on when I immediately removed it.  I would not recommend it---sorry.</li>
            <li> Really like it .. But was fool by the picture they show two of them together .. I brought it thinking I was going to get the blond and brown one .. Only receive the blond .. Great product .but Picture should of  been clear on what They were selling..Take solo picture of each item apart ..</li>
            <li> Thought this was a great idea; but it was more red than light brown and it clumps as you put it on.  Used it for a few days; but no more.  Pity - back to the eyebrow pencil to fill in.</li>
            <li> It took along time to come and then, I found out it came from overseas.  But, the product is fine.</li>
            <li> It was great to finally find something for my brows that was not so black. My whole face looks so much softer. ( I am a 58 year old man with dye resistant eyebrows. Could not be happier</li>
            <li> I am really surprise with this product I  liked</li>
            <li> The color is not what I would call light brown.  It had a very orangish tint to it.  Not a good color at all.  However, the product itself was a good color.  The vendor packed it with care; however, it took an exceptionally long time to arrive.</li>

            <li> It was ok. A little bit dry when I got it.</li>
            <li> not the color I expected</li>
            <li> I purchased the light brown in this mascara for my eyebrows to give them more definition.  The color I received was NOT light brown but an orangish, tan, clay-like color.  I am not satisfied with this at all.  So if you are looking for a real light brown and not beige, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried it anyway hoping that it would work, the stuff just clumped on.  Not a very good product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love the color! super pigmented and matches my hair perfectly. Would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> the color was a reddish gold not light brown</li>
