            <li>Perfect for travel!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a good product!</li>
            <li>great travel size...</li>
            <li>Best product to maintain oral health and healthy gums.</li>
            <li>At that size it&#x27;d be a good deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with how well the products work.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent &amp; is renewing my oral health as well as giving me a reason to smile again.</li>
            <li>I have noticed change for the better!</li>
            <li>this is the product you need, the SLS free formula is great for preventing them.  </li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>Being TSA compliant is handy when traveling.</li>
            <li>Nice to find the travel size.</li>
            <li>I recommended CloSys toothpaste to my patients; no SLS which is soap for foaming that causes sensitivity and canker sores and is in most toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>it is ok in my book..</li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t be able to get through TSA with it in your carry on.  </li>
            <li>The best way to buy this product is to schedule regular ship-free deliveries.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using CloSYS products for many years since his dentist introduced him to the product line.</li>
            <li>The taste is nice and will really enjoy seeing how this works with the information found in Kiss</li>
            <li>Will know more after a couple of months</li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>Have to order some more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a strong minty flavor</li>
            <li>I truly believe in these products, not only for their ability to combat mouth odor, which hands down is the best product out there, but I have had nothing but great dental cleanings and healthier teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I searched for this item looking for Flouride Free travel sized toothpaste and accidentally ordered it because I assumed that it was fluoride free</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVEE it !!!</li>
            <li>love Closys products (5-stars worth), but the issue with this trial size kit seems to be more than just a one-time thing, so I can&#x27;t recommend this particular kit.</li>
            <li>I use the full size</li>
            <li>The actual product is good, but don&#x27;t buy this version of it.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I need for trips!</li>
            <li>It does not contain alcohol and does what it claims, fresh breath and no burning.</li>
            <li>The bottles were just the right size - used them for 2 weeks and no problems with airport security.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Closys products, and a few year baseline indicates that it is at least a good and maybe a uniquely good product for me (fewer deep pockets, and generally great gum</li>
            <li>and so I like this toothpaste and rinse very much.</li>
            <li>My local drugstores do not carry it anymore, most people have never heard of it</li>
            <li>Now he never has to worry about leaving home on a trip without having clean and fresh breath for the entire trip.</li>
            <li>rinse and spray don&#x27;t have any flavor and the toothpaste has just a very mellow mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Plus they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>So absolutely grateful I found these product.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t put in the \\&quot;taste\\&quot; that they give you with it, the oral rinse really has no taste at all.  </li>
            <li>It is a complete system and if used according to the directions it really works.</li>
            <li>I use the normal toothpaste</li>
            <li>That way he would not have his normal tube of toothpaste confiscated by the TSA.</li>
            <li>I just went to a new dentist and they were amazed at the shape my mouth was in,</li>
            <li>It has a similar active ingredient as in prescripion Periodex rinse, but without the alcohol that can irritate sensitive gums, and without the problem of tooth-staining many people experience with the prescription rinse.  </li>
            <li>Beware, it does not give you the burning pepper minty intensity that other mouthwashes and toothpastes do, but is IS highly effective, and long lasting</li>
            <li>Needed to travel a few times lately and was really happy to find this toothpaste/mouthwash TSA compliant from Closys.  </li>
            <li>I am a teacher and feel confident each day that I can speak to my students individually without turning their faces green!</li>
            <li>(carefully) used a razor blade to slice off the bottom few mm of the cap, and it now seats well to the top.</li>
            <li>That said, I was very skeptical of the product but it works amazingly well!  </li>
            <li>I like the product very much, but the toothpaste is slightly OVER the allowed 3-ounce limit.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little travel kit but has 1 very small toothpaste.</li>

            <li> I like the product very much, but the toothpaste is slightly OVER the allowed 3-ounce limit.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little travel kit but has 1 very small toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Prior to getting this TSA approved CloSYS kit, my husband would use almost all of a tube of CloSYS toothpaste and then save the last little amount in a drawer for his next business trip.  </li>
            <li> Long term usage will determine value.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(I refill the little toothpaste tubes by forming a &#x27;kiss&#x27; of it with the larger tube and squeezing the larger tube.</li>
            <li> but I will be going back to my other toothpaste</li>
            <li> I like the spray for when my mouth is feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> discovered, though, upon unpacking after my first trip, a terrible flaw in the design of the mouthwash bottle: the bottom lip of the cap bottoms out on the shoulder of the bottle before the cap top seals to the threaded neck of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use it without adding the little extra bottle provided for those who want a minty aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> Toothpaste really doesn&#x27;t kill the bacteria causing bad breath and the leading mouthwashes only seem to last for an hour.  </li>
            <li> I see one poor review for the actual size (3.4oz) being smaller than the pictured size (8oz).  </li>
            <li> The product is really good, my teeth are not nearly so sensitive, it aids in gingivitis and the mouthwash really keeps the bad breath away without the awful taste.  </li>
            <li> I use the products everyday.  </li>
            <li> wanted a small mouthwash bottle with which I could travel, and had been using improvised solutions, but the 100mL bottle appealed to me and the label would make it a little easier to distinguish in my travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has a small travel sized toothpaste, a small breath-spray, a small mouthwash and a small flavoring to add to the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> So: 5 stars for the product itself, minus 3 stars for the lousy design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To date, CloSYS has been the only toothpaste product that has helped my husband&#x27;s bad breath problems without affecting his sense of taste.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is the horrible tasting (not exaggerating) breath spray.</li>
            <li> mint-containing rinses are irritating.  </li>
            <li> Bad odor is gone &amp; gums are healing.</li>
            <li> I always had bad teeth and hated going for cleanings until I started with Closis.</li>
            <li> The spray is terrible (tasting) but the oral rinse is the lynchpin product.  </li>

            <li> I searched for this item looking for Flouride Free travel sized toothpaste and accidentally ordered it because I assumed that it was fluoride free which it was not.  I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Being TSA compliant is handy when traveling. I like everything about the product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I need for trips! The only down side is the horrible tasting (not exaggerating) breath spray. What were they thinking?</li>
            <li> Needed to travel a few times lately and was really happy to find this toothpaste/mouthwash TSA compliant from Closys.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this brand, you must.  Nice to find the travel size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a strong minty flavor and so I like this toothpaste and rinse very much. I don&#x27;t use the included mint concentrate drops.&lt;br /&gt;The rinse and spray don&#x27;t have any flavor and the toothpaste has just a very mellow mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I use the products everyday.  I&#x27;m very pleased with how well the products work.  Plus they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I used this on recent travel. The bottles were just the right size - used them for 2 weeks and no problems with airport security.  I use the full size Closys products that I get from my dentist at home.  The product is really good, my teeth are not nearly so sensitive, it aids in gingivitis and the mouthwash really keeps the bad breath away without the awful taste.  It&#x27;s just a good product!</li>
            <li> The picture shows an 8 oz bottle and 5 oz toothpaste. At that size it&#x27;d be a good deal. What you actually receive is a 3.4 oz bottle and a teeny-tiny bottle of toothpaste. (lost it on vacation, so can&#x27;t post actual size.) The actual product is good, but don&#x27;t buy this version of it.</li>
            <li> I really like the Closys products, and a few year baseline indicates that it is at least a good and maybe a uniquely good product for me (fewer deep pockets, and generally great gum health).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a small mouthwash bottle with which I could travel, and had been using improvised solutions, but the 100mL bottle appealed to me and the label would make it a little easier to distinguish in my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered, though, upon unpacking after my first trip, a terrible flaw in the design of the mouthwash bottle: the bottom lip of the cap bottoms out on the shoulder of the bottle before the cap top seals to the threaded neck of the bottle. In short, the foolish thing leaks by design, and with pressure changes in aircraft, it is not academic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unscrewed the cap and (carefully) used a razor blade to slice off the bottom few mm of the cap, and it now seats well to the top. This should not be necessary! So: 5 stars for the product itself, minus 3 stars for the lousy design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I refill the little toothpaste tubes by forming a &#x27;kiss&#x27; of it with the larger tube and squeezing the larger tube. Takes some practice not to lose a lot of toothpaste, though!)</li>
            <li> This is a nice little travel kit but has 1 very small toothpaste. I recommended CloSys toothpaste to my patients; no SLS which is soap for foaming that causes sensitivity and canker sores and is in most toothpastes. This has a small travel sized toothpaste, a small breath-spray, a small mouthwash and a small flavoring to add to the mouthwash. I like the toothpaste. I recommend this but recommend a larger size toothpaste for daily use, I would buy again, and hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> So absolutely grateful I found these product.  Cancer sore sufferers this is the product you need, the SLS free formula is great for preventing them.  I use the normal toothpaste so I bought this and put it with my passport for my upcoming trip.  Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> it is ok in my book.. I wanted try something different to help my teeth and gums... great travel size... but I will be going back to my other toothpaste</li>
            <li> I see one poor review for the actual size (3.4oz) being smaller than the pictured size (8oz).  This is the TSA TRAVEL SIZE which MUST be no larger than 3.4oz!  If you want/need a larger size, by all means purchase it but you won&#x27;t be able to get through TSA with it in your carry on.  That said, I was very skeptical of the product but it works amazingly well!  The spray is terrible (tasting) but the oral rinse is the lynchpin product.  If you don&#x27;t put in the \\&quot;taste\\&quot; that they give you with it, the oral rinse really has no taste at all.  It makes your breath smell like..well..nothing!  Toothpaste really doesn&#x27;t kill the bacteria causing bad breath and the leading mouthwashes only seem to last for an hour.  TRY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I have been a Closis  fan for the last 7 years or so, since my dental hygienist turned me on to it, and I have never gone back. I truly believe in these products, not only for their ability to combat mouth odor, which hands down is the best product out there, but I have had nothing but great dental cleanings and healthier teeth and gums. I just went to a new dentist and they were amazed at the shape my mouth was in, (I am 53). I always had bad teeth and hated going for cleanings until I started with Closis. My local drugstores do not carry it anymore, most people have never heard of it and I have never seen it advertised. Beware, it does not give you the burning pepper minty intensity that other mouthwashes and toothpastes do, but is IS highly effective, and long lasting, you just don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s working, but it is. I am a teacher and feel confident each day that I can speak to my students individually without turning their faces green! I tried this kit because I never had the mouth spray and would like to see how that works, it&#x27;s in my purse and I have used it, it&#x27;s great as well!</li>
            <li> I like the product but this size is way overpriced.  The best way to buy this product is to schedule regular ship-free deliveries.</li>
            <li> Just the size I needed</li>
            <li> I have noticed change for the better! This product is excellent &amp; is renewing my oral health as well as giving me a reason to smile again. Bad odor is gone &amp; gums are healing.</li>
            <li> Just enough for a 12-day trip - no problems with airport security when including in carryon bag</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year. It was recommended by my dental hygienist. It does not contain alcohol and does what it claims, fresh breath and no burning.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using CloSYS products for many years since his dentist introduced him to the product line. To date, CloSYS has been the only toothpaste product that has helped my husband&#x27;s bad breath problems without affecting his sense of taste.  Prior to getting this TSA approved CloSYS kit, my husband would use almost all of a tube of CloSYS toothpaste and then save the last little amount in a drawer for his next business trip.  That way he would not have his normal tube of toothpaste confiscated by the TSA. Using this kit, he now takes all three items, the toothpaste, the mouthwash and the breath spray with him on business trips.  Now he never has to worry about leaving home on a trip without having clean and fresh breath for the entire trip.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much, but the toothpaste is slightly OVER the allowed 3-ounce limit. So how do they call THAT &amp;#34;TSA compliant&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;perfectly tsa compliant for flight travel,&lt;br /&gt;perfect size for brief travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel! Best product to maintain oral health and healthy gums. Never leave home without it. Fits in purse</li>
            <li> CloSYS is a product my dentist recommends for anyone with periodontal issues.  It has a similar active ingredient as in prescripion Periodex rinse, but without the alcohol that can irritate sensitive gums, and without the problem of tooth-staining many people experience with the prescription rinse.  I use it without adding the little extra bottle provided for those who want a minty aftertaste.  I find mint-containing rinses are irritating.  I like the spray for when my mouth is feeling dry.  The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates, Triclosan or Gluten.</li>
            <li> Was what I was ordering and will meet my needs</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Long term usage will determine value.  There is no way to evaluate this product on a short term basis.</li>
            <li> The taste is nice and will really enjoy seeing how this works with the information found in Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye book.  Will know more after a couple of months and I see the dentist again.</li>
            <li> Outstanding. See my review of the entire line of these Clo Sys products. It is a complete system and if used according to the directions it really works. Have been a user for about eight years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RFS&lt;br /&gt;San Diego County CA</li>
            <li> Omg I never knew it was possible NOT to have morning breath until I tried this stuff !! Have to order some more I absolutely LOVEE it !!!</li>
            <li> Mouthwash was leaking out of the bottle when the kit arrived.  I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement, and when the replacement arrived it had the same issue.  I sent that one back for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Closys products (5-stars worth), but the issue with this trial size kit seems to be more than just a one-time thing, so I can&#x27;t recommend this particular kit.</li>
