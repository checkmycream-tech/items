            <li>Love it, supper soft and easy fit in my makeup bag for those on the go touch up.</li>

            <li>I have been searching for a good retractable brush for a while now and have finally found it!</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft and it is full, unlike some brushes that do not have sufficient amount of bristles in the tip.</li>

            <li>It is cute, it is very durable and the brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>It is soft and full!</li>
            <li>it is pink, which is one of my favorite colors!</li>
            <li>and I love how shiny it is I would definitely buy another one</li>
            <li>After the reviews and the &amp;#34; how to properly use your brush to get the most out of your brush&amp;#34; email I thought hmm looking forward to getting this item.</li>
            <li>Not only is it cute and compact..</li>
            <li>It is dense enough but one thing I will say is that I&#x27;ve had kabuki brushes with much better blending abilities.</li>
            <li>It will definitely be in my staple because it is so travel friendly!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty easy to close and open without messing the brush up.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice little brush.  </li>
            <li>I use it pretty rarely, but so far its holding up and hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles, etc.</li>
            <li>The actual brush is fine.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s retractable</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The lid stays on very well.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot, so I always like having travel ready luggage</li>
            <li>It also is very compact.</li>
            <li>but this brush has a nifty and very functional retractable system.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty soft</li>
            <li>I have never really been a fan of retractable brushes as I find they break easily or</li>
            <li>The metal could be a little stronger, though, in order to better support the enclosed brush.</li>
            <li>The brush is very well put together and th brissles are nice and soft but still dense which is hard to find.</li>
            <li>It was really soft and the case seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Not going to replace my normal powder brush</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is very soft.</li>
            <li>The brush is VERY soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, dense, and picks up plenty of power product.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised that it was a larger brushhead than I had anticipated!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle, sleeve and cap are made out of a thin, lightweight metal which means it is better protected.</li>
            <li>When you are done with it simply pull the sleeve back up over the brush, replace the cap and push it back down to its original, compact size.</li>

I actually have a name brand brush that&#x27;s similar in style and this works just as well as the name brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  Promo received for review purposes</li>
            <li> This is a simple retractable brush. I really like it. It&#x27;s soft, dense, and picks up plenty of power product. It&#x27;s easy to close and throw in your purse.

Within 5 if that long, minutes the stupid brush was broken. All I did was take the cover off.  I don&#x27;t consider myself some heavy handed wrestler chic or nothing just an average girl trying to touch up face powder.  I was so tight I had to return this and get all my money back.</li>
            <li> A very nice brush. It&#x27;s about 2 times wider than most lipstick tubes.</li>
            <li> Really great brush! Perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture. The brush is VERY soft. This is perfect for blush and it&#x27;s the perfect size to put in a make-up bag or what not.</li>
            <li> This Kabuki is great for on the go. I travel a lot, so I always like having travel ready luggage and this is permanently in my bags.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for good quality travel brushes that won&#x27;t break the bank. This covers everything I have been looking for. It is cute, it is very durable and the brush is very soft. Most travel brushes are scratchy but this is far from it. It retracts easily and everything flows together smoothly. I keep this in my purse for touchups. This product was provided for review purposes but all opinions are based on my personal experience.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best brushes that I have gotten to review.The bristles are nice and soft and it is full, unlike some brushes that do not have sufficient amount of bristles in the tip. Not only is it cute and compact.. it is pink, which is one of my favorite colors! I would recommend this to all my beauty queens as a handy Kabuki brush you can keep right in your purse. A good buy at a good price!</li>
            <li> nice brush.  Def gets the job done with no problem.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good retractable brush for a while now and have finally found it! I love this brush! It is soft and full! It also is very compact. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting bent up or smashed in my makeup bag.  It is very easy to use. You simply pull the cap off and push the retractable part down and bam!! There is your brush. When you are done with it simply pull the sleeve back up over the brush, replace the cap and push it back down to its original, compact size. It&#x27;s that simple!  Being retractable adds a lot of security and mobility that you don&#x27;t have with a regular makeup brush.  Besides this brush is super cute! The pinkish, reddish color is beautiful! The handle, sleeve and cap are made out of a thin, lightweight metal which means it is better protected. I love this brush and recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Good for my purse. I use it pretty rarely, but so far its holding up and hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles, etc.</li>
            <li> I have never really been a fan of retractable brushes as I find they break easily or their retractable mechanism doesn&#x27;t work well but this brush has a nifty and very functional retractable system. It is the size of a lipstick container and fits perfectly in your purse or a travel kit. The actual brush is fine. It is not the softest or silkiest I&#x27;ve used but it doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy against your face. It is dense enough but one thing I will say is that I&#x27;ve had kabuki brushes with much better blending abilities. I think this brush is good for on the go but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as your primary face brush.</li>
