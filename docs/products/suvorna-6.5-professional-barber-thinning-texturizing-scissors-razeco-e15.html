            <li>These are so nice for the times when you just need to take out some of the thickness in your hair.</li>
            <li>It is nice that it has the V notches that hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>These are really nice.  </li>
            <li>but I was hoping they might come with some kind of instructions as to how to use them.</li>
            <li>this are nice thinning shears for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just stick to doing my own buzz cut which as a result on my thinning, is now a one.  </li>
            <li>Good feel to them, good weight, smooth operation, and they cut well without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li>The prodcut is also nice.</li>
            <li>Bought these because the stylist doesn&#x27;t always get it perfect, and I need to touch up the texturizing some times (time for a new stylist).  </li>
            <li>They cut quite well, and are very easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use!</li>
            <li>well I love the wat they cut and blend hair nicely :)</li>
            <li>I just cut my husband&#x27;s hair and sometimes my own (at times successfully, and at times requiring an emergency visit to my very understanding stylist for repairs</li>

            <li>many times i tighten it.</li>
            <li>Love the way they cut hair.</li>
            <li>Very excited.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for me as a novice groomer.</li>
            <li>I would like to choose this again because its quarity is pretty good</li>
            <li>They cut well without slipping and will be perfect for the projects I intend to use them for.</li>
            <li>so your hair lays more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>These are good quality and handle very well.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to handle and use.  </li>
            <li>It would have been helpful if it came with instructions but that information was easy to find on the internet.  </li>
            <li>We use this to cut our 1 year olds hair and this makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>but they are still going strong.</li>
            <li>It just works fine.</li>
            <li>They fit fine for me</li>
            <li>Received these thinning shears today and plan to use them as my primary thinning shears.  </li>
            <li>There was no way to fit them inside the holes.  </li>
            <li>I just kind of guess and try them out but don&#x27;t really know the correct way to use them.</li>
            <li>Indispensable.</li>
            <li>Feel Cheap</li>
            <li>I deducted one star because they could be sharper, but since they&#x27;re cheap and I can work around that by not pulling as I cut, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They work well and fit my hand and fingers.</li>
            <li>so far so good...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a learning curve, but they&#x27;re nice &amp; sharp and a good price.</li>
            <li>Used these last night when I cut my hubby&#x27;s hair .Worked out very well .I am a very happy customer .Very quick service.</li>
            <li>Works well, sharp, good price!</li>
            <li>These are great thinning shears that cut my long haired chihuahuas fur so effortlessly that he didn&#x27;t mind the trimming.  </li>
            <li>This pair of Thinning scissors are best asset for a small price.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair - just a nice precise cut every time, with more teeth than most cheaper scissors.  </li>
            <li>The cutting blade is a perfect size for good control.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a think head of hair and being able to thin things out between hair cuts is wonderful and these shears do just that.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, exactly what we were looking for at a great price!</li>
            <li>I use these on my dogs - very smooth and sharp, so much better than the very cheap ones sold for pets.  </li>
            <li>Love the product Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Just what I needed for my full head of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad item for the price, but if I got to pick it up and try it, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li>wife thinned my hair with these and all she could say was how great they felt in her hand, and how sharp they were.  </li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and are well made.</li>
            <li>Glad I chose them and would highly recommend this pair.</li>
            <li>I am tall and have medium to large hands and these worked fine.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how long they last but nice for now at a good price.</li>
            <li>Its great to touch up in between haircuts, saves me a few trips per year to the barber.</li>
            <li>for the scissors, it does not cut as smoothy as I would have expected, but still does a good job.</li>
            <li>These scissors are great, although I have used them only 1 time so far.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Comes with a useful leather cover.</li>
            <li>Is WORTH the money.</li>
            <li>...and they take off just the right amount of hair.</li>
            <li>I show dogs and needed one that was very sharp and did a smooth cut this one for sure fit the bill</li>
            <li>Easy to use between professional haircuts and great for creating a choppy, layered look.</li>
            <li>This is probably a great thinning tool but probably I didn&#x27;t need it since the Yorkie ends up with a puppy clip usually.</li>
            <li>It is very reasonably priced and are of &amp;#34; salon quality &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>really works well and worth to have one with this price.</li>
            <li>I lost my first pair because I forgot to take it out of my carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li>;).  </li>
            <li>These were very fancy shears!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First, my wife is not an expert or licensed cosmetologist.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>These are a great set of thinning shears and take on my grandson&#x27;s really thick hair without pulling.  </li>
            <li>; they&#x27;re appropriate for medium-sized women&#x27;s hands and smaller.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m much happier with my bouncier, easier-to-dry hair!</li>
            <li>IMO, the quality is very good, they are comfortable to use, and seem like if they are properly taken care of will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pull the hair and are nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still sharp and nice.</li>
            <li>These scissors are light, easy to handle, and very sharp.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality and very sharp.  </li>
            <li>Awesome but have to be a bit careful not to go overboard.</li>
            <li>I use these to maintain my hair at a certain length.</li>
            <li>For those who aren&#x27;t hairdressers and who have never used thinning shears before (like me)... the blades have large, wide-spaced teeth.</li>
            <li>There is also the companion ( regular ) scissors available.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have used thinning scissors before, and these Suvorna Ador work very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>and she said it works really well.  </li>
            <li>when I saw the pile of hair and realized how much weight was gone</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy and well made though.</li>
            <li>For the high price, I would have expected better performance.</li>
            <li>We all know there is that period of time between hair appointments, that your hair just will not cooperate and if you could just have that right tool to use to snip it but not mess it up...</li>
            <li>They feel balanced and fit my short but wide hand easily.</li>
            <li>Sharp, sturdy, and do a wonderful job at creating subtle texture and helping blend.</li>
            <li>I chose these because I couldn&#x27;t really afford the &amp;#34;higher quality&amp;#34; more expensive ones, so I kinda took a chance on these because they are more &amp;#34;middle of the road&amp;#34; in terms of price,  but she loves them, and uses them all the time.</li>
            <li>decent quality for the price point</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>High quality scissors.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Well made, high quality, works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, sharp, and high quality.</li>
            <li>Sharp, easy to use and high quality.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and easy handling.</li>
            <li>Purchaser should know that the same company has a full line of professional barber shears.</li>
            <li>However, they are not super comfortable for me because I have large thumbs.</li>
            <li>I wasted an hour, was successful getting the too big ring in one but gave up on the second.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp and works very well.</li>
            <li>and they are very sharp and cut my dog&#x27;s hair easily.</li>
            <li>work very well for thinning and adding so much style at the same time!</li>
            <li>But this doesn&#x27;t bother me because I think the fit would be a bit too tight with them.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to use on my Irish Setter and they are working very well.</li>
            <li>These are not already inserted and the likely reason is it would cost too much for employees&#x27; time to force them in.</li>
            <li>much easier to cut my teenage boy&#x27;s hair with style,</li>
            <li>They cut my cairn terrier&#x27;s hair to look naturally layered.  </li>
            <li>The Suvorna Ador 6.5&amp;#34; Professional Barber Thinning / Texturizing Scissors 2102  </li>
            <li>Bought these for my wife the professional pet groomer</li>
            <li>I am a professional shear sharpener and from my perspective they seem well made.</li>
            <li>It is so expensive to have a good haircut.</li>
            <li>The only down side that really didn&#x27;t bother me is that the plastic liners for the finger holes were too big to fit inside the holes.  </li>
            <li>They make a fairly clean cut it you squeeze firmly and don&#x27;t pull on the hair as you&#x27;re using them.</li>
            <li>This scissor works very well as what I was expected.</li>
            <li>Necessary item for thinning and for a professional groomer I suppose.</li>
            <li>I cut my husbands hair and use these to thin out the top.</li>
            <li>I am able to thin my hair out by myself without going to the hair dresser.  </li>
            <li>I did a little at a time, put them down and walked away, then decided later if I was satisfied or wanted to continue thinning.  </li>
            <li>These scissors are sharp and work very well.  </li>
            <li>They are very sharp and actually cut away a little more of the hair than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Thought at first we&#x27;d have his hair a little longer.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is professional grade but for casual occasional hair cut, it is very nice scissors</li>
            <li>This has extended my haircut for a few weeks longer in the hot summer.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and easy to use, although the finger holes are quire small.</li>
            <li>I would give it five starts, but unfortunately, it is true what other people say about the holes, they are too tight for my fingers.</li>
            <li>Decided to try to save money by cutting my husband&#x27;s hair myself, and these things work like magic!  </li>

            <li> These are so nice for the times when you just need to take out some of the thickness in your hair.</li>
            <li> It is nice that it has the V notches that hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li> Really nice.</li>
            <li> These are really nice.  </li>
            <li> but I was hoping they might come with some kind of instructions as to how to use them.</li>
            <li> this are nice thinning shears for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick to doing my own buzz cut which as a result on my thinning, is now a one.  </li>
            <li> Good feel to them, good weight, smooth operation, and they cut well without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> The prodcut is also nice.</li>
            <li> Bought these because the stylist doesn&#x27;t always get it perfect, and I need to touch up the texturizing some times (time for a new stylist).  </li>
            <li> They cut quite well, and are very easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use!</li>

            <li> I just cut my husband&#x27;s hair and sometimes my own (at times successfully, and at times requiring an emergency visit to my very understanding stylist for repairs</li>

            <li> Very excited.</li>

            <li> These are good quality and handle very well.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to handle and use.  </li>
            <li> It would have been helpful if it came with instructions but that information was easy to find on the internet.  </li>
            <li> We use this to cut our 1 year olds hair and this makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> but they are still going strong.</li>
            <li> It just works fine.</li>
            <li> They fit fine for me</li>
            <li> Received these thinning shears today and plan to use them as my primary thinning shears.  </li>
            <li> There was no way to fit them inside the holes.  </li>
            <li> I just kind of guess and try them out but don&#x27;t really know the correct way to use them.</li>
            <li> Indispensable.</li>
            <li> Feel Cheap</li>
            <li> I deducted one star because they could be sharper, but since they&#x27;re cheap and I can work around that by not pulling as I cut, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They work well and fit my hand and fingers.</li>
            <li> so far so good...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a learning curve, but they&#x27;re nice &amp; sharp and a good price.</li>
            <li> Used these last night when I cut my hubby&#x27;s hair .Worked out very well .I am a very happy customer .Very quick service.</li>
            <li> Works well, sharp, good price!</li>
            <li> These are great thinning shears that cut my long haired chihuahuas fur so effortlessly that he didn&#x27;t mind the trimming.  </li>
            <li> This pair of Thinning scissors are best asset for a small price.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair - just a nice precise cut every time, with more teeth than most cheaper scissors.  </li>
            <li> The cutting blade is a perfect size for good control.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a think head of hair and being able to thin things out between hair cuts is wonderful and these shears do just that.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, exactly what we were looking for at a great price!</li>
            <li> I use these on my dogs - very smooth and sharp, so much better than the very cheap ones sold for pets.  </li>
            <li> Love the product Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my full head of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad item for the price, but if I got to pick it up and try it, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> wife thinned my hair with these and all she could say was how great they felt in her hand, and how sharp they were.  </li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and are well made.</li>
            <li> Glad I chose them and would highly recommend this pair.</li>
            <li> I am tall and have medium to large hands and these worked fine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long they last but nice for now at a good price.</li>
            <li> Its great to touch up in between haircuts, saves me a few trips per year to the barber.</li>
            <li> for the scissors, it does not cut as smoothy as I would have expected, but still does a good job.</li>
            <li> These scissors are great, although I have used them only 1 time so far.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Comes with a useful leather cover.</li>
            <li> Is WORTH the money.</li>
            <li> ...and they take off just the right amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I show dogs and needed one that was very sharp and did a smooth cut this one for sure fit the bill</li>
            <li> Easy to use between professional haircuts and great for creating a choppy, layered look.</li>
            <li> This is probably a great thinning tool but probably I didn&#x27;t need it since the Yorkie ends up with a puppy clip usually.</li>
            <li> It is very reasonably priced and are of &amp;#34; salon quality &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> really works well and worth to have one with this price.</li>
            <li> I lost my first pair because I forgot to take it out of my carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li> ;).  </li>
            <li> These were very fancy shears!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First, my wife is not an expert or licensed cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> These are a great set of thinning shears and take on my grandson&#x27;s really thick hair without pulling.  </li>
            <li> ; they&#x27;re appropriate for medium-sized women&#x27;s hands and smaller.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m much happier with my bouncier, easier-to-dry hair!</li>
            <li> IMO, the quality is very good, they are comfortable to use, and seem like if they are properly taken care of will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull the hair and are nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still sharp and nice.</li>
            <li> These scissors are light, easy to handle, and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Awesome but have to be a bit careful not to go overboard.</li>
            <li> I use these to maintain my hair at a certain length.</li>
            <li> For those who aren&#x27;t hairdressers and who have never used thinning shears before (like me)... the blades have large, wide-spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> There is also the companion ( regular ) scissors available.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used thinning scissors before, and these Suvorna Ador work very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> and she said it works really well.  </li>
            <li> when I saw the pile of hair and realized how much weight was gone</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy and well made though.</li>
            <li> For the high price, I would have expected better performance.</li>
            <li> We all know there is that period of time between hair appointments, that your hair just will not cooperate and if you could just have that right tool to use to snip it but not mess it up...</li>
            <li> They feel balanced and fit my short but wide hand easily.</li>
            <li> Sharp, sturdy, and do a wonderful job at creating subtle texture and helping blend.</li>
            <li> I chose these because I couldn&#x27;t really afford the &amp;#34;higher quality&amp;#34; more expensive ones, so I kinda took a chance on these because they are more &amp;#34;middle of the road&amp;#34; in terms of price,  but she loves them, and uses them all the time.</li>
            <li> decent quality for the price point</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> High quality scissors.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Well made, high quality, works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, sharp, and high quality.</li>
            <li> Sharp, easy to use and high quality.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and easy handling.</li>
            <li> Purchaser should know that the same company has a full line of professional barber shears.</li>
            <li> However, they are not super comfortable for me because I have large thumbs.</li>
            <li> I wasted an hour, was successful getting the too big ring in one but gave up on the second.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp and works very well.</li>
            <li> and they are very sharp and cut my dog&#x27;s hair easily.</li>
            <li> work very well for thinning and adding so much style at the same time!</li>
            <li> But this doesn&#x27;t bother me because I think the fit would be a bit too tight with them.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to use on my Irish Setter and they are working very well.</li>
            <li> These are not already inserted and the likely reason is it would cost too much for employees&#x27; time to force them in.</li>
            <li> much easier to cut my teenage boy&#x27;s hair with style,</li>
            <li> They cut my cairn terrier&#x27;s hair to look naturally layered.  </li>
            <li> The Suvorna Ador 6.5&amp;#34; Professional Barber Thinning / Texturizing Scissors 2102  </li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife the professional pet groomer</li>
            <li> I am a professional shear sharpener and from my perspective they seem well made.</li>
            <li> It is so expensive to have a good haircut.</li>
            <li> The only down side that really didn&#x27;t bother me is that the plastic liners for the finger holes were too big to fit inside the holes.  </li>
            <li> They make a fairly clean cut it you squeeze firmly and don&#x27;t pull on the hair as you&#x27;re using them.</li>
            <li> This scissor works very well as what I was expected.</li>
            <li> Necessary item for thinning and for a professional groomer I suppose.</li>
            <li> I cut my husbands hair and use these to thin out the top.</li>
            <li> I am able to thin my hair out by myself without going to the hair dresser.  </li>
            <li> I did a little at a time, put them down and walked away, then decided later if I was satisfied or wanted to continue thinning.  </li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and work very well.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and actually cut away a little more of the hair than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Thought at first we&#x27;d have his hair a little longer.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is professional grade but for casual occasional hair cut, it is very nice scissors</li>
            <li> This has extended my haircut for a few weeks longer in the hot summer.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to use, although the finger holes are quire small.</li>
            <li> I would give it five starts, but unfortunately, it is true what other people say about the holes, they are too tight for my fingers.</li>
            <li> Decided to try to save money by cutting my husband&#x27;s hair myself, and these things work like magic!  </li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and give me the result that I was looking for: my hair ends are sheared as if done by a professional hairdresser.</li>
            <li> They barely cut, and do much more pulling than cutting.  </li>
            <li> It has very solid feel and cutting movement of scissors is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> It will enable you to thin hair or make those layers, lay a little better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use it that much since I found out they dull easily and are expensive to get them sharpened.</li>
            <li> You put a small section of hair between the blades at a time, cut like you would with normal scissors, and proceed slowly to other sections of your hair.</li>
            <li> The screw keeps coming loose no matter now</li>
            <li> Makes a clean cut without any painful hair pulling, like my old one.  </li>
            <li> Compared to Sally&#x27;s that are three to four times more expensive, this piece is really competitive with any other expensive product.</li>
            <li> They are a bit on the small side, but for those with small hands/small fingers, and for home use, they&#x27;re decent!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, and these thinning scissors are a must for my new-found hobby of cutting my own  hair.</li>
            <li> The straight edge of the scissors was just plain too dull to cut.</li>
            <li> They are sharp amd work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever had other hair dressers use at their salons.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and does not tug hair.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;e gave me a haircut with these, and they did not pull my hair significantly, as other reviewers indicated.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, the finger holes may be too small with the rubber guards if you are a man, but you can simply just remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scissors work well enough but the holes are way too small to get your fingers in if you have medium fingers</li>
            <li> All stainless steel construction which will never rust and is hard to dull.</li>
            <li> However,  they did not seem very sharp, and rough on the hair.</li>
            <li> but I can see how an adult male may be uncomfortable trying to use them.  </li>
            <li> I tried several times to cut increasingly smaller sections of hair and they just wouldn&#x27;t cut unless I basically serrated the hair -- making for a jagged, sloppy cut.</li>
            <li> It might be little small for those of who has big fingers.</li>
            <li> difficult to adap the screw/tighten-loosen, cuts OK(ish)&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend very highly</li>
            <li> I had read this complaint prior to the purchase but figured it was just a fluke.  </li>
            <li> I am not a professional nor do I know much about cutting hair</li>
            <li> The only negative thing was the black rubbers to put into the finger holes.  </li>
            <li> The finger holes are quite small and the little plastic inserts were too big and do not fit</li>
            <li> very very thin a lil to much...</li>
            <li> Very sharp &#x3D; no pulling.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and get the job done well.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp</li>
            <li> It is very sharp, so it would not pull on the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a long thick brown hair and I bought this item to trim my hair at home.</li>
            <li> The little black plastic inserts that go in the finger holes don&#x27;t tend to stay in.</li>
            <li> Not just by a little.  </li>
            <li> The only con for this product, I would say that rubber inside the handles are loose and fall out, which makes it little uncomfortable for fingers.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a thinning scissors as my hair is so heavy all the time.</li>
            <li> and then just thin the hair next time</li>
            <li> However, I am not having any trouble using them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> this is my first bad review in my life, and very sadly it will be my first product I have to return.</li>
            <li> Scissors works well at making it possible to thin out excessive hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product to thin my extra thick hair between haircuts.  </li>
            <li> finger holes are too small for a man&#x27;s fingers.  </li>
            <li> Do note, however, that the finger holes are really small</li>
            <li> I agree that the finger holes are on the small side.  </li>
            <li> These shears don&#x27;t make your hair look shorter; they thin the section you are working on by removing about half of the hair you put between the blades, and leaving the rest intact.  </li>
            <li> That said, I have not own any thinning scissors before.</li>
            <li> They did not catch on my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> compare to other products, it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried a cheaper pair at first and they were horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought this scissor to thin my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and was afraid of buying thinning shears online since I didn&#x27;t know if they&#x27;d work on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is my secret weapon now!</li>
            <li> They have a very difficult time cutting thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> It was used, it has a lot HAIR AND UNKNOWN LIQUID on it, very disgusting , I am going to return it ASAP.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad pair, but these scissors do not cut!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my favorite thinning scissor. Durable</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for me as a novice groomer. I use it for my puppy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a thinning scissors as my hair is so heavy all the time. This scissor works very well as what I was expected.</li>
            <li> I have a long thick brown hair and I bought this item to trim my hair at home. And it&#x27;s been a great choice! These scissors are sharp and give me the result that I was looking for: my hair ends are sheared as if done by a professional hairdresser. Tons of money saved! Now I go to the hair salon only to have my hair colored or get highlights. The only con for this product, I would say that rubber inside the handles are loose and fall out, which makes it little uncomfortable for fingers. Otherwise, these shears do their job great! I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I trim my hair by myself with this scissors.&lt;br /&gt;It really works well and worth to have one with this price.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my salon. They are sharp amd work wery well I love the wat they cut and blend hair nicely :) I would order another pair from seller.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, salon quality</li>
            <li> These are as good as any pro shears I&#x27;ve used. At this price, you cannot beat it. Used for texturing or thinning scissors over comb technique because of length.</li>
            <li> It is so expensive to have a good haircut. The way I found to keep always a good haircut was to have a good hair cut once in a while and then just thin the hair next time I need a hair cut. I have never tried to thing my hair by myself till I bought this. Well, this is absolutely great! I would give it five starts, but unfortunately, it is true what other people say about the holes, they are too tight for my fingers. I got a blister. But well, I still find it great.</li>
            <li> I use these on my dogs - very smooth and sharp, so much better than the very cheap ones sold for pets.  If they work this well on the Aussies, I am certain they will be great for people hair too!</li>
            <li> finger holes are too small for a man&#x27;s fingers.  good product.</li>
            <li> I show dogs and needed one that was very sharp and did a smooth cut this one for sure fit the bill</li>
            <li> Received these thinning shears today and plan to use them as my primary thinning shears.  IMO, the quality is very good, they are comfortable to use, and seem like if they are properly taken care of will last a very long time.  I am very pleased with the Suvorna Ador Thinning Shears.  They arrived before the estimated delivery time and were packaged in a heavy-duty bubble shipping envelope.</li>
            <li> Better than any thinning shears I&#x27;ve ever had other hair dressers use at their salons.  Very sharp &#x3D; no pulling.</li>
            <li> We all know there is that period of time between hair appointments, that your hair just will not cooperate and if you could just have that right tool to use to snip it but not mess it up...HERE IT IS...It will enable you to thin hair or make those layers, lay a little better.

            <li> Very sharp, exactly what we were looking for at a great price!</li>
            <li> I got these for my girlfriend, she&#x27;s a hair stylist, and she loves them. I chose these because I couldn&#x27;t really afford the &amp;#34;higher quality&amp;#34; more expensive ones, so I kinda took a chance on these because they are more &amp;#34;middle of the road&amp;#34; in terms of price,  but she loves them, and uses them all the time.</li>
            <li> Love the product Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I cut my husbands hair and use these to thin out the top. Works well, sharp, good price!</li>
            <li> Bought these because the stylist doesn&#x27;t always get it perfect, and I need to touch up the texturizing some times (time for a new stylist).  Very sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair - just a nice precise cut every time, with more teeth than most cheaper scissors.  The only down side that really didn&#x27;t bother me is that the plastic liners for the finger holes were too big to fit inside the holes.  Not just by a little.  There was no way to fit them inside the holes.  But this doesn&#x27;t bother me because I think the fit would be a bit too tight with them.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have used them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a very good quality pair of scissors and come with a nice case to store them in.  Glad I chose them and would highly recommend this pair.</li>
            <li> I love these thinning shears.  I am able to thin my hair out by myself without going to the hair dresser.  They are easy to use, sharp, and high quality.</li>
            <li> These are so nice for the times when you just need to take out some of the thickness in your hair. I use them all the time. Love them. Would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are great thinning shears that cut my long haired chihuahuas fur so effortlessly that he didn&#x27;t mind the trimming.  Very sharp!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to handle and use.  It would have been helpful if it came with instructions but that information was easy to find on the internet.  A great item for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Awesome but have to be a bit careful not to go overboard. It is nice that it has the V notches that hold the hair in place. Its great to touch up in between haircuts, saves me a few trips per year to the barber.</li>
            <li> I have used these shears for about 2 years cutting my own hair every month or so. They are very sharp and get the job done well. However, they are not super comfortable for me because I have large thumbs. The little black plastic inserts that go in the finger holes don&#x27;t tend to stay in. Still, they are very good for the price. I lost my first pair because I forgot to take it out of my carry-on luggage. I couldn&#x27;t do without them, so I bought another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hair stylist.  I just cut my husband&#x27;s hair and sometimes my own (at times successfully, and at times requiring an emergency visit to my very understanding stylist for repairs ;).  For our purposes these are great.  Sharp, sturdy, and do a wonderful job at creating subtle texture and helping blend.</li>
            <li> Really nice. I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves them.  They are very sharp</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad pair, but these scissors do not cut! I tried several times to cut increasingly smaller sections of hair and they just wouldn&#x27;t cut unless I basically serrated the hair -- making for a jagged, sloppy cut. The straight edge of the scissors was just plain too dull to cut. For the high price, I would have expected better performance.</li>
            <li> Makes a clean cut without any painful hair pulling, like my old one.  Purchaser should know that the same company has a full line of professional barber shears.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use on my Irish Setter and they are working very well. A very nice pair of thinning shears for the price. The finger holes are quite small and the little plastic inserts were too big and do not fit but I am not using them anyway, I would actually give them 5 stars if the finger holes were a bit larger. However, I am not having any trouble using them and they are very sharp and cut my dog&#x27;s hair easily.</li>
            <li> These are really nice.  They don&#x27;t pull the hair and are nice and sharp.  The cutting blade is a perfect size for good control.  The grip fits my hand (woman&#x27;s medium sized hand).  The only negative thing was the black rubbers to put into the finger holes.  These are not already inserted and the likely reason is it would cost too much for employees&#x27; time to force them in. I wasted an hour, was successful getting the too big ring in one but gave up on the second.  I had read this complaint prior to the purchase but figured it was just a fluke.  The rings are not really necessary for comfort unless the cut hair for a living.  I would still buy them and just toss the rings.</li>
            <li> Package arrived in time and in good order. Item is as advertised. Sharp and does not tug hair.</li>
            <li> These blending sheers are junk.  They have a very difficult time cutting thick hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> These are surprising great shears. They cut without pulling the hair. I would recommend them to anyone who is a do it yourself barber or stylist. Good price point as well</li>
            <li> Great pair of thinning shears.  I&#x27;ve got a think head of hair and being able to thin things out between hair cuts is wonderful and these shears do just that.  Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I use this for my Cavapoo puppy. He hates the trimmer-- it scares him. It takes a while to cut his fur with shears, but he tolerates it. I tried a cheaper pair at first and they were horrible. These actually cut.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and very sharp.  Glad I purchased.  Now I just have to sharpen MY skills in using them.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I have extremely thick hair and was afraid of buying thinning shears online since I didn&#x27;t know if they&#x27;d work on my hair.  These are perfect.  Great quality and they come with a pouch to keep them safe.</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and work very well.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very good scissors for the price.</li>
            <li> These are good but I was hoping they might come with some kind of instructions as to how to use them. I just kind of guess and try them out but don&#x27;t really know the correct way to use them. They are very sharp and actually cut away a little more of the hair than I was expecting. Nice and heavy and well made though. If you know what to do with them, probably very good!</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;e gave me a haircut with these, and they did not pull my hair significantly, as other reviewers indicated.  They are a bit on the small side, but for those with small hands/small fingers, and for home use, they&#x27;re decent!</li>
            <li> my wire reports it&#x27;s a great pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the finger holes may be too small with the rubber guards if you are a man, but you can simply just remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scissors, it does not cut as smoothy as I would have expected, but still does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is how I fix at home what the stylist did in the shop. Indispensable. High quality scissors.</li>
            <li> compare to other products, it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used thinning scissors before, and these Suvorna Ador work very well.  They cut quite well, and are very easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to thin my extra thick hair between haircuts.  This has extended my haircut for a few weeks longer in the hot summer.  My stylist couldn&#x27;t figure out how it stayed so contained.  It is my secret weapon now!</li>
            <li> The reviews were good, and seems good product. However,  they did not seem very sharp, and rough on the hair.</li>
            <li> These suck.  I&#x27;m a hairstylist, and I can&#x27;t even use them.  They barely cut, and do much more pulling than cutting.  Save your money,</li>
            <li> Great quality. Makes trimming our Maltese a breeze.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and are well made. They feel balanced and fit my short but wide hand easily. They cut well without slipping and will be perfect for the projects I intend to use them for.</li>
            <li> decent quality for the price point</li>
            <li> much easier to cut my teenage boy&#x27;s hair with style,</li>
            <li> These were very fancy shears! I was impressed at the quality. I am not a professional nor do I know much about cutting hair so this is based on personal usage.</li>
            <li> I really like these it works just like the hairdresser.  Very excited.</li>
            <li> Use it for over 1.5 years. It&#x27;s still sharp and nice.</li>
            <li> Feel Cheap But they do the trick .... very very thin a lil to much... so far so good... i hope they don&#x27;t lose their sharpness.!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, and these thinning scissors are a must for my new-found hobby of cutting my own  hair.</li>
            <li> This is probably a great thinning tool but probably I didn&#x27;t need it since the Yorkie ends up with a puppy clip usually. Thought at first we&#x27;d have his hair a little longer. I don&#x27;t like to use it that much since I found out they dull easily and are expensive to get them sharpened. Necessary item for thinning and for a professional groomer I suppose. And the quality is  probably good.</li>
            <li> These scissors are light, easy to handle, and very sharp.  They cut my cairn terrier&#x27;s hair to look naturally layered.  (I just use it on tummy, feet, and tail-tip.  The rest of the coat is hand-pulled.)</li>
            <li> When I use it, it feels clunky and it doesn&#x27;t glide when I go to snip the hair. It&#x27;s not a bad item for the price, but if I got to pick it up and try it, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> These are really great scissors!  The Suvorna Ador 6.5&amp;#34; Professional Barber Thinning / Texturizing Scissors 2102  work very well for thinning and adding so much style at the same time!</li>
            <li> this are nice thinning shears for the money. I use them at home for touch ups for the family and friends.</li>
            <li> Feels like a quality product, especially for the price. I use it to trim my poodles&#x27; ears and tail which is does a good job of.</li>
            <li> excellent ..do a great job of thinning hair</li>
            <li> I bought this scissor to thin my hair.  My wife cuts my hair every 3-4 months and I like to get my hair thinned. That said, I have not own any thinning scissors before. This pair of scissors is well-made.  It has very solid feel and cutting movement of scissors is very smooth.  My wife used it only twice on me and she said it works really well.  Not sure if this is professional grade but for casual occasional hair cut, it is very nice scissors and I highly recommended.  It might be little small for those of who has big fingers.</li>
            <li> These scissors are great, although I have used them only 1 time so far.  All stainless steel construction which will never rust and is hard to dull.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the home hair trimming rituals for our 3 kids.  It is very sharp, so it would not pull on the hair.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Scissors works well at making it possible to thin out excessive hair so your hair lays more smoothly.  Sharp and easy to use, although the finger holes are quire small.</li>
            <li> Used these last night when I cut my hubby&#x27;s hair .Worked out very well .I am a very happy customer .Very quick service.Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my full head of hair. These are perfect.</li>
            <li> Worked great but because I had no training, I ended up looking like I had mange.  I&#x27;ll just stick to doing my own buzz cut which as a result on my thinning, is now a one.  Opps!</li>
            <li> First, my wife is not an expert or licensed cosmetologist. She ordered these to use for the family haircuts. For our purpose, they work great. Good feel to them, good weight, smooth operation, and they cut well without pulling your hair. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Got them to use on my horse&#x27;s mane because I won&#x27;t pull it. There&#x27;s a learning curve, but they&#x27;re nice &amp; sharp and a good price.</li>
            <li> Well made, high quality, works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again without any qualms.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a storage pouch.&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks better than when a stylist does it! Great for touch ups between cuts!</li>
            <li> Glides through hair without any pull.  Easy to use between professional haircuts and great for creating a choppy, layered look.</li>
            <li> I use these to maintain my hair at a certain length. They were exactly what I was expecting. Comes with a useful leather cover.</li>
            <li> These scissors do a great job, they dont pull fur and I use them on my cocker spaniel, the cuts come out great. Is WORTH the money.</li>
            <li> This pair of Thinning scissors are best asset for a small price. Compared to Sally&#x27;s that are three to four times more expensive, this piece is really competitive with any other expensive product.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair and they work good on me.</li>
            <li> wife thinned my hair with these and all she could say was how great they felt in her hand, and how sharp they were.  when I saw the pile of hair and realized how much weight was gone I was happy to!</li>
            <li> difficult to adap the screw/tighten-loosen, cuts OK(ish)&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend very highly&lt;br /&gt;OK for the price, but not &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; as advertised</li>
            <li> It was used, it has a lot HAIR AND UNKNOWN LIQUID on it, very disgusting , I am going to return it ASAP. this is my first bad review in my life, and very sadly it will be my first product I have to return.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and works very well. I can do &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; thinning at home!</li>
            <li> The scissors work well enough but the holes are way too small to get your fingers in if you have medium fingers</li>
            <li> Would not recommend these sheers. The screw keeps coming loose no matter now many times i tighten it. Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> These are a great set of thinning shears and take on my grandson&#x27;s really thick hair without pulling.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can beat these.</li>
            <li> It just works fine. Sharp and easy handling.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife the professional pet groomer and she immediately tried them out on our Newfoundland, she loves them. I am a professional shear sharpener and from my perspective they seem well made. Time will tell how they hold up but they are still going strong.</li>
            <li> These are good quality and handle very well. The plastic inner ring came already fitted into the finger holes. I am tall and have medium to large hands and these worked fine. They did not catch on my thick, curly hair. It helps to have seen a stylist use these, so I knew how to do it and how it should feel.</li>
            <li> Great dog scissors! Do note, however, that the finger holes are really small; they&#x27;re appropriate for medium-sized women&#x27;s hands and smaller. I use them to cut my Chow/Newfoundland Mix&#x27;s dense fur.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, and works great.</li>
            <li> We use this to cut our 1 year olds hair and this makes it so easy. Work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use these properly. They seem to work well and are quality built. No problems recommending them.</li>
            <li> These scissors are awesome. Love the way they cut hair. So easy to use! I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> ...and they take off just the right amount of hair. They make a fairly clean cut it you squeeze firmly and don&#x27;t pull on the hair as you&#x27;re using them. I deducted one star because they could be sharper, but since they&#x27;re cheap and I can work around that by not pulling as I cut, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;I use these to de-bulk the ends of my hair. For those who aren&#x27;t hairdressers and who have never used thinning shears before (like me)... the blades have large, wide-spaced teeth. You put a small section of hair between the blades at a time, cut like you would with normal scissors, and proceed slowly to other sections of your hair. These shears don&#x27;t make your hair look shorter; they thin the section you are working on by removing about half of the hair you put between the blades, and leaving the rest intact.  I did a little at a time, put them down and walked away, then decided later if I was satisfied or wanted to continue thinning.  They work great and I&#x27;m much happier with my bouncier, easier-to-dry hair!</li>
            <li> I use these scissors for grooming our Pomerainian dogs. They work well and fit my hand and fingers. Don&#x27;t know how long they last but nice for now at a good price.</li>
            <li> Decided to try to save money by cutting my husband&#x27;s hair myself, and these things work like magic!  Sharp, easy to use and high quality.  I have fat fingers, so I didn&#x27;t even try to put the finger inserts into the holes... not necessary.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very pleased.. Who needs barber or it can be used to improve upon the work of the pros</li>
            <li> They work perfect and the price was right.  No, I am not a hairdresser, so the sharpness of these was very important! I would recommend them to all.</li>
            <li> I agree that the finger holes are on the small side.  They fit fine for me but I can see how an adult male may be uncomfortable trying to use them.  However they do a great job - we use them on our Bernese Mountain Dog.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really good. The prodcut is also nice. I used same product, but I lost it. I would like to choose this again because its quarity is pretty good</li>
