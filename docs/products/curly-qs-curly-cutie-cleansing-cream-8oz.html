    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>We tried using a conditioner after this product, but any benefit was marginal at best.</li>
            <li>Very good products.</li>
            <li>I liked the consitency of the product and it smells delicious</li>
            <li>It smells great.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair for about two years, and I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>And, her hair smells amazing!</li>
            <li>As a perk, it has an amazing smell that reminds me of buttercream frosting!</li>
            <li>On top of that the curls stayed shiny and beautiful for days!</li>
            <li>Her hair stays shinny, smelling really good and not greasy for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>Perfect product for children who are inter-racial because their hair are now more easy to maintain and style while holding in the moisture.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I use it sometimes on my own hair, but my hair is longer and it&#x27;s still a bit too stripping for me, but it&#x27;s pretty good for my hair too.</li>
            <li>Though it is creamy it does act more as a shampoo than a no-poo or co-wash.</li>
            <li>I may use this when I feel like I need something more cleansing than a no-poo.</li>
            <li>I thought it would offer more moisture after washing, but it could be my childs hair as well :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li>A friend of mine suggested my search take me away from leave-in conditioners and focus more on a shampoo that would work wonders.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product for my boys.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they are not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>I love this line, and i love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry out my son&#x27;s curls.</li>
            <li>Excellent for my little one curly and very fine hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells great like natural coconut milk.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but not overpowering, and it leaves my daughters curls conditioned and soft.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, if you  have a little curly head , this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Nicely concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot and gives a nice almost \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean but conditions at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo along with the conditioner and her curls are not soft and cute!  :-)  </li>
            <li>light weight for fine curls, great smell for a little girl</li>
            <li>After someone swore up and down that this product was the best out there, I decided to shell out the money for the very pricey bottle of cleansing cream.</li>
            <li>I want something mild, that doesn&#x27;t strip their hair, but that isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals like a lot of the curl shampoos.  </li>
            <li>We went through a lot of other products and this one is the best we&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>Love the scent &amp; does beautifully with my blonde curly headed 2.5 year old &amp; 4.5 year old girls hair.</li>
            <li>I figured it would be both its weight in gold if it actually performed as amazingly as some people had said.</li>
            <li>He has an incredible mass of thick, curly and unruly hair.</li>
            <li>Just wish larger bottles at better prices were available via Prime.</li>
            <li>I have read on other sites that you have to use this company&#x27;s entire product line (shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, and leave-in styling product) to get the best results.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has long, curly hair, and we have been searching for a product that leaves her curls both manageable and looking nice.</li>
            <li>I used this for my daughter&#x27;s fine curly blonde hair because I read about it on a blog.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that goes flat with too much conditioner and goes frizzy or fly-away easily - this provides some body without frizz and doesn&#x27;t flatten.  </li>
            <li>I think the product is overpriced per item, i bought the whole line to try it out.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent cleanser.</li>
            <li>Seeing as it did nothing for my older daughter, I eventually started using this on my toddler as it doesn&#x27;t foam up and hurt her eyes.</li>
            <li>A lot of the natural shampoos just don&#x27;t work well on curls.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a curly hair cleanser with low detergent, natural ingredients, and no wheat (gluten) - and so tried this.  </li>
            <li>This left me with major tangles.</li>
            <li>It weighed down her hair too much, and after awhile it made her hair smell like rotten milk.</li>

            <li> Both my daughters and I have curly hair, and it&#x27;s been hard to find shampoo for them.  </li>
            <li> However it dried my kids hair out horribly.</li>
            <li> I hate leaving a bad review, but for her hair type it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is not billed as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the nasty stuff like phthalates.  </li>

            <li> My daughter has curly hair and the body wash that doubles as shampoo/conditioner for infants was no longer working on her long locks.  I purchased this shampoo along with the conditioner and her curls are not soft and cute!  :-)  And, her hair smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the curly q products for my daughter and son for a while so I purchased this, the cocnut dream conditioner and the curly milkshake. The shampoo smells great like natural coconut milk. However it dried my kids hair out horribly. I even used it on myself and had the same result. I liked the consitency of the product and it smells delicious but I wont be making it a staple product in their hair regimens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a curly hair cleanser with low detergent, natural ingredients, and no wheat (gluten) - and so tried this.  Nicely concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot and gives a nice almost \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean but conditions at the same time.

As a perk, it has an amazing smell that reminds me of buttercream frosting!</li>
            <li> My son is of African American and Irish descent. He has an incredible mass of thick, curly and unruly hair. Nothing short of half a bottle of conditioner will allow me to control it. And I&#x27;d still have to dedicate an hour to it. That is until I found this product. Curly Q was a God send! The first time I washed and conditioned his hair, it fell past his shoulders on it&#x27;s own. Before combing. Before brushing. That in it&#x27;s self was a miracle. On top of that the curls stayed shiny and beautiful for days! If your child has stubborn curls, you have arrived at the answer to your problems!</li>
            <li> Love the scent &amp; does beautifully with my blonde curly headed 2.5 year old &amp; 4.5 year old girls hair.</li>
            <li> This is a decent cleanser. It smells great.  Though it is creamy it does act more as a shampoo than a no-poo or co-wash. I may use this when I feel like I need something more cleansing than a no-poo. I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times since I purchased it 2 months ago because I found it to be oily while on my hair and extremely drying after I rinsed it out. This left me with major tangles. I will not be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry out my son&#x27;s curls.</li>
            <li> I thought it would offer more moisture after washing, but it could be my childs hair as well :)&lt;br /&gt;she is 8 months</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair for about two years, and I am happy with the results.  Regarding the other poster who said the products left her hair dry, they also have a moisturizer/detangler (Curly Q&#x27;s Moist Curls Moisturizer).  I have read on other sites that you have to use this company&#x27;s entire product line (shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, and leave-in styling product) to get the best results.  We use Curls Clarifying Shampoo in the summer because it gets chlorine out (and we swim a lot).</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, curly hair, and we have been searching for a product that leaves her curls both manageable and looking nice. A friend of mine suggested my search take me away from leave-in conditioners and focus more on a shampoo that would work wonders. After someone swore up and down that this product was the best out there, I decided to shell out the money for the very pricey bottle of cleansing cream. I figured it would be both its weight in gold if it actually performed as amazingly as some people had said. To make a long story short, I was absolutely disappointed. I saw no difference whatsoever in my daughter&#x27;s hair when she used this product versus a $2 bottle of Suave shampoo from the grocery store. In fact, this product made her hair feel like straw. We tried using a conditioner after this product, but any benefit was marginal at best. Seeing as it did nothing for my older daughter, I eventually started using this on my toddler as it doesn&#x27;t foam up and hurt her eyes. I figured we might as well finish off the bottle.</li>
            <li> I used this for my daughter&#x27;s fine curly blonde hair because I read about it on a blog. It weighed down her hair too much, and after awhile it made her hair smell like rotten milk. I hate leaving a bad review, but for her hair type it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters and I have curly hair, and it&#x27;s been hard to find shampoo for them.  I want something mild, that doesn&#x27;t strip their hair, but that isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals like a lot of the curl shampoos.  A lot of the natural shampoos just don&#x27;t work well on curls.  This is not billed as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the nasty stuff like phthalates.  The scent is pleasant but not overpowering, and it leaves my daughters curls conditioned and soft.  I use it sometimes on my own hair, but my hair is longer and it&#x27;s still a bit too stripping for me, but it&#x27;s pretty good for my hair too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product for my boys. I&#x27;m glad they are not greasy or oily. Perfect product for children who are inter-racial because their hair are now more easy to maintain and style while holding in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this line, and i love the smell of this product. I think the product is overpriced per item, i bought the whole line to try it out.  I will buy the this product again, detangler, and moisturizer again, but i will but the value sizes.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my little one curly and very fine hair. Her hair stays shinny, smelling really good and not greasy for 2-3 days. We have the conditioner too. Very good products. I didn&#x27;t like the curls moisturizer( or refresher ?). It&#x27;s too heavy. Otherwise, if you  have a little curly head , this is an excellent product. We went through a lot of other products and this one is the best we&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> light weight for fine curls, great smell for a little girl</li>
            <li> Works well on my twin girls&#x27; hair!</li>
            <li> Does wonders for our little girl&#x27;s curly hair.  Just wish larger bottles at better prices were available via Prime.</li>
    </ol>
