            <li>She said this product was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>

            <li>I really liked the thickness.  </li>
            <li>It was not as spectacular as I have seen some reviews say.</li>
            <li>The best and delivered so fast</li>
            <li>I honestly had no idea what to do about it until a stylist I went to recommended this (in addition to a moisturizing shampoo from another brand).</li>
            <li>you great service and fast delivery !!</li>
            <li>and I feel it&#x27;s a lot more effective for my hair this way than the &amp;#34;5 minutes every week&amp;#34; it recommends.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and had wonderful definition.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth, light and shines beautifully.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair once a week with the joico recovery moisture shampoo and the balm, after the first use of the balm I notices a great difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>BUT, I have started using it as my primary conditioner, just on the ends, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Supposedly it works better if using the combo (shampoo/cond)</li>
            <li>the hair won&#x27;t look healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner</li>

            <li>and I Love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is much better now.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Lovely smell and it leaves my hair feeling a lot softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product and that&#x27;s saying a lot because I&#x27;m a product junkie</li>
            <li>After using this product my hair has improved a lot, it feels and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE this product!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it does hold moisture in my hair and keeps my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see RiteAid now stocks this product also.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>even when I go to my stylist for a touch-up, she comments on how soft my hair feels and what great condition it&#x27;s in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells great and leaves your hair soft if you brush it out and doesn&#x27;t flake.  </li>
            <li>doing their hair is real fun for all of us....</li>
            <li>My hair is easily detangled and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It washes out EASILY.  </li>
            <li>The jar has a pump which I thought was great; however, after the product gets to a certain level in the jar, the pump no longer works and requires a lot work to get the product in the right spot in the jar to use the pump.  </li>

            <li>This is a crisp clean aquatic fragrance LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This is the best product ever for my thick hair that tangles easy!</li>
            <li>but I only use this one and it works great.</li>
            <li>Yes I appreciate a tangle free Fro.</li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth, never tangles, and is shiny all day.</li>
            <li>When I am done rinsing my hair it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>But given the cost, it is more economical to just buy body lotion.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I buy for much more elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Really rich and thick, makes my curly hair shine and feel wonderfully touchable.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone who uses swagbucks to get Amazon gift cards, this product is worth a try because it will practically be free.</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth a try if you want want those buttery, smooth locks.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for 10 minutes with a shower cap, then rinse, and apply coconut oil and it leaves my hair detangled and soft with shine and a nice curl.</li>
            <li>My ends are still a bit dry after only two treatments, but the difference is incredible and becomes more moisturized each time.</li>
            <li>After showering, I rub it into my skin and then rinse quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bleached my hair from brown, and all women know that horrid straw feeling of your beautiful new blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product will work better on newly relaxed hair</li>
            <li>Maybe this product will work better on newly relaxed hair</li>
            <li>This product also has a strong smell that I didn&#x27;t too much care for.</li>
            <li>I love this product had my natural curls defined and bouncing!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews for the balm and because of the success I&#x27;ve had with the Moisture Recovery conditioner in this line, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>When I felt my hair after sitting under the hooded dryer, my hair felt silky and as if my hair absorbed the conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely worth it.an to buy this product again.  </li>
            <li>Completely worth it.</li>
            <li>I use a soft t-shirt to dry my hair and after rinsing the balm and using the t-shirt, the softness of my hair greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li>I know it says it is for coarse hair, but my hair is very fine, and it works well for me.</li>
            <li>It is amazing for dry hair that is not color treated.</li>
            <li>it not only smells good, but makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have curly thick hair (type 3) and this makes my hair so soft and my curls look wonderful.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with thick hair to use this product and it smells great.</li>
            <li>The first use, all of the straw feeling went away.</li>
            <li>get this larger size, the 16.9 jar with the pump - it is a better deal than the tube.</li>
            <li>I almost thought  I was loosing hair when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a bit more hydrating, but I use it as a regular conditioner</li>
            <li>It left my hair incredibly greasy and wet looking, no matter how much I rinsed and washed it out.</li>
            <li>My ends were dry and brittle and would break very easy</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft!!!!</li>
            <li>I am currently using Joico&#x27;s Moisture Recovery conditioner for dry hair and loving it!.</li>
            <li>In addition, she recommended using a detangler with no alcohol in it, and then after, to use pure coconut oil on hair to keep moisture in.  </li>
            <li>With this balm, I had to definitely use a more moisturizer during the week and because I am 3 months post relaxer, my new growth requires lots of moisture and</li>
            <li>Just be careful when you use and make sure that you dont use to much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the quest for a product that is really moisturizing</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li>I find it works very well as a moisturizer though.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with the winter dryness.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair very soft, easy to detangle and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes a very noticeable, visible difference in my fine and dry hair.</li>
            <li>seriously its good stuff i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>She advised to use it more often and to, if possible, put it on my hair and let it sit for 30 minutes, preferably covered, and to apply heat to keep the shaft open and let the moisture penetrate deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love using this product for my little sister, myself and mom&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I actually bought it at TJMaxx for $14.99 and didn&#x27;t like it at first because I was putting too much in my hair, and all throughout my hair rather than just the ends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heavy cream conditioner that dries more like a gel.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry frizzy and thick hair and moisture recovery balm works great.  </li>
            <li>but, when I use the balm it made my hair very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>She advised to use less of the protein restorers and more of the moisture products as protein products tend to dry out hair if used too much.</li>
            <li>and my hair is never dry thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>My natural curls look better than usual.</li>
            <li>Of course all is not lost; I will definitely continue to use the Joico Moisture Recovery Conditioner for dry hair.had to definitely use a more moisturizer during the week and because I am 3 months post relaxer, my new growth requires lots of moisture and</li>
            <li>Great for my thick coarse curly long hair.  </li>
            <li>My hairstylist recommended it to me because I am transitioning from permed hair to natural texture</li>
            <li>Kept me from putting in a relaxer I have alot of hair brastrap length all natural.</li>
            <li>It completely changes the texture from tangle-y and stick-straight straw-like to soft and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m AA with natural hair</li>
            <li>As far as its ability to moisturize, I&#x27;m still on the fence.</li>
            <li>They have 3 different types of hair textures but they all have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Detangling was much easier and my hair finally didn&#x27;t feel like straw.</li>
            <li>After this cream, my hair look so shine and soft.</li>
            <li>With a few more uses we shall see what my overall opinion is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes I let my hair cool down before rinsing the conditioner out.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the hunt for a new product you should definitely try this one.</li>
            <li>She mentioned having major breakage issues.</li>
            <li>I generally apply the conditioner, put on a plastic cap and then sit under my hooded dryer for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Only thing that has worked so far.</li>
            <li>Overall, the true test for me is how moisturized my hair is after a few days.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing in the shower, my hair felt soft; however not as soft and conditioned as it does when I use the Joico Moisture Recovery conditioner for dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have other deep conditioners that work much better for less &amp; also come in a bigger container.</li>
            <li>I decided to bleach my hair platinum (from black) for the first time ever about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a lover of Joico products until recently, and I have thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It definitely has a balm consistency, very thick and rich and it coats the hair completely.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t bad and it feels good on.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the best product ever for my thick hair that tangles easy!</li>
            <li> but I only use this one and it works great.</li>
            <li> Yes I appreciate a tangle free Fro.</li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth, never tangles, and is shiny all day.</li>
            <li> When I am done rinsing my hair it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> But given the cost, it is more economical to just buy body lotion.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I buy for much more elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Really rich and thick, makes my curly hair shine and feel wonderfully touchable.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who uses swagbucks to get Amazon gift cards, this product is worth a try because it will practically be free.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth a try if you want want those buttery, smooth locks.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for 10 minutes with a shower cap, then rinse, and apply coconut oil and it leaves my hair detangled and soft with shine and a nice curl.</li>
            <li> My ends are still a bit dry after only two treatments, but the difference is incredible and becomes more moisturized each time.</li>
            <li> After showering, I rub it into my skin and then rinse quickly.  </li>
            <li> I bleached my hair from brown, and all women know that horrid straw feeling of your beautiful new blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product will work better on newly relaxed hair</li>
            <li> Maybe this product will work better on newly relaxed hair</li>
            <li> This product also has a strong smell that I didn&#x27;t too much care for.</li>
            <li> I love this product had my natural curls defined and bouncing!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for the balm and because of the success I&#x27;ve had with the Moisture Recovery conditioner in this line, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> When I felt my hair after sitting under the hooded dryer, my hair felt silky and as if my hair absorbed the conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Completely worth it.an to buy this product again.  </li>
            <li> Completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I use a soft t-shirt to dry my hair and after rinsing the balm and using the t-shirt, the softness of my hair greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li> I know it says it is for coarse hair, but my hair is very fine, and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> It is amazing for dry hair that is not color treated.</li>
            <li> it not only smells good, but makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair (type 3) and this makes my hair so soft and my curls look wonderful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with thick hair to use this product and it smells great.</li>
            <li> The first use, all of the straw feeling went away.</li>
            <li> get this larger size, the 16.9 jar with the pump - it is a better deal than the tube.</li>
            <li> I almost thought  I was loosing hair when I first used it.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit more hydrating, but I use it as a regular conditioner</li>
            <li> It left my hair incredibly greasy and wet looking, no matter how much I rinsed and washed it out.</li>
            <li> My ends were dry and brittle and would break very easy</li>
            <li> leaves my hair soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I am currently using Joico&#x27;s Moisture Recovery conditioner for dry hair and loving it!.</li>
            <li> In addition, she recommended using a detangler with no alcohol in it, and then after, to use pure coconut oil on hair to keep moisture in.  </li>
            <li> With this balm, I had to definitely use a more moisturizer during the week and because I am 3 months post relaxer, my new growth requires lots of moisture and</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you use and make sure that you dont use to much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the quest for a product that is really moisturizing</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li> I find it works very well as a moisturizer though.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with the winter dryness.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair very soft, easy to detangle and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes a very noticeable, visible difference in my fine and dry hair.</li>
            <li> seriously its good stuff i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> She advised to use it more often and to, if possible, put it on my hair and let it sit for 30 minutes, preferably covered, and to apply heat to keep the shaft open and let the moisture penetrate deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love using this product for my little sister, myself and mom&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it at TJMaxx for $14.99 and didn&#x27;t like it at first because I was putting too much in my hair, and all throughout my hair rather than just the ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy cream conditioner that dries more like a gel.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy and thick hair and moisture recovery balm works great.  </li>
            <li> but, when I use the balm it made my hair very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> She advised to use less of the protein restorers and more of the moisture products as protein products tend to dry out hair if used too much.</li>
            <li> and my hair is never dry thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li> My natural curls look better than usual.</li>
            <li> Of course all is not lost; I will definitely continue to use the Joico Moisture Recovery Conditioner for dry hair.had to definitely use a more moisturizer during the week and because I am 3 months post relaxer, my new growth requires lots of moisture and</li>
            <li> Great for my thick coarse curly long hair.  </li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended it to me because I am transitioning from permed hair to natural texture</li>
            <li> Kept me from putting in a relaxer I have alot of hair brastrap length all natural.</li>
            <li> It completely changes the texture from tangle-y and stick-straight straw-like to soft and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with natural hair</li>
            <li> As far as its ability to moisturize, I&#x27;m still on the fence.</li>
            <li> They have 3 different types of hair textures but they all have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Detangling was much easier and my hair finally didn&#x27;t feel like straw.</li>
            <li> After this cream, my hair look so shine and soft.</li>
            <li> With a few more uses we shall see what my overall opinion is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 30 minutes I let my hair cool down before rinsing the conditioner out.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the hunt for a new product you should definitely try this one.</li>
            <li> She mentioned having major breakage issues.</li>
            <li> I generally apply the conditioner, put on a plastic cap and then sit under my hooded dryer for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that has worked so far.</li>
            <li> Overall, the true test for me is how moisturized my hair is after a few days.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing in the shower, my hair felt soft; however not as soft and conditioned as it does when I use the Joico Moisture Recovery conditioner for dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have other deep conditioners that work much better for less &amp; also come in a bigger container.</li>
            <li> I decided to bleach my hair platinum (from black) for the first time ever about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a lover of Joico products until recently, and I have thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a balm consistency, very thick and rich and it coats the hair completely.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad and it feels good on.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, I can say I was not thrilled about the price.</li>
            <li> I found that this moisture recovery balm locks in the moisture I need for blow drying and flat ironing my hair or twisting/knotting my hair.  </li>
            <li> Of course all is not lost; I will definitely continue to use the Joico Moisture Recovery Conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Oh, and my scalp itches far less too.  </li>
            <li> I have three very mixed daughters who are black, puerto rican, chinese, peruvian, hawaiian, and mexican.</li>
            <li> I was only using this a couple of times a week and alternating with keratin/protein products and my hair was still very dry and breaking off and shedding like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am natural, so is my little sister and my mom is transitioning.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s harder to get the last of it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> a lit bit of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This balm is really thick and goes a long way, I do not have to use a whole lot to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly and thick hair that I couldn&#x27;t manage till this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the balm for 4 consecutive weeks as a deep conditioner under a hooded dry for 30 minutes and to say the least, my results were less than stellar.  </li>
            <li> No only does my hair feel softer and less dry,  far less of my hair is falling out.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Now, my hair is so brittle and dry that it&#x27;s breaking off to the point where I am concerned that I may have to butch my hair to a pixie.  </li>
            <li> but I purchased it with hopes that it would do what it promised on my thick and course new growth.</li>
            <li> but I purchased it with hopes that it would do what it promised on my thick and course new growth.</li>
            <li> My relaxed hair was very dry and brittle, this made all the difference.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying my type of hair is kinky and very dry.</li>
            <li> African American with long thick hair.</li>
            <li> was a little worried that the product would not be the same I buy at salons, But it&#x27;s spot-on..</li>
            <li> Typically I purchase my Joico products from Marshall&#x27;s at a deep discount so this was way out of my typical price range</li>
            <li> However, I do buy all of my other JOICO products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use it every other wash, so on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> I purchased this balm for thick and coarse dry hair to tame my 3 months post relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> my kids have this shocked tear free look on their face.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is when it came in the mail, some of the product came out of the bottle and onto the packaging.</li>
            <li> Less tugging and pulling means less hair loss</li>
            <li> I talked to a black woman in the ethnic hair care section of a store.  </li>
            <li> this balm just does not give my hair the moisturized base needed to maintain the proper moisture levels prior to applying leave-ins and moisturizer; however, I definitely recommend Joico&#x27;s Moisture Recovery Conditioner for dry</li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m harshly judging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I buy other brands since this one is a little on the expensive side, but they never work as well as this stuff, so I always come back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and love it! I have very curly and thick hair that I couldn&#x27;t manage till this product. The only complaint I have is when it came in the mail, some of the product came out of the bottle and onto the packaging.</li>
            <li> I love it! It is very good for my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Really rich and thick, makes my curly hair shine and feel wonderfully touchable.</li>
            <li> Very good product!!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Left my hair very soft, easy to detangle and moisturized. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  My hairstylist recommended it to me because I am transitioning from permed hair to natural texture and I need the proper moisture and conditioning.  I found that this moisture recovery balm locks in the moisture I need for blow drying and flat ironing my hair or twisting/knotting my hair.  This balm is really thick and goes a long way, I do not have to use a whole lot to get the job done.  I would recommend this to anyone with thick hair to use this product and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy this online, because it runs about $8 at TJMAXX. However, I do buy all of my other JOICO products on Amazon. I bleached my hair from brown, and all women know that horrid straw feeling of your beautiful new blonde hair. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! The first use, all of the straw feeling went away. I have naturally thick and course hair and this is a gift from the hair gods!! I use it every other wash, so on a weekly basis. My ends are still a bit dry after only two treatments, but the difference is incredible and becomes more moisturized each time. I currently use the KPAK and I will switch to the moisture recovery line when I run out. I like to switch my shampoo and conditioner every three months or so simply for the sake of change, but I will never stop using JOICO.</li>
            <li> Supposedly it works better if using the combo (shampoo/cond) but I only use this one and it works great. The day of the hair looks like you just got out of the salon. It feels smooth, light and shines beautifully. However I was told by my hair stylist that I should only use once a week max or else the hair won&#x27;t look healthy. I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> African American with long thick hair. It detangles the toughest knots, it has a relaxing effect on my hair feeling hydrated, unbelievable moisture! Less tugging and pulling means less hair loss I kissed the bottle. Yes I appreciate a tangle free Fro. BEST hair product I ever used. Kept me from putting in a relaxer I have alot of hair brastrap length all natural. Oh and the scent  Ooohs and Aaahs! I don&#x27;t like coconut smells or fruity berry scents gack! This is a crisp clean aquatic fragrance LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes a very noticeable, visible difference in my fine and dry hair. I know it says it is for coarse hair, but my hair is very fine, and it works well for me. It completely changes the texture from tangle-y and stick-straight straw-like to soft and bendable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I buy other brands since this one is a little on the expensive side, but they never work as well as this stuff, so I always come back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get this larger size, the 16.9 jar with the pump - it is a better deal than the tube. And it&#x27;s harder to get the last of it out of the tube. With this jar, you can probably just open it up and get the last of it out.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner it not only smells good, but makes my hair soft. My hair is easily detangled and moisturized. It&#x27;s my favorite moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with natural hair and I&#x27;ve used this a few times since I&#x27;ve got it and it is a great detangler. My shed hairs slide on out with this. I almost thought  I was loosing hair when I first used it. As far as its ability to moisturize, I&#x27;m still on the fence. When it&#x27;s on my hair, it feels nice, but once I rinse it out I&#x27;m not reminded of this product at all. It could be that I expected for this to wow me beyond belief so I&#x27;m harshly judging. I&#x27;m going to keep using and update my review with a final verdict. If you&#x27;re someone who uses swagbucks to get Amazon gift cards, this product is worth a try because it will practically be free. The smell isn&#x27;t bad and it feels good on. With a few more uses we shall see what my overall opinion is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last opinion: I&#x27;ve concluded that this product is not for me. It doesn&#x27;t have the lasting moisturizing capabilities that I desire and need for my hair. It provided me with the slip I needed so that I could detangle my hair which is great. My hair felt a little moisturized while the product was in my hair but after rinsing it out the moisturized feeling failed to stay. This product also has a strong smell that I didn&#x27;t too much care for. I wish it would have delivered but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner for beautiful mixed girls hair. I have three very mixed daughters who are black, puerto rican, chinese, peruvian, hawaiian, and mexican. They have 3 different types of hair textures but they all have very curly hair. You can imagine their curly hair is always frizzy, nappy and extremely difficult to comb. All 3 of them even have different sized curls on each of their heads so yeah doing their hair is real fun for all of us.... This conditioner is a miracle worker!! when my girls put this in their hair, the combs just glide through their hair n my kids have this shocked tear free look on their face. THEY LOVE THIS STUFF. I swear by it. I just wish it was cheaper. This conditioner has changed our lives! seriously its good stuff i highly recommend it. a lit bit of it goes a long way. i love joico and i have been using the joico kpak on my hair since i was 19 n I&#x27;m now 29. joico is a great brand period.</li>
            <li> My relaxed hair was very dry and brittle, this made all the difference. I leaves my hair soft and shiny.  Just remember to use a heat protector to prevent damaging your hair when you put heat on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this balm for thick and coarse dry hair to tame my 3 months post relaxed hair.  I am currently using Joico&#x27;s Moisture Recovery conditioner for dry hair and loving it!. I read the reviews for the balm and because of the success I&#x27;ve had with the Moisture Recovery conditioner in this line, I decided to give it a try. Right off the bat, I can say I was not thrilled about the price. Typically I purchase my Joico products from Marshall&#x27;s at a deep discount so this was way out of my typical price range but I was hopeful this would be an AWESOME deep conditioner.  I&#x27;ve used the balm for 4 consecutive weeks as a deep conditioner under a hooded dry for 30 minutes and to say the least, my results were less than stellar.  So here&#x27;s the skinny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I really liked the thickness.  It definitely has a balm consistency, very thick and rich and it coats the hair completely.  It is a substantial conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I generally apply the conditioner, put on a plastic cap and then sit under my hooded dryer for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes I let my hair cool down before rinsing the conditioner out.  When I felt my hair after sitting under the hooded dryer, my hair felt silky and as if my hair absorbed the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- After rinsing in the shower, my hair felt soft; however not as soft and conditioned as it does when I use the Joico Moisture Recovery conditioner for dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What didn&#x27;t work for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is not that great.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell bad, but its not a smell that I would want to linger.  Good news is, it doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I use a soft t-shirt to dry my hair and after rinsing the balm and using the t-shirt, the softness of my hair greatly diminished.  Even after applying my leave-ins, my hair did not feel as moisturized as I was expecting it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Overall, the true test for me is how moisturized my hair is after a few days.  With this balm, I had to definitely use a more moisturizer during the week and because I am 3 months post relaxer, my new growth requires lots of moisture and this balm just does not give my hair the moisturized base needed to maintain the proper moisture levels prior to applying leave-ins and moisturizer; however, I definitely recommend Joico&#x27;s Moisture Recovery Conditioner for dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The jar has a pump which I thought was great; however, after the product gets to a certain level in the jar, the pump no longer works and requires a lot work to get the product in the right spot in the jar to use the pump.  I had a hard time in the shower with slick hands trying to unscrew the pump to get the product out.  The pump is a good idea but maybe not with a jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: For the price and the results, I unfortunately will not be purchasing the product again.  Maybe this product will work better on newly relaxed hair but I purchased it with hopes that it would do what it promised on my thick and course new growth. Of course all is not lost; I will definitely continue to use the Joico Moisture Recovery Conditioner for dry hair.had to definitely use a more moisturizer during the week and because I am 3 months post relaxer, my new growth requires lots of moisture and this balm just does not give my hair the moisturized base needed to maintain the proper moisture levels prior to applying leave-ins and moisturizer; however, I definitely recommend Joico&#x27;s Moisture Recovery Conditioner for dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The jar has a pump which I thought was great; however, after the product gets to a certain level in the jar, the pump no longer works and requires a lot work to get the product in the right spot in the jar to use the pump.

            <li> I had some hair breakage due to dryness and cold weather. After one treatment, the breakage stopped. Love it!</li>
            <li> I alsways see rave reviews for Joico so I tried it. It was not as spectacular as I have seen some reviews say. I have other deep conditioners that work much better for less &amp; also come in a bigger container.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever for my thick hair that tangles easy!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have dry hair. It was recommended to me by a friend and I Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair is hydrated for the entire week! I love Joico products and is the best product they offer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product! I will recommend it for a friend. My hair is much better now. Thank you Joico!!!</li>
            <li> I have 4b hair that I relax every 8-10 weeks. I&#x27;ve been on the quest for a product that is really moisturizing and I&#x27;ve finally found it! Its definitely worth a try if you want want those buttery, smooth locks. I add coconut oil and EVOO to mine and sit under a dryer for one hour. the results are great. this is my staple deep conditioner now. If you&#x27;re on the hunt for a new product you should definitely try this one.</li>
            <li> I love using this product for my little sister, myself and mom&#x27;s hair. I am natural, so is my little sister and my mom is transitioning. It works for all of us and an added greatness with a hair steamer. It is great in the winter.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I buy for much more elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The best and delivered so fast</li>
            <li> leaves my hair soft!!!! love it</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and it leaves my hair feeling a lot softer and more manageable. I wish it was a bit more hydrating, but I use it as a regular conditioner and I feel it&#x27;s a lot more effective for my hair this way than the &amp;#34;5 minutes every week&amp;#34; it recommends. I leave it on for 10 minutes with a shower cap, then rinse, and apply coconut oil and it leaves my hair detangled and soft with shine and a nice curl.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product and that&#x27;s saying a lot because I&#x27;m a product junkie and I&#x27;m very picky. I have curly thick hair (type 3) and this makes my hair so soft and my curls look wonderful. It is the perfect texture and smells nice. I recommend this to everyone that asks me what do I put in my hair. Shampoo and the conditioner is a great buy as well.</li>
            <li> After moving to Minnesota, my coarse, coil-y hair became drier than I have ever known it to be. I honestly had no idea what to do about it until a stylist I went to recommended this (in addition to a moisturizing shampoo from another brand). It is amazing for dry hair that is not color treated. I would leave this on my hair for about an hour after shampooing, then rinse and style. Detangling was much easier and my hair finally didn&#x27;t feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying my type of hair is kinky and very dry. I relax it every 6 weeks and it need a lot of moisture. After using this product my hair has improved a lot, it feels and looks healthy. The great thing about this product is that it adds moisture without adding heaviness. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great product and great price</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I actually bought it at TJMaxx for $14.99 and didn&#x27;t like it at first because I was putting too much in my hair, and all throughout my hair rather than just the ends. It left my hair incredibly greasy and wet looking, no matter how much I rinsed and washed it out. BUT, I have started using it as my primary conditioner, just on the ends, and I absolutely love it! My hair is so smooth, never tangles, and is shiny all day. I also pair this with the Joico KPaks Oil. I wasn&#x27;t a lover of Joico products until recently, and I have thick, fine hair. BUT I&#x27;m a believer now and would recommend this to anyone, all types of hair!</li>
            <li> This is a constant purchase for me.  It keeps my relaxed hair well moisturized and in great condition.  This is about my 4th purchase.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy it because it works for me.  I wash &amp; condition my hair myself at home, but even when I go to my stylist for a touch-up, she comments on how soft my hair feels and what great condition it&#x27;s in.  So I&#x27;d definitely recommend this treatment.</li>
            <li> I decided to bleach my hair platinum (from black) for the first time ever about a month ago.  Now, my hair is so brittle and dry that it&#x27;s breaking off to the point where I am concerned that I may have to butch my hair to a pixie.  The reconstructor by Joico was recommended by my stylist but I decided to try this as well.  I was only using this a couple of times a week and alternating with keratin/protein products and my hair was still very dry and breaking off and shedding like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I talked to a black woman in the ethnic hair care section of a store.  She mentioned having major breakage issues. She recommended this product and said to shampoo only once a week to once a month (and to use an organic clarifying shampoo that contains none of the sulfates, etc.) and, instead, deep condition daily to restore moisture.  She advised to use less of the protein restorers and more of the moisture products as protein products tend to dry out hair if used too much. She said this product was amazing.  I said I had it already.  She advised to use it more often and to, if possible, put it on my hair and let it sit for 30 minutes, preferably covered, and to apply heat to keep the shaft open and let the moisture penetrate deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered one of those heat bonnets to cover my hair and use with a hair dryer but I have not received it yet so, in the meanwhile, I have been just leaving this on my hair for 5-10 minutes a day when in the shower.  Amazing.  In addition, she recommended using a detangler with no alcohol in it, and then after, to use pure coconut oil on hair to keep moisture in.  I had already been using a detangler and coconut oil so the difference must be a result of using this every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 4 days since I talked with that lady and upped my usage to daily (and nixed the shampoo).  No only does my hair feel softer and less dry,  far less of my hair is falling out.  Oh, and my scalp itches far less too.  I definitely plan to buy this product again.  Completely worth it.an to buy this product again.  Completely worth it.</li>
            <li> This cream is so good. After this cream, my hair look so shine and soft. Just be careful when you use and make sure that you dont use to much.</li>
            <li> I have really coarse or kinky hair and I used this to deep condition. I loved it. My hair was soft and had wonderful definition. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Deixa o cabelo maravilhooooooso!</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy and thick hair and moisture recovery balm works great.  When I am done rinsing my hair it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  It&#x27;s the best self moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used and didn&#x27;t cost a great deal.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner on the market.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE this product!!&lt;br /&gt;It can be a very expensive product..&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried that the product would not be the same I buy at salons, But it&#x27;s spot-on..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you great service and fast delivery !!</li>
            <li> I love this product had my natural curls defined and bouncing! Day two and my hair still feels so good... I&#x27;m going to stock up!</li>
            <li> THIS THING IS SO AWESOME. Only thing that has worked so far. I always color my hair too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s like a holding conditioner and IS NOT GREASY.  I love this product because it does hold moisture in my hair and keeps my hair in place.  It&#x27;s a heavy cream conditioner that dries more like a gel.  It&#x27;s smells great and leaves your hair soft if you brush it out and doesn&#x27;t flake.  It washes out EASILY.  I wash my hair every two days because I work out and my hair is never dry thanks to this product.  I wash, tussle through my curls and go.  JOICO has done an excellent job with this product and every time I see it I buy it.  I&#x27;m glad to see RiteAid now stocks this product also.  I CONDITION CONDITION CONDITION my hair and this product is everything I could have wanted so my hair is never brittle.</li>
            <li> Received correctly, as agreed. I recommend !!</li>
            <li> Great for my thick coarse curly long hair.  My natural curls look better than usual.</li>
            <li> I normally love Joico products, but this one seemed to make my hair drier than before!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair once a week with the joico recovery moisture shampoo and the balm, after the first use of the balm I notices a great difference in my hair.  My ends were dry and brittle and would break very easy but, when I use the balm it made my hair very soft and silky.  I will order this product on a regular basis. love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is the consistency of a balm.  If you rinse your hair enough to remove the waxy coating, there is nothing left of the conditioner.  If you don&#x27;t rinse it out, you hair feels and looks dirty.  I find it works very well as a moisturizer though.  After showering, I rub it into my skin and then rinse quickly.  It really helps with the winter dryness.  But given the cost, it is more economical to just buy body lotion.</li>
