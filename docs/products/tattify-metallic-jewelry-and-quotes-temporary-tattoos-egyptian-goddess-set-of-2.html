            <li>/&gt;Would be a great gift for any teen!</li>
            <li>Really cheap looking tacky colored gold.  </li>
            <li>but it looks good so far.</li>
            <li>These are a decent set of temp tattoos with a nice variety of styles.</li>
            <li>Tattoos were super cute but rubbed off way too fast!!</li>
            <li>so much fun and easy to use</li>
            <li>So fun and user friendly</li>
            <li>Very pretty temporary jewelry.</li>
            <li>Very durable, but can be easily removed with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Just fun.</li>
            <li>Such fun tattoos, look amazing and stay on pretty well.</li>
            <li>Delivered right on time.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick service too.</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful and last a long time!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>looks exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>These were delivered in 5 days, they are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love and will use them again next suer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I would put it there knowing as much as I wash my hands and all the movement that goes on right there.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use very much of the tattoos themselves since they were all rather large and bulky.</li>
            <li>Expected something more realistic looking for the price</li>
            <li>Loved them, they last a long time, and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Happy I finally found these online since it is hard to find them in stores, and when I have found them in stores they are very pricey.</li>
            <li>Put on a strip as directed and completely peeled off as a whole...</li>
            <li>Tattoos are cool looking, but kind of expensive for two sheets, should have 4-6 sheets for the price.</li>
            <li>stay on for quite as long as advertised but is cool for the day or two</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same exact the  photos and delivered on time thank you so much</li>
            <li>Easily applied with just water, I put one on my ankle and it lasted over a week though I showered everyday.</li>
            <li>The tattoos were very pretty some did not fit my body very well and shipping was a nightmare</li>
            <li>Expected the size (length of the tattoos) to be a bit larger, but they will work and still are fun!</li>
            <li>, I bought these a full week and a half before I needed then for vacation</li>

            <li> LOVE THESE TATTOOS!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome pack! There was a lot more than I expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stay on for quite as long as advertised but is cool for the day or two it lasts.

            <li> Absolutely loved! Tattoos stayed on for 3 days without fading</li>
            <li> Loved them, they last a long time, and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was hoping this one was one of the better ones because of the price. I wanted my temporary tat to last a little bit longer. I put one on my wrist in the crook, where y wrist bends (which was my mistake) I don&#x27;t know why I would put it there knowing as much as I wash my hands and all the movement that goes on right there. Suffice it to say, it lasted for about 12 hours....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it again in a not so active area.</li>
            <li> not fond of the color of gold. gold color isn&#x27;t as muted as I&#x27;ve seen on other tattoos.</li>
            <li> looks exactly as pictured. beautifully packaged. my only complaint is that there were no instructions included. i&#x27;m guessing they should be applied just as any temporary tattoo is though.</li>
            <li> Is a great product. I wish more deigns were available.</li>
            <li> Very cute fast delivery they just don&#x27;t stay on the skin very long.</li>
