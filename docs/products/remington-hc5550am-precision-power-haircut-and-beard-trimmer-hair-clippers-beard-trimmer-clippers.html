            <li>IT&#x27;S VERY GOOD PRODUCT:)</li>
            <li>This was good while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this product, I jumped at the chance to order it because I loved the cordless option.</li>
            <li>, this product works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>Product is good as described.</li>
            <li>This is a really good clipper.  </li>
            <li>I use a Remington shaver to ensure that doesn&#x27;t happen, because I just don&#x27;t look good in a beard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is good for head hair or cleaning up your neck.</li>
            <li>One good charge before you hit the road</li>
            <li>The trimmer is nice and has great features...  </li>
            <li>this is verry good one , you can bay it and you will not be disepointed , this one m</li>

            <li>It has good power and cuts well.</li>
            <li>good things to pass</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>My son is going into the 9th grade so he needs to look good.</li>
            <li>If you keep them charged then you will be good to go.</li>
            <li>but it is good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those inputs they have sliding regulation which is good</li>
            <li>Whoever likes this trimmer I dont think they ever used good one in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one is also doing good.</li>
            <li>Good question.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>and they did a damn good job.</li>
            <li>The idea of having micro USB cable is good.</li>
            <li>it takes a good 12 hours to recharge it.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great to finally own a good set of clippers.   </li>
            <li>The titanium-coated blades are awesome and easy to clean!!</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had, but they are better than most of the ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>with each stroke the hair that collects on the end fall off with great ease and it felt very smooth.</li>
            <li>-Free Use]]The machine itself is very good, but the plastic attachments are flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>(I also have no use for or opinion on the &amp;#34;hair texturizor&amp;#34;.)&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Remington for a great product, well-thought out and designed, and at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>I love it, and it does a great job on my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>This light weight clipper is ideal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>sure this trimmer would be great for some people, just not for me.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied</li>
            <li>Works great and love the thinning option.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied witht he product.</li>
            <li>Works great on my sons head, lots is attachments, and love the duel charging option</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>After pointing out its superior qualities as a beard and mustache trimmer, I had a couple of employees purchasing a Remington RPCH for their own use.     </li>
            <li>Price is right and a perfect cut ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts nice, speed is nice, blade width is good</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, I loved the cordless feature.</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>had one exactly like this for over 2 years and was very happy wit it, until my son dropped it (or was it thrown?).</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Much better than the Panasonic!</li>
            <li>Battery is quite awesome, holds change pretty well.</li>
            <li>These are pretty awesome for the price.</li>
            <li>They love them!</li>
            <li>This one cuts much better and cleans up very easy!</li>
            <li>The boost feature is great and the built in thinner is another huge plus.</li>
            <li>But all around amazing clippers.</li>
            <li>Has a nice cleaning feature too.</li>
            <li>Nice product for the price..</li>
            <li>The Remington HC5550 is a handy device.  </li>
            <li>I liked that thang</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also well-shaped and has a nice heft and balance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for well over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>These will cut any kind of hair you need with no problem.</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice storage/travel bag.</li>
            <li>That is a really nice feature.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>I got this product since I cut my own hair and have been using a dying trimmer for a while now.  </li>
            <li>I use this to trim my beard &amp; for doing my own haircuts.</li>
            <li>Just let it glide on your head with it&#x27;s own weight.  </li>
            <li>It is nice not having to keep adjusting to where the cord is.</li>
            <li>the connectors got worn/rusted or something - it just wouldn&#x27;t make a good connection or charge/run any more</li>
            <li>Recommend for anyone who cuts their own hair.</li>
            <li>I have a Wahl clipper that I use with the comb attachments to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>I now cut my own hair</li>
            <li>This is a really nice item for the price.</li>
            <li>I really liked the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Nice concept, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The best cost/benefit ever, it works very well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that cuts their own hair.  </li>
            <li>I had read many good reviews about this product before purchased it.</li>
            <li>If this clipper comes with better combs, this is a really good product</li>
            <li>all bundles up nicely into its carry case once finished with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Really nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a styling freak, just like my hair to maintain a nice</li>
            <li>The titanium coated click-and-wash blades are also a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Can tell about that support is very nice and friendly....</li>
            <li>The clipper is great but the charger stopped working after 1 full charge.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product for the most part.</li>
            <li>Product looks cool and ergonomic design with backlit adds to its attractive appearance.</li>
            <li>All is fine good stuff and nice quality buy every time again.</li>
            <li>It was new, never opened and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The settings are good and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>good build the clips break easily</li>
            <li>It is very easy.  </li>
            <li>It cuts hair very easily, all you need to do is guide it through along the contour of your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clips are very easy to put on and change or to adjust the size.</li>
            <li>Also very nice that there is a quick-release setting which pops up the head of the trimmer for quick washing to remove excess hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We&#x27;ll see how this holds up over time, but so far, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>I had a Maverick which I used to trim my beard with great success.</li>
            <li>Good size and holds a pretty good charge.</li>
            <li>But the trimmer itself is a very fine product, as I&#x27;ve noted.</li>
            <li>last one was a Remington hkvac 2000 and it was the best clippers I have ever own</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This clippers worked great for the first month or two.  </li>
            <li>I love the length combs because they make it so that you can adjust lengths without it being a huge difference, so I can use it to give myself a haircut and even do a nice fade on my own head.</li>
            <li>Cut great easy to clean need more goodies with it.</li>
            <li>But, again, he says it runs and operates very smoothly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very smooth.  </li>
            <li>The plastic used on these guards is very cheap.</li>
            <li>The combs, however, are made out of very cheap, brittle plastic and break at the slightest stress.</li>
            <li>strong four stars, probably deserving of five for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want or need a tapered comb attachment.</li>
            <li>, it cleans up easily, the cord/less options is nice, and I like the idea of having one comb that adjusts in size, but because of the design of the combs, they tend to trap the cut hair inside them instead of just letting it all fall to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this Remington shaver seems like a good shaver, and it has good power to take off the hair very easy.</li>
            <li>My daughter is a professional and said this product was very good quality,  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, I&#x27;ve had much better luck using this haircut kit.</li>
            <li>The works better than any</li>
            <li>these seem possibly more the fault of the user than the trimmer.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>The MSRP is about what I would expect, and I got an even better price buying through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked it because it was light &amp; portable, but the contacts wore out and it no longer charges (or</li>
            <li>Love Amazon Prime shipping....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my sons&#x27; hair, too, for many years.  </li>
            <li>Once the guide is attached, be sure to apply pressure to the guide to see if it will slip out of position.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of having no cord.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s better clippers on the market</li>
            <li>This trimmer is well constructed and I love that it charges via USB.</li>
            <li>On most beard trimmers I use a setting of 5 or 6.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe Remington will have better guides in the updated version of this product.  </li>
            <li>My advice is it  might be better to avoid buying this one.  </li>
            <li>Remington really added a lot of nice features to it to make this a good clipper for all types of people.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, no.1 reason - cord and cordless trimming.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a plus, being able to plug it in and be sure that you will finish that haircut is what made me to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that come with most clippers.</li>
            <li>I think I had mostly just resigned myself to the fact that I&#x27;d be stuck with the ancient Wahl clippers, bites and all.  </li>
            <li>Returned it and now shopping here for something better.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be spending some more time cleaning it.</li>
            <li>If looking for just the trimmer then ok buy</li>
            <li>and i do pride myself on doing more than just buzz or square cuts) and i&#x27;ve learnt over the years,</li>
            <li>was more then I expecting</li>
            <li>I should be able to get 3 haircuts &amp; trims on 1 charge.</li>
            <li>After the Wahl disintegrated its batteries, I purchased this Remington as its replacement, thinking I was getting a better device.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can go on trips and never have to pack a charger.</li>
            <li>and I can use it for a week or more.</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m very happy about the product</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an OK</li>
            <li>I went with the Oster Topaz and am hoping for a better performance.</li>
            <li>Love the price, and the product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s comb, it is ok,</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used the USB charging yet, but i love the idea that i could travel anywhere in the world with it and not worry about wall chargers.</li>
            <li>can you say about one of America&#x27;s oldest most reputable manufacturers, Their production of outstanding firearms have served this country&#x27;s bravest soldiers and kept our flag flying.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>After just 14 months of use the battery will no longer hold a charge for operating more than 10 seconds and does not operate even with the cord attached.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have learned to use it and love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what more you could ask for from a home haircut, beard-trimming kit.</li>
            <li>... make sure you pamper the blade covers.  </li>
            <li>When it broke after many tears of service I ordered this as a replacement.</li>
            <li>it was for myself, so it was ok.</li>
            <li>Love Remington products and look forward to getting a lot of years of use out of this one.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>At best, I&#x27;ll be using it for my hair only, while finding a separate beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself appears to be Ok</li>
            <li>A good trimmer, gets the job done and is easy to clean out when done.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver, and the USB charge feature is great on international travel.</li>
            <li>Remington seems to have skimped on packaging to put more into the product.</li>
            <li>I love the versatility.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>And the reasons why this is better than the Wahl is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I love the ingenuity of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the idea of USB charging though.</li>
            <li>But since I am guessing most are like me, you don&#x27;t buy every brand of clipper on the market.  </li>
            <li>I could not get a cut with the hair comb, and was able to get something with the beard trimmer comb, but had to fight with it.</li>
            <li>For 100% refund policy, I&#x27;d say you should try it if you don&#x27;t see something better.</li>
            <li>Love this one as if I neglect to keep the goatee trimmed up</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problems with tugging or pulling (as the razor industry has humorously called it).</li>
            <li>They are more designed for a beard than your head.  </li>
            <li>They are okay if that is what you intend to use them for</li>
            <li>and he is satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the portability of this, so that you do not have to have it plugged in during use.  </li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product .</li>
            <li>I was concerned if it may heat up more and burn my skin</li>
            <li>I guess I can&#x27;t expect more.</li>
            <li>I love using the USB to charge.  </li>
            <li>bag is good too, nothing fancy but it effectively holds the whole kit.</li>
            <li>Very accurate, easy maintenance and excellent results in different brands for shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Very good product who have a long beard,short or any kind.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves etotot 1.7 product is delighted he ideally suited to it and combined with many other things!</li>
            <li>It takes quite a while to get the job done with it, but once you do it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It holds charges for a long time and the cordless convience is awesome.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is an pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li>The Remington Haircut &amp; Beard Trimmer 5550 is a great little razor at a great price with some super nice features!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i bought this item for my husband birthday, he love&#x27;s it, it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It even has a USB port that would be super handy for the traveller.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this trimmer to three of my bearded buddies and they&#x27;ve all enjoyed the design, power, and easy of use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use safely.</li>
            <li>This one seems to have a more manageable amount that can trim hair more precisely.    </li>
            <li>Works as described, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very soft, works great.  </li>
            <li>The feature that I like the most is that you can easily clean the razor by pressing the sides at the top to eject the head.</li>
            <li>I got out my trusty Wahl and had to cut my hair down to 1/8\\&quot; to cover it up, but the stripes are still fairly visible.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it as a beard trimmer because I like many of the functions - the blades come out for easy cleaning, the strength while cordless is pretty impressive - but will never use it as a hair trimmer again.</li>
            <li>These clippers work great, so far.</li>
            <li>I started as a way of saving money, primarily, but I learned to do a better job than what I got from hair salons.  </li>
            <li>So far I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>and most importantly, has usb charging.</li>
            <li>also like it better if the charging light changed colors to indicate when the battery was full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lasted about 50-60 light uses, not horrible for the price I suppose.</li>
            <li>Good investment and work very well.</li>
            <li>Really nice and sharp blades, trims beautifully, even my somewhat curlier beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like any other tool or instrument, the user has to master using it in order to get the best results.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a great little cordless razor at a super great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The additional pieces attach easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s study in one&#x27;s hand, easy to change between attachments and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and got a Wahl corded as a replacement and can tell the difference in build quality, but the Wahl is heavier and not as easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean because the top \\&quot;springs open\\&quot; to rinse with water.  </li>
            <li>I like how easy it was for my husband to use -- the attachments come on and off easily.    </li>
            <li>I found that I could use them easily without the \\&quot;Boost\\</li>
            <li>Most people will use this for actual hair (head) trimming and it will do a great job.  </li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to use and the product itself is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Well product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>The clippers since off easily.</li>
            <li>There are flimsy and flex easily.</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer, I&#x27;ve owned it for a few months and it works wonderful.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick and he did like the features on it.</li>
            <li>This makes it so easy to trim my beard to the length I want.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy to cut his hair now.</li>
            <li>The guide stays in place, it cuts the hair evenly and it&#x27;s able to get in all the nooks and crannies for a clean, even cut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This will cut ANY hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it ought to be easy to use, no matter where you are.</li>
            <li>, it ought to be easy to set to cut the length you want.</li>
            <li>a easy job of cleaning the unit once finished trimming; was just the icing on the cake for</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasts for over a week and the unit is easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li>works great, love the rechargable and multiple settings</li>
            <li>The Heads are junk, they break easily.</li>
            <li>I regret my purchase, and would strongly advise buying something else.</li>
            <li>The clipper worked strongly.</li>
            <li>This is my third hair clipper and to be honest, it is the best one I have owned so far.</li>
            <li>But it is pretty handy on the go, as you don&#x27;t need to carry a separate charger if you are traveling with a laptop.</li>
            <li>The ability to simply pop the clippers forward in order to clean under running water is a stroke of genius, and works brilliantly.  </li>
            <li>Wireless is awesome too, you can cut your hair on the roof and let your hairs fall down on all the unsuspecting people below, but why would you do that weirdo</li>
            <li>it does&#x27;nt trim down to the skin which isnt ideal if you&#x27;re planning to remove all your hair !</li>
            <li>Is powerfull and works fine.</li>
            <li>and you will have a fine beard trimmer and hair cutter.</li>
            <li>I use this just to trim my sideburns, and it works fine.</li>
            <li>The top pops open so you can run water through it to clean it which is a great feature to have.</li>
            <li>lot of complaints said that the guards were cheap and break easily...</li>
            <li>have used it now for doing follow up, light trimming, and it once again is easy for me to handle and gave me no problems.  </li>
            <li>works fine.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a trimmer that would allow me to shave close to 0mm QUICK!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, and does the job well.</li>
            <li>Great product somehow the battery does not last strong enough for one great cut.</li>
            <li>It has this cool feature so you can wash it thoroughly so its always very clean and the different types of razors it has come in very handy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another huge benefit (and the reason I bought this), is that it can be charged through your laptop via USB.  </li>
            <li>The assorted combs are quite accurate and well built.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this unit is HUGE, it feels like your holding a 40oz in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;the plastic attachments cracked twice on me, during a shave.</li>
            <li>This is a easy to use, a snap to clean product.</li>
            <li>the product should become defective within the warranty period, we will replace it free of charge&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li>(The Wahl is probably more powerful, but for me I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>I can confirm this, although when switched on the battery/charging light goes off, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still charging at that point or not.</li>
            <li>These lightweight, quiet, cordless hair clippers are great for giving cord-free, tangle-free haircuts.  </li>
            <li>My suggestion is to avoid purchasing these clippers if their primary use will be for trimming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another option that I like is the Corded/Cord Free use of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is an easy to use trimmer, but I do wish it was easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve let the trimmer charge for 48h and the light indicator was still amber</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product, plastic attachments are cheap.</li>
            <li>The hc5550 is easy to clean and comes with plenty of accessories.  </li>
            <li>do lightly oil the teeth after a rinse or between uses.</li>
            <li>Remington products are cheap but not reliable.</li>
            <li>I have this product and use it often, it works great and holds a charge for several days.</li>
            <li>The charge light never goes off when it is plugged in.</li>
            <li>and the light never went off.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go cheap on a hair trimmer is the lesson I learned.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, as the blades can pop up.  </li>
            <li>And not having to carry an extra charger, since it charges with USB, is great.</li>
            <li>i used to have a barber style where the No. 1 attachment was short and had the comb pieces close together and that worked great.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the courteous, ontime service.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and maintain the cuttign edge well.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and this trimmer works great for shaving the back of the neck and trimming beard/mustache.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, it ought to clean up easily.</li>
            <li>has a bit of a cheap feel</li>
            <li>Great but batt lasted only 18 mo on mine</li>
            <li>Its really easy to use and clean after.</li>
            <li>cuts smooth.  </li>
            <li>(I get free to day shipping</li>
            <li>It cuts really smooth.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to clean but...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic thank you</li>
            <li>I am no expert in the arena of these devices, but I have used a good many in my forty plus years of facial hair trimming.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>shopped around a bit and found the price reasonable and feel it is the best product in its class and will last for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Smooth action, lots of power, fits you hand well, and good battery life</li>
            <li>Armed with this outpouring of rubbish from the likes of me, I hope that this review allows you to make a more informed decision as to whether or not this product might be the right one for you or for someone that would appreciate this grooming tool as a gift.</li>
            <li>me, it works like a charm, I even was able to make a haircut right out from the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I had been able to hold one  before buying, I would have put it right</li>
            <li>The could use a good sharpening out of the box but other than that the battery has amazing life.</li>
            <li>It is well built and very powerful.</li>
            <li>Overall very handy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item highly,it comes with everything you need and when charged is very powerful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good, and it arrived in a very short time without any kinds of delay, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>this is more appropriately used as a supplement to a main clipper.</li>
            <li>Also I like the easy clean up, just run water over the blade and push the two buttons on each side to clean the inside and your done.</li>
            <li>this trimmer/hair cutter cuts very easily and quietly compared to others I own.  </li>
            <li>It does clean out pretty easily, but there&#x27;s got to be a better</li>
            <li>Very nice product, before I bought this, I had tried two of them from other brands and i wasnt satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and we really enjoy the click and clean feature as well.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, recharges quickly, and has three attachments that is workable with any length of hair.  </li>
            <li>Also the battery life is exceptional, compared to my old unit (ever after replacing the batteries).</li>
            <li>The blade also pops out for super easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>But we really like this product and after becoming more familiar with it , it got easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>The attachments are very very flimsy, anything more than the slightest pressure and you end up with racing stripes and bald strips.</li>
            <li>Have used it shave my head 3 times now - on the original charge.</li>
            <li>The more I&#x27;ve used it, the better the results have been and the price I paid for it was only a bit more than one trip to the barber shop.</li>
            <li>Anyway worth the price!</li>
            <li>If you ever want to use power supply then you have no choice but to use the supplied DC adapter with the funny tip on top of the USB plug</li>
            <li>I had to stop and clean it three times.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a breeze as well.    </li>
            <li>He trims his beard over the sink and then has to clean up all the trimmings.</li>
            <li>Then you can rinse the head under running water to clean it out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need to use a brush to clean it and no dismantling required.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean, even, and</li>
            <li>I also like the pop up head and rinse clean features.  </li>
            <li>I have used it only twice, but so far I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>And clean out the built-up hair....</li>
            <li>Powerful and easy to run.</li>
            <li>It cuts very nicely, and stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li>While my experience with the trimmer itself has been good (good battery life, cuts cleanly, doesn&#x27;t tug or yank on hair as you cut, easy to clean), the attatchments have been nothing but frustrating.  </li>
            <li>It recharges easily, holds a charge for a long time, and is what I&#x27;d call a good trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it cuts right through it!</li>
            <li>A little large but does a great job....would have liked a stand for it to come with</li>
            <li>used within its limitations, this is probably good enough for most guys, and certainly a number of notches up from the $10 or $20 clipper/trimmer sets you buy at target or drug stores.</li>
            <li>the blades will also get quite warm, fast, at the higher speed setting.</li>
            <li>Great, well made product in every way, except the blade is too wide for beard trimming</li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s washable under a tap, i recommend also using a spray cleaner and lubricant like andis cool care</li>
            <li>i have been cutting my own hair for a long time and this is the best clippers ever used, and  a great price.  </li>
            <li>Dad always had his own hair cut by a professional.     </li>
            <li>Not the nice clear clam shell you see it in stores with.  </li>
            <li>Preformed well with full charge.</li>
            <li>I have tried different combs sold with this product, they do not have good clock  </li>
            <li>Some of those cool looking body grooming clippers (Phillips, Norelco, Braun, ect) have just 6 height settings, some the guards don&#x27;t even come off so you can mark.</li>
            <li>These clippers are sweet.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about this at first, but after a couple of uses this clipper is quite all right.  </li>
            <li>It cuts smooth, fast, and easy</li>
            <li>; In no way to I intend to contradict other owner/users, but I have had great success in getting warranty parts shipped to me free of charge from both Remington AKA Spectrum Brands as well as another household name in shaving/grooming</li>
            <li>The Remington clippers feel good in the hand, are easy to manipulate and hold in a number of different ways (useful whether you&#x27;re getting your own head or trimming back fur on a dog).  </li>
            <li>Cant really do super tight fancy things, but great for a maintenance free haircut.</li>
            <li>blades are super sharp and the power of the motor is great.</li>
            <li>Love them, would recommend to other looking for a decent priced, but great clippers</li>
            <li>Those who know me may laugh at me having an opinion about hair care - my last \\&quot;good hair day\\</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still on the same charge, now if they only made phone batteries this great!</li>
            <li>They could doubtlessly have been constructed from a material that instills trust in their use instead of mild angst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>QUICK SUMMARY:  </li>
            <li>hair-cutting jobs done quick.    </li>
            <li>You just slide up the switch and you can get your neat edges done quickly.</li>
            <li>They charge quickly</li>
            <li>\\&quot;boost\\&quot; improved things tremendously, but i doubt anyone is going to see the 40 minute usage claim.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best trimmers on the market other than a professional model !</li>
            <li>Luckily Remington sells all the combs on their website.</li>
            <li>Holds charge well and charges fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is an OK clipper, I have a better Remington, I only got this because of voltage requirements.</li>
            <li>I would like to give it more stars because when it was working it seemed to do a decent job.  </li>
            <li>I expected was very nice product, I am satisfied with the product, as they offer, pay the right price, I will continue watching deals, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>And when I used it on my eyebrows the plastic guard bent (very easily) and I nearly took a chunk of my eyebrow off.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, long battery life, very easy clean up after usage.  </li>
            <li>With a little more experience, I&#x27;ll be able to competently attach and detach the clipper guides</li>
            <li>With a little more experience, I&#x27;ll be able to competently attach and detach the clipper guides</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very handy that you can keep it plugged in while using it compared to other trimmers that have to be used on a charge.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I have been using shaving and trimming devices for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems like a good idea at first, reducing many attatchments down to just three, but it just doesn&#x27;t work in practice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of this clipper after using it two times and I bought a cordless WAHL that works great and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The clipper length is actually pretty easy to set, and it is nice to have only three of them instead of the dozen or so</li>
            <li>This sounds very convenient and easy, but the fact is that hair gets stuck and bunched up under the plastic guard.    </li>
            <li>This trimmer works great with a long charge life and I really like that it is cordless and rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>For the price this is an excellent trimmer, works well &amp; holds a charge long enough so it doesn&#x27;t have to be charged between every trimming.</li>
            <li>Very durable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I keep my head trimmed pretty short and have had problems finding a good trimmer that doesn&#x27;t pull until I tried the Remington HC5550.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to use and easy to clean, just wished it had a smaller trimmer as well!</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer for \\&quot;cleaning up\\&quot; in between visits to the barber shop.</li>
            <li>This is one great little haircut trimmer.</li>
            <li>If you are using this as a traditional hair cut device, I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.</li>
            <li>It has good power, although I wish it had just a little more to get really hardcore jobs done, but it will work for all hair types.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this trimmer because it made such a great first impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This unit cuts smoothly and evenly, and holds its charge very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It actually cuts faster than the Wahl did amazingly.</li>
            <li>The price was well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best trimmer I have ever had!&lt;br /&gt;Solid built and massive like a commercial grade trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer/cutter is exceedingly well made, and has a terrifically powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Solid motor and nice blades.</li>
            <li>the batter last and the attachments are so handy.</li>
            <li>Since this is made to be a haircut kit, it does more than just trim beards, but that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve used it for so far.</li>
            <li>There is a turbo button for extra power which comes in handy for those with longer  hair.</li>
            <li>The machine is excellent but the adapter comb arrived broken</li>
            <li>For the price, I find it REALLY worth</li>
            <li>It has a powerful motor also.</li>
            <li>None of the attachments are useful to sculpt a beard.</li>
            <li>It eliminates visiting the barber shop on a more than frequent basis.</li>
            <li>Useful, very convenient, simple sense is good</li>
            <li>and feels more professional</li>
            <li>My 7 year old Remington was needing another twin battery replacement, and being on my last comb for the clipper, it was time to replace what&#x27;s been a great grooming tool for me.  </li>
            <li>If you use it straight, without the attachments, it&#x27;s good enough I suppose.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this razor.</li>
            <li>My hair came out nice and even using the second largest guard.</li>
            <li>Much more powerful than my old one, charges off USB</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>After many years of cutting my husbands beard and hair,this has been the best I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>so far one of the better trimmers i&#x27;ve owned and</li>
            <li>But the awesome thing is that if you are half way done, and the juice does run out (and when it runs out it goes fast, but it goes full speed until it does), just plug into the wall, and your in business again right away, no waiting for it to charge for you to continue, it worked on direct wall power AND on battery.</li>
            <li>I used it to take my longish hair down to 1/4&amp;#34;, and even with the attachment, it zipped through my hair as easily as the professional grade Wahl clippers I have at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For beard trimming, it also did a great job.  </li>
            <li>Right now, as it stands, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Cuts great, cleans easily, no snags or hair pulling...</li>
            <li>I bought Remington vacuum hair cut, it was amazing, but this item Remington HC5550AM Cord/Cordless is not that good as the other one.  </li>
            <li>It recharges easily, cleans up quickly after use and stores easily in soft case to protect it between uses.</li>
            <li>whole product is pretty sturdy feeling, and a good overall weight.  </li>
            <li>Has a lot of good points about it as already stated by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, dose good cuts.</li>
            <li>It should just effortlessly snap on, right?  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>It did start right out of the package well and manages to hold a charge</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have the long-bristle brush from my older pair of clippers that I&#x27;m still using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of why I bought the second one, after my first was destroyed.</li>
            <li>It did seem durable and loved most everything else about it but definitely not as versatile as I expected.</li>
            <li>use the plastic guard for other \\&quot;man parts\\&quot;, works pretty good.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve cut my own hair for a long time (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that you can charge these with only a usb, or a regular wall charger.</li>
            <li>I use this thing right-up against my face without those plastic guards and it did the job super fast.</li>
            <li>the comb is too soft and would break easily.</li>
            <li>The device works great for head hair, but far too wide to work on your face.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer had combs made of harder plastic and work great for my beard and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>We have used them to give over 25 haircuts so far and they are running strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to automatically give you the best haircut right out of the box like maybe some of the other reviewers here have expected.  </li>
            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are light and the language resembles English, but it&#x27;s not always in the right syntax to be easily understood unless you&#x27;re very liberal with the interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After two uses, I was happy and comfortable enough with them as replacements that I simply threw the old reliable Wahl away.  </li>
            <li>but I very much appreciate the customer service I received from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I use a kit very much like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Good for shorter hair like mine, but struggles a little through thicker longer hair.</li>
            <li>Efficient, fairy fast speed, long lasting battery, excellent trim feature, stays clean for several uses.</li>
            <li>I might further add: this model is advertised as being able to operate while plugged in to charge.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make a loud buzzing sound like my corded clippers.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that instead of many pieces to keep track of, there are only 3 plastic adjustable attachment combs.  </li>
            <li>I need to go and return on the same place of my head many times.  </li>
            <li>Have been a Remington fan, but will look around better next I&#x27;m purchasing.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the construction.</li>
            <li>The second time I admit I should have known better, but having just purchased the clippers I was keen to give them another chance.</li>
            <li>if those are too pricy, i&#x27;d hazard to say even a mid-range oster or andis would be a better overall cutter.</li>
            <li>note that the product description gives first billing to beard trimming, indicatingit&#x27;s a beard trimmer first, then a haircutter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even able to do the back of my head &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>One of the combs on the large guard was bent right out of the package.</li>
            <li>This is my first cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li>So, it does exactly what it is supposed to be doing, does it well, (and sometimes before I wished I had a loan mower for the hair</li>
            <li>- once you go cordless, there&#x27;s no going back :)</li>
            <li>funny part is product</li>
            <li>However, it now won&#x27;t hold enough charge for more than 15 seconds of use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted to be able to charge it while I travel internationally.</li>
            <li>first problem with the attachments occurred the day the trimmer arrived</li>
            <li>It does ok on my head, but forget about using it for facial hair.</li>
            <li>First of all, while it claims to be an all-in-one beard/hair/body trimmer, it is not.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have the blade width or sheer horsepower of plug in clippers, so I have to make more repeat passes with it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this since I hadn&#x27;t purchased the \\&quot;Vanilla Ice\\&quot; model, and I was pretty upset.</li>
            <li>One pass on either setting, no sticking, like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>If you take proper care of blades they do not break as many people claim, they are just plastic after all and won&#x27;t withstand a fall while attached.  </li>
            <li>I used this unit today for the first time and</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m kind of careful about it).</li>
            <li>When I charged it for the first time everything was OK on the second time the indicator that was supposed to shine didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Not as solid a machine, but seems to work better to cut hair.</li>
            <li>I found it okay only.</li>
            <li>still works, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to do the same :)</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell when it was charged or not at first, heads up, blinks when charging, if it steadies, its charged.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li>This is a nice item as I expected.</li>
            <li>the first trim combs/guard broke the first time I took them on a flight.</li>
            <li>Overall I like the product most of it because of the cordless option</li>
            <li>Works pretty well</li>
            <li>but they never last more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>Very well built !</li>
            <li>Then, when I tried to reach the Remington via email they never responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great clippers for the first year, then they are disposable.</li>
            <li>but what good is it if the guides are going to break every few months.</li>
            <li>quality wise, the product seems well built, but i have a few nagging gripes.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s because I was used to my old Remington but preferred the attachments better than on the new one.</li>
            <li>Since it has USB charging, I thought it would be ideal -- less volume and weight in my bag without an extra power adapter.  </li>
            <li>The variable adjustable combs work generally well except that they clog with hair easily</li>
            <li>This is a full-sized trimmer and is far too large for beard trimming or anything detailed.  </li>
            <li>I own or have owned nose hair trimmers, electric razors, and other hair and body trimmers.  </li>
            <li>For trimming hair and etc it may work just fine, but for beards and other fine trimming do not use this product.</li>
            <li>Without a tapered attachment, it&#x27;s hard to get the kind of easy control you&#x27;d want, unless you like the look of absolutely uniform</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve said it above, but I&#x27;m really excited about the USB charging capability!</li>
            <li>It arived a day earlier than expected and it woks great.</li>
            <li>The cordless operation is seemed good but it can only last around 40mins.</li>
            <li>This thing does even better and gives me a 1 o&#x27;clock shadow all week long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am also pleased that it is designed for use on both regular hair and facial hair, as I confirmed on the Remington website and in the video advertisement on the Amazon product page.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fully satisfied with this product, as for now, time will show for how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are great for haircuts, assuming that the guard doesn&#x27;t break as mine did and several other commenters have noted as well.</li>
            <li>Has guard that lets you cut leaving hair long than most clippers.</li>
            <li>I pretty much always use them in boost mode.</li>
            <li>Has many features, and much easier to clean than my previous Sharper Image groomer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good or not, I haven&#x27;t even turned it on, because the product I received wasn&#x27;t new, but refurbished!!!&lt;br /&gt;Oil was leaking from the blade, covering half of it.</li>
            <li>I had an older version of the non-turbo model, it was way more solid and reliable.</li>
            <li>I love this thing the only issue it has , is the blades pop out to clean and the blades are constantly popping out while I cut my hair</li>
            <li>Buzzer runs quiet and is easy to wash and maintain.</li>
            <li>Remington makes it easy for the Mrs. to trim - it comes with 15 length settings with 3 different snap-on combs.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this a nice, compact size, but because it&#x27;s both precise enough for beard trimming and powerful enough for head-shaving, it&#x27;s allowed me to leave two devices at home, and just bring this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plastic power switch turns on easy enough, but requires two hands to turn off because there is no grip to</li>
            <li>I keep my hair fairly short, and find this easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is too big to use easily as a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable combs make this easy enough, although they will move if pressed.</li>
            <li>So easy to screw up -- like I did and cut too short.</li>
            <li>Only thing that I would change is to be able to adjusts the smaller comb like you can on the larger ones...makes it more difficult to trim a mustache without having one of the combs going into my nose...other than that, it is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion it is tool large to put in a travel kit even though it is powered by rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t blame the gadget for my inability to cut my own hair with a trimmer, nor can I blame the gadget for the mess it made in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It worked great, up until now, less than two years later.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s amazing they send you the new set before you have sent back the old one...</li>
            <li>Flexing was abundant with little force applied.</li>
            <li>Works well with the variable settings available, especially for hair trimming, but as others have noted, it&#x27;s a bit large for beard and moustache trimming.</li>
            <li>this can not trim beards, there is no small settings or attachments and it is a very large trimmer.</li>
            <li>This thing is huge, has a lot of power and is way too big for your face.</li>
            <li>but it feels really like cheap plastic, especially the accessories .</li>
            <li>They call this a beard trimmer but it should really lose that classification.  </li>
            <li>Cheap bag, the combs don&#x27;t work well, and it needs a boost because just trimming my short beard caused it to jam up with hair!  </li>
            <li>This groomer/trimmer device works very well.</li>
            <li>so much I looked for another Remington product to replace it.</li>
            <li>Nor is it a really close beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Customer is responsible for return shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>of this is a real indication as to quality, but it should stand as some manner of guidepost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yeah, the trimmer works very well</li>
            <li>and I really like the cordless operation aspect -</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t radiate heat like my corded clippers, which get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The only light it has shows that it is plugged-in, but you can&#x27;t tell when the charge cycle is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charging is very convenient, you can plug it into the wall or any USB jack.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a highly recommended hair-cutting kit!</li>
            <li>Remington makes one that works very well.    </li>
            <li>So you wind up having to cut your hair very CAREFULLY.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The real selling point of this clipper is the cordless feature.  </li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>and I really like the heft and feel of this cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The staff at Remington really know how to make a user-friendly trimmer.</li>
            <li>It makes cleaning the blade much easier.</li>
            <li>USB Charging option is unusual, but I guess if you&#x27;re travelling, it would be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems very durable.  </li>
            <li>at $35, i don&#x27;t feel i have much to complain about.</li>
            <li>I just started shaving my head and this thing really cuts it away.</li>
            <li>The second cut, a bit shorter than desired, was smooth and there wasn&#x27;t any pulling.  </li>
            <li>but they do work very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the adjustable heads.</li>
            <li>and I get a very inconsistent cut...  </li>
            <li>you cant really see the quality</li>
            <li>I would really like a number 0.5 head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is to shave your head with and also if you have as much hair on your face as you do with your head, then this will work out, because you are haircutting.</li>
            <li>So much easier to cut my boys hair</li>
            <li>I do wish that it had a light that showed when it was charged or when it was low.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will see much use at my place.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Battery holds a charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain about&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>They sent a unit that battery charge does not charge to green...is always in amber and discharge very rapidly( one session of around 10 minutes).</li>
            <li>about 6 times to do my whole head and face.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all that was involved in the transaction, including the delivery.</li>
            <li>Be gentle putting them on and taking them off.</li>
            <li>works better then expected</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made and appears to be a very solidly-built product.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I had never seen one in person and really wish I had.</li>
            <li>It does that well, but considering how this clipper is marketed, I can&#x27;t really reccomend it.</li>
            <li>It works and cuts very well.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, better than expected.</li>
            <li>They have worked out very well.</li>
            <li>The HC 5550 cuts really well</li>
            <li>Especially like its corded and cord free feature.</li>
            <li>I used it on my whole head once a week (number 3).</li>
            <li>Then you get a really close trim.</li>
            <li>But amazon.com was very helped, fast, and covered the shipping cost of the return.</li>
            <li>and I can this tell is one is much worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never know what is the real length</li>
            <li>This product cuts hair very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I SAVED SO MUCH MONEY</li>
            <li>Shipped extremely fast</li>
            <li>My sons really like this</li>
            <li>, it seems very sturdy</li>
            <li>Haircut\\&quot; is a real misnomer.  </li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and well protected.</li>
            <li>thanks .</li>
            <li>very satisfied-good product</li>
            <li>This trimmer/shaver works very well,</li>
            <li>If you try to use this on battery power alone the power is very week and won&#x27;t cut your hair</li>
            <li>but i dont recommend it to any one who wants to trim beard ..</li>
            <li>On this trimmer I used the lowest setting and that only kind of works -- the combs are just way too big.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd purchase, the first was 3 years ago, from leaving it in the shower stall the full time,</li>
            <li>Whoever design it looked at only the handle shape and button..which looks nice but only on store</li>
            <li>Luckily, his hair has grown back some before the first day of school.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and active.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to use with no guard as long as you manage the temperature of it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and long battery life.</li>
            <li>The fact that you can open it up and run it under water to clean it out is very convenient.</li>
            <li>this reason, I&#x27;d say this product is better for use on other people than for do-it-yourself types when it comes to haircuts --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Remington cordless twice, both times after leaving it plugged in for the full 14+ hours to give it as much time to be fully charged as possible.  </li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, I was concerned it might be underpowered because it was so quiet, but turns out it&#x27;s plenty powerful with the added bonus of not sounding like a lawnmower.  </li>
            <li>but I need a pair of clippers to do my line and clean my facial hair up</li>
            <li>And it always works really well (considering the above mentioned quality of hair - wire-like and full).</li>
            <li>and you have to back off to clean.  </li>
            <li>My main use for it was to do a close trim of my whole body, including head and face.</li>
            <li>You can clean it like an electric razor - open the cutter part and wash it under the sink.</li>
            <li>the positive side, the charge capacity lasted through the first botched cut and the second cut to fix the first one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s easy to use, it has a lot of heads to choose from, it is portable and rechargeable, and when you look at the price of haircuts, it&#x27;s also a common sense choice.</li>
            <li>The attachments are also made from very brittle plastic, so be careful carrying any of them in a bag as they break easily and become unusable.</li>
            <li>Other trimmers by Remington for less money have many more settings for length.  </li>
            <li>Only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I found is that battery takes forever to charge but once its full you can use it for hours</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find much of an increase from the normal setting to the boosted setting, though.</li>
            <li>The guards are far too flexible and butchered my beard and head on the first use.  </li>
            <li>Dropping it now an again from sink top level or even average shoulder level shouldn&#x27;t harm it.  </li>
            <li>I really like being able to flick open the blade to simple wash the blades and drive mechanism.  </li>
            <li>One full charge usually last me about two to three cuts.  </li>
            <li>So far it is more powerful than my old corded model, so much so that I can cut my hair in less time.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good little man groomer look no further.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love my new clipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to be incredibly careful with the guides this time knowing how easily they can break</li>
            <li>When it worked, it lacked the power of a typical shaver, although it seemed to cut okay.  </li>
            <li>Good for close cutting on neck, but grooming attachments are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I am a follically challenged man who has been cutting his own hair for many years now.</li>
            <li>main problem is with the comb attachments.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Click-N-Wash blade system is one of the main reasons why I bought this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you don&#x27;t use the guides at all it would be a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s cordless, it&#x27;s way easier to use than my older plug in type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m used to the standard clipper kit with hardened plastic guards, but I would also expect a bit more resistance from these especially considering those stubborn under chin beard hairs.  </li>
            <li>A decent set of clippers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably quiet and does its job quickly.</li>
            <li>Used this on my father for a haircut and compared to a quite older model of Remington&#x27;s corded unit, this one pales in comparison.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this was to replace the Wahl brand hair trimmer that I had used for over five years.</li>
            <li>Its motor is stronger than my Philips Norelco clippers that I had before this (don&#x27;t know the model off-hand, but it was a slightly older one).</li>
            <li>It cut the hair alright, the main issue I had was that cut hair kept getting building up between the blade and body of the machine.  </li>
            <li>The on/off switch malfunctioned after a couple of months use - (had to flick back and forth many times to turn off), then the battery simply died after almost 2 years.</li>
            <li>main issues with it</li>
            <li>powerful enough, but the length was not controlled very well</li>
            <li>My husband says it runs very smoothly but that, since it&#x27;s not strictly a beard trimmer, it has no receptacle to catch the little hairs that are trimmed from his beard.</li>
            <li>But if you do relative short cuts, and/or tapered cuts, or even love those high and tights, this Trimmer will do the job quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why USB charging was thought to be a good idea, are people really in a situation ever where they need to trim their hair and they have access to USB power but not a regular outlet?</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>This product is really of high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you cut hair at home, I highly recommend this Remington.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>imo, this is a good travel companion for grooming, touch ups, and the occasional buzz, but not heavy duty enough to warrant being your only choice or even your number 1 choice.</li>
            <li>We have tried so many different brands of Haircut and beard trimmers before that always fell flat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Indeed, it is a little bit more difficult, compared to other models, say Philips, to clean hair out of comb, but If you&#x27;re handy enough to make a self haircut, cleaning hair is nothing to you, be handy till the end.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(\\&quot;Boost\\&quot; makes the clippers a little noisier and it discharges the battery more</li>
            <li>I use it on my moustache and eyebrows and we&#x27;ve used it on the family dog as well - the blades wash easily and seem to have stayed perfectly sharp.</li>
            <li>other complaints said that the guards bend too easily when you&#x27;re pressing...</li>
            <li>This is a great clipper and I disagree with the other reviews that say it is not easy to use.  </li>
            <li>sometimes the hard way, how good quality tools really make a big difference.</li>
            <li>I replaced an older version of this with the new one.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s also used this as a beard trimmer and says that it&#x27;s much easier to use than his old model.  </li>
            <li>I was actually skeptical about this product when I read the reviews, but this thing works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>The ones that were needed most for me trimming needs broke on transport without any heavy jostling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery has plenty of juice for just doing my head and on the normal speed setting I would say it lasts from 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely well worth the money, and lives up to the remington name.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money but, as one reviewer noted, the shortest length isn&#x27;t all that short and I keep having to replace them.  </li>
            <li>It seemed ok from the add, but it turned out to be too bulky and heavy.</li>
            <li>I deducted a star because the vibrating blade was not properly adjusted so was not cutting close.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it and would likely buy another one....</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t toss it around, and continuously drop it, it seems plenty durable for normal home use.  </li>
            <li>You cannot turn on and operate the clipper with the normal usb cable.</li>
            <li>Does a good, not great job.</li>
            <li>Unlike other hair trimmers in this price range, these&lt;br /&gt;clippers are more heavy duty and cut smoothly.</li>
            <li>We hope to get it right next haircut</li>
            <li>The big comb broke right away</li>
            <li>it is ok it is not strong</li>
            <li>Needless to say, the trimmer but a bald patch on the top of my son&#x27;s head!!</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000LNB8HK Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades]], or any other brand you like, following a quick burst of compressed air to get all the hair particles out from under the blade head.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t tested to see how long the battery lasts or how hot the blades will finally get while on full boost mode, but if i do, i&#x27;ll update this review.  </li>
            <li>Sharp blades, smooth cut.</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t make a tapered comb (for trimming around your ears) for this product (and none of their other tapers will fit).</li>
            <li>I actually use this to cut my own hair and after some practice I can now cut my hair and as little as 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and carved a nice little racing stipe into my noggin and had to cut the rest of my head short to even it</li>
            <li>The first and most important thing a trimmer ought to do is cut hair without yanking or pulling it, and without scratching or cutting me.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t really move it all the way down until you clean it...and cleaning...</li>
            <li>so I decided to refresh with a new cordless haircut kit.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I have a new found respect for Remington on this thing, as an engineer, congrats to the engineers that designed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing a new trimmer from another manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, its new and I&#x27;m hoping with use it does not change how it works.  </li>
            <li>The new one doesnt have that</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t use the new unit for that again.  </li>
            <li>I opened the new trimmer set and again, NO BLADE GUARD.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item as new, but it didn&#x27;t came in the Manufacturer Package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to always check this, because I have burned out a few motors on trimmers designed for use on hair alone by also using them on beards, which are much tougher to cut.</li>
            <li>Better handle, better cutting.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the blade width is pretty wide for use on the face.  </li>
            <li>I thought the USB thing was a bit strange at first and got some jokes from the family about downloading haircuts, but really i just use it with no guard in the shower twice a week.  </li>
            <li>However, given foreknowledge of the purported fragility of the attachments relative to the robustness of the trimmer/cutter, I suspect that I would use lots of care using the attachments;...and it is not unlikely that I would use them without fanfare and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>But unless you plan to shave the head completely, this product just doesn&#x27;t have the power you&#x27;ll need for a normal hair cut.    </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The combs are cheaply made which make this trimmer average.</li>
            <li>Second, it cuts very well!  </li>
            <li>The boost setting runs like my old trimmer does normally.  </li>
            <li>But that seems rather pointless when I&#x27;m sure there are models out there that will do both well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give an opinion on the combs/guards as I haven&#x27;t and likely won&#x27;t use them - though I will say they seem fairly sturdy and they were reasonably well-packaged in my purchase, so those experiencing broken or bent guards ought to be in the minority.</li>
            <li>So I kept using the old pair, returned the new (and the replacement new pair when we thought we might have just had a defective set), and went about our merry way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super high powered like the clippers they use at the salon, so you will most likely have to finish off your sideburns with a razor.</li>
            <li>The guards for this product are cheap plastic and are not very accurate.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that it really cuts well, and the guides are fairly decent for maintaining a specific length.</li>
            <li>After using other product I found Remington HC5550 very convenient and practical with the right price it is</li>
            <li>My old Remington razor finally bit the big one after 10 years of almost daily use (I&#x27;m bald on top, but still have plenty of activity on the sides.</li>
            <li>VERY sharp and precise during hair trimming.</li>
            <li>They couldn&#x27;t send just the guard to me but emailed me a label print to attach to the box and immediately sent me a new trimmer (I think I was given a whole month to send the first one back, but I sent it out the next day).</li>
            <li>Fortunately with this razor which I have had for about a year and a half now, that is not an issue.</li>
            <li>I have little doubt that it will last a good long while.</li>
            <li>After that I was so proud of my newly acquired cutting skills</li>
            <li>the cool care spray or similar will also have the added benefit of cooling down the blades halfway through a cut if they get hot.</li>
            <li>I suppose that would be great if you had a really big head since it makes trimming go much faster due to a very wide (too wide, IMO) blade, or wanted to shear sheep all day.</li>
            <li>The three heads aren&#x27;t all that inspiring either, we&#x27;ve had less expensive kits do a whole lot better.    </li>
            <li>I cannot attest to the battery life, because I just keep it plugged in between uses, but it certainly has enough juice to complete at least one haircut, and probably many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>blade is sharp and it isn&#x27;t super loud.  </li>
            <li>this is because while the aforementioned titanium coated blades are sharp, the motor doesn&#x27;t seem particularly strong.</li>
            <li>This Remington not only has a large enough blade and enough power to buzz my head nearly smooth, it additionally: has two power settings; charges via USB(!)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bog down like the other cheap retail ones, it plows right through.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This looks like a well made unit, and may be great for cutting hair, but I bought it as a beard trimmer, and it is not at all well suited for that.  </li>
            <li>are huge gaps in between the plastic blades on the attachment, which leaves uneven lines.</li>
            <li>The cordless aspect is great and if the battery dies during a cut you can just plug it in with the recharging cord and keep cutting.</li>
            <li>The unit comes with a bottle of oil and the instructions clearly state that oiling is part of the blade maintenance.</li>
            <li>My 12 years old Oster broke</li>
            <li>My old Remington cut it all until the day it croaked).</li>
            <li>I cannot really speak to this issue as I have only peered at the faux chrome &#x27;plated&#x27; items through their packaging, and</li>
            <li>What I can state with some degree of certainty is that they do not seem to anywhere near the quality of the trimmer/</li>
            <li>the record, the basic trimmer/cutter works very well to trim hair.</li>
            <li>I have used a corded Wahl for a while now, but have wanted a cordless* since it&#x27;s not always practical for me to use it near an outlet.</li>
            <li>This is what the manufacturer says about the Remington HC5550AM professional Cord/cordless rechargeable haircut kit with turbo boost:    </li>
            <li>Remington HC5550AM Professional Cord/cordless Rechargeable Beard Trimmer and Haircut Kit with Turbo</li>
            <li>Plug it in after giving a hair cut and it&#x27;s ready for the next use.  </li>
            <li>I really like the lightweight, cordless, cool-to-the-touch, quiet features of these clippers.  </li>

            <li>The neat thing about this clipper is that it has a lot of extra features that really help you get</li>
            <li>We just purchased this because we had an old Remington that no longer charged.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that it looks very used.</li>
            <li>It will take a long time to charge the first time as stated in the instructions (read them).  </li>
            <li>It was unexpected.</li>
            <li>Use it directly on my scalp without the attachment</li>
            <li>It charges well and the batteries are capable of holding enough charge to use it for atleast an hour.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to change blade guards to frequently to cut hair.</li>
            <li>Now I have a grandson and a Remington Rechargeable Professional Cordless Haircut Kit.</li>
            <li>Thanks Regington for making such affordable device!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m located overseas and mistakenly trusted that the product shipment would be complete.</li>
            <li>It is really convenient to use though especially since it&#x27;s cordless and can even be charged via USB!</li>
            <li>The fact that it doubled as a hair trimmer sealed the deal, since I was also looking for something to replace my old Wahl.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it once</li>
            <li>but so far no problems.  </li>
            <li>normally do not waste my time writing about things i bought..</li>
            <li>Not even from the direct manufacturer.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few trimmer I&#x27;ve used that te attachments fit snugly</li>
            <li>I thought the light was supposed to turn green or something, guess not .</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really do haircut if you have a very short hair.</li>
            <li>the brushes on the head are soft on scalp as you trim.</li>
            <li>At this price point, it&#x27;d only take two hair cuts for the unit to pay for itself in this area, so you&#x27;re definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The manufacturers would have been better off just making a few extra single-depth attachments that don&#x27;t collect trimmed hair.</li>
            <li>bought this one after reading the reviews carefully and there you go its actually worth my money.</li>
            <li>It only is recharged through the socket, but if it can&#x27;t hold a charge than you can&#x27;t use it for more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li>but honestly I&#x27;d rather use my old clippers that were broken than use this again.</li>
            <li>good price, not very ease to clean hair from cutting blades</li>
            <li>Very nice for trimming the beard and cutting hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to keep all of the mess in the shower and just rinse it all down the drain.</li>
            <li>However, I hope that I have added some useful data that I did not see in other reviewers&#x27; remarks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item is pretty much as advertised, however I have found it to be a lot heavier, as well as a lot bigger, than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I am not THAT old, but only suffered having to shave while still in junior high school.</li>
            <li>Such a easy, quiet unit to use; within a short space of time my facial hair was trimmed to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>My charging indicator light always stays red when plugged in and never turns green like other devices do when their charge is full.</li>
            <li>The only real caveat here is that the trimmer/cutter most assuredly does not cut down to the level of a dedicated shaver, nor does it cut as close to the skin as some other beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>I have had many different trimmers in the past...</li>
            <li>another model shown in the video promo seems to actually show the time left on the charge, but i couldn&#x27;t find a higher end model than this for sale.</li>
            <li>I used to have older Remington model for years and it would last even longer, but it broke when I dropped it.</li>
            <li>HC550, first one the battery finally gave up after 2 years of regular use.  </li>
            <li>Ironically enough, I only caught my skin once when I first tried it</li>
            <li>Ive only used this once, but it worked like a charm, has high quality components.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this product is that it can heat up to high temperatures when in turbo boost mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>An use haircut high price but low quality.</li>
            <li>only option is to buy replacement guides directly from Remington for a steep price or buy a new trimmer.....</li>
            <li>the major design flaw of this product is that the teeth flex leaving you with lines and bald spots allover!</li>
            <li>Not very heavy for beard and mustache trimming.  </li>
            <li>and my beard looks the same as if I used the normal mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few years ago it started to become increasingly clear that it was time to replace them, the blades were no longer as sharp, nor were they as nicely secured in their positions, which meant that now and again the clippers would bite just enough to hurt.  </li>
            <li>boys hair cuts...there aren&#x27;t all the different attachments like normal clippers...</li>
            <li>Almost nothing is intuitive, and as near a I&#x27;ve been able to  adjust the various guides, I am forced to trim my beard either at &amp;#34;longer than I want&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Did</li>
            <li>One of the teeth on the only attachment I use (it goes from #3 to #21) snapped off from the pressure of the tight fit in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li>The first is the adjustable length guides bend with only slight pressure so as you are using it you get variable length cuts depending on how much force you exert.  </li>
            <li>The cumbs can&#x27;t be replaced, they are easy to break but hard to get a replacement.</li>
            <li>at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought cheaper trimmers that only lasted a few months.&lt;br /&gt;So as long as you are OK with a comb that will have to be replaced frequently</li>
            <li>I am a male and I only needed to write down for numbers; one for the front, One for the top, One for the back and one for the sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I called Remington, got through to customer service with no hold time whatsoever and after briefly explaining the situation they offered to send me a new one and a return shipping label to return my dieing clippers with the receipt from my order history in Amazon.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean cutting</li>
            <li>This unit is heavy duty and does an excellent job of cutting my hair.</li>
            <li>The last pair didn&#x27;t last at all or cut the hair very well.</li>
            <li>especially like the Turbo Boost (which I have on constantly while cutting), the attached hair texturizor, titanium coated blade, and the SUPER handy Click N&#x27; Wash option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a guy that cuts his own hair (buzz cut), I have experimented with several trimmers and was regularly annoyed by the cord getting in my way.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and smooth cutting.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if I received a refurbished item or what, but it wasn&#x27;t in original packaging.  </li>
            <li>I can only charge mine using a computer or another USB based charger (currently using iPAD 12w charger) which isn&#x27;t big enough to give it full charging speed as it is only 1.2A not 1.5A like the stock</li>
            <li>The clippers have a tiny brush for cleaning, but they really need to come with a long-bristled brush to clear out hair bunches stuck in the clipper guides, and to flick hair off the victim&#x27;s neck.  </li>
            <li>My finicky older son reported only once where the clippers pulled at his hair rather than sheer his hair.  </li>
            <li>Usually, this kind of&lt;br /&gt;trimmer feels a little flimsy and I&#x27;m always worried that the head&lt;br /&gt;attachments are going to bread; they often do.</li>
            <li>it feels better constructed than competitive brands at the same price point, it is larger and heavier than other brands i&#x27;ve owned, the actual blades give a more comfortable cut, it remains to be seen if they stay sharp, this seems to be where all the other brands fall down, the blades become dull or even a bit rusty.</li>
            <li>I generally just plug it into my phone charger, so charging couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li>You will have to take off the attachment and clear the stuffed hair several times during the hair cut.</li>
            <li>addition, there are two additional money back offers and guarantees.</li>
            <li>So my advise is that if you&#x27;re a professional hair dresser, you probably want to go with something else but for sporadic household use (weekly usage not daily usage), you can&#x27;t beat these clippers!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would you recommend this product to youth, adults and especially mothers with young children.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only complaint is that there aren&#x27;t more short size combs to choose from.</li>
            <li>Apparently Remington has hired a Vice President in Charge of Screwing Things Up as there is virtually nothing I like about this device.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>They break constantly and the wall charger is faulty (they frequently die).  </li>
            <li>I have used old version of Remington for last 7 years.</li>
            <li>The stubble attachment is the most poorly designed attachment I&#x27;ve seen, considering its intended use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for beard cutting though.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s easy enough, especially since this is so small and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only complaint is easy to hit button that causes guard to slip while in use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter than other clippers i&#x27;ve used, and there were no pulled hairs in the whole process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont use it much, but when I do, it does not pull hair like other machines doo</li>
            <li>The integrated Pro Power Motor gives you a cutting performance that&#x27;s twice as fast and its self-sharpening Titanium-coated blades are scientifically proven to cut significantly more hair with every stroke--saving you both time and effort.     </li>
            <li>love that its cordless, makes cutting my sons hair soo much easier.</li>
            <li>The thin wispy hairs on top of his head don&#x27;t get cut at all, and I have to go back with scissors.    </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much about them -- which is to say that they did their job, and with proper maintenance they did their job well and for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>In the end I had to use my old trimmer that has flat solid guides to fix my patchy haircut from this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>nothing much to complain about except for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smaller trimmer to trim mustaches and other parts of beards.</li>
            <li>There is only a bare shaver (about 0.2mm), and a number 1.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how long it holds a charge.</li>
            <li>I see a lot of people saying lots of things and apparently folks who buy lots of different clippers.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasted plenty long to complete my cut.  </li>
            <li>The attachment work pretty well (though they seem to break if you are a bit heavy handed like me)</li>
            <li>They are powerful enough, and include a button to boost the same when you need a little extra clipping power.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixed White and Black, and because of the way the combs are designed - with a significant gap between them and the blade - my hair bunched up, meaning that I had to stop every 5 or so seconds to empty it.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the adjustable combs that came with the new clipper, but they align and work just fine.  </li>
            <li>The product looks cheap, doesn&#x27;t hold charge that well and in general functions poorly.</li>
            <li>as far a the guards go, they are either too long or too short.</li>
            <li>Given this, i&#x27;m not sure how useful this would be as a groomer for facial hair, given the contours of a face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly the heavy duty, going to last a while, gets the job done razor that we have been looking for.</li>
            <li>its good for cutting long hairs like the barbers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cost of a single replacement comb is over $11 (including shipping charge), which is almost 1/2 of the price of the complete kit (trimmer, combs, charger)</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time, I&#x27;ve only had it 3 weeks so far and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since the initial charge.  </li>
            <li>however, if you want a full fledged clipper to do an entire head or thick or coarse hair, i&#x27;d go with a \\&quot;real\\&quot; clipper set, like an oster 76 (corded), or andis bgr or voguers max pro (both cordless).</li>
            <li>Decent, but not worth the price for the flimsy attachments.</li>
            <li>:  large size, heavy weight,</li>
            <li>The dual way to charge (outlet or usb) is a little unusual, but I can see how that&#x27;d be beneficial for someone traveling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simply write down the number setting to a particular attachment and go to town.</li>

            <li> This was good while it lasted.  </li>

            <li> , this product works fairly well.  </li>
            <li> Product is good as described.</li>
            <li> This is a really good clipper.  </li>
            <li> I use a Remington shaver to ensure that doesn&#x27;t happen, because I just don&#x27;t look good in a beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is good for head hair or cleaning up your neck.</li>
            <li> One good charge before you hit the road</li>

            <li> If you keep them charged then you will be good to go.</li>
            <li> but it is good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those inputs they have sliding regulation which is good</li>
            <li> Whoever likes this trimmer I dont think they ever used good one in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This one is also doing good.</li>
            <li> Good question.  </li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> and they did a damn good job.</li>
            <li> The idea of having micro USB cable is good.</li>
            <li> it takes a good 12 hours to recharge it.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great to finally own a good set of clippers.   </li>
            <li> The titanium-coated blades are awesome and easy to clean!!</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had, but they are better than most of the ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> with each stroke the hair that collects on the end fall off with great ease and it felt very smooth.</li>
            <li> -Free Use]]The machine itself is very good, but the plastic attachments are flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> (I also have no use for or opinion on the &amp;#34;hair texturizor&amp;#34;.)&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Remington for a great product, well-thought out and designed, and at a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> I love it, and it does a great job on my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> This light weight clipper is ideal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> sure this trimmer would be great for some people, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Works great and love the thinning option.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied witht he product.</li>
            <li> Works great on my sons head, lots is attachments, and love the duel charging option</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> After pointing out its superior qualities as a beard and mustache trimmer, I had a couple of employees purchasing a Remington RPCH for their own use.     </li>
            <li> Price is right and a perfect cut ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cuts nice, speed is nice, blade width is good</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I loved the cordless feature.</li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> had one exactly like this for over 2 years and was very happy wit it, until my son dropped it (or was it thrown?).</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Much better than the Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Battery is quite awesome, holds change pretty well.</li>
            <li> These are pretty awesome for the price.</li>
            <li> They love them!</li>
            <li> This one cuts much better and cleans up very easy!</li>
            <li> The boost feature is great and the built in thinner is another huge plus.</li>
            <li> But all around amazing clippers.</li>
            <li> Has a nice cleaning feature too.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price..</li>
            <li> The Remington HC5550 is a handy device.  </li>
            <li> I liked that thang</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also well-shaped and has a nice heft and balance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for well over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> These will cut any kind of hair you need with no problem.</li>
            <li> Comes with a nice storage/travel bag.</li>
            <li> That is a really nice feature.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> I got this product since I cut my own hair and have been using a dying trimmer for a while now.  </li>
            <li> I use this to trim my beard &amp; for doing my own haircuts.</li>
            <li> Just let it glide on your head with it&#x27;s own weight.  </li>
            <li> It is nice not having to keep adjusting to where the cord is.</li>
            <li> the connectors got worn/rusted or something - it just wouldn&#x27;t make a good connection or charge/run any more</li>
            <li> Recommend for anyone who cuts their own hair.</li>
            <li> I have a Wahl clipper that I use with the comb attachments to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> I now cut my own hair</li>
            <li> This is a really nice item for the price.</li>
            <li> I really liked the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice concept, but it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The best cost/benefit ever, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that cuts their own hair.  </li>
            <li> I had read many good reviews about this product before purchased it.</li>
            <li> If this clipper comes with better combs, this is a really good product</li>
            <li> all bundles up nicely into its carry case once finished with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Really nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a styling freak, just like my hair to maintain a nice</li>
            <li> The titanium coated click-and-wash blades are also a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> Can tell about that support is very nice and friendly....</li>
            <li> The clipper is great but the charger stopped working after 1 full charge.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product for the most part.</li>
            <li> Product looks cool and ergonomic design with backlit adds to its attractive appearance.</li>
            <li> All is fine good stuff and nice quality buy every time again.</li>
            <li> It was new, never opened and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The settings are good and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> good build the clips break easily</li>
            <li> It is very easy.  </li>
            <li> It cuts hair very easily, all you need to do is guide it through along the contour of your skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clips are very easy to put on and change or to adjust the size.</li>
            <li> Also very nice that there is a quick-release setting which pops up the head of the trimmer for quick washing to remove excess hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how this holds up over time, but so far, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I had a Maverick which I used to trim my beard with great success.</li>
            <li> Good size and holds a pretty good charge.</li>
            <li> But the trimmer itself is a very fine product, as I&#x27;ve noted.</li>
            <li> last one was a Remington hkvac 2000 and it was the best clippers I have ever own</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This clippers worked great for the first month or two.  </li>
            <li> I love the length combs because they make it so that you can adjust lengths without it being a huge difference, so I can use it to give myself a haircut and even do a nice fade on my own head.</li>
            <li> Cut great easy to clean need more goodies with it.</li>
            <li> But, again, he says it runs and operates very smoothly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very smooth.  </li>
            <li> The plastic used on these guards is very cheap.</li>
            <li> The combs, however, are made out of very cheap, brittle plastic and break at the slightest stress.</li>
            <li> strong four stars, probably deserving of five for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want or need a tapered comb attachment.</li>
            <li> , it cleans up easily, the cord/less options is nice, and I like the idea of having one comb that adjusts in size, but because of the design of the combs, they tend to trap the cut hair inside them instead of just letting it all fall to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this Remington shaver seems like a good shaver, and it has good power to take off the hair very easy.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a professional and said this product was very good quality,  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, I&#x27;ve had much better luck using this haircut kit.</li>
            <li> The works better than any</li>
            <li> these seem possibly more the fault of the user than the trimmer.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> The MSRP is about what I would expect, and I got an even better price buying through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked it because it was light &amp; portable, but the contacts wore out and it no longer charges (or</li>
            <li> Love Amazon Prime shipping....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my sons&#x27; hair, too, for many years.  </li>
            <li> Once the guide is attached, be sure to apply pressure to the guide to see if it will slip out of position.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of having no cord.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s better clippers on the market</li>
            <li> This trimmer is well constructed and I love that it charges via USB.</li>
            <li> On most beard trimmers I use a setting of 5 or 6.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe Remington will have better guides in the updated version of this product.  </li>
            <li> My advice is it  might be better to avoid buying this one.  </li>
            <li> Remington really added a lot of nice features to it to make this a good clipper for all types of people.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, no.1 reason - cord and cordless trimming.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a plus, being able to plug it in and be sure that you will finish that haircut is what made me to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that come with most clippers.</li>
            <li> I think I had mostly just resigned myself to the fact that I&#x27;d be stuck with the ancient Wahl clippers, bites and all.  </li>
            <li> Returned it and now shopping here for something better.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be spending some more time cleaning it.</li>
            <li> If looking for just the trimmer then ok buy</li>
            <li> and i do pride myself on doing more than just buzz or square cuts) and i&#x27;ve learnt over the years,</li>
            <li> was more then I expecting</li>
            <li> I should be able to get 3 haircuts &amp; trims on 1 charge.</li>
            <li> After the Wahl disintegrated its batteries, I purchased this Remington as its replacement, thinking I was getting a better device.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can go on trips and never have to pack a charger.</li>
            <li> and I can use it for a week or more.</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m very happy about the product</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s an OK</li>
            <li> I went with the Oster Topaz and am hoping for a better performance.</li>
            <li> Love the price, and the product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comb, it is ok,</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the USB charging yet, but i love the idea that i could travel anywhere in the world with it and not worry about wall chargers.</li>
            <li> can you say about one of America&#x27;s oldest most reputable manufacturers, Their production of outstanding firearms have served this country&#x27;s bravest soldiers and kept our flag flying.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> After just 14 months of use the battery will no longer hold a charge for operating more than 10 seconds and does not operate even with the cord attached.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have learned to use it and love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what more you could ask for from a home haircut, beard-trimming kit.</li>
            <li> ... make sure you pamper the blade covers.  </li>
            <li> When it broke after many tears of service I ordered this as a replacement.</li>
            <li> it was for myself, so it was ok.</li>
            <li> Love Remington products and look forward to getting a lot of years of use out of this one.</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> At best, I&#x27;ll be using it for my hair only, while finding a separate beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself appears to be Ok</li>
            <li> A good trimmer, gets the job done and is easy to clean out when done.  </li>
            <li> Good shaver, and the USB charge feature is great on international travel.</li>
            <li> Remington seems to have skimped on packaging to put more into the product.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> And the reasons why this is better than the Wahl is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I love the ingenuity of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the idea of USB charging though.</li>
            <li> But since I am guessing most are like me, you don&#x27;t buy every brand of clipper on the market.  </li>
            <li> I could not get a cut with the hair comb, and was able to get something with the beard trimmer comb, but had to fight with it.</li>
            <li> For 100% refund policy, I&#x27;d say you should try it if you don&#x27;t see something better.</li>
            <li> Love this one as if I neglect to keep the goatee trimmed up</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with tugging or pulling (as the razor industry has humorously called it).</li>
            <li> They are more designed for a beard than your head.  </li>
            <li> They are okay if that is what you intend to use them for</li>
            <li> and he is satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the portability of this, so that you do not have to have it plugged in during use.  </li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product .</li>
            <li> I was concerned if it may heat up more and burn my skin</li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t expect more.</li>
            <li> I love using the USB to charge.  </li>
            <li> bag is good too, nothing fancy but it effectively holds the whole kit.</li>
            <li> Very accurate, easy maintenance and excellent results in different brands for shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Very good product who have a long beard,short or any kind.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves etotot 1.7 product is delighted he ideally suited to it and combined with many other things!</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to get the job done with it, but once you do it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It holds charges for a long time and the cordless convience is awesome.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is an pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li> The Remington Haircut &amp; Beard Trimmer 5550 is a great little razor at a great price with some super nice features!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i bought this item for my husband birthday, he love&#x27;s it, it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It even has a USB port that would be super handy for the traveller.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this trimmer to three of my bearded buddies and they&#x27;ve all enjoyed the design, power, and easy of use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use safely.</li>
            <li> This one seems to have a more manageable amount that can trim hair more precisely.    </li>
            <li> Works as described, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very soft, works great.  </li>
            <li> The feature that I like the most is that you can easily clean the razor by pressing the sides at the top to eject the head.</li>
            <li> I got out my trusty Wahl and had to cut my hair down to 1/8\\&quot; to cover it up, but the stripes are still fairly visible.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it as a beard trimmer because I like many of the functions - the blades come out for easy cleaning, the strength while cordless is pretty impressive - but will never use it as a hair trimmer again.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great, so far.</li>
            <li> I started as a way of saving money, primarily, but I learned to do a better job than what I got from hair salons.  </li>
            <li> So far I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> and most importantly, has usb charging.</li>
            <li> also like it better if the charging light changed colors to indicate when the battery was full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasted about 50-60 light uses, not horrible for the price I suppose.</li>
            <li> Good investment and work very well.</li>
            <li> Really nice and sharp blades, trims beautifully, even my somewhat curlier beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like any other tool or instrument, the user has to master using it in order to get the best results.  </li>
            <li> All in all, a great little cordless razor at a super great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The additional pieces attach easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s study in one&#x27;s hand, easy to change between attachments and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and got a Wahl corded as a replacement and can tell the difference in build quality, but the Wahl is heavier and not as easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean because the top \\&quot;springs open\\&quot; to rinse with water.  </li>
            <li> I like how easy it was for my husband to use -- the attachments come on and off easily.    </li>
            <li> I found that I could use them easily without the \\&quot;Boost\\</li>
            <li> Most people will use this for actual hair (head) trimming and it will do a great job.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to use and the product itself is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Well product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> The clippers since off easily.</li>
            <li> There are flimsy and flex easily.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, I&#x27;ve owned it for a few months and it works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick and he did like the features on it.</li>
            <li> This makes it so easy to trim my beard to the length I want.  </li>
            <li> Its so easy to cut his hair now.</li>
            <li> The guide stays in place, it cuts the hair evenly and it&#x27;s able to get in all the nooks and crannies for a clean, even cut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This will cut ANY hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, it ought to be easy to use, no matter where you are.</li>
            <li> , it ought to be easy to set to cut the length you want.</li>
            <li> a easy job of cleaning the unit once finished trimming; was just the icing on the cake for</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts for over a week and the unit is easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li> works great, love the rechargable and multiple settings</li>
            <li> The Heads are junk, they break easily.</li>
            <li> I regret my purchase, and would strongly advise buying something else.</li>
            <li> The clipper worked strongly.</li>
            <li> This is my third hair clipper and to be honest, it is the best one I have owned so far.</li>
            <li> But it is pretty handy on the go, as you don&#x27;t need to carry a separate charger if you are traveling with a laptop.</li>
            <li> The ability to simply pop the clippers forward in order to clean under running water is a stroke of genius, and works brilliantly.  </li>
            <li> Wireless is awesome too, you can cut your hair on the roof and let your hairs fall down on all the unsuspecting people below, but why would you do that weirdo</li>
            <li> it does&#x27;nt trim down to the skin which isnt ideal if you&#x27;re planning to remove all your hair !</li>
            <li> Is powerfull and works fine.</li>
            <li> and you will have a fine beard trimmer and hair cutter.</li>
            <li> I use this just to trim my sideburns, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> The top pops open so you can run water through it to clean it which is a great feature to have.</li>
            <li> lot of complaints said that the guards were cheap and break easily...</li>
            <li> have used it now for doing follow up, light trimming, and it once again is easy for me to handle and gave me no problems.  </li>
            <li> works fine.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a trimmer that would allow me to shave close to 0mm QUICK!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and does the job well.</li>
            <li> Great product somehow the battery does not last strong enough for one great cut.</li>
            <li> It has this cool feature so you can wash it thoroughly so its always very clean and the different types of razors it has come in very handy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another huge benefit (and the reason I bought this), is that it can be charged through your laptop via USB.  </li>
            <li> The assorted combs are quite accurate and well built.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this unit is HUGE, it feels like your holding a 40oz in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;the plastic attachments cracked twice on me, during a shave.</li>
            <li> This is a easy to use, a snap to clean product.</li>
            <li> the product should become defective within the warranty period, we will replace it free of charge&amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> (The Wahl is probably more powerful, but for me I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I can confirm this, although when switched on the battery/charging light goes off, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still charging at that point or not.</li>
            <li> These lightweight, quiet, cordless hair clippers are great for giving cord-free, tangle-free haircuts.  </li>
            <li> My suggestion is to avoid purchasing these clippers if their primary use will be for trimming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another option that I like is the Corded/Cord Free use of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is an easy to use trimmer, but I do wish it was easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve let the trimmer charge for 48h and the light indicator was still amber</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product, plastic attachments are cheap.</li>
            <li> The hc5550 is easy to clean and comes with plenty of accessories.  </li>
            <li> do lightly oil the teeth after a rinse or between uses.</li>
            <li> Remington products are cheap but not reliable.</li>
            <li> I have this product and use it often, it works great and holds a charge for several days.</li>
            <li> The charge light never goes off when it is plugged in.</li>
            <li> and the light never went off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go cheap on a hair trimmer is the lesson I learned.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, as the blades can pop up.  </li>
            <li> And not having to carry an extra charger, since it charges with USB, is great.</li>
            <li> i used to have a barber style where the No. 1 attachment was short and had the comb pieces close together and that worked great.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the courteous, ontime service.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and maintain the cuttign edge well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and this trimmer works great for shaving the back of the neck and trimming beard/mustache.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, it ought to clean up easily.</li>
            <li> has a bit of a cheap feel</li>
            <li> Great but batt lasted only 18 mo on mine</li>
            <li> Its really easy to use and clean after.</li>
            <li> cuts smooth.  </li>
            <li> (I get free to day shipping</li>
            <li> It cuts really smooth.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to clean but...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic thank you</li>
            <li> I am no expert in the arena of these devices, but I have used a good many in my forty plus years of facial hair trimming.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> shopped around a bit and found the price reasonable and feel it is the best product in its class and will last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Smooth action, lots of power, fits you hand well, and good battery life</li>
            <li> Armed with this outpouring of rubbish from the likes of me, I hope that this review allows you to make a more informed decision as to whether or not this product might be the right one for you or for someone that would appreciate this grooming tool as a gift.</li>
            <li> me, it works like a charm, I even was able to make a haircut right out from the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I had been able to hold one  before buying, I would have put it right</li>
            <li> The could use a good sharpening out of the box but other than that the battery has amazing life.</li>
            <li> It is well built and very powerful.</li>
            <li> Overall very handy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item highly,it comes with everything you need and when charged is very powerful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good, and it arrived in a very short time without any kinds of delay, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> this is more appropriately used as a supplement to a main clipper.</li>
            <li> Also I like the easy clean up, just run water over the blade and push the two buttons on each side to clean the inside and your done.</li>
            <li> this trimmer/hair cutter cuts very easily and quietly compared to others I own.  </li>
            <li> It does clean out pretty easily, but there&#x27;s got to be a better</li>
            <li> Very nice product, before I bought this, I had tried two of them from other brands and i wasnt satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and we really enjoy the click and clean feature as well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, recharges quickly, and has three attachments that is workable with any length of hair.  </li>
            <li> Also the battery life is exceptional, compared to my old unit (ever after replacing the batteries).</li>
            <li> The blade also pops out for super easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> But we really like this product and after becoming more familiar with it , it got easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> The attachments are very very flimsy, anything more than the slightest pressure and you end up with racing stripes and bald strips.</li>
            <li> Have used it shave my head 3 times now - on the original charge.</li>
            <li> The more I&#x27;ve used it, the better the results have been and the price I paid for it was only a bit more than one trip to the barber shop.</li>
            <li> Anyway worth the price!</li>
            <li> If you ever want to use power supply then you have no choice but to use the supplied DC adapter with the funny tip on top of the USB plug</li>
            <li> I had to stop and clean it three times.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a breeze as well.    </li>
            <li> He trims his beard over the sink and then has to clean up all the trimmings.</li>
            <li> Then you can rinse the head under running water to clean it out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to use a brush to clean it and no dismantling required.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean, even, and</li>
            <li> I also like the pop up head and rinse clean features.  </li>
            <li> I have used it only twice, but so far I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> And clean out the built-up hair....</li>
            <li> Powerful and easy to run.</li>
            <li> It cuts very nicely, and stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li> While my experience with the trimmer itself has been good (good battery life, cuts cleanly, doesn&#x27;t tug or yank on hair as you cut, easy to clean), the attatchments have been nothing but frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It recharges easily, holds a charge for a long time, and is what I&#x27;d call a good trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it cuts right through it!</li>
            <li> A little large but does a great job....would have liked a stand for it to come with</li>
            <li> used within its limitations, this is probably good enough for most guys, and certainly a number of notches up from the $10 or $20 clipper/trimmer sets you buy at target or drug stores.</li>
            <li> the blades will also get quite warm, fast, at the higher speed setting.</li>
            <li> Great, well made product in every way, except the blade is too wide for beard trimming</li>
            <li> while it&#x27;s washable under a tap, i recommend also using a spray cleaner and lubricant like andis cool care</li>
            <li> i have been cutting my own hair for a long time and this is the best clippers ever used, and  a great price.  </li>
            <li> Dad always had his own hair cut by a professional.     </li>
            <li> Not the nice clear clam shell you see it in stores with.  </li>
            <li> Preformed well with full charge.</li>
            <li> I have tried different combs sold with this product, they do not have good clock  </li>
            <li> Some of those cool looking body grooming clippers (Phillips, Norelco, Braun, ect) have just 6 height settings, some the guards don&#x27;t even come off so you can mark.</li>
            <li> These clippers are sweet.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this at first, but after a couple of uses this clipper is quite all right.  </li>
            <li> It cuts smooth, fast, and easy</li>
            <li> ; In no way to I intend to contradict other owner/users, but I have had great success in getting warranty parts shipped to me free of charge from both Remington AKA Spectrum Brands as well as another household name in shaving/grooming</li>
            <li> The Remington clippers feel good in the hand, are easy to manipulate and hold in a number of different ways (useful whether you&#x27;re getting your own head or trimming back fur on a dog).  </li>
            <li> Cant really do super tight fancy things, but great for a maintenance free haircut.</li>
            <li> blades are super sharp and the power of the motor is great.</li>
            <li> Love them, would recommend to other looking for a decent priced, but great clippers</li>
            <li> Those who know me may laugh at me having an opinion about hair care - my last \\&quot;good hair day\\</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still on the same charge, now if they only made phone batteries this great!</li>
            <li> They could doubtlessly have been constructed from a material that instills trust in their use instead of mild angst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> QUICK SUMMARY:  </li>
            <li> hair-cutting jobs done quick.    </li>
            <li> You just slide up the switch and you can get your neat edges done quickly.</li>
            <li> They charge quickly</li>
            <li> \\&quot;boost\\&quot; improved things tremendously, but i doubt anyone is going to see the 40 minute usage claim.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers on the market other than a professional model !</li>
            <li> Luckily Remington sells all the combs on their website.</li>
            <li> Holds charge well and charges fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is an OK clipper, I have a better Remington, I only got this because of voltage requirements.</li>
            <li> I would like to give it more stars because when it was working it seemed to do a decent job.  </li>
            <li> I expected was very nice product, I am satisfied with the product, as they offer, pay the right price, I will continue watching deals, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> And when I used it on my eyebrows the plastic guard bent (very easily) and I nearly took a chunk of my eyebrow off.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, long battery life, very easy clean up after usage.  </li>
            <li> With a little more experience, I&#x27;ll be able to competently attach and detach the clipper guides</li>
            <li> With a little more experience, I&#x27;ll be able to competently attach and detach the clipper guides</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very handy that you can keep it plugged in while using it compared to other trimmers that have to be used on a charge.</li>
            <li> At any rate, I have been using shaving and trimming devices for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems like a good idea at first, reducing many attatchments down to just three, but it just doesn&#x27;t work in practice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of this clipper after using it two times and I bought a cordless WAHL that works great and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The clipper length is actually pretty easy to set, and it is nice to have only three of them instead of the dozen or so</li>
            <li> This sounds very convenient and easy, but the fact is that hair gets stuck and bunched up under the plastic guard.    </li>
            <li> This trimmer works great with a long charge life and I really like that it is cordless and rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> For the price this is an excellent trimmer, works well &amp; holds a charge long enough so it doesn&#x27;t have to be charged between every trimming.</li>
            <li> Very durable and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I keep my head trimmed pretty short and have had problems finding a good trimmer that doesn&#x27;t pull until I tried the Remington HC5550.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to use and easy to clean, just wished it had a smaller trimmer as well!</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer for \\&quot;cleaning up\\&quot; in between visits to the barber shop.</li>
            <li> This is one great little haircut trimmer.</li>
            <li> If you are using this as a traditional hair cut device, I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.</li>
            <li> It has good power, although I wish it had just a little more to get really hardcore jobs done, but it will work for all hair types.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this trimmer because it made such a great first impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This unit cuts smoothly and evenly, and holds its charge very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It actually cuts faster than the Wahl did amazingly.</li>
            <li> The price was well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best trimmer I have ever had!&lt;br /&gt;Solid built and massive like a commercial grade trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer/cutter is exceedingly well made, and has a terrifically powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Solid motor and nice blades.</li>
            <li> the batter last and the attachments are so handy.</li>
            <li> Since this is made to be a haircut kit, it does more than just trim beards, but that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve used it for so far.</li>
            <li> There is a turbo button for extra power which comes in handy for those with longer  hair.</li>
            <li> The machine is excellent but the adapter comb arrived broken</li>
            <li> For the price, I find it REALLY worth</li>
            <li> It has a powerful motor also.</li>
            <li> None of the attachments are useful to sculpt a beard.</li>
            <li> It eliminates visiting the barber shop on a more than frequent basis.</li>
            <li> Useful, very convenient, simple sense is good</li>
            <li> and feels more professional</li>
            <li> My 7 year old Remington was needing another twin battery replacement, and being on my last comb for the clipper, it was time to replace what&#x27;s been a great grooming tool for me.  </li>
            <li> If you use it straight, without the attachments, it&#x27;s good enough I suppose.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this razor.</li>
            <li> My hair came out nice and even using the second largest guard.</li>
            <li> Much more powerful than my old one, charges off USB</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> After many years of cutting my husbands beard and hair,this has been the best I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> so far one of the better trimmers i&#x27;ve owned and</li>
            <li> But the awesome thing is that if you are half way done, and the juice does run out (and when it runs out it goes fast, but it goes full speed until it does), just plug into the wall, and your in business again right away, no waiting for it to charge for you to continue, it worked on direct wall power AND on battery.</li>
            <li> I used it to take my longish hair down to 1/4&amp;#34;, and even with the attachment, it zipped through my hair as easily as the professional grade Wahl clippers I have at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For beard trimming, it also did a great job.  </li>
            <li> Right now, as it stands, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Cuts great, cleans easily, no snags or hair pulling...</li>
            <li> I bought Remington vacuum hair cut, it was amazing, but this item Remington HC5550AM Cord/Cordless is not that good as the other one.  </li>
            <li> It recharges easily, cleans up quickly after use and stores easily in soft case to protect it between uses.</li>
            <li> whole product is pretty sturdy feeling, and a good overall weight.  </li>
            <li> Has a lot of good points about it as already stated by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, dose good cuts.</li>
            <li> It should just effortlessly snap on, right?  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> It did start right out of the package well and manages to hold a charge</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have the long-bristle brush from my older pair of clippers that I&#x27;m still using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kind of why I bought the second one, after my first was destroyed.</li>
            <li> It did seem durable and loved most everything else about it but definitely not as versatile as I expected.</li>
            <li> use the plastic guard for other \\&quot;man parts\\&quot;, works pretty good.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve cut my own hair for a long time (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that you can charge these with only a usb, or a regular wall charger.</li>
            <li> I use this thing right-up against my face without those plastic guards and it did the job super fast.</li>
            <li> the comb is too soft and would break easily.</li>
            <li> The device works great for head hair, but far too wide to work on your face.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer had combs made of harder plastic and work great for my beard and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> We have used them to give over 25 haircuts so far and they are running strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to automatically give you the best haircut right out of the box like maybe some of the other reviewers here have expected.  </li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are light and the language resembles English, but it&#x27;s not always in the right syntax to be easily understood unless you&#x27;re very liberal with the interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After two uses, I was happy and comfortable enough with them as replacements that I simply threw the old reliable Wahl away.  </li>
            <li> but I very much appreciate the customer service I received from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I use a kit very much like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Good for shorter hair like mine, but struggles a little through thicker longer hair.</li>
            <li> Efficient, fairy fast speed, long lasting battery, excellent trim feature, stays clean for several uses.</li>
            <li> I might further add: this model is advertised as being able to operate while plugged in to charge.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make a loud buzzing sound like my corded clippers.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that instead of many pieces to keep track of, there are only 3 plastic adjustable attachment combs.  </li>
            <li> I need to go and return on the same place of my head many times.  </li>
            <li> Have been a Remington fan, but will look around better next I&#x27;m purchasing.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the construction.</li>
            <li> The second time I admit I should have known better, but having just purchased the clippers I was keen to give them another chance.</li>
            <li> if those are too pricy, i&#x27;d hazard to say even a mid-range oster or andis would be a better overall cutter.</li>
            <li> note that the product description gives first billing to beard trimming, indicatingit&#x27;s a beard trimmer first, then a haircutter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even able to do the back of my head &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> One of the combs on the large guard was bent right out of the package.</li>
            <li> This is my first cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li> So, it does exactly what it is supposed to be doing, does it well, (and sometimes before I wished I had a loan mower for the hair</li>
            <li> - once you go cordless, there&#x27;s no going back :)</li>
            <li> funny part is product</li>
            <li> However, it now won&#x27;t hold enough charge for more than 15 seconds of use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to be able to charge it while I travel internationally.</li>
            <li> first problem with the attachments occurred the day the trimmer arrived</li>
            <li> It does ok on my head, but forget about using it for facial hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, while it claims to be an all-in-one beard/hair/body trimmer, it is not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have the blade width or sheer horsepower of plug in clippers, so I have to make more repeat passes with it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this since I hadn&#x27;t purchased the \\&quot;Vanilla Ice\\&quot; model, and I was pretty upset.</li>
            <li> One pass on either setting, no sticking, like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> If you take proper care of blades they do not break as many people claim, they are just plastic after all and won&#x27;t withstand a fall while attached.  </li>
            <li> I used this unit today for the first time and</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m kind of careful about it).</li>
            <li> When I charged it for the first time everything was OK on the second time the indicator that was supposed to shine didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Not as solid a machine, but seems to work better to cut hair.</li>
            <li> I found it okay only.</li>
            <li> still works, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to do the same :)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell when it was charged or not at first, heads up, blinks when charging, if it steadies, its charged.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice item as I expected.</li>
            <li> the first trim combs/guard broke the first time I took them on a flight.</li>
            <li> Overall I like the product most of it because of the cordless option</li>
            <li> Works pretty well</li>
            <li> but they never last more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Very well built !</li>
            <li> Then, when I tried to reach the Remington via email they never responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great clippers for the first year, then they are disposable.</li>
            <li> but what good is it if the guides are going to break every few months.</li>
            <li> quality wise, the product seems well built, but i have a few nagging gripes.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s because I was used to my old Remington but preferred the attachments better than on the new one.</li>
            <li> Since it has USB charging, I thought it would be ideal -- less volume and weight in my bag without an extra power adapter.  </li>
            <li> The variable adjustable combs work generally well except that they clog with hair easily</li>
            <li> This is a full-sized trimmer and is far too large for beard trimming or anything detailed.  </li>
            <li> I own or have owned nose hair trimmers, electric razors, and other hair and body trimmers.  </li>
            <li> For trimming hair and etc it may work just fine, but for beards and other fine trimming do not use this product.</li>
            <li> Without a tapered attachment, it&#x27;s hard to get the kind of easy control you&#x27;d want, unless you like the look of absolutely uniform</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve said it above, but I&#x27;m really excited about the USB charging capability!</li>
            <li> It arived a day earlier than expected and it woks great.</li>
            <li> The cordless operation is seemed good but it can only last around 40mins.</li>
            <li> This thing does even better and gives me a 1 o&#x27;clock shadow all week long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am also pleased that it is designed for use on both regular hair and facial hair, as I confirmed on the Remington website and in the video advertisement on the Amazon product page.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fully satisfied with this product, as for now, time will show for how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are great for haircuts, assuming that the guard doesn&#x27;t break as mine did and several other commenters have noted as well.</li>
            <li> Has guard that lets you cut leaving hair long than most clippers.</li>
            <li> I pretty much always use them in boost mode.</li>
            <li> Has many features, and much easier to clean than my previous Sharper Image groomer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good or not, I haven&#x27;t even turned it on, because the product I received wasn&#x27;t new, but refurbished!!!&lt;br /&gt;Oil was leaking from the blade, covering half of it.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of the non-turbo model, it was way more solid and reliable.</li>
            <li> I love this thing the only issue it has , is the blades pop out to clean and the blades are constantly popping out while I cut my hair</li>
            <li> Buzzer runs quiet and is easy to wash and maintain.</li>
            <li> Remington makes it easy for the Mrs. to trim - it comes with 15 length settings with 3 different snap-on combs.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this a nice, compact size, but because it&#x27;s both precise enough for beard trimming and powerful enough for head-shaving, it&#x27;s allowed me to leave two devices at home, and just bring this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plastic power switch turns on easy enough, but requires two hands to turn off because there is no grip to</li>
            <li> I keep my hair fairly short, and find this easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is too big to use easily as a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable combs make this easy enough, although they will move if pressed.</li>
            <li> So easy to screw up -- like I did and cut too short.</li>
            <li> Only thing that I would change is to be able to adjusts the smaller comb like you can on the larger ones...makes it more difficult to trim a mustache without having one of the combs going into my nose...other than that, it is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion it is tool large to put in a travel kit even though it is powered by rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t blame the gadget for my inability to cut my own hair with a trimmer, nor can I blame the gadget for the mess it made in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It worked great, up until now, less than two years later.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s amazing they send you the new set before you have sent back the old one...</li>
            <li> Flexing was abundant with little force applied.</li>
            <li> Works well with the variable settings available, especially for hair trimming, but as others have noted, it&#x27;s a bit large for beard and moustache trimming.</li>
            <li> this can not trim beards, there is no small settings or attachments and it is a very large trimmer.</li>
            <li> This thing is huge, has a lot of power and is way too big for your face.</li>
            <li> but it feels really like cheap plastic, especially the accessories .</li>
            <li> They call this a beard trimmer but it should really lose that classification.  </li>
            <li> Cheap bag, the combs don&#x27;t work well, and it needs a boost because just trimming my short beard caused it to jam up with hair!  </li>
            <li> This groomer/trimmer device works very well.</li>
            <li> so much I looked for another Remington product to replace it.</li>
            <li> Nor is it a really close beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> Customer is responsible for return shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of this is a real indication as to quality, but it should stand as some manner of guidepost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yeah, the trimmer works very well</li>
            <li> and I really like the cordless operation aspect -</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t radiate heat like my corded clippers, which get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The only light it has shows that it is plugged-in, but you can&#x27;t tell when the charge cycle is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging is very convenient, you can plug it into the wall or any USB jack.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a highly recommended hair-cutting kit!</li>
            <li> Remington makes one that works very well.    </li>
            <li> So you wind up having to cut your hair very CAREFULLY.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The real selling point of this clipper is the cordless feature.  </li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> and I really like the heft and feel of this cordless trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The staff at Remington really know how to make a user-friendly trimmer.</li>
            <li> It makes cleaning the blade much easier.</li>
            <li> USB Charging option is unusual, but I guess if you&#x27;re travelling, it would be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems very durable.  </li>
            <li> at $35, i don&#x27;t feel i have much to complain about.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving my head and this thing really cuts it away.</li>
            <li> The second cut, a bit shorter than desired, was smooth and there wasn&#x27;t any pulling.  </li>
            <li> but they do work very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the adjustable heads.</li>
            <li> and I get a very inconsistent cut...  </li>
            <li> you cant really see the quality</li>
            <li> I would really like a number 0.5 head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is to shave your head with and also if you have as much hair on your face as you do with your head, then this will work out, because you are haircutting.</li>
            <li> So much easier to cut my boys hair</li>
            <li> I do wish that it had a light that showed when it was charged or when it was low.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will see much use at my place.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Battery holds a charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain about&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> They sent a unit that battery charge does not charge to green...is always in amber and discharge very rapidly( one session of around 10 minutes).</li>
            <li> about 6 times to do my whole head and face.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all that was involved in the transaction, including the delivery.</li>
            <li> Be gentle putting them on and taking them off.</li>
            <li> works better then expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made and appears to be a very solidly-built product.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I had never seen one in person and really wish I had.</li>
            <li> It does that well, but considering how this clipper is marketed, I can&#x27;t really reccomend it.</li>
            <li> It works and cuts very well.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, better than expected.</li>
            <li> They have worked out very well.</li>
            <li> The HC 5550 cuts really well</li>
            <li> Especially like its corded and cord free feature.</li>
            <li> I used it on my whole head once a week (number 3).</li>
            <li> Then you get a really close trim.</li>
            <li> But amazon.com was very helped, fast, and covered the shipping cost of the return.</li>
            <li> and I can this tell is one is much worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never know what is the real length</li>
            <li> This product cuts hair very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I SAVED SO MUCH MONEY</li>
            <li> Shipped extremely fast</li>
            <li> My sons really like this</li>
            <li> , it seems very sturdy</li>
            <li> Haircut\\&quot; is a real misnomer.  </li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and well protected.</li>
            <li> thanks .</li>
            <li> very satisfied-good product</li>
            <li> This trimmer/shaver works very well,</li>
            <li> If you try to use this on battery power alone the power is very week and won&#x27;t cut your hair</li>
            <li> but i dont recommend it to any one who wants to trim beard ..</li>
            <li> On this trimmer I used the lowest setting and that only kind of works -- the combs are just way too big.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase, the first was 3 years ago, from leaving it in the shower stall the full time,</li>
            <li> Whoever design it looked at only the handle shape and button..which looks nice but only on store</li>
            <li> Luckily, his hair has grown back some before the first day of school.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and active.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to use with no guard as long as you manage the temperature of it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and long battery life.</li>
            <li> The fact that you can open it up and run it under water to clean it out is very convenient.</li>
            <li> this reason, I&#x27;d say this product is better for use on other people than for do-it-yourself types when it comes to haircuts --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Remington cordless twice, both times after leaving it plugged in for the full 14+ hours to give it as much time to be fully charged as possible.  </li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, I was concerned it might be underpowered because it was so quiet, but turns out it&#x27;s plenty powerful with the added bonus of not sounding like a lawnmower.  </li>
            <li> but I need a pair of clippers to do my line and clean my facial hair up</li>
            <li> And it always works really well (considering the above mentioned quality of hair - wire-like and full).</li>
            <li> and you have to back off to clean.  </li>
            <li> My main use for it was to do a close trim of my whole body, including head and face.</li>
            <li> You can clean it like an electric razor - open the cutter part and wash it under the sink.</li>
            <li> the positive side, the charge capacity lasted through the first botched cut and the second cut to fix the first one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s easy to use, it has a lot of heads to choose from, it is portable and rechargeable, and when you look at the price of haircuts, it&#x27;s also a common sense choice.</li>
            <li> The attachments are also made from very brittle plastic, so be careful carrying any of them in a bag as they break easily and become unusable.</li>
            <li> Other trimmers by Remington for less money have many more settings for length.  </li>
            <li> Only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I found is that battery takes forever to charge but once its full you can use it for hours</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find much of an increase from the normal setting to the boosted setting, though.</li>
            <li> The guards are far too flexible and butchered my beard and head on the first use.  </li>
            <li> Dropping it now an again from sink top level or even average shoulder level shouldn&#x27;t harm it.  </li>
            <li> I really like being able to flick open the blade to simple wash the blades and drive mechanism.  </li>
            <li> One full charge usually last me about two to three cuts.  </li>
            <li> So far it is more powerful than my old corded model, so much so that I can cut my hair in less time.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good little man groomer look no further.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love my new clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to be incredibly careful with the guides this time knowing how easily they can break</li>
            <li> When it worked, it lacked the power of a typical shaver, although it seemed to cut okay.  </li>
            <li> Good for close cutting on neck, but grooming attachments are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I am a follically challenged man who has been cutting his own hair for many years now.</li>
            <li> main problem is with the comb attachments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Click-N-Wash blade system is one of the main reasons why I bought this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you don&#x27;t use the guides at all it would be a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s cordless, it&#x27;s way easier to use than my older plug in type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m used to the standard clipper kit with hardened plastic guards, but I would also expect a bit more resistance from these especially considering those stubborn under chin beard hairs.  </li>
            <li> A decent set of clippers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably quiet and does its job quickly.</li>
            <li> Used this on my father for a haircut and compared to a quite older model of Remington&#x27;s corded unit, this one pales in comparison.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this was to replace the Wahl brand hair trimmer that I had used for over five years.</li>
            <li> Its motor is stronger than my Philips Norelco clippers that I had before this (don&#x27;t know the model off-hand, but it was a slightly older one).</li>
            <li> It cut the hair alright, the main issue I had was that cut hair kept getting building up between the blade and body of the machine.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch malfunctioned after a couple of months use - (had to flick back and forth many times to turn off), then the battery simply died after almost 2 years.</li>
            <li> main issues with it</li>
            <li> powerful enough, but the length was not controlled very well</li>
            <li> My husband says it runs very smoothly but that, since it&#x27;s not strictly a beard trimmer, it has no receptacle to catch the little hairs that are trimmed from his beard.</li>
            <li> But if you do relative short cuts, and/or tapered cuts, or even love those high and tights, this Trimmer will do the job quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why USB charging was thought to be a good idea, are people really in a situation ever where they need to trim their hair and they have access to USB power but not a regular outlet?</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product is really of high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you cut hair at home, I highly recommend this Remington.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> imo, this is a good travel companion for grooming, touch ups, and the occasional buzz, but not heavy duty enough to warrant being your only choice or even your number 1 choice.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many different brands of Haircut and beard trimmers before that always fell flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Indeed, it is a little bit more difficult, compared to other models, say Philips, to clean hair out of comb, but If you&#x27;re handy enough to make a self haircut, cleaning hair is nothing to you, be handy till the end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (\\&quot;Boost\\&quot; makes the clippers a little noisier and it discharges the battery more</li>
            <li> I use it on my moustache and eyebrows and we&#x27;ve used it on the family dog as well - the blades wash easily and seem to have stayed perfectly sharp.</li>
            <li> other complaints said that the guards bend too easily when you&#x27;re pressing...</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper and I disagree with the other reviews that say it is not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> sometimes the hard way, how good quality tools really make a big difference.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older version of this with the new one.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s also used this as a beard trimmer and says that it&#x27;s much easier to use than his old model.  </li>
            <li> I was actually skeptical about this product when I read the reviews, but this thing works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> The ones that were needed most for me trimming needs broke on transport without any heavy jostling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery has plenty of juice for just doing my head and on the normal speed setting I would say it lasts from 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely well worth the money, and lives up to the remington name.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money but, as one reviewer noted, the shortest length isn&#x27;t all that short and I keep having to replace them.  </li>
            <li> It seemed ok from the add, but it turned out to be too bulky and heavy.</li>
            <li> I deducted a star because the vibrating blade was not properly adjusted so was not cutting close.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it and would likely buy another one....</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t toss it around, and continuously drop it, it seems plenty durable for normal home use.  </li>
            <li> You cannot turn on and operate the clipper with the normal usb cable.</li>
            <li> Does a good, not great job.</li>
            <li> Unlike other hair trimmers in this price range, these&lt;br /&gt;clippers are more heavy duty and cut smoothly.</li>
            <li> We hope to get it right next haircut</li>
            <li> The big comb broke right away</li>
            <li> it is ok it is not strong</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the trimmer but a bald patch on the top of my son&#x27;s head!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000LNB8HK Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades]], or any other brand you like, following a quick burst of compressed air to get all the hair particles out from under the blade head.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tested to see how long the battery lasts or how hot the blades will finally get while on full boost mode, but if i do, i&#x27;ll update this review.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades, smooth cut.</li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t make a tapered comb (for trimming around your ears) for this product (and none of their other tapers will fit).</li>
            <li> I actually use this to cut my own hair and after some practice I can now cut my hair and as little as 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and carved a nice little racing stipe into my noggin and had to cut the rest of my head short to even it</li>
            <li> The first and most important thing a trimmer ought to do is cut hair without yanking or pulling it, and without scratching or cutting me.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really move it all the way down until you clean it...and cleaning...</li>
            <li> so I decided to refresh with a new cordless haircut kit.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I have a new found respect for Remington on this thing, as an engineer, congrats to the engineers that designed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing a new trimmer from another manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, its new and I&#x27;m hoping with use it does not change how it works.  </li>
            <li> The new one doesnt have that</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use the new unit for that again.  </li>
            <li> I opened the new trimmer set and again, NO BLADE GUARD.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as new, but it didn&#x27;t came in the Manufacturer Package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to always check this, because I have burned out a few motors on trimmers designed for use on hair alone by also using them on beards, which are much tougher to cut.</li>
            <li> Better handle, better cutting.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the blade width is pretty wide for use on the face.  </li>
            <li> I thought the USB thing was a bit strange at first and got some jokes from the family about downloading haircuts, but really i just use it with no guard in the shower twice a week.  </li>
            <li> However, given foreknowledge of the purported fragility of the attachments relative to the robustness of the trimmer/cutter, I suspect that I would use lots of care using the attachments;...and it is not unlikely that I would use them without fanfare and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> But unless you plan to shave the head completely, this product just doesn&#x27;t have the power you&#x27;ll need for a normal hair cut.    </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The combs are cheaply made which make this trimmer average.</li>
            <li> Second, it cuts very well!  </li>
            <li> The boost setting runs like my old trimmer does normally.  </li>
            <li> But that seems rather pointless when I&#x27;m sure there are models out there that will do both well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an opinion on the combs/guards as I haven&#x27;t and likely won&#x27;t use them - though I will say they seem fairly sturdy and they were reasonably well-packaged in my purchase, so those experiencing broken or bent guards ought to be in the minority.</li>
            <li> So I kept using the old pair, returned the new (and the replacement new pair when we thought we might have just had a defective set), and went about our merry way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super high powered like the clippers they use at the salon, so you will most likely have to finish off your sideburns with a razor.</li>
            <li> The guards for this product are cheap plastic and are not very accurate.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that it really cuts well, and the guides are fairly decent for maintaining a specific length.</li>
            <li> After using other product I found Remington HC5550 very convenient and practical with the right price it is</li>
            <li> My old Remington razor finally bit the big one after 10 years of almost daily use (I&#x27;m bald on top, but still have plenty of activity on the sides.</li>
            <li> VERY sharp and precise during hair trimming.</li>
            <li> They couldn&#x27;t send just the guard to me but emailed me a label print to attach to the box and immediately sent me a new trimmer (I think I was given a whole month to send the first one back, but I sent it out the next day).</li>
            <li> Fortunately with this razor which I have had for about a year and a half now, that is not an issue.</li>
            <li> I have little doubt that it will last a good long while.</li>
            <li> After that I was so proud of my newly acquired cutting skills</li>
            <li> the cool care spray or similar will also have the added benefit of cooling down the blades halfway through a cut if they get hot.</li>
            <li> I suppose that would be great if you had a really big head since it makes trimming go much faster due to a very wide (too wide, IMO) blade, or wanted to shear sheep all day.</li>
            <li> The three heads aren&#x27;t all that inspiring either, we&#x27;ve had less expensive kits do a whole lot better.    </li>
            <li> I cannot attest to the battery life, because I just keep it plugged in between uses, but it certainly has enough juice to complete at least one haircut, and probably many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> blade is sharp and it isn&#x27;t super loud.  </li>
            <li> this is because while the aforementioned titanium coated blades are sharp, the motor doesn&#x27;t seem particularly strong.</li>
            <li> This Remington not only has a large enough blade and enough power to buzz my head nearly smooth, it additionally: has two power settings; charges via USB(!)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bog down like the other cheap retail ones, it plows right through.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This looks like a well made unit, and may be great for cutting hair, but I bought it as a beard trimmer, and it is not at all well suited for that.  </li>
            <li> are huge gaps in between the plastic blades on the attachment, which leaves uneven lines.</li>
            <li> The cordless aspect is great and if the battery dies during a cut you can just plug it in with the recharging cord and keep cutting.</li>
            <li> The unit comes with a bottle of oil and the instructions clearly state that oiling is part of the blade maintenance.</li>
            <li> My 12 years old Oster broke</li>
            <li> My old Remington cut it all until the day it croaked).</li>
            <li> I cannot really speak to this issue as I have only peered at the faux chrome &#x27;plated&#x27; items through their packaging, and</li>
            <li> What I can state with some degree of certainty is that they do not seem to anywhere near the quality of the trimmer/</li>
            <li> the record, the basic trimmer/cutter works very well to trim hair.</li>
            <li> I have used a corded Wahl for a while now, but have wanted a cordless* since it&#x27;s not always practical for me to use it near an outlet.</li>
            <li> This is what the manufacturer says about the Remington HC5550AM professional Cord/cordless rechargeable haircut kit with turbo boost:    </li>
            <li> Remington HC5550AM Professional Cord/cordless Rechargeable Beard Trimmer and Haircut Kit with Turbo</li>
            <li> Plug it in after giving a hair cut and it&#x27;s ready for the next use.  </li>
            <li> I really like the lightweight, cordless, cool-to-the-touch, quiet features of these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I really like the lightweight, cordless, cool-to-the-touch, quiet features of these clippers.  </li>
            <li> Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]] that I purchased 9 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I always have to be near a power outlet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;  and a fixed stubble comb that cuts 1/16 inch&lt;</li>
            <li> The neat thing about this clipper is that it has a lot of extra features that really help you get</li>
            <li> We just purchased this because we had an old Remington that no longer charged.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it looks very used.</li>
            <li> It will take a long time to charge the first time as stated in the instructions (read them).  </li>
            <li> It was unexpected.</li>
            <li> Use it directly on my scalp without the attachment</li>
            <li> It charges well and the batteries are capable of holding enough charge to use it for atleast an hour.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to change blade guards to frequently to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Now I have a grandson and a Remington Rechargeable Professional Cordless Haircut Kit.</li>
            <li> Thanks Regington for making such affordable device!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m located overseas and mistakenly trusted that the product shipment would be complete.</li>
            <li> It is really convenient to use though especially since it&#x27;s cordless and can even be charged via USB!</li>
            <li> The fact that it doubled as a hair trimmer sealed the deal, since I was also looking for something to replace my old Wahl.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it once</li>
            <li> but so far no problems.  </li>
            <li> normally do not waste my time writing about things i bought..</li>
            <li> Not even from the direct manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few trimmer I&#x27;ve used that te attachments fit snugly</li>
            <li> I thought the light was supposed to turn green or something, guess not .</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really do haircut if you have a very short hair.</li>
            <li> the brushes on the head are soft on scalp as you trim.</li>
            <li> At this price point, it&#x27;d only take two hair cuts for the unit to pay for itself in this area, so you&#x27;re definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The manufacturers would have been better off just making a few extra single-depth attachments that don&#x27;t collect trimmed hair.</li>
            <li> bought this one after reading the reviews carefully and there you go its actually worth my money.</li>
            <li> It only is recharged through the socket, but if it can&#x27;t hold a charge than you can&#x27;t use it for more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> but honestly I&#x27;d rather use my old clippers that were broken than use this again.</li>
            <li> good price, not very ease to clean hair from cutting blades</li>
            <li> Very nice for trimming the beard and cutting hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to keep all of the mess in the shower and just rinse it all down the drain.</li>
            <li> However, I hope that I have added some useful data that I did not see in other reviewers&#x27; remarks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item is pretty much as advertised, however I have found it to be a lot heavier, as well as a lot bigger, than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I am not THAT old, but only suffered having to shave while still in junior high school.</li>
            <li> Such a easy, quiet unit to use; within a short space of time my facial hair was trimmed to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> My charging indicator light always stays red when plugged in and never turns green like other devices do when their charge is full.</li>
            <li> The only real caveat here is that the trimmer/cutter most assuredly does not cut down to the level of a dedicated shaver, nor does it cut as close to the skin as some other beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> I have had many different trimmers in the past...</li>
            <li> another model shown in the video promo seems to actually show the time left on the charge, but i couldn&#x27;t find a higher end model than this for sale.</li>
            <li> I used to have older Remington model for years and it would last even longer, but it broke when I dropped it.</li>
            <li> HC550, first one the battery finally gave up after 2 years of regular use.  </li>
            <li> Ironically enough, I only caught my skin once when I first tried it</li>
            <li> Ive only used this once, but it worked like a charm, has high quality components.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that it can heat up to high temperatures when in turbo boost mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An use haircut high price but low quality.</li>
            <li> only option is to buy replacement guides directly from Remington for a steep price or buy a new trimmer.....</li>
            <li> the major design flaw of this product is that the teeth flex leaving you with lines and bald spots allover!</li>
            <li> Not very heavy for beard and mustache trimming.  </li>
            <li> and my beard looks the same as if I used the normal mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few years ago it started to become increasingly clear that it was time to replace them, the blades were no longer as sharp, nor were they as nicely secured in their positions, which meant that now and again the clippers would bite just enough to hurt.  </li>
            <li> boys hair cuts...there aren&#x27;t all the different attachments like normal clippers...</li>
            <li> Almost nothing is intuitive, and as near a I&#x27;ve been able to  adjust the various guides, I am forced to trim my beard either at &amp;#34;longer than I want&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Did</li>
            <li> One of the teeth on the only attachment I use (it goes from #3 to #21) snapped off from the pressure of the tight fit in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> The first is the adjustable length guides bend with only slight pressure so as you are using it you get variable length cuts depending on how much force you exert.  </li>
            <li> The cumbs can&#x27;t be replaced, they are easy to break but hard to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought cheaper trimmers that only lasted a few months.&lt;br /&gt;So as long as you are OK with a comb that will have to be replaced frequently</li>
            <li> I am a male and I only needed to write down for numbers; one for the front, One for the top, One for the back and one for the sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I called Remington, got through to customer service with no hold time whatsoever and after briefly explaining the situation they offered to send me a new one and a return shipping label to return my dieing clippers with the receipt from my order history in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean cutting</li>
            <li> This unit is heavy duty and does an excellent job of cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> The last pair didn&#x27;t last at all or cut the hair very well.</li>
            <li> especially like the Turbo Boost (which I have on constantly while cutting), the attached hair texturizor, titanium coated blade, and the SUPER handy Click N&#x27; Wash option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a guy that cuts his own hair (buzz cut), I have experimented with several trimmers and was regularly annoyed by the cord getting in my way.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and smooth cutting.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I received a refurbished item or what, but it wasn&#x27;t in original packaging.  </li>
            <li> I can only charge mine using a computer or another USB based charger (currently using iPAD 12w charger) which isn&#x27;t big enough to give it full charging speed as it is only 1.2A not 1.5A like the stock</li>
            <li> The clippers have a tiny brush for cleaning, but they really need to come with a long-bristled brush to clear out hair bunches stuck in the clipper guides, and to flick hair off the victim&#x27;s neck.  </li>
            <li> My finicky older son reported only once where the clippers pulled at his hair rather than sheer his hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually, this kind of&lt;br /&gt;trimmer feels a little flimsy and I&#x27;m always worried that the head&lt;br /&gt;attachments are going to bread; they often do.</li>
            <li> it feels better constructed than competitive brands at the same price point, it is larger and heavier than other brands i&#x27;ve owned, the actual blades give a more comfortable cut, it remains to be seen if they stay sharp, this seems to be where all the other brands fall down, the blades become dull or even a bit rusty.</li>
            <li> I generally just plug it into my phone charger, so charging couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li> You will have to take off the attachment and clear the stuffed hair several times during the hair cut.</li>
            <li> addition, there are two additional money back offers and guarantees.</li>
            <li> So my advise is that if you&#x27;re a professional hair dresser, you probably want to go with something else but for sporadic household use (weekly usage not daily usage), you can&#x27;t beat these clippers!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would you recommend this product to youth, adults and especially mothers with young children.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint is that there aren&#x27;t more short size combs to choose from.</li>
            <li> Apparently Remington has hired a Vice President in Charge of Screwing Things Up as there is virtually nothing I like about this device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> They break constantly and the wall charger is faulty (they frequently die).  </li>
            <li> I have used old version of Remington for last 7 years.</li>
            <li> The stubble attachment is the most poorly designed attachment I&#x27;ve seen, considering its intended use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for beard cutting though.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s easy enough, especially since this is so small and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only complaint is easy to hit button that causes guard to slip while in use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than other clippers i&#x27;ve used, and there were no pulled hairs in the whole process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont use it much, but when I do, it does not pull hair like other machines doo</li>
            <li> The integrated Pro Power Motor gives you a cutting performance that&#x27;s twice as fast and its self-sharpening Titanium-coated blades are scientifically proven to cut significantly more hair with every stroke--saving you both time and effort.     </li>
            <li> love that its cordless, makes cutting my sons hair soo much easier.</li>
            <li> The thin wispy hairs on top of his head don&#x27;t get cut at all, and I have to go back with scissors.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much about them -- which is to say that they did their job, and with proper maintenance they did their job well and for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> In the end I had to use my old trimmer that has flat solid guides to fix my patchy haircut from this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> nothing much to complain about except for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smaller trimmer to trim mustaches and other parts of beards.</li>
            <li> There is only a bare shaver (about 0.2mm), and a number 1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how long it holds a charge.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people saying lots of things and apparently folks who buy lots of different clippers.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasted plenty long to complete my cut.  </li>
            <li> The attachment work pretty well (though they seem to break if you are a bit heavy handed like me)</li>
            <li> They are powerful enough, and include a button to boost the same when you need a little extra clipping power.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed White and Black, and because of the way the combs are designed - with a significant gap between them and the blade - my hair bunched up, meaning that I had to stop every 5 or so seconds to empty it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the adjustable combs that came with the new clipper, but they align and work just fine.  </li>
            <li> The product looks cheap, doesn&#x27;t hold charge that well and in general functions poorly.</li>
            <li> as far a the guards go, they are either too long or too short.</li>
            <li> Given this, i&#x27;m not sure how useful this would be as a groomer for facial hair, given the contours of a face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is exactly the heavy duty, going to last a while, gets the job done razor that we have been looking for.</li>
            <li> its good for cutting long hairs like the barbers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cost of a single replacement comb is over $11 (including shipping charge), which is almost 1/2 of the price of the complete kit (trimmer, combs, charger)</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time, I&#x27;ve only had it 3 weeks so far and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since the initial charge.  </li>
            <li> however, if you want a full fledged clipper to do an entire head or thick or coarse hair, i&#x27;d go with a \\&quot;real\\&quot; clipper set, like an oster 76 (corded), or andis bgr or voguers max pro (both cordless).</li>
            <li> Decent, but not worth the price for the flimsy attachments.</li>
            <li> :  large size, heavy weight,</li>
            <li> The dual way to charge (outlet or usb) is a little unusual, but I can see how that&#x27;d be beneficial for someone traveling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simply write down the number setting to a particular attachment and go to town.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work for long went dull quickly or didn&#x27;t have a lot of power to begin with.</li>
            <li> Where I&#x27;d may several passes with the old clipper before there was no more hair being clipped, the new is done after two passes.  </li>
            <li> He has a thick, coarse beard and it cuts right through it with no problem.</li>
            <li> Their consumer goods and power tools also rank right at the top of their industry.</li>
            <li> This is very hard to clean, bulky.</li>
            <li> the battery lasted plenty long enough and was powerful enough to cut my extremely thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what we want it to (shave his entire head and beard) in half of the time that some of the other products we have bought used to.</li>
            <li> Pretty quiet, but hard to tell when charge is running low as it sounds \\&quot;under-powered\\&quot; even when fully charged.</li>
            <li> I could get past the large physical size of it with some practice, but the guide design makes me want to pitch it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> The Remington HC5550 Hair Clipper puts professional power into your hands with a clipper scientifically proven to give you double the speed and double the performance of Remington&#x27;s previous models.</li>
            <li> Trying to trim my upper lip results in having the extra long plastic blade guard jabbed up my nose.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure the micro usb connection end closest to the shavers base</li>
            <li> The manual provided is very bare minimal.</li>
            <li> At first I found the heads hard to change until I located the release button.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t understand why you needed to press that hard in the first place?</li>
            <li> The Wahl makes very little noise; whereas the Remington clippers are very noisy.  </li>
            <li> Not as thin as expected and blade get heat up very quickly</li>
            <li> So, for Asian and Europe buyer, be aware that you need step down transformer to use this little clipper as the supplied DC adapter is for 110v 60hz input with 3.2V 1.5A output.</li>
            <li> The assembly is very sturdy and the vibrations your hands feel aren&#x27;t excessive.  </li>
            <li> Shaver works well one charge last a long time but the trimming beard adapters don&#x27;t keep the hair in place when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> The charge that it arrived with lasted long enough for the item to not be eligible for return.  </li>
            <li> There are one missing part (Blade Gaurd &amp;#34;F&amp;#34;) and a broken part (Stubble comb &amp;#34;A&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if the little black bits were plastic or old hairs, but regardless, the product was already oiled inside, so I wonder if it were actually new.  </li>
            <li> But i was very dissapaointed to discover that it trims very unevenly with patches.</li>
            <li> The turbo boost is really not even needed for my hair, and I have thick hair, but It may come in handy for people with lots of REALLY thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> I can hold it up against in my head for the whole cut (I shave my entire head) without having to press as hard as it needs to be pressed to bend in any way that would make a difference to the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing works, it cut my hair</li>
            <li> I also mean that once you&#x27;ve finished the task of shaving all your hair off, it&#x27;s pretty gunked up</li>
            <li> Power does not last very long 3-4 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> In fact it makes me feel like a plucked chicken and puts me in a sucky mood for the entire day, something about my face being smooth and silky that I just don&#x27;t like!  </li>
            <li> This means any irregularity on your head that isn&#x27;t wide enough to span the entire width of the attachment may result in bald patch (no matter the setting).</li>
            <li> My husband was not happy with the way I cut his hair but next time he will know exactly where to set the comb for the proper adjustment.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered the remington MB200 that i already had and works fine; just thought i might upgrade to something &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; but wrong.</li>
            <li> You can tell straight out of the box that it is well made and not cheap or flimsy like some of the other ones you might see.</li>
            <li> It still had a cord and only one cutting attachment, but more safety features that limited the pain factor.</li>
            <li> Little loud though.</li>
            <li> (I used to get this complaint several times with our older, corded clippers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enough power to cut through my older son&#x27;s thick hair, even without the \\&quot;Boost\\</li>
            <li> My husband has very little hair on top, just thin wisps.  </li>
            <li> This product is more about cutting your hair or if you have a relatively long beard.</li>
            <li> I like the flexibility of no cord and the rechargeable battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> long before i cut it.</li>
            <li> It has a long battery time..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I should have wrapped this product review up long before now.</li>
            <li> And the guides are flexible enough that it&#x27;s harder to accidentally jab the scalp of the one you&#x27;re giving a hair cut</li>
            <li> There is no light indicator showing when the charging cycle is complete.  </li>
            <li> He likes it cut to be about 3/8 of an inch long.  </li>
            <li> razor also has three adjustable guards:  a long comb that adjusts from 1 inch to 1 3/4 inches&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a long searching for a trimmer, choosing between Braun Cruzer, Philips Norelco, Wahls and Panasonics, this Remington was the jackpot.</li>
            <li> The charge seems to hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> The plastic adjustable attachments are very fragile so be careful</li>
            <li> He enjoys the cordless feature and it holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for my beard trimmer, but it turns out that it is nearly as wide as regular barber clippers.  </li>
            <li> about 1/2 plus inches long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also takes a long time to charge and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Forget even using the smallest attachment as it will still leave your hair way too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cordless one for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not really for facial hair.</li>
            <li> A pity that its only 110V, when travelling a transformer is needed</li>
            <li> It has lasted the test of time and is still keeping my facial hair minimal.</li>
            <li> The first was a Wahl model which I thought was worse but now appears to be about the same.  </li>
            <li> It thinned out his thick, course hair very well.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I bought this as both a hair trimmer to cut my hair down as short as possible without shaving, and to also use to groom my goatee.</li>
            <li> The plastic attatchments slide up and down the clipper so each can cut at several different lengths.  </li>
            <li> The shortest length for any of the head attachments provided is still about a half inch, which is too long for my beard, and I think most men except those affecting the lumber jack look (not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that).</li>
            <li> Due to this design flaw, it also cut my hair unevenly, and I had to get my old clippers back out in order to fix the damage.</li>
            <li> For the time I&#x27;d invest in cutting my hair (or even having someone else use it on me), and then cleaning up both the area and the trimmer itself, and then trying to get the whole kit back in the too-small bag, I&#x27;d just as soon pay someone $12 to give me a decent haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the combs are so long and widely spaced that any hair laying flat against the skin doesn&#x27;t get cut.</li>
            <li> For cutting a whole scalp of hair down from shaggy to less than an inch, this trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li> I increased my initial rating due to this.</li>
            <li> It comes with an accessory bag as well to store the other attachments, brush, USB cord, cleaning fluid, etc.    </li>
            <li> So, when I&#x27;m in the states, I can charge it through the wall, but when I&#x27;m traveling, I can plug it into my computer with no fear of damaging the motor due to international voltage</li>
            <li> This thing is small, has a short battery life, and feels kind of awkward to me.</li>
            <li> However, it turns out this trimmer alone is heavier and larger than other trimmers with their power</li>
            <li> Other than that I would and plan to buy another set in the future if I need to replace it.</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical, but has many features.</li>
            <li> The battery is starting to die and unlike other clippers that can be plugged in the wall and draw power through the socket, this one can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This model feels flimsy, the blade speed is not consistent for some reason and it has much less power than my old one.</li>
            <li> But it does not have the precision needed to trim a beard unless you wear a very long beard.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to keep clean, but I like everything else about it.</li>
            <li> I see a few people haven&#x27;t figured out how to adjust the guards different depths with the button on the back.   </li>
            <li> The only issue is that after a few years of use the comb rails break apart...they are very fragile.</li>
            <li> had a loose connection which did not allow this product to work well very long.  </li>
            <li> Since then I haven&#x27;t had a single hair pull or anything (and I did the rest of my head and body).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is a serious design flaw with the attachments; the outer teeth are much heavier than the inner teeth, and therefore less prone to flexing.</li>
            <li> Overall, this was not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The stubble attachment is about 1/4&amp;#34; and the guard on it is so long that you can&#x27;t use it to trim your mustache without the spikey plastic part jammed up your nose.</li>
            <li> However the evident poor craftsmanship makes me doubt if I should buy this one again or even the namebrand.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable guard has a fragile plastic button that is pressed to move it up and down.  </li>
            <li> What I like to do is use a trimmer on my face that will bring it down short even to then use my electric razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to do that with this, you have to use no attachments.</li>
            <li> I especially like the the way the cutting head \\&quot;slides\\&quot; down for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i had high hopes, but sadly this trimmer will join the other trimmers that didn&#x27;t live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> Well, that means I can&#x27;t trim the upper half of my mustache with it at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You basically also cannot use generic DC adapter to power up the clipper as you cannot find the weird USB with the funny tip to slot into the clipper to power it.</li>
            <li> have had them replace the blades once as it broke within a week, but they have all since broken months later and it is only usable bare blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m a little worried about the plastic attachments, they seem to be very fragile - but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily with a little cut tape I&#x27;ve kept this thing in use but even that isn&#x27;t allowing the cord to function properly now</li>
            <li> I bought this hair trimmer because it came with very long attachable guards that other trimmers don&#x27;t offer.</li>
            <li> the titanium coated blades are sharp and can cut through sections of dry or wet hair with ease.</li>
            <li> Overall, great blades, bad attachments, questionable motor.</li>
            <li> But the attachments are the worst I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> These clippers are not what I had expected for the price.   </li>
            <li> either with the included wall cord or any micro USB cable (one was included in my purchase); and allows for a wet rinse of the blades via a pop-out function that distances them from the body/motor/battery.</li>
            <li> Instead, you have to carefully position the clippers into the guard&#x27;s channels so the plastic guard stays in place.</li>
            <li> Comes with a wide assortment of guard sizes.  </li>
            <li> It glides through hair like butter, never getting jammed at all in my experiences.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> but it does not work as expected.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is NOT cheaply made, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a big deal, as i don&#x27;t plan on using it for anything heavy for extended times, but this could matter to you.</li>
            <li> It cuts my hair, just not very well.</li>
            <li> It has the wide mouth is just under 2 inches.</li>
            <li> Remington then tries to charge $4 for a replacement comb, with $6 S&amp;H.</li>
            <li> my hair were cut shorter than I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for only a few months</li>
            <li> final result was that i still had few longer hair</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> LASTS LONGER THAN EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I tried to be careful after that</li>
            <li> end up taking a lot longer than expected....</li>
            <li> DONT get them wet.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet this device is, because I no longer have to explain the fervent vibrating noise coming from behind the bathroom door, like I always had to do when I used my Wahl</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t, for instance, bother cutting with the lower standard speed, and moved right up to \\&quot;boost\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is right, and I don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this at usual wal-mart and charged and ready to use, I slip on the attachment for hair cut and the thing won&#x27;t stay on, there is hardly anything to hold on for the attachment and the clipper, it slips away.</li>
            <li> Might be a little larger than some, but it has lots of combs for haircuts down to beard and sideburn trimming.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t cut as well, the blades would sometimes bind up (even after we&#x27;d take them apart, oil, and put them back together with a little less force on the screws.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all different inputs they split in the middle which is not pleasant for your skin face when you shave a bear</li>
            <li> That being said I would buy another one before any other brand.</li>
            <li> My husband likes his hair cut very short, and it usually gets about 1/2&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like that close shave feeling that other guys like, electric or blade.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I had in mind.</li>
            <li> As for the turbo boost...i&#x27;m not sure if he actually used that feature.  </li>
            <li> I went online to order additional attachment(s) and discovered the were 2 or 3 other attachments included in the kit.</li>
            <li> No more fumbling with a dozen different guides.  </li>
            <li> In the past, other trimmers I&#x27;ve used had 6+ attachements for various lengths.  </li>
            <li> It cuts hair well, but the guard broke after two months (or 8 trims), so it is pretty well useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had different trimmers in the past</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sharp and cuts well...</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL WITH THE GUARDS!  </li>
            <li> tons of blade adjustment settings without having the clutter of dozens of attachments as some other razors do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you can get over the scare factor of using a trimmer without a trim guard to get an extremely close trim, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Need to look at other company now.</li>
            <li> The wife went berserker on my head the other day</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t trade this for any other trimmer in the world.</li>
            <li> I use these every other day to keep head trimmed.</li>
            <li> When I say it&#x27;s messy, I mean it comes with a bag to store everything in, but the bag isn&#x27;t quite big enough to store the trimmer, the guides, and the AC adapter all together at once.</li>
            <li> They work fine for cutting hair all to one length, but previous trimmers I&#x27;ve used have had a tapered attachment that allows you to cut hair very short above the ears and at the base of the neck, while allowing the hair to be progressively longer as you get higher.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a foolproof design of attaching the guides to the clippers -- you have to very careful.  </li>
            <li> when the battery finally goes, you&#x27;ll be left with a thin, fairly short cord attached to a small a/c charger</li>
            <li> It doesnt charge anymore and plug is broken so had to buy new.</li>
            <li> I hate similar products when they feel like they&#x27;re made out of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not forever untangling/untwisting the cord that inevitably would become twisted and kinked as I used the old Wahls.  </li>
            <li> You basically have to use it plugged in to get adequate and reliable cutting power.  </li>
            <li> Heavy weight (but not too heavy) suggests quality components, the rubberized grip, the buttons, lights, etc... and the standard mini-USB charger.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not comfortable using it to give himself a cut or trim, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for someone interested in cutting a family member or friend&#x27;s hair at home.</li>
            <li> - i could see the light not coming on due to the bad connection.  </li>
            <li> It sucks, because the piece that attached to the razor has a space in the middle which means some part of your beard will be ZERO and other</li>
            <li> There really is no right size</li>
            <li> The guards are flimsy plastic and the setting gauge uses a tiny font that is hard to read.  </li>
            <li> Last thing..blade worms so high that it can burn your skin if you try trim bear after cutting your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is that it came in a plain white box with plain black text describing what was inside.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be there are no ear piece attachments...</li>
            <li> absolutely not worth the money, regardless of the price.  </li>
            <li> 3- It is not easy to clean while cutting.</li>
            <li> otherwise, it&#x27;s dark during use.</li>
            <li> I left it plugged in for at least 48 hours after I got it</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the trimmer attachments leave a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> Not useful as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product is not accurrately described and useless for me because the beard trimmer settings are either much too close stuble or your have to leave beard hair length</li>
            <li> At least hair grows back.</li>
            <li> My beard is not that thick, and I was only trimming 1 inch off.  </li>
            <li> Simply not enough power to cope with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace my old broken combs.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to shave around the mouth and under the nose without using a strange angle that in some parts create very short sections of hair and in others completely misses hair.</li>
            <li> I used it once until the battery ran down and now the battery(s) won&#x27;t recharge.  </li>
            <li> In an attempt to cut down on the number of trimmer attachments, the makers of this product provide you with three adjustable trimmer heads.</li>
            <li> &quot; I had the guide set to 12mm and this thing had cut a swath almost down to the skin.</li>
            <li> Two stripes down the side of my head.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the battery run down on me yet.</li>
            <li> The down side is the combs do feel a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> quickly).&lt;br /&gt;- Sharp!  </li>
            <li> (I mean really short cause</li>
            <li> I really believe this very poor performance is purposely designed into the product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lever on the side that slides the bottom plate up and down and provides a slight protection trim</li>
            <li> These comb attachments are virtually worthless; they fall off very easily, and snag small hairs.</li>
            <li> He likes the speed and performance over his previous clipper, as well as ease of use and rubberized gripper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously considering sending it back!</li>
            <li> given them a slight squeeze.</li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t as loud as the Wahl corded, and doesn&#x27;t make my hand numb from vibrations after several minutes.</li>
            <li> I will say that I used to pay $15.00 for a haircut weekly, so this purchase payed for itself in a couple of weeks - no real big deal that it failed a couple of years later.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty disappointed.   </li>
            <li> Shaved off half an eyebrow trying to trim them.  </li>
            <li> and I put the trimmer and the attachments into the provided black bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a cordless, rechargeable beard trimmer that had guards for longer hair length than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> Previous one worked well for 18 months.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a black guy sooooooo yea)</li>
            <li> but its been less than 24 hours since I ordered them).</li>
            <li> But each time, the battery lasted for less and less time, until it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Has a difficult time cutting fine short hair.  </li>
            <li> Very little downward pressure is needed to flex the center of the guard when elevated.  </li>
            <li> Other hair cutting systems took much longer and would overheat.</li>
            <li> No, it was not cool.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington clippers to protect my health and now I am cutting my hair with a pair of first aid kit scissors instead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found they don&#x27;t cut evenly; when I used one of them to clip my head down to a #2 length, it left a sort of striped effect behind.  </li>
            <li> Clean-up is a breeze and there&#x27;s a little pouch to store everything (although I think the bag is a wee bit on the chintzy side, it works).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if other guys feel like that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> not sure if the blade will stays sharp.</li>
            <li> Not without a little Tetris-like puzzle solving, trying to nest everything</li>
            <li> It takes a little time and patience to get a feel for what each setting on the guide combs does.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that bothers me is the weak guides.</li>
            <li> When my brothers were little, my Dad would give them buzz cuts every spring, not because we couldn&#x27;t afford a barber, but because he was a child of the depression and would always rather do something himself than pay for it.</li>
            <li> Did wonder why it came with a little oil bottle as I had read</li>
            <li> it never needed it, but in the manual it says that a little maintenance is required every 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> Put a little pressure on it, the comb will slide inside and ...</li>
            <li> It is just a toy, uneven cut, the plastic heads are to flexible, the battery is too weak and I am now embarrassed to leave my house.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a rookie by no means,  20 years (!) of self haircutting experience with 2 Oster clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very many length settings too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> a miserable mistake, this well designed toy is nothing but a cheap Chinese piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> thinking it&#x27;s going to be a miracle product that will make you capable of cutting hair at home to save some money on cosmetologists or barbers.</li>
            <li> It has several removable, changeable heads for cutting hair at different lengths, and can be used with or without a cord.</li>
            <li> but then again I don&#x27;t take so much time cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> see some reviews complaining about uneven haircuts...</li>
            <li> like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow all day everyday.</li>
            <li> I got this a few days ago and its a keeper.</li>
            <li> I called to report and request the missing parts.</li>
            <li> A few design quibbles keep these clippers from being a 5-star product, though.g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few design quibbles keep these clippers from being a 5-star product, though.</li>
            <li> (I expect it to be green...)</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> I may not have noticed my head was uneven as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It WILL cut your hair unevenly if you use the battery power.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband a few years ago and he loves it.  </li>
            <li> Never ran into any issues or trouble with the battery.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Nice to shave necks and trim beards but terrible for men&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> charge lasts forever too, I charge it after every few haircuts even though there&#x27;s never been any perceptible battery drain when in use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One thing that was missing was a Blade Guard, but I sent a email to Customer Service for one to be sent out.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the attachments are a pain to switch out and are a bit flimsy (one has even broken already).</li>
            <li> Did not come with a case, just a bag that does not fit the accessories nor charger.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all I want to say waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its just purely a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I guess this is so busy people can charge the trimmer from their laptop, but it&#x27;s just weird, and i have trouble imagining anyone ever using it that way.</li>
            <li> They have all held up over time and the only issue I ever had where one failed was due to me dropping it....</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not a good beard trimmer, probably because it&#x27;s too wide for that purpose, leaving the trim rather uneven.</li>
            <li> frustrating thing was that it is actually pretty difficult to trim neatly around ears.</li>
            <li> The attachments are not easy to use and are flimsy.</li>
            <li> A mediocre razor that barely gets the job done.    </li>
            <li> But if you have it plugged in, I would guess it&#x27;s using that power rather than the battery, so even if it&#x27;s not charging at least it wouldn&#x27;t be running the battery down.</li>
            <li> i got this a couple of weeks ago and have used it twice since, to trim stubble and a little touch up trimming for my fairly thick and textured hair.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard, but this cuts through it with little effort.</li>
            <li> This is a key feature I was looking for, but it turns out that description is wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have it in the past.</li>
            <li> I will post the pertinent data here: &amp;#34;Limited Five-Year Warranty.&amp;#34; ...the usual blather..and then &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li> No more extension cords, no dealing with tangled cords.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had grat luck with Remington products in the past.  </li>
            <li> While it seems silly to get excitable about a pair of clippers,sometimes there&#x27;s simple pleasure in having a tool that works, and works well.  </li>
            <li> no more barber visits for me</li>
            <li> NOT FOR BEARDS.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I would be a cut above the rest (pun intended) by ordering online.&lt;br /&gt;Decent machine, not so vulnerable to water and holds charge well.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the beard attachments are a joke.</li>
            <li> The bag is too small so after stuffing the trimmer and the attachments into it, I struggled to zip the bag.</li>
            <li> The guide sticks out so far that you can&#x27;t get the cutting blade closer than 3/8ths of an inch</li>
            <li> A small oversight</li>
            <li> Sorry, my review wasn&#x27;t for that as I&#x27;m not using it for a traditional hair cut.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if it is charging as it should.</li>
            <li> ; as an aspiring minimalist I had an idea that cordless trimmers would necessarily come with a special-purpose charging cord, or a base that would take counter space, or otherwise further clutter my life.</li>
            <li> If you press very hard on the combs they will go down a notch.</li>
            <li> This is designed for your head and is pretty much worthless when trying to trim something like a goatee.  </li>
            <li> It scared the crap out of me the first time I tried it without an attachment.</li>
            <li> I like the adjustable comb height, but the combs are a little weak, take care to avoid breaking them.</li>
            <li> even as u press hard against ur skull.</li>
            <li> hard to use compare to panasonic</li>
            <li> Hard to find guards that thick.</li>
            <li> I have used the Wahl, and wanted a cordless option, just for regularly cutting my head hair short - no guard and set to the shortest length.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t know you&#x27;re out of battery juice until it&#x27;s too late.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain trying to cut hair and also having to contend with a clumsy cord.  </li>
            <li> (so don&#x27;t toss it thinking a usb cord will suffice forever!), but at least the unit can be turned on whilst plugged in.</li>
            <li> the combs are delicate, and break easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The comb settings on the Remington are somewhat confusing and I have to refer to the manual to find which comb to use and what setting number equals the length that I want.  </li>
            <li> But the hair cutting guards only click in increments of 3.</li>
            <li> It also is extremely awkward trying to trim around my ears for the same reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason this loses a star for me is it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; control.</li>
            <li> Not reccomended  for anyone for hair at least.</li>
            <li> I also have a thick bristly beard that murders scissor blades.</li>
            <li> They are made with a flimsy plastic and have all broken within a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair on the sides of his head is fairly thick and wiry.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned it would cut poorly and/or unevenly.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is at all thick, this is not your device.</li>
            <li> Cuts through thick beard hair like butter.</li>
            <li> but in a few weeks they were all broken.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is very small and stows easily.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> so it makes getting the difficult parts around the ear a little hard.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the power of the clippers, but is frustrated that the guides are flawed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, as I was really hoping to do some cord-free hair cutting, but I&#x27;m back to using my Wahl haircutting kit.</li>
            <li> This is a hair trimmer and is not a good beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> This clipper is not good for making a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also the plastic blades (blades may be the wrong word) bend while you are shaving, which leaves again - uneven</li>
            <li> THE BATTERY LIFE STINKS with this one and the other</li>
            <li> Dealing with Remington was not a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> The motor is pathetically weak.</li>
            <li> The guard teeth are weak and are guaranteed to break on you</li>
            <li> It tells you to go two down from what you are cutting hair for thinning.</li>
            <li> About two weeks ago while cutting my son&#x27;s hair on the #15 setting, the attachment mechanism gave way and the attachment slid down the trimmer and fell to the default #3 setting.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;re not supposed to press the combs very hard against your head or body.</li>
            <li> It is tough to buy a set online cause</li>
            <li> Very disappointing you cannot get a replacement only for the comb.</li>
            <li> Cut my sons hair, which is VERY thick...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m tired of using a blade</li>
            <li> Too thin and pliable.  </li>
            <li> I have broken three.</li>
            <li> this is worthless is you keep your hair short.</li>
            <li> To be used as a prize in a game that we play.</li>
            <li> I am deployed in the US Army and bought these because I got tired of lookinh shaggy.</li>
            <li> Battery seems well as I had taken approximately 40 minutes to finish shaving my head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all the hair that got caught between the guide and the blades is to blame, but while cutting the hair on the side of my head</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old trimmer after years of use, decided on this model and have been very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it does the job, but the combs are very weak and easily broken.</li>
            <li> A real duh moment.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comb&#x27;s shape was changed, at last , my hair is very ugly.</li>
            <li> And close to the least expensive!</li>
            <li> This product has a few terrible design flaws that made it cut my hair unevenly.  </li>
            <li> The only con is that you have to charge it for 14 hours (granted you can use it plugged into the wall too) and I hate that it&#x27;s a USB because it wiggles out while you&#x27;re cutting</li>
            <li> Just a little disappointed that the set doesn&#x27;t have a blade guard, as listed in the packing materials.</li>
            <li> However, I have been very disappointed in this hair trimmer for the following reasons...  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, that did not end well for either of us.</li>
            <li> at east that&#x27;s what I think is wrong with it).  </li>
            <li> The guides are difficult to attach to the clippers.  </li>
            <li> The guard piece you attach to the clipper blades when not in use is surprisingly difficult to attach correctly.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t have the power of the Wahl plug in version.    </li>
            <li> This makes it somewhat difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> They would not cut close to the skin and are useless for close trimming.</li>
            <li> Accordingly, I have to use it with the cord which means its cordless feature is almost useless.    </li>
            <li> Also, the on/off switch is somewhat difficult to move.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It has voice like bomb explosion and the same time works nasty.</li>
            <li> That renders the clippers somewhat useless for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;ve been unable to charge the razor.  </li>
            <li> Item was useless in Australia.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my husband has not used it yet.  </li>
            <li> theory once again fails.</li>
            <li> Second, the attatchments are terrible.  </li>
            <li> ; unfortunately Remington does not provide spare  replacement clipper heads and their customer support is NON-EXISTENT</li>
            <li> Sorry Remington.</li>
            <li> and I am sad that Remington stop making them...</li>
            <li> This useless Remington clipper will go to the recycle.</li>
            <li> If you try to solve #2 but keeping it plugged in when you cut your hair the horribly designed USB cord connection will constantly come unplugged on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really disappointment about this item, based on this poor product package, I doubt the quality of product as well.</li>
            <li> but this shaver is ridiculous bad.</li>
            <li> These clippers performed very poorly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t be afraid to at least try it out!!</li>
            <li> I made a terrible mess.</li>
            <li> This one had plenty of power without the turbo feature and it was like a knife cutting through butter.</li>
            <li> The HC5550 cordless/corded razor is all that and a bag of Frito&#x27;s Chili Cheese chips with a cold brew on the side.</li>
            <li> and I used it for cutting my sun&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Would have preferred a built-in hood that could be removed for close cutting.</li>
            <li> parents cutting children&#x27;s hair, or spouses cutting spouses&#x27; hair, for example.</li>
            <li> You have to judge what the setting is when you start cutting.  </li>
            <li> will use it again, but those attachments make it a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> Removing the &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; requires removing the comb, turning the unit off, sliding the cutting assembly away from the body and taking some time to dislodge the clumps that jam there.</li>
            <li> have not used this for cutting hair on the head.</li>
            <li> the way the combs are made just collect the hair and then its stops cutting well</li>
            <li> Still trying to get used to the cutting guards and the number I need.</li>
            <li> There is no solution for this if you are cutting hair longer than 1/8&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I heard an unpleasant \\&quot;GSHHHHRRTTT!\\</li>
            <li> I found that this shaver is terrible complained to Braun or Norelco.</li>
            <li> Impossible to cut hair without leaving stripes.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to it use after that.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The guides are just badly designed.</li>
            <li> I tend to use it without the guides and that has its risks in a bad trim.</li>
            <li> The bad things with this machine are:  </li>
            <li> Bad Vendor</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> However, the comb which has multi clock levels were too bad.</li>
            <li> bad bad bad</li>
            <li> my Honda dual blade mower treats my lawn: mercilessly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Happy Cutting!</li>
            <li> I am truly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reputation of Remmington as a quality shaver, but was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Given the weight of the product, I would hate to drop it and see the comb break.</li>
            <li> a close trim, the attachments are absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, and would not recommend buying this machine.</li>
            <li> The replacements were awful.  </li>
            <li> Worst hair clippers I have used in 15 years!</li>
            <li> What can I say - it&#x27;s disgusting!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying it again, but wouldn&#x27;t call it a horrible device for $25.</li>
            <li> : The worst comb design ever.</li>
            <li> I had to use a shorter one and it came out terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The description states &amp;#34;With its exclusive Click N’ Wash cleaning feature and self-sharpening blades that never need oil, maintenance is a breeze.&amp;#34;  Note the phrase &amp;#34;never need oil&amp;#34;.  This is a key feature I was looking for, but it turns out that description is wrong.  The unit comes with a bottle of oil and the instructions clearly state that oiling is part of the blade maintenance.</li>
            <li> They call this a beard trimmer but it should really lose that classification.  If you like your facial hair trimmed close then you won&#x27;t get it with these trimmers.  I ended up returning the item just for that reason.  It did seem durable and loved most everything else about it but definitely not as versatile as I expected.</li>
            <li> I love this thing the only issue it has , is the blades pop out to clean and the blades are constantly popping out while I cut my hair</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer.  Remington&#x27;s are the best.  I like the flexibility of no cord and the rechargeable battery lasts a long time.  Has a nice cleaning feature too.</li>
            <li> The power adapter is 110v only! It doesn&#x27;t work abroad with a simple mechanical adapter.</li>
            <li> Every thing i nedded for prsonal use.</li>
            <li> Great product! We love it! We have tried so many different brands of Haircut and beard trimmers before that always fell flat. They didn&#x27;t work for long went dull quickly or didn&#x27;t have a lot of power to begin with. This one had plenty of power without the turbo feature and it was like a knife cutting through butter. Not only did it work so well it only took a couple of minutes to do the entire haircut. Other hair cutting systems took much longer and would overheat. I like how versatile it is and we really enjoy the click and clean feature as well.I would highly recommend this product to everyone. My only complaint would be there are no ear piece attachments...so it makes getting the difficult parts around the ear a little hard. That being said I would buy another one before any other brand.</li>
            <li> Good for shorter hair like mine, but struggles a little through thicker longer hair. Buzzer runs quiet and is easy to wash and maintain. The additional pieces attach easily.</li>
            <li> Works great but it is too big to function well as a mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> I used this on my husband and they&#x27;re the best clippers i&#x27;ve ever used. i am not a beautician or anything close. My husband likes his hair cut very short, and it usually gets about 1/2&#x27;&#x27; long before i cut it. with each stroke the hair that collects on the end fall off with great ease and it felt very smooth. It&#x27;s great that you can charge these with only a usb, or a regular wall charger. Great for traveling if need be. Love them, would recommend to other looking for a decent priced, but great clippers</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price..</li>
            <li> This is a easy to use, a snap to clean product. It has a long battery time.. We did have to get online to learn how to cut hair properly to prevent that Larry-curly-moe look.... But we really like this product and after becoming more familiar with it , it got easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars on this product.</li>
            <li> Until my husband convinced me to try and cut his hair, the only time I&#x27;d ever tried was in 5th grade on a friend. Needless to say, that did not end well for either of us. Thankfully, I&#x27;ve had much better luck using this haircut kit. It&#x27;s study in one&#x27;s hand, easy to change between attachments and easy to use. Clean-up is a breeze and there&#x27;s a little pouch to store everything (although I think the bag is a wee bit on the chintzy side, it works). The dual way to charge (outlet or usb) is a little unusual, but I can see how that&#x27;d be beneficial for someone traveling. The only part that&#x27;s been difficult is trimming around his ears, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;ll come with practice. He&#x27;s also used this as a beard trimmer and says that it&#x27;s much easier to use than his old model.  He&#x27;s not comfortable using it to give himself a cut or trim, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for someone interested in cutting a family member or friend&#x27;s hair at home. At this price point, it&#x27;d only take two hair cuts for the unit to pay for itself in this area, so you&#x27;re definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Have used it shave my head 3 times now - on the original charge. The works better than any I have it in the past.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my son-in-law Roberto (who shaves his head), so this review is based on his feedback. He likes the speed and performance over his previous clipper, as well as ease of use and rubberized gripper. Especially likes the click-and-wash system for cleaning.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great, so far. They could have included some instructions though. I see a few people haven&#x27;t figured out how to adjust the guards different depths with the button on the back.   Cut my sons hair, which is VERY thick... and it didn&#x27;t hang up once. What was really great was the texturing/ thinning feature. It thinned out his thick, course hair very well.   Cuts great, cleans easily, no snags or hair pulling... I would recommend this hair clipper/ beard trimmer to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good investment and work very well.</li>
            <li> The Remington HC5550 is a handy device.  Those who know me may laugh at me having an opinion about hair care - my last \\&quot;good hair day\\&quot; was during the Carter Administration - but they also know that I&#x27;m required to maintain \\&quot;Navy Standards\\&quot; and although I may be follicularly challenged, my sparse hair grows at a vigorous rate of speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington makes it easy for the Mrs. to trim - it comes with 15 length settings with 3 different snap-on combs.  The rechargeable cordless aspect is a double bonus - it not only lets Cindy work me over without fighting a cord, it comes with a regular AC charger as well as a USB charger.  So - you can travel with it without carrying extra cords.  I also like the rubberized grip and the fact that the thing is sturdy.  I hate similar products when they feel like they&#x27;re made out of cheap plastic.  The aesthetics of this trimmer are a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some reviews complaining about uneven haircuts... these seem possibly more the fault of the user than the trimmer. I use it on my moustache and eyebrows and we&#x27;ve used it on the family dog as well - the blades wash easily and seem to have stayed perfectly sharp.</li>
            <li> My 12 years old Oster broke so I decided to refresh with a new cordless haircut kit.&lt;br /&gt;What a miserable mistake, this well designed toy is nothing but a cheap Chinese piece of plastic. It is just a toy, uneven cut, the plastic heads are to flexible, the battery is too weak and I am now embarrassed to leave my house.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a rookie by no means,  20 years (!) of self haircutting experience with 2 Oster clippers.&lt;br /&gt;My advice pay double and get the corded Oster, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are not what I had expected for the price.   Cheap bag, the combs don&#x27;t work well, and it needs a boost because just trimming my short beard caused it to jam up with hair!  I had to stop and clean it three times. My beard is not that thick, and I was only trimming 1 inch off.  I&#x27;m seriously considering sending it back!</li>
            <li> This groomer/trimmer device works very well. It does not pull the hair at all.   It&#x27;s great for travelling with its USB port, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about converters.</li>
            <li> My old Remington razor finally bit the big one after 10 years of almost daily use (I&#x27;m bald on top, but still have plenty of activity on the sides. I like to keep that hair as short as possible. I also have a thick bristly beard that murders scissor blades. My old Remington cut it all until the day it croaked). I liked that thang so much I looked for another Remington product to replace it. The HC5550 cordless/corded razor is all that and a bag of Frito&#x27;s Chili Cheese chips with a cold brew on the side. One can even wash the blade surfaces under a faucet. Get Out! The Remington keeps me looking like a bald guy should (take note, you comb-over creepezoids: give it up, buy this thing and never have to worry about checking the windspeed on WeatherBug before venturing out again), all neat and trimmed, and it mows my killer beard like my Honda dual blade mower treats my lawn: mercilessly.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer for \\&quot;cleaning up\\&quot; in between visits to the barber shop. I have found I can even extend the time between trips using this trimmer regularly. Easy to use, easy to clean, and does the job well. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Received this on Jan 17, I use this puppy twice a week and it&#x27;s still on the same charge, now if they only made phone batteries this great!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. The price was well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best trimmer I have ever had!&lt;br /&gt;Solid built and massive like a commercial grade trimmer. I was never a fan of Remington until I got this. It blows away any Norelco or Wahl that I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that close shave feeling that other guys like, electric or blade. In fact it makes me feel like a plucked chicken and puts me in a sucky mood for the entire day, something about my face being smooth and silky that I just don&#x27;t like!  I&#x27;m not sure if other guys feel like that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow all day everyday. This thing does even better and gives me a 1 o&#x27;clock shadow all week long. I use this thing right-up against my face without those plastic guards and it did the job super fast. It doesn&#x27;t bog down like the other cheap retail ones, it plows right through.&lt;br /&gt;I use the plastic guard for other \\&quot;man parts\\&quot;, works pretty good. I got this a few days ago and its a keeper. I have a new found respect for Remington on this thing, as an engineer, congrats to the engineers that designed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin&lt;br /&gt;Scottsdale, AZ</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old trimmer after years of use, decided on this model and have been very disappointed. The guides are just badly designed. They are made with a flimsy plastic and have all broken within a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only option is to buy replacement guides directly from Remington for a steep price or buy a new trimmer..... I&#x27;ll be purchasing a new trimmer from another manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty the trimmer itself is well made and cut my hair well but what good is it if the guides are going to break every few months. I would not recommend this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After my initial review I was contacted by Remington Products and they replaced my broken guides free of charge. I&#x27;ll try to be incredibly careful with the guides this time knowing how easily they can break but I very much appreciate the customer service I received from this manufacturer. I increased my initial rating due to this.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I had in mind. The guides are made of flimsy plastic. One was bent in pack and will not straighten out. I tend to use it without the guides and that has its risks in a bad trim. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This does not function as a close shaver. Nor is it a really close beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is not advertised as such. As a beard trimmer and yes, a hair cutter, it is an excellent grooming tool. I am no expert in the arena of these devices, but I have used a good many in my forty plus years of facial hair trimming. I am not THAT old, but only suffered having to shave while still in junior high school. No, it was not cool. At any rate, I have been using shaving and trimming devices for a good long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the device. The trimmer/cutter is exceedingly well made, and has a terrifically powerful motor. Really. Terrific. Build. Quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have expressed concerns about the quality of the attachments. I cannot really speak to this issue as I have only peered at the faux chrome &#x27;plated&#x27; items through their packaging, and given them a slight squeeze. Flexing was abundant with little force applied.What I can state with some degree of certainty is that they do not seem to anywhere near the quality of the trimmer/cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to speculate as to whether or not I will break the attachments when I finally do put them into use. However, given foreknowledge of the purported fragility of the attachments relative to the robustness of the trimmer/cutter, I suspect that I would use lots of care using the attachments;...and it is not unlikely that I would use them without fanfare and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, the basic trimmer/cutter works very well to trim hair. The Remington HC5550 cuts hair of all human types with aplomb; including that which covers the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there appears to be no warranty info. on Amazon, but the product literature indicates a five year warranty. I will post the pertinent data here: &amp;#34;Limited Five-Year Warranty.&amp;#34; ...the usual blather..and then &amp;#34;If the product should become defective within the warranty period, we will replace it free of charge&amp;#34;..etc., etc., ad infinitum. Customer is responsible for return shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, there are two additional money back offers and guarantees. The former is a 30 day &amp;#34;Money-Back Offer,&amp;#34; and the latter is a &amp;#34;...Shave and Groom 60-Day Money Back Guarantee.&amp;#34; In no way to I intend to contradict other owner/users, but I have had great success in getting warranty parts shipped to me free of charge from both Remington AKA Spectrum Brands as well as another household name in shaving/grooming products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this is a real indication as to quality, but it should stand as some manner of guidepost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have wrapped this product review up long before now. However, I hope that I have added some useful data that I did not see in other reviewers&#x27; remarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star off is for the attachments. They could doubtlessly have been constructed from a material that instills trust in their use instead of mild angst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer/cutter is a great tool. I have little doubt that it will last a good long while. The only real caveat here is that the trimmer/cutter most assuredly does not cut down to the level of a dedicated shaver, nor does it cut as close to the skin as some other beard trimmers. Armed with this outpouring of rubbish from the likes of me, I hope that this review allows you to make a more informed decision as to whether or not this product might be the right one for you or for someone that would appreciate this grooming tool as a gift.</li>
            <li> What a great product! Well-built, works well, and has all the features I had wished for in my dream trimmers before I started looking! I have used a corded Wahl for a while now, but have wanted a cordless* since it&#x27;s not always practical for me to use it near an outlet. I have used the Wahl, and wanted a cordless option, just for regularly cutting my head hair short - no guard and set to the shortest length. This Remington not only has a large enough blade and enough power to buzz my head nearly smooth, it additionally: has two power settings; charges via USB(!) either with the included wall cord or any micro USB cable (one was included in my purchase); and allows for a wet rinse of the blades via a pop-out function that distances them from the body/motor/battery. It&#x27;s also well-shaped and has a nice heft and balance. I like that it isn&#x27;t as loud as the Wahl corded, and doesn&#x27;t make my hand numb from vibrations after several minutes. (The Wahl is probably more powerful, but for me I don&#x27;t need it. Still appreciate the quality of Wahl, but I&#x27;ll be getting rid of mine now that I&#x27;ve got this gem!) I can&#x27;t give an opinion on the combs/guards as I haven&#x27;t and likely won&#x27;t use them - though I will say they seem fairly sturdy and they were reasonably well-packaged in my purchase, so those experiencing broken or bent guards ought to be in the minority. (I also have no use for or opinion on the &amp;#34;hair texturizor&amp;#34;.)&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Remington for a great product, well-thought out and designed, and at a fantastic price! The MSRP is about what I would expect, and I got an even better price buying through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I actually thought I would not want a cordless; as an aspiring minimalist I had an idea that cordless trimmers would necessarily come with a special-purpose charging cord, or a base that would take counter space, or otherwise further clutter my life. Not so with this! I&#x27;ve said it above, but I&#x27;m really excited about the USB charging capability! Great jobRemington on that decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I might further add: this model is advertised as being able to operate while plugged in to charge. I can confirm this, although when switched on the battery/charging light goes off, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still charging at that point or not. But if you have it plugged in, I would guess it&#x27;s using that power rather than the battery, so even if it&#x27;s not charging at least it wouldn&#x27;t be running the battery down.</li>
            <li> This was good while it lasted.  I got about 2 years use out of it (trimmed my hair about once a week).  I will say that I used to pay $15.00 for a haircut weekly, so this purchase payed for itself in a couple of weeks - no real big deal that it failed a couple of years later. I liked it because it was light &amp; portable, but the contacts wore out and it no longer charges (or at east that&#x27;s what I think is wrong with it).  I went ahead and got a Wahl corded as a replacement and can tell the difference in build quality, but the Wahl is heavier and not as easy to use.</li>
            <li> ordered for deployment and the fact that it is usb chargeable is a definite plus...does not snag hair or pinch skin....great tool</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price during the sale. Love Amazon Prime shipping....</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the regular shaving clippers to shave his balding head for some time.  He loves these clippers! He has used them wireless and was impressed with the power even using battery power.  He was also impressed with how close it shaves.  Of course, its new and I&#x27;m hoping with use it does not change how it works.  As for the turbo boost...i&#x27;m not sure if he actually used that feature.  It is also easy to clean because the top \\&quot;springs open\\&quot; to rinse with water.  I do not believe you can use it in the shower though.</li>
            <li> This is what the manufacturer says about the Remington HC5550AM professional Cord/cordless rechargeable haircut kit with turbo boost:    The Remington HC5550 Hair Clipper puts professional power into your hands with a clipper scientifically proven to give you double the speed and double the performance of Remington&#x27;s previous models. The integrated Pro Power Motor gives you a cutting performance that&#x27;s twice as fast and its self-sharpening Titanium-coated blades are scientifically proven to cut significantly more hair with every stroke--saving you both time and effort.     This is what \\&quot;I\\&quot; say about the Remington HC5550 -- if you do nothing else, go buy one!  It is easy to use, recharges quickly, and has three attachments that is workable with any length of hair.  My husband even used it for his eyebrows and it worked like a dream.  I like how easy it was for my husband to use -- the attachments come on and off easily.    Clean up is a breeze as well.    I definitely recommend this hair clipper!

            <li> Works great.  Bought it to replace one I lost.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a Christmas gift.  It is sturdier than I thought it would be for the price.  Person who received it loves it and uses it regularly.  Great gift.</li>
            <li> RE: Remington HC5550AM Professional Cord/cordless Rechargeable Beard Trimmer and Haircut Kit with Turbo Boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered and received this kit in a timely manner but, soon after I began using it I felt that the one attachment that came with the unit was limiting, I could only cut my hair at one length. I went online to order additional attachment(s) and discovered the were 2 or 3 other attachments included in the kit. I guess they were just not packaged when shipped. But Amazon saved the day. I called to report and request the missing parts. I had all the parts in my hands in two days - no hassle, just excellent customer service on the part of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, the trimmer works very well and I really like the cordless operation aspect - but without excellent customer service, you got nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> QUICK SUMMARY:  These lightweight, quiet, cordless hair clippers are great for giving cord-free, tangle-free haircuts.  But some regrettable design decisions by Remington keep this from being a 5-star, must-have pair of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background:  I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for well over 20 years.  I started as a way of saving money, primarily, but I learned to do a better job than what I got from hair salons.  I&#x27;ve cut my sons&#x27; hair, too, for many years.  So I know a thing or two about hair clippers. I waited until I used this pair on myself and both my sons before writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight!  Noticeably lighter than any corded hair clippers I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;- Cooler! These don&#x27;t radiate heat like my corded clippers, which get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;- Cordless!  No more extension cords, no dealing with tangled cords.&lt;br /&gt;- They work!  Enough power to cut through my older son&#x27;s thick hair, even without the \\&quot;Boost\\&quot; setting switched on.&lt;br /&gt;- Quiet!  They don&#x27;t make a loud buzzing sound like my corded clippers.  This is especially nice if you&#x27;re cutting a young boy&#x27;s hair, and the young boy doesn&#x27;t like (or is afraid of) the buzzing sound.&lt;br /&gt;- Compact!  The carrying case is very small and stows easily.&lt;br /&gt;- Only three, adjustable guides!  No more fumbling with a dozen different guides.  And the guides are flexible enough that it&#x27;s harder to accidentally jab the scalp of the one you&#x27;re giving a hair cut to.&lt;br /&gt;- Rechargeable!  Plug it in after giving a hair cut and it&#x27;s ready for the next use.  In a pinch, you can connect the charging cord to use these clippers as corded clippers instead of cordless.&lt;br /&gt;- Turbo-Boost!  The clippers have a \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; and \\&quot;Boost\\&quot; setting.  I found that I could use them easily without the \\&quot;Boost\\&quot; setting switched on.  (\\&quot;Boost\\&quot; makes the clippers a little noisier and it discharges the battery more quickly).&lt;br /&gt;- Sharp!  My finicky older son reported only once where the clippers pulled at his hair rather than sheer his hair.  (I used to get this complaint several times with our older, corded clippers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DISLIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is no light indicator showing when the charging cycle is complete.  The only light it has shows that it is plugged-in, but you can&#x27;t tell when the charge cycle is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is no battery discharge indicator, so you won&#x27;t know you&#x27;re out of battery juice until it&#x27;s too late.  I gave my sons haircuts on different days because I didn&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;d have enough battery power left in the clipper to give them both haircuts on the same day.  (I could have just plugged-in these clippers and used them as a corded set, but I didn&#x27;t want to do that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The guides are difficult to attach to the clippers.  In fact, on the third hair cut, I accidentally didn&#x27;t attach the guide correctly (but it seemed to be correct when I began using the clippers), and the guide slipped out of position causing me to cut my son&#x27;s hair shorter than I intended to.  It&#x27;s not a foolproof design of attaching the guides to the clippers -- you have to very careful.  Once the guide is attached, be sure to apply pressure to the guide to see if it will slip out of position.  If it does, re-check the alignment of the guide to the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The guard piece you attach to the clipper blades when not in use is surprisingly difficult to attach correctly.  It should just effortlessly snap on, right?  But it doesn&#x27;t.  Instead, you have to carefully position the clippers into the guard&#x27;s channels so the plastic guard stays in place. Even when it&#x27;s attached correctly, it falls off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The clippers have a tiny brush for cleaning, but they really need to come with a long-bristled brush to clear out hair bunches stuck in the clipper guides, and to flick hair off the victim&#x27;s neck.  (Did I just say \\&quot;victim\\&quot;?).  Fortunately, I have the long-bristle brush from my older pair of clippers that I&#x27;m still using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:  I really like the lightweight, cordless, cool-to-the-touch, quiet features of these clippers.  With a little more experience, I&#x27;ll be able to competently attach and detach the clipper guides so I won&#x27;t cut my kids&#x27; hair too short.  A few design quibbles keep these clippers from being a 5-star product, though.g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:  I really like the lightweight, cordless, cool-to-the-touch, quiet features of these clippers.  With a little more experience, I&#x27;ll be able to competently attach and detach the clipper guides so I won&#x27;t cut my kids&#x27; hair too short.  A few design quibbles keep these clippers from being a 5-star product, though.</li>
            <li> Comes with a wide assortment of guard sizes.  It glides through hair like butter, never getting jammed at all in my experiences.  The turbo boost is really not even needed for my hair, and I have thick hair, but It may come in handy for people with lots of REALLY thick, long hair.  The charging is very convenient, you can plug it into the wall or any USB jack.  I cannot attest to the battery life, because I just keep it plugged in between uses, but it certainly has enough juice to complete at least one haircut, and probably many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole product is pretty sturdy feeling, and a good overall weight.  Some devices gain a lot of weight when the manufacturer makes it cordless, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a highly recommended hair-cutting kit!</li>
            <li> i bought this item for my husband birthday, he love&#x27;s it, it&#x27;s so easy to use. IT&#x27;S VERY GOOD PRODUCT:)</li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair, and have for about 9 years.  I use a kit very much like [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]] that I purchased 9 years ago.  I love it, and it does a great job on my husband&#x27;s hair.  The downside is the cord.  I always have to be near a power outlet.  When I saw this product, I jumped at the chance to order it because I loved the cordless option. Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t have the power of the Wahl plug in version.    My husband has very little hair on top, just thin wisps.  The hair on the sides of his head is fairly thick and wiry.  He likes it cut to be about 3/8 of an inch long.  I&#x27;ve tried the Remington cordless twice, both times after leaving it plugged in for the full 14+ hours to give it as much time to be fully charged as possible.  I find that it takes me 3 times longer to cut his hair, as I have to keep going back over it at different angles to cut it.  The thin wispy hairs on top of his head don&#x27;t get cut at all, and I have to go back with scissors.    I love the idea of having no cord.  I also like the fact that instead of many pieces to keep track of, there are only 3 plastic adjustable attachment combs.  One for longer hair (1+ inches I believe), one for shorter hair, and one for stubble.  You attach the plastic piece and click it up to the level you want the hair to be cut.  This sounds very convenient and easy, but the fact is that hair gets stuck and bunched up under the plastic guard.    I do find that when I shave the hair without one of the combs (I use the clippers on the back of my husband&#x27;s neck to shave the hair off without the plastic guard), this product works fairly well.  It seems to have enough power to use without the guards.  But unless you plan to shave the head completely, this product just doesn&#x27;t have the power you&#x27;ll need for a normal hair cut.    I&#x27;m very disappointed, as I was really hoping to do some cord-free hair cutting, but I&#x27;m back to using my Wahl haircutting kit.</li>
            <li> These clippers are GREAT!  Easy to use, long battery life, very easy clean up after usage.  I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s better clippers on the market but you&#x27;ll have to go in the $100 plus range to find a set of clippers that beats this Remington&#x27;s performance and ease of use.  After buying 3 sets of $50 Wahl clippers from Walmart that gave me issues after 1 year I decided to go with a different brand and I&#x27;ll never buy another Wahl product again, it&#x27;s great to finally own a good set of clippers.   So my advise is that if you&#x27;re a professional hair dresser, you probably want to go with something else but for sporadic household use (weekly usage not daily usage), you can&#x27;t beat these clippers!!</li>
            <li> This looks like a well made unit, and may be great for cutting hair, but I bought it as a beard trimmer, and it is not at all well suited for that.  The shortest length for any of the head attachments provided is still about a half inch, which is too long for my beard, and I think most men except those affecting the lumber jack look (not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that).</li>
            <li> Best head shaver I&#x27;ve owned. And close to the least expensive! Solid motor and nice blades. Cordless is THE NEXT LEVEL of shaving. Step up.</li>
            <li> This light weight clipper is ideal. the batter last and the attachments are so handy. You can be a pro with these Trimmers.</li>
            <li> Very good quality I was highly impressed.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper and I disagree with the other reviews that say it is not easy to use.  It is very easy.  People read the instructions!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Simple review...this trimmer/hair cutter cuts very easily and quietly compared to others I own.  The \\&quot;fewer\\&quot; attachements makes it easier for me to keep track of them.  In the past, other trimmers I&#x27;ve used had 6+ attachements for various lengths.  And others I&#x27;ve used only came with one that was ajustable up to 6 or 8 lengths. This one seems to have a more manageable amount that can trim hair more precisely.    Most people will use this for actual hair (head) trimming and it will do a great job.  If you plan on using ths for body grooming, I would suggest looking elsewhere for a trimmer that either has an expandable reach or an add on so you can reach places like your back.  Remington makes one that works very well.    I&#x27;ve had grat luck with Remington products in the past.  I own or have owned nose hair trimmers, electric razors, and other hair and body trimmers.  They have all held up over time and the only issue I ever had where one failed was due to me dropping it....several times.</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with the product. Does the job. The manual provided is very bare minimal. Had to figure out some things.  Product is good as described.</li>
            <li> THe only reason I bought this was to trim my beard. And the 1.5mm attachment is all I needed. But i was very dissapaointed to discover that it trims very unevenly with patches. And the attachment also irritates skin. It might be good for trimming chest hair but dont buy it if you want to use it on your facd!! Period.</li>
            <li> As expected. Is powerfull and works fine.</li>
            <li> Ive only used this once, but it worked like a charm, has high quality components. and most importantly, has usb charging.</li>
            <li> What looks and feel like a great product isn&#x27;t as soon as you try use it!  the major design flaw of this product is that the teeth flex leaving you with lines and bald spots allover!</li>
            <li> I used for my kids&#x27; haircut. Not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent item.&lt;br /&gt;it is valuable comparing with $100 Panasonic Hair Clipper ER1411S.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for haircut.</li>
            <li> The item is pretty much as advertised, however I have found it to be a lot heavier, as well as a lot bigger, than I expected.  This makes it somewhat difficult to use.  I will probably use it until I can find what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is well constructed and I love that it charges via USB. But it does not have the precision needed to trim a beard unless you wear a very long beard. On most beard trimmers I use a setting of 5 or 6. On this trimmer I used the lowest setting and that only kind of works -- the combs are just way too big.</li>
            <li> second remington haicutter I buy... these are really great. Only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I found is that battery takes forever to charge but once its full you can use it for hours</li>
            <li> Great item for its working</li>
            <li> absolutely not worth the money, regardless of the price.  doesn&#x27;t even cut ur hair.  even as u press hard against ur skull.</li>
            <li> excellent tool for the job</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the lowdown: These clippers are terrific.  However the plastic guides move around and do not stay attached to the clippers.  So you wind up having to cut your hair very CAREFULLY.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Remington will have better guides in the updated version of this product.  Hope so.  My husband really likes the power of the clippers, but is frustrated that the guides are flawed.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good little man groomer look no further. These will cut any kind of hair you need with no problem. The attachments are easy to use and the product itself is easy to use. Comes with a nice storage/travel bag. From head to your feet these are the groomers to get. You just cannot beat the price for these quality trimmers.</li>
            <li> This is a really good clipper.  I&#x27;ve never tried a Remington one before.  The settings are good and easy to use.  The real selling point of this clipper is the cordless feature.  It&#x27;s a pain trying to cut hair and also having to contend with a clumsy cord.  Cuts evenly and with ease.  Just remember to plug it in to charge it before each use...that&#x27;s the only part you have to get used to when switching from a plug in trimmer/clipper.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer for my husband since he wears a short beard and regularly trims it. Since this is made to be a haircut kit, it does more than just trim beards, but that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve used it for so far. My husband says it runs very smoothly but that, since it&#x27;s not strictly a beard trimmer, it has no receptacle to catch the little hairs that are trimmed from his beard. He trims his beard over the sink and then has to clean up all the trimmings. But, again, he says it runs and operates very smoothly. So I can&#x27;t speak to the hair cut functions since I don&#x27;t use it for that, but it seems to be a well-made product overall.</li>
            <li> I bought these Hair Trimmers because I trim my sons and husbands hair at home. The last pair didn&#x27;t last at all or cut the hair very well. These are excellent, I am really pleased with them, in fact mt son was so impressed he is looking to buta remington electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The clipper is great but the charger stopped working after 1 full charge.</li>
            <li> These clippers performed very poorly. They would not cut close to the skin and are useless for close trimming. My suggestion is to avoid purchasing these clippers if their primary use will be for trimming.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004I8NO8A Remington HC5550 Precision Power Haircut &amp; Beard Trimmer Corded &amp; Cord-Free Use]]The machine itself is very good, but the plastic attachments are flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;One problem which makes the use of the machine unpractical is that the hair gets stuffed between the attachment and the blade. You will have to take off the attachment and clear the stuffed hair several times during the hair cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling.  It cuts hair well, but the guard broke after two months (or 8 trims), so it is pretty well useless.</li>
            <li> I bought this item almost one month since the writing of this lines, I am not persuaded with it. One member in my family used it to cut my hair and I used it for cutting my sun&#x27;s hair but it does not work as expected. The bad things with this machine are:  1- The battery dies before finishing my cut session. Accordingly, I have to use it with the cord which means its cordless feature is almost useless.    2- It does not cur perfectly. I need to go and return on the same place of my head many times.  3- It is not easy to clean while cutting. I need to stop and wash it by the water.  Truth be told, I am not against Remington. I bought Remington vacuum hair cut, it was amazing, but this item Remington HC5550AM Cord/Cordless is not that good as the other one.  My advice is it  might be better to avoid buying this one.  Thanks,</li>
            <li> Does a good, not great job. Good for close cutting on neck, but grooming attachments are cheap plastic. Would have preferred a built-in hood that could be removed for close cutting. Pretty quiet, but hard to tell when charge is running low as it sounds \\&quot;under-powered\\&quot; even when fully charged. Have been a Remington fan, but will look around better next I&#x27;m purchasing.</li>
            <li> 16 hours for charging !!!</li>
            <li> I am a follically challenged man who has been cutting his own hair for many years now. I&#x27;ve used a number of haircutting tools and I really like the heft and feel of this cordless trimmer. It is a pleasure to use from that point of view, one of the best I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also pleased that it is designed for use on both regular hair and facial hair, as I confirmed on the Remington website and in the video advertisement on the Amazon product page. It&#x27;s important to always check this, because I have burned out a few motors on trimmers designed for use on hair alone by also using them on beards, which are much tougher to cut. Never use a haircut tool on facial hair unless you know it has been designed for this use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problem is with the comb attachments. They work fine for cutting hair all to one length, but previous trimmers I&#x27;ve used have had a tapered attachment that allows you to cut hair very short above the ears and at the base of the neck, while allowing the hair to be progressively longer as you get higher. This trimmer doesn&#x27;t allow that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this reason, I&#x27;d say this product is better for use on other people than for do-it-yourself types when it comes to haircuts -- parents cutting children&#x27;s hair, or spouses cutting spouses&#x27; hair, for example. Without a tapered attachment, it&#x27;s hard to get the kind of easy control you&#x27;d want, unless you like the look of absolutely uniform length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The USB input is for charging only -- no data, of course. But it is pretty handy on the go, as you don&#x27;t need to carry a separate charger if you are traveling with a laptop. Every bit of space and weight counts these days on the airlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A strong four stars, probably deserving of five for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want or need a tapered comb attachment.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> The Remington Haircut &amp; Beard Trimmer 5550 is a great little razor at a great price with some super nice features!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the Turbo Boost (which I have on constantly while cutting), the attached hair texturizor, titanium coated blade, and the SUPER handy Click N&#x27; Wash option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor also has three adjustable guards:  a long comb that adjusts from 1 inch to 1 3/4 inches&lt;br /&gt;  a short comb that adjusts from 1/8 inch to 7/8 inch&lt;br /&gt;  and a fixed stubble comb that cuts 1/16 inch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even has a USB port that would be super handy for the traveller.  All in all, a great little cordless razor at a super great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Cutting!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking clipper. It is wireless, which is a BIG plus, as you don&#x27;t have to struggle with the cord. It also has a variety of attachments so that you can use it for a variety of purposes. It has good power, although I wish it had just a little more to get really hardcore jobs done, but it will work for all hair types. The neat thing about this clipper is that it has a lot of extra features that really help you get hair-cutting jobs done quick.    It has a boost feature to ratchet up the power. I don&#x27;t find much of an increase from the normal setting to the boosted setting, though. The feature that I like the most is that you can easily clean the razor by pressing the sides at the top to eject the head. Then you can rinse the head under running water to clean it out. That is a really nice feature. Also, it comes with an edger built-in. You just slide up the switch and you can get your neat edges done quickly. It comes with a USB cable of all things so you can charge it on your computer! I guess if you have a laptop and are on the go with it you can just use the laptop to charge it. I like the fact that it has a nice weight to it. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a kid&#x27;s toy. And it cuts through heavy hair very well. Any hair on your body it will go through with ease. It comes with an accessory bag as well to store the other attachments, brush, USB cord, cleaning fluid, etc.    If you groom hair a lot this device will definitely make your life easier. Remington really added a lot of nice features to it to make this a good clipper for all types of people.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is better than I expected. I&#x27;ve had different trimmers in the past and I thought I&#x27;d give a Remington a try. Wow! The first thing I noticed was the construction. This trimmer is NOT cheaply made, especially for the price. The second thing I noticed was the ease of use and cleaning. The staff at Remington really know how to make a user-friendly trimmer. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and I hope this trimmer lasts for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Click-N-Wash blade system is one of the main reasons why I bought this trimmer. It makes cleaning the blade much easier. I don&#x27;t even need to use a brush to clean it and no dismantling required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Turbo Boost is a neat option. I use it when I&#x27;m in a hurry to get out the door and my beard looks the same as if I used the normal mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another option that I like is the Corded/Cord Free use of the trimmer. My last couple of trimmers would not allow me to use the trimmer while it was charging, which was a bit of a hassle when only a forth of my beard was trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The USB Charging option is unusual, but I guess if you&#x27;re travelling, it would be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this trimmer to three of my bearded buddies and they&#x27;ve all enjoyed the design, power, and easy of use.</li>
            <li> After a long searching for a trimmer, choosing between Braun Cruzer, Philips Norelco, Wahls and Panasonics, this Remington was the jackpot. I absolutely love it, no.1 reason - cord and cordless trimming. I don&#x27;t give a f*ck on cordless, it&#x27;s a plus, being able to plug it in and be sure that you will finish that haircut is what made me to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other complains were the comb is too soft and would break easily. I&#x27;m telling you this, if you managed to break this comb, your hands are growing from your ass and you shouldn&#x27;t be doing haircuts. Or anything else at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can always find the worst in the best and the best in the worst, so you&#x27;ll always hear complains about this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it works like a charm, I even was able to make a haircut right out from the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts nice, speed is nice, blade width is good, I didn&#x27;t need that turbo speed, regular does its job well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the beard comb for my haircut, cause I trim my hair short, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, it is a little bit more difficult, compared to other models, say Philips, to clean hair out of comb, but If you&#x27;re handy enough to make a self haircut, cleaning hair is nothing to you, be handy till the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fully satisfied with this product, as for now, time will show for how long it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m recommending it.</li>
            <li> I inadvertently shaved a bald spot on my head with it, twice. The second time I admit I should have known better, but having just purchased the clippers I was keen to give them another chance. The problem is a serious design flaw with the attachments; the outer teeth are much heavier than the inner teeth, and therefore less prone to flexing. This means any irregularity on your head that isn&#x27;t wide enough to span the entire width of the attachment may result in bald patch (no matter the setting). I won&#x27;t use them again.</li>
            <li> Use it every day and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. it&#x27;s sharp and cuts well...&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m not sure if the blade will stays sharp. but for now.it is very good</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It is an easy to use trimmer, but I do wish it was easier to clean.</li>
            <li> For cutting a whole scalp of hair down from shaggy to less than an inch, this trimmer works fine. The clipper length is actually pretty easy to set, and it is nice to have only three of them instead of the dozen or so that come with most clippers. It&#x27;s quieter than other clippers i&#x27;ve used, and there were no pulled hairs in the whole process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One frustrating thing was that it is actually pretty difficult to trim neatly around ears. Given this, i&#x27;m not sure how useful this would be as a groomer for facial hair, given the contours of a face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like it better if the charging light changed colors to indicate when the battery was full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, it comes with a USB adapter. I guess this is so busy people can charge the trimmer from their laptop, but it&#x27;s just weird, and i have trouble imagining anyone ever using it that way.</li>
            <li> Maybe 15 years ago I bought a pair of Wahl corded clippers.  I didn&#x27;t think much about them -- which is to say that they did their job, and with proper maintenance they did their job well and for a long, long time.  A few years ago it started to become increasingly clear that it was time to replace them, the blades were no longer as sharp, nor were they as nicely secured in their positions, which meant that now and again the clippers would bite just enough to hurt.  So I simply bought another pair.  The replacements were awful.  They didn&#x27;t cut as well, the blades would sometimes bind up (even after we&#x27;d take them apart, oil, and put them back together with a little less force on the screws.  So I kept using the old pair, returned the new (and the replacement new pair when we thought we might have just had a defective set), and went about our merry way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was, until we discovered the Remington HC5550AM.  I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough.  I was concerned it would cut poorly and/or unevenly.  I think I had mostly just resigned myself to the fact that I&#x27;d be stuck with the ancient Wahl clippers, bites and all.  I&#x27;m here to report that I couldn&#x27;t possibly be happier with these clippers.  They are powerful enough, and include a button to boost the same when you need a little extra clipping power.  They charge quickly and I&#x27;m not forever untangling/untwisting the cord that inevitably would become twisted and kinked as I used the old Wahls.  The Remington clippers feel good in the hand, are easy to manipulate and hold in a number of different ways (useful whether you&#x27;re getting your own head or trimming back fur on a dog).  The ability to simply pop the clippers forward in order to clean under running water is a stroke of genius, and works brilliantly.  After two uses, I was happy and comfortable enough with them as replacements that I simply threw the old reliable Wahl away.  While it seems silly to get excitable about a pair of clippers,sometimes there&#x27;s simple pleasure in having a tool that works, and works well.  These clippers are just that.  No biting.  Clean, even, and close cuts.  Cordless.  I don&#x27;t know what else I can ask.</li>
            <li> We just purchased this because we had an old Remington that no longer charged.  That one had a wheel in it that allowed me to set the correct settings.  The new one doesnt have that and it is basically hit and miss.  You have to judge what the setting is when you start cutting.  My husband was not happy with the way I cut his hair but next time he will know exactly where to set the comb for the proper adjustment.  It seems very durable.  We hope to get it right next haircut</li>
            <li> I shave my head but I&#x27;m tired of using a blade so I was looking for a trimmer that would allow me to shave close to 0mm QUICK! The titanium-coated blades are awesome and easy to clean!! I like the attachements that came with it too... The charge indicator doesn&#x27;t tell you when it&#x27;s fully charge tho. I&#x27;ve let the trimmer charge for 48h and the light indicator was still amber (I expect it to be green...)</li>
            <li> Very accurate, easy maintenance and excellent results in different brands for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Would you recommend this product to youth, adults and especially mothers with young children.&lt;br /&gt;very grateful</li>
            <li> This product is something of a hybrid between a beard trimmer and hair clipper, and it&#x27;s been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend 6+ months a year traveling the word for work, so I needed something portable.  Not only is this a nice, compact size, but because it&#x27;s both precise enough for beard trimming and powerful enough for head-shaving, it&#x27;s allowed me to leave two devices at home, and just bring this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another huge benefit (and the reason I bought this), is that it can be charged through your laptop via USB.  So, when I&#x27;m in the states, I can charge it through the wall, but when I&#x27;m traveling, I can plug it into my computer with no fear of damaging the motor due to international voltage differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of performance, it works great.  When I first turned it on, I was concerned it might be underpowered because it was so quiet, but turns out it&#x27;s plenty powerful with the added bonus of not sounding like a lawnmower.  I used it to take my longish hair down to 1/4&amp;#34;, and even with the attachment, it zipped through my hair as easily as the professional grade Wahl clippers I have at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For beard trimming, it also did a great job.  The only drawback is the because it&#x27;s a bit larger, getting the hairs of my mustache was a bit tricky.  But, it&#x27;s doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three attachments allow you to select any length, at 1/8&amp;#34; increments, from stubble up to 2&amp;#34;.  Lots of versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how this holds up over time, but so far, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this at usual wal-mart and charged and ready to use, I slip on the attachment for hair cut and the thing won&#x27;t stay on, there is hardly anything to hold on for the attachment and the clipper, it slips away. Returned it and now shopping here for something better. Do not buy this product, plastic attachments are cheap.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that it can heat up to high temperatures when in turbo boost mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is sharp and it isn&#x27;t super loud.  The assembly is very sturdy and the vibrations your hands feel aren&#x27;t excessive.  The hc5550 is easy to clean and comes with plenty of accessories.  It is also easy to use with no guard as long as you manage the temperature of it.  Which I do by turning it off for a bit and running the blade under water for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shopped around a bit and found the price reasonable and feel it is the best product in its class and will last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Dreadz but I need a pair of clippers to do my line and clean my facial hair up so I&#x27;m sure this will serve the purpose!!</li>
            <li> Worst hair clippers I have used in 15 years! Impossible to cut hair without leaving stripes. What a disaster!! It just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I do not have a beard. I use a Remington shaver to ensure that doesn&#x27;t happen, because I just don&#x27;t look good in a beard. I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;beard guy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do have hair, and so I gave the Remington HC5550 Precision Power Haircut &amp; Beard Trimmer a shot. I made a terrible mess. I won&#x27;t blame the gadget for my inability to cut my own hair with a trimmer, nor can I blame the gadget for the mess it made in my bathroom. What I can say is that it really cuts well, and the guides are fairly decent for maintaining a specific length. It recharges easily, holds a charge for a long time, and is what I&#x27;d call a good trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s messy. When I say it&#x27;s messy, I mean it comes with a bag to store everything in, but the bag isn&#x27;t quite big enough to store the trimmer, the guides, and the AC adapter all together at once. Not without a little Tetris-like puzzle solving, trying to nest everything just right. I also mean that once you&#x27;ve finished the task of shaving all your hair off, it&#x27;s pretty gunked up and you&#x27;ll be spending some more time cleaning it. It does clean out pretty easily, but there&#x27;s got to be a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are light and the language resembles English, but it&#x27;s not always in the right syntax to be easily understood unless you&#x27;re very liberal with the interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll get a ton of use out of this trimmer. For the time I&#x27;d invest in cutting my hair (or even having someone else use it on me), and then cleaning up both the area and the trimmer itself, and then trying to get the whole kit back in the too-small bag, I&#x27;d just as soon pay someone $12 to give me a decent haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I guess I&#x27;m saying is that I believe this works for its intended purpose, but I don&#x27;t advise buying it thinking it&#x27;s going to be a miracle product that will make you capable of cutting hair at home to save some money on cosmetologists or barbers. Unless you know what you&#x27;re doing, or take a class, you&#x27;re very likely to shave something too short and end up going to a barber to fix it, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use this unless you actually know how to cut hair or trim a beard properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating for a pro: ***** (5 stars)&lt;br /&gt;Rating for the layman: ***  (3 stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Averaged rating: **** (4 stars)end up going to a barber to fix it, anyway.

            <li> The combs are cheaply made which make this trimmer average. There is a turbo button for extra power which comes in handy for those with longer  hair. Overall pretty disappointed.   If looking for just the trimmer then ok buy but if you plan on using the combs i suggest looking for another trimmer</li>
            <li> I have had many different trimmers in the past...this one works wonderfully...I especially like the the way the cutting head \\&quot;slides\\&quot; down for easy cleaning. Only thing that I would change is to be able to adjusts the smaller comb like you can on the larger ones...makes it more difficult to trim a mustache without having one of the combs going into my nose...other than that, it is a wonderful product.  Would recommend to anyone..</li>
            <li> Excellent !!!! Just Buy it &amp; Enjoy it !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing is small, has a short battery life, and feels kind of awkward to me. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone else.</li>
            <li> i got this a couple of weeks ago and have used it twice since, to trim stubble and a little touch up trimming for my fairly thick and textured hair. the titanium coated blades are sharp and can cut through sections of dry or wet hair with ease. usb charging is convenient, especially for international travelers, and not just a gimmick.  used within its limitations, this is probably good enough for most guys, and certainly a number of notches up from the $10 or $20 clipper/trimmer sets you buy at target or drug stores. however, if you want a full fledged clipper to do an entire head or thick or coarse hair, i&#x27;d go with a \\&quot;real\\&quot; clipper set, like an oster 76 (corded), or andis bgr or voguers max pro (both cordless). if those are too pricy, i&#x27;d hazard to say even a mid-range oster or andis would be a better overall cutter. this is because while the aforementioned titanium coated blades are sharp, the motor doesn&#x27;t seem particularly strong. i didn&#x27;t, for instance, bother cutting with the lower standard speed, and moved right up to \\&quot;boost\\&quot;. at low speed, the motor sounded inconsistent and a bit anemic. \\&quot;boost\\&quot; improved things tremendously, but i doubt anyone is going to see the 40 minute usage claim. the blades will also get quite warm, fast, at the higher speed setting. i haven&#x27;t tested to see how long the battery lasts or how hot the blades will finally get while on full boost mode, but if i do, i&#x27;ll update this review.  i&#x27;m not a pro but i&#x27;ve cut my own hair for a long time (and i do pride myself on doing more than just buzz or square cuts) and i&#x27;ve learnt over the years, sometimes the hard way, how good quality tools really make a big difference. imo, this is a good travel companion for grooming, touch ups, and the occasional buzz, but not heavy duty enough to warrant being your only choice or even your number 1 choice. this is more appropriately used as a supplement to a main clipper. note that the product description gives first billing to beard trimming, indicatingit&#x27;s a beard trimmer first, then a haircutter.  quality wise, the product seems well built, but i have a few nagging gripes. for one, the LED \\&quot;battery indicator\\&quot; is only lit when plugged into the charger. otherwise, it&#x27;s dark during use. i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s how this is supposed to be, or if my unit is faulty. i did check to see if it was the hc5550am pictured here but it just says hc5550 on the back. another model shown in the video promo seems to actually show the time left on the charge, but i couldn&#x27;t find a higher end model than this for sale. it&#x27;s not a big deal, as i don&#x27;t plan on using it for anything heavy for extended times, but this could matter to you. i never bothered with the flimsy comb attachments.  while it&#x27;s washable under a tap, i recommend also using a spray cleaner and lubricant like andis cool care [[ASIN:B000LNB8HK Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades]], or any other brand you like, following a quick burst of compressed air to get all the hair particles out from under the blade head. the cool care spray or similar will also have the added benefit of cooling down the blades halfway through a cut if they get hot. do lightly oil the teeth after a rinse or between uses. that&#x27;ll maximize the life and performance of any clippers or trimmer. when the battery finally goes, you&#x27;ll be left with a thin, fairly short cord attached to a small a/c charger (so don&#x27;t toss it thinking a usb cord will suffice forever!), but at least the unit can be turned on whilst plugged in. at $35, i don&#x27;t feel i have much to complain about. if this was a $50 set, they&#x27;d be going back to amazon, and i&#x27;d be spending the extra cash on a made in usa wahl sterling eclipse. this remington model is made in prc.</li>
            <li> Remington products are cheap but not reliable. I found that this shaver is terrible complained to Braun or Norelco. The product looks cheap, doesn&#x27;t hold charge that well and in general functions poorly. Try another brand -- Remington is a bit shabby.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product for the most part. It arived a day earlier than expected and it woks great. I just started shaving my head and this thing really cuts it away. The only problem is that it looks very used. the sides and some of the finish just looks like it&#x27;s been worn out and refurbished. Other than that I love my new clipper.</li>
            <li> This thing is huge, has a lot of power and is way too big for your face. This is designed for your head and is pretty much worthless when trying to trim something like a goatee.  Trying to trim my upper lip results in having the extra long plastic blade guard jabbed up my nose. There really is no right size as far a the guards go, they are either too long or too short. The plastic power switch turns on easy enough, but requires two hands to turn off because there is no grip to it&#x27;s smoth surface. Overall, this was not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Not a beard trimmer which is the reason for the purchase. The device works great for head hair, but far too wide to work on your face. It is impossible to shave around the mouth and under the nose without using a strange angle that in some parts create very short sections of hair and in others completely misses hair. (leaving what appears to be &amp;#34;bald spots&amp;#34; in your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good for head hair or cleaning up your neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for around 15 years now, and have never had a pair of clippers that were so inappropriate for the texture of my hair. I&#x27;m mixed White and Black, and because of the way the combs are designed - with a significant gap between them and the blade - my hair bunched up, meaning that I had to stop every 5 or so seconds to empty it. Due to this design flaw, it also cut my hair unevenly, and I had to get my old clippers back out in order to fix the damage. Not risking using these again and they&#x27;re being returned immediately.</li>
            <li> it does what i need it to do..</li>
            <li> was more then I expecting</li>
            <li> I got this product since I cut my own hair and have been using a dying trimmer for a while now.  This product has a few terrible design flaws that made it cut my hair unevenly.  The first is the adjustable length guides bend with only slight pressure so as you are using it you get variable length cuts depending on how much force you exert.  The second problem is the shape of the trimming guides are concave so depending on the angle they ride on your scalp you will get different lengths.  In the end I had to use my old trimmer that has flat solid guides to fix my patchy haircut from this trimmer.  I suppose if you don&#x27;t use the guides at all it would be a decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great with a long charge life and I really like that it is cordless and rechargeable.  Like any other tool or instrument, the user has to master using it in order to get the best results.  It&#x27;s not going to automatically give you the best haircut right out of the box like maybe some of the other reviewers here have expected.  It takes a little time and patience to get a feel for what each setting on the guide combs does.  The more I&#x27;ve used it, the better the results have been and the price I paid for it was only a bit more than one trip to the barber shop.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my beard &amp; for doing my own haircuts. I keep my hair fairly short, and find this easy to use. I especially like that I can trim my beard to a stubble. Because it&#x27;s cordless, it&#x27;s way easier to use than my older plug in type. I&#x27;m even able to do the back of my head &amp; neck. The charge seems to hold up for a long time. I should be able to get 3 haircuts &amp; trims on 1 charge.</li>
            <li> This unit cuts smoothly and evenly, and holds its charge very well. Very easy to use, I loved the cordless feature. However, the attachments only offer three different levels and they don&#x27;t stay onto the razor too well. They are big and bulky too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it again, but those attachments make it a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> Great price! Came with 3 different combs, cleaning brush, oil and usb charger. Really good!</li>
            <li> I replaced an older version of this with the new one. Better handle, better cutting. The plastic adjustable attachments are very fragile so be careful and you will have a fine beard trimmer and hair cutter.</li>
            <li> This is the second battery (non-corded) hair trimmer I have purchased inside a year.  The first was a Wahl model which I thought was worse but now appears to be about the same.  I am a Peace Corps volunteer in West Africa.  After the Wahl disintegrated its batteries, I purchased this Remington as its replacement, thinking I was getting a better device.  I used it once until the battery ran down and now the battery(s) won&#x27;t recharge.  There are no instructions on exchanging or replacing the battery.  I am stuck in the bush of West Africa but am not stooping to getting ringworm from the local hair cutters.  I bought the Remington clippers to protect my health and now I am cutting my hair with a pair of first aid kit scissors instead.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have this product and use it often, it works great and holds a charge for several days. I love the fact that I can go on trips and never have to pack a charger. One good charge before you hit the road and I can use it for a week or more. Also I like the easy clean up, just run water over the blade and push the two buttons on each side to clean the inside and your done. It comes with guards and a travel bag.</li>
            <li> Really nice and sharp blades, trims beautifully, even my somewhat curlier beard.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m a little worried about the plastic attachments, they seem to be very fragile - but we&#x27;ll see. Also, the on/off switch is somewhat difficult to move.&lt;br /&gt;But overall I&#x27;m very happy about the product</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I used to have older Remington model for years and it would last even longer, but it broke when I dropped it. So, looking for replacement I order HC5550. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good or not, I haven&#x27;t even turned it on, because the product I received wasn&#x27;t new, but refurbished!!!&lt;br /&gt;Oil was leaking from the blade, covering half of it. It was covered with fingerprints and I found a hair inside... What can I say - it&#x27;s disgusting!</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL WITH THE GUARDS!  The guards are far too flexible and butchered my beard and head on the first use.  Very little downward pressure is needed to flex the center of the guard when elevated.  Just let it glide on your head with it&#x27;s own weight.  I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m used to the standard clipper kit with hardened plastic guards, but I would also expect a bit more resistance from these especially considering those stubborn under chin beard hairs.  If it wasn&#x27;t for them getting messed up I may not have noticed my head was uneven as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the charge capacity lasted through the first botched cut and the second cut to fix the first one.  It will take a long time to charge the first time as stated in the instructions (read them).  Second, it cuts very well!  The second cut, a bit shorter than desired, was smooth and there wasn&#x27;t any pulling.  I also like the pop up head and rinse clean features.  This would get 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for those wobbly guards.</li>
            <li> Works great. The guards are definitely brittle.</li>
            <li> Has a difficult time cutting fine short hair.  Leaves some miss cuts.  Hair has to be cleaned out on each pass.</li>
            <li> The machine is excellent but the adapter comb arrived broken</li>
            <li> This product is really of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with it is when you want to use the 1.5mm size. It sucks, because the piece that attached to the razor has a space in the middle which means some part of your beard will be ZERO and other will be 1.5mm.&lt;br /&gt;Summary, if you want to use 1.5mm then you&#x27;ll end up of having a beard that doesnt have same cut.</li>
            <li> Well product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It worked properly only 3 months. I am truly disappointed. It was unexpected. I can not charge it. It has voice like bomb explosion and the same time works nasty.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is excellent. Mine has lasted for years.&lt;br /&gt;But the combs are delicate, and break easily.&lt;br /&gt;The cost of a single replacement comb is over $11 (including shipping charge), which is almost 1/2 of the price of the complete kit (trimmer, combs, charger) at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought cheaper trimmers that only lasted a few months.&lt;br /&gt;So as long as you are OK with a comb that will have to be replaced frequently, it&#x27;s an OK buy.&lt;br /&gt;If the combs were sturdy, this would be an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Chose this unit because of blade quality, attachments/combs, and the fact that it didn&#x27;t need a stand for charging.  Blades are great.  Use it directly on my scalp without the attachment and it&#x27;s very smooth.  The combs though are aweful.  Too thin and pliable.  Shaved off half an eyebrow trying to trim them.  My old trimmer had combs made of harder plastic and work great for my beard and eyebrows.  Won&#x27;t use the new unit for that again.  Charged it for the prescribed amount of time and it sounded like it was discgarged.  The boost setting runs like my old trimmer does normally.  The motor also fluctuates depending on how I maneuver the unit.  Hope it lasts.  Overall, great blades, bad attachments, questionable motor.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Been using it for the last 6 months or so. So far so good!</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper. I use it to cut my hair and trim my beard in the shower. It&#x27;s nice to keep all of the mess in the shower and just rinse it all down the drain. The clippers since off easily. The combs feel a bit flimsy, so I am concerned with breaking them. but they do work very well.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the heavy duty, going to last a while, gets the job done razor that we have been looking for. It does exactly what we want it to (shave his entire head and beard) in half of the time that some of the other products we have bought used to. It is sturdy and I can&#x27;t imagine its motor is going to run out anytime soon. If it does, I will edit my review. Right now, as it stands, this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair trimmer because it came with very long attachable guards that other trimmers don&#x27;t offer. However, I have been very disappointed in this hair trimmer for the following reasons...  1. When I first opened it, I suspected the device to be refurbished, although I&#x27;m not sure. I couldn&#x27;t tell if the little black bits were plastic or old hairs, but regardless, the product was already oiled inside, so I wonder if it were actually new.  2. One of the combs on the large guard was bent right out of the package. One of the combs on the middle guard broke off during travel in my carry on luggage. The plastic used on these guards is very cheap. Remington also never responded to my request to replace them.  3. The motor is pathetically weak. It WILL cut your hair unevenly if you use the battery power. You basically have to use it plugged in to get adequate and reliable cutting power.  4. The charge light never goes off when it is plugged in. I left it plugged in for at least 48 hours after I got it and the light never went off. I never knew if it were charged fully and it never performed like it was.  I have since abandoned this product in favor of the more expensive Oster products. I went with the Oster Topaz and am hoping for a better performance. Don&#x27;t go cheap on a hair trimmer is the lesson I learned.</li>
            <li> I wish I never bought this. In fact, I want a refund. This thing cannot cut hair period. I thought the cordless functionality was a plus but honestly I&#x27;d rather use my old clippers that were broken than use this again.</li>
            <li> So far this Remington shaver seems like a good shaver, and it has good power to take off the hair very easy.</li>
            <li> It cuts my hair, just not very well. hair clogs at blade and i don&#x27;t get the pop-put and wash under water feature. The shortest attachment isn&#x27;t nearly short enough.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for international travel.  Since it has USB charging, I thought it would be ideal -- less volume and weight in my bag without an extra power adapter.  However, it turns out this trimmer alone is heavier and larger than other trimmers with their power warts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:  USB charging is great, washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:  large size, heavy weight, 3mm length increments.  There are 3 separate combs. Stubble comb is 1.5mm.  Beard comb is 3-21mm with 3mm increments.  Hair comb is 24-42mm with 3mm increments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this trimmer would be great for some people, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Shaver works well one charge last a long time but the trimming beard adapters don&#x27;t keep the hair in place when I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> I really like the adjustable heads. It cuts time when trimming my hair. This is my first cordless trimmer. It is nice not having to keep adjusting to where the cord is.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is nice and has great features...  However, the clips themselves, I don&#x27;t care for...  The design traps hair and I get a very inconsistent cut...  I prefer the clips that attach to the blade and not float over the blade...</li>
            <li> I like it.  I have been cutting my own hair for over 15 years and have started to have problems finding cordless Hair Trimmers.  It is tough to buy a set online cause you cant really see the quality but these are great.  buy with ease.  if these are still for sale when i need another set i will buy them again.  Thank you amazon</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself seems to be of very good quality, but the sizing guards leave a lot to be desired.  The ones that were needed most for me trimming needs broke on transport without any heavy jostling.  They were located in the carry case in a bag of luggage.</li>
            <li> So, it does exactly what it is supposed to be doing, does it well, (and sometimes before I wished I had a loan mower for the hair I cut on monthly basis), this thing does it well. For the price, I find it REALLY worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one exactly like this for over 2 years and was very happy wit it, until my son dropped it (or was it thrown?). Must say, some plastic parts of it can brake, but the force has to be applied to do that. And it always works really well (considering the above mentioned quality of hair - wire-like and full). Kind of why I bought the second one, after my first was destroyed.</li>
            <li> Bought these for business travel. I buzz my head and these work well. I travel internationally and the fact that I can charge these via USB saves me from having to get a converter. Only thing that bothers me is the weak guides. I have broken three. There are flimsy and flex easily. I use this clipper 3 times a week. For beard and mustache trimming and for haircuts.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a beard trimmer and, for that, it&#x27;s very, very good. Tried it on my hair on a whim. If your hair is at all thick, this is not your device. Simply not enough power to cope with thick hair. Thinner and finer hair also has a tendency to work its way between the blades and the trimmer body to the point where the unit become ineffective. Removing the &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; requires removing the comb, turning the unit off, sliding the cutting assembly away from the body and taking some time to dislodge the clumps that jam there.</li>
            <li> this is verry good one , you can bay it and you will not be disepointed , this one m</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle-eastern so that means I come with a lot of hair all over. This thing works GREAT. The battery lasts for multiple trims, although the charger looks proprietary, it also charges with a regular micro USB. The rubberized sides feel great when holding and maneuvering the trimmer all over the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that there aren&#x27;t more short size combs to choose from. There is only a bare shaver (about 0.2mm), and a number 1. I would really like a number 0.5 head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used this for cutting hair on the head. My experience is only for beard and body.</li>
            <li> This is NOT or can be a trimmer. It has the wide mouth is just under 2 inches. This is to shave your head with and also if you have as much hair on your face as you do with your head, then this will work out, because you are haircutting. Now if you want to trim, you have to use beard/mustache trimmer. Again, THIS IS NOT A TRIMMER!!!</li>
            <li> The adjustable guard has a fragile plastic button that is pressed to move it up and down.  The clip snapped off and now the guard is not adjustable. That renders the clippers somewhat useless for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are super sharp and the power of the motor is great. Be aware that the blade width is pretty wide for use on the face.  They are great for haircuts, assuming that the guard doesn&#x27;t break as mine did and several other commenters have noted as well.</li>
            <li> No, I didn&#x27;t like it.This is very hard to clean, bulky. Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t work when plugged in. Spend on something else.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I been using it for some time now.  It charges well and holds it too. Easy to clean, as the blades can pop up.  Little loud though.</li>
            <li> Love the price, and the product.  So much easier to cut my boys hair - once you go cordless, there&#x27;s no going back :)</li>
            <li> This is one great little haircut trimmer. I actually use this to cut my own hair and after some practice I can now cut my hair and as little as 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply write down the number setting to a particular attachment and go to town. I am a male and I only needed to write down for numbers; one for the front, One for the top, One for the back and one for the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery has plenty of juice for just doing my head and on the normal speed setting I would say it lasts from 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny part is product is that it came in a plain white box with plain black text describing what was inside. Just my $.02</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use and long battery life.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to trim my beard and it works great. I&#x27;m surprised at how long it holds a charge. It has a powerful motor also. Really good price for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> This is a hair trimmer and is not a good beard trimmer. It has only one setting for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband a few years ago and he loves it.  He enjoys the cordless feature and it holds a charge for a long time.  He has a thick, coarse beard and it cuts right through it with no problem.</li>
            <li> Solid trimmer. Definitely well worth the money, and lives up to the remington name. Cuts through thick beard hair like butter.</li>
            <li> I thought the USB thing was a bit strange at first and got some jokes from the family about downloading haircuts, but really i just use it with no guard in the shower twice a week.  This is my 2nd purchase, the first was 3 years ago, from leaving it in the shower stall the full time, the connectors got worn/rusted or something - it just wouldn&#x27;t make a good connection or charge/run any more - i could see the light not coming on due to the bad connection.  Plenty of power.  I do wish that it had a light that showed when it was charged or when it was low.  But the awesome thing is that if you are half way done, and the juice does run out (and when it runs out it goes fast, but it goes full speed until it does), just plug into the wall, and your in business again right away, no waiting for it to charge for you to continue, it worked on direct wall power AND on battery.</li>
            <li> Trim worked well while it held a charge.  But i&#x27;ve been unable to charge the razor.  The charge that it arrived with lasted long enough for the item to not be eligible for return.  However, it now won&#x27;t hold enough charge for more than 15 seconds of use.  I plug it in for 48 hours, unplug it and turn it on and it dies in 15 seconds.  I&#x27;ve double checked the cord, outlets, etc and it appears to just be defective.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers on the market other than a professional model ! Price is right and a perfect cut ...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since quite a while now and I must say this is just awesome! Never ran into any issues or trouble with the battery. It charges well and the batteries are capable of holding enough charge to use it for atleast an hour. I am completely satisfied with the product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to be able to charge it while I travel internationally. And not having to carry an extra charger, since it charges with USB, is great. It has good power and cuts well. And cleaning by water makes it swell.</li>
            <li> i have been cutting my own hair for a long time and this is the best clippers ever used, and  a great price.  Recommend for anyone who cuts their own hair. Very happy with product and service!</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for my beard trimmer, but it turns out that it is nearly as wide as regular barber clippers.  I have a Wahl clipper that I use with the comb attachments to cut my own hair.  The Wahl makes very little noise; whereas the Remington clippers are very noisy.  The comb settings on the Remington are somewhat confusing and I have to refer to the manual to find which comb to use and what setting number equals the length that I want.  In my opinion it is tool large to put in a travel kit even though it is powered by rechargeable battery. I don&#x27;t think it will see much use at my place.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comb&#x27;s shape was changed, at last , my hair is very ugly. EXcept it&#x27;s comb, it is ok, But I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> the item looked the bees knees and was what I was looking for, only problem was the difference between 240v(Australia) system and 110v American.  Item was useless in Australia.  Did however receive terrific customer service from Amazon when they were notified of problem.  That is the only reason for my rating as an item untried.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Recommended!</li>
            <li> This Remington HC5550 Haircut &amp; Beard Trimmer has worked flawlessly and is the best one I have ever tried. Will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> really happy with this. the battery lasted plenty long enough and was powerful enough to cut my extremely thick, coarse hair. tons of blade adjustment settings without having the clutter of dozens of attachments as some other razors do. haven&#x27;t used the USB charging yet, but i love the idea that i could travel anywhere in the world with it and not worry about wall chargers.</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to get the job done with it, but once you do it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had, but they are better than most of the ones I&#x27;ve used. The could use a good sharpening out of the box but other than that the battery has amazing life. The attachment work pretty well (though they seem to break if you are a bit heavy handed like me) Other than that I would and plan to buy another set in the future if I need to replace it.</li>
            <li> Great package covers my beard and head and my sons as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, I&#x27;ve owned it for a few months and it works wonderful. It holds charges for a long time and the cordless convience is awesome. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver&lt;br /&gt;Does all it claims&lt;br /&gt;Battery holds a charge very well.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to complain about&lt;br /&gt;Only good things to pass on.&lt;br /&gt;What can you say about one of America&#x27;s oldest most reputable manufacturers, Their production of outstanding firearms have served this country&#x27;s bravest soldiers and kept our flag flying. Their consumer goods and power tools also rank right at the top of their industry.</li>
            <li> Efficient, fairy fast speed, long lasting battery, excellent trim feature, stays clean for several uses.</li>
            <li> Love it I now cut my own hair no more barber visits for me</li>
            <li> They sent a unit that battery charge does not charge to green...is always in amber and discharge very rapidly( one session of around 10 minutes). I sent them an email and no answer at all. Bad Vendor</li>
            <li> This product deserve fife stares. After using other product I found Remington HC5550 very convenient and practical with the right price it is</li>
            <li> NOT FOR BEARDS.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I would be a cut above the rest (pun intended) by ordering online.&lt;br /&gt;Decent machine, not so vulnerable to water and holds charge well.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the beard attachments are a joke. None of the attachments are useful to sculpt a beard. No matter what you add, maneuver, or whatever you try, you will only get a five o&#x27;clock shadow - even if you wanted your beard longer or shorter.&lt;br /&gt;Have not used it for my hair, can only imagine the horrors.</li>
            <li> Works as described, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This trimmer did a good job for both hair and beard trimming while it operated!!  After just 14 months of use the battery will no longer hold a charge for operating more than 10 seconds and does not operate even with the cord attached.  I have returned it for replacement under the 5 year warranty.</li>
            <li> love that its cordless, makes cutting my sons hair soo much easier. would def recommend this to friends. great clippers</li>
            <li> this is worthless is you keep your hair short. not at all suited for beard trimming. the combs are so long and widely spaced that any hair laying flat against the skin doesn&#x27;t get cut. the way the combs are made just collect the hair and then its stops cutting well and you have to take the attachment off. about 6 times to do my whole head and face. i used to have a barber style where the No. 1 attachment was short and had the comb pieces close together and that worked great. i am already looking to replace this and i&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice item for the price. Saves me a bundle of money.I really appreciate the courteous, ontime service. Thanks to all that was involved in the transaction, including the delivery. Keep up the good work. Have a great day.</li>
            <li> Have used this twice now. Works great and love the thinning option. Easy to clean. Cons. flimsy blade guards, and it only clicks on levels of 3. It tells you to go two down from what you are cutting hair for thinning. But the hair cutting guards only click in increments of 3. Was a little skeptical, but has many features. Still trying to get used to the cutting guards and the number I need. They are not standard. Don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to change blade guards to frequently to cut hair. Be gentle putting them on and taking them off.</li>
            <li> Very good product who have a long beard,short or any kind. Love it. Can work as corded or cordless. Sharp blades, smooth cut.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a professional and said this product was very good quality,  Unfortunately, my husband has not used it yet.  Delivery was very quick and he did like the features on it.</li>
            <li> When my brothers were little, my Dad would give them buzz cuts every spring, not because we couldn&#x27;t afford a barber, but because he was a child of the depression and would always rather do something himself than pay for it. I remember the haircuts being punctuated at regular intervals with an \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; or a hiss of pain. Dad always had his own hair cut by a professional.     Years later, we cut my son&#x27;s hair with a newer model home haircutting kit than that used on my brothers. It still had a cord and only one cutting attachment, but more safety features that limited the pain factor. The cut was gappy and we kept it to the summer months, letting it grow out in August. We did this out of necessity, not having any money to spare for barbers.    Now I have a grandson and a Remington Rechargeable Professional Cordless Haircut Kit. I have learned to use it and love it. It has several removable, changeable heads for cutting hair at different lengths, and can be used with or without a cord. It makes haircuts - even for penny-pinching, non-professional do-it-yourself barbers like me - a snap. At first I found the heads hard to change until I located the release button. A real duh moment. After that I was so proud of my newly acquired cutting skills I was asking everyone to sit for a haircut. After pointing out its superior qualities as a beard and mustache trimmer, I had a couple of employees purchasing a Remington RPCH for their own use.     I don&#x27;t know what more you could ask for from a home haircut, beard-trimming kit. It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s easy to use, it has a lot of heads to choose from, it is portable and rechargeable, and when you look at the price of haircuts, it&#x27;s also a common sense choice.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  It&#x27;s worth the money but, as one reviewer noted, the shortest length isn&#x27;t all that short and I keep having to replace them.  Why?  Well, they probably last if you baby them but I put it in the drawer and let nature take its course.  Invariably, they break and I end up buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... make sure you pamper the blade covers.  Beyond that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> It seemed ok from the add, but it turned out to be too bulky and heavy. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> works better then expected</li>
            <li> Seems to be a nice equipment!</li>
            <li> This is too big to use easily as a beard trimmer.  Even using the smallest head I could not get the hairs closest to my nose.  Also the head on this broke in 3 months.  I regret my purchase, and would strongly advise buying something else.</li>
            <li> I had a Maverick which I used to trim my beard with great success. When it broke after many tears of service I ordered this as a replacement. Apparently Remington has hired a Vice President in Charge of Screwing Things Up as there is virtually nothing I like about this device. Almost nothing is intuitive, and as near a I&#x27;ve been able to  adjust the various guides, I am forced to trim my beard either at &amp;#34;longer than I want&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Did you forget to shave today?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not sure if I received a refurbished item or what, but it wasn&#x27;t in original packaging.  Received in a generic white box.  Not the nice clear clam shell you see it in stores with.  Not something I give to someone as a gift packaged like this, but it was for myself, so it was ok.</li>
            <li> battery life is short and does not have a battery indicator. Despite these details the product does the job.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the one I gave to my son.  Love Remington products and look forward to getting a lot of years of use out of this one.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product. While the trimmer itself is great, the trimmer is used with attachments, which are junk. I had high hopes for this trimmer because it made such a great first impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Remington HC5550 to cut my son&#x27;s hair. He&#x27;s mixed and has a bit of an afro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first problem with the attachments occurred the day the trimmer arrived and I put the trimmer and the attachments into the provided black bag. The bag is too small so after stuffing the trimmer and the attachments into it, I struggled to zip the bag. One of the teeth on the only attachment I use (it goes from #3 to #21) snapped off from the pressure of the tight fit in the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the mechanism for holding the attachments into place (so the attachment doesn&#x27;t collapse out of place during trimming) is flimsy. About two weeks ago while cutting my son&#x27;s hair on the #15 setting, the attachment mechanism gave way and the attachment slid down the trimmer and fell to the default #3 setting. Needless to say, the trimmer but a bald patch on the top of my son&#x27;s head!! I was utterly mortified and furious with my purchase. My son is going into the 9th grade so he needs to look good. Luckily, his hair has grown back some before the first day of school.</li>
            <li> For the price this is an excellent trimmer, works well &amp; holds a charge long enough so it doesn&#x27;t have to be charged between every trimming. No snagging of hairs at all.</li>
            <li> hard to use compare to panasonic</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to switch to a cordless trimmer. I had concerns about power, and batteries dying before haircut/trimming was done. So far it is more powerful than my old corded model, so much so that I can cut my hair in less time. I went from 20 mins to about 10 mins. I have used it only twice, but so far I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> A mediocre razor that barely gets the job done.    It did start right out of the package well and manages to hold a charge OK but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it.    The three heads aren&#x27;t all that inspiring either, we&#x27;ve had less expensive kits do a whole lot better.    I guess it&#x27;s serviceable but it isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d have my heart set on.</li>
            <li> I really liked the trimmer. It&#x27;s very well made and appears to be a very solidly-built product. My only complaint is that the trimmer attachments leave a lot to be desired. In an attempt to cut down on the number of trimmer attachments, the makers of this product provide you with three adjustable trimmer heads. The problem is that when you adjust them, there is a gap between the cutter head and the attachment that collects hair and plugs up the trimmer. The manufacturers would have been better off just making a few extra single-depth attachments that don&#x27;t collect trimmed hair. The \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; theory once again fails. Nice concept, but it just doesn&#x27;t work. I will look around for single-depth trimmer heads for my trimmer, as I don&#x27;t like the adjustable ones it came with. But the trimmer itself is a very fine product, as I&#x27;ve noted.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 50-60 light uses, not horrible for the price I suppose. Battery is gone, otherwise it is still functional. The attachments are very very flimsy, anything more than the slightest pressure and you end up with racing stripes and bald strips. I won&#x27;t be buying it again, but wouldn&#x27;t call it a horrible device for $25.</li>
            <li> I would rate this review excellent.  It eliminates visiting the barber shop on a more than frequent basis. I have been very satisfied witht he product.</li>
            <li> Nice to shave necks and trim beards but terrible for men&#x27;s and boys hair cuts...there aren&#x27;t all the different attachments like normal clippers...</li>
            <li> A decent set of clippers. Has guard that lets you cut leaving hair long than most clippers. Hard to find guards that thick. Preformed well with full charge. The charge only last for about 30 to 45 minutes though.</li>
            <li> Not useful as a beard trimmer. The stubble attachment is about 1/4&amp;#34; and the guard on it is so long that you can&#x27;t use it to trim your mustache without the spikey plastic part jammed up your nose. it works great as a haircutter.</li>
            <li> Works very well I really like it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;d buy the same product again off Amazon.  Great sales and delivery - no problems or complaints.</li>
            <li> To be used as a prize in a game that we play.</li>
            <li> The best cost/benefit ever, it works very well. The only issue is that after a few years of use the comb rails break apart...they are very fragile. I bought this unit to replace my old broken combs. Anyway worth the price! Thanks Regington for making such affordable device!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the glowing reviews and product features. I had never seen one in person and really wish I had. If I had been able to hold one  before buying, I would have put it right back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the thing is big. It&#x27;s almost twice as big to hold onto compared to the compact Wahl trimmer that I&#x27;m trying to replace. I suppose that would be great if you had a really big head since it makes trimming go much faster due to a very wide (too wide, IMO) blade, or wanted to shear sheep all day. It would be perfect for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I bought this as both a hair trimmer to cut my hair down as short as possible without shaving, and to also use to groom my goatee. It does ok on my head, but forget about using it for facial hair. The stubble attachment is the most poorly designed attachment I&#x27;ve seen, considering its intended use. The guide sticks out so far that you can&#x27;t get the cutting blade closer than 3/8ths of an inch (I measured it) to anything such as your nose. Well, that means I can&#x27;t trim the upper half of my mustache with it at all. It also is extremely awkward trying to trim around my ears for the same reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit that it does cut well. It&#x27;s reasonably quiet and does its job quickly. I could get past the large physical size of it with some practice, but the guide design makes me want to pitch it in the garbage. At best, I&#x27;ll be using it for my hair only, while finding a separate beard trimmer. But that seems rather pointless when I&#x27;m sure there are models out there that will do both well.</li>
            <li> This makes it so easy to trim my beard to the length I want.  It cuts very nicely, and stays charged for a long time.  I&#x27;ve searched for years for a good beard trimmer like this!</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself appears to be Ok but the product was shipped without the proper power cords. I&#x27;m located overseas and mistakenly trusted that the product shipment would be complete. I ordered the product 4 weeks before returning to the US and now I&#x27;m stuck with an incomplete product because of Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return policy. Moral of the story - don&#x27;t trust that the product will be sent with all the components as advertised. Anyone need a paper weight?</li>
            <li> Used this on my father for a haircut and compared to a quite older model of Remington&#x27;s corded unit, this one pales in comparison. The attachments are not easy to use and are flimsy. It is really convenient to use though especially since it&#x27;s cordless and can even be charged via USB! Decent, but not worth the price for the flimsy attachments.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a mixed bag.  First of all, while it claims to be an all-in-one beard/hair/body trimmer, it is not.  This is a full-sized trimmer and is far too large for beard trimming or anything detailed.  Second, the attatchments are terrible.  While my experience with the trimmer itself has been good (good battery life, cuts cleanly, doesn&#x27;t tug or yank on hair as you cut, easy to clean), the attatchments have been nothing but frustrating.  The plastic attatchments slide up and down the clipper so each can cut at several different lengths.  This seems like a good idea at first, reducing many attatchments down to just three, but it just doesn&#x27;t work in practice.  The attatchments tend to not stay in place and slide around during use.  I&#x27;ve also found they don&#x27;t cut evenly; when I used one of them to clip my head down to a #2 length, it left a sort of striped effect behind.  At this point, I&#x27;ve given up on using it if attatchments are involved and only use it without a guard when I want to shave my head.  It does that well, but considering how this clipper is marketed, I can&#x27;t really reccomend it.</li>
            <li> It works and cuts very well. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I was used to my old Remington but preferred the attachments better than on the new one. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer; unfortunately Remington does not provide spare  replacement clipper heads and their customer support is NON-EXISTENT, i.e. they refuse to answer queries and always disconnect a phone call.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Works perfectly, better than expected.</li>
            <li> A good trimmer, gets the job done and is easy to clean out when done.  I like the adjustable comb height, but the combs are a little weak, take care to avoid breaking them.</li>
            <li> I am deployed in the US Army and bought these because I got tired of lookinh shaggy. One of the guys in my squad cuts hair and so I figured why not buy these. They have worked out very well. We have used them to give over 25 haircuts so far and they are running strong. They are easy to clean and maintain the cuttign edge well. The only thing keeping these from getting 5 stars is that the battery seems to die after one cut and the USB charger doesn&#x27;t seem to charge as well as the plug in one. If you keep them charged then you will be good to go. Worked well with the converters over here in Asia/Africa.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and this trimmer works great for shaving the back of the neck and trimming beard/mustache.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet this device is, because I no longer have to explain the fervent vibrating noise coming from behind the bathroom door, like I always had to do when I used my Wahl clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have the blade width or sheer horsepower of plug in clippers, so I have to make more repeat passes with it but that&#x27;s easy enough, especially since this is so small and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts forever too, I charge it after every few haircuts even though there&#x27;s never been any perceptible battery drain when in use. I generally just plug it into my phone charger, so charging couldn&#x27;t be easier. My charging indicator light always stays red when plugged in and never turns green like other devices do when their charge is full. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s by design or a defect but it&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments don&#x27;t clip in place as solidly as I like, so you have to check them or they can come off when making a pass. I made this mistake once....once....and carved a nice little racing stipe into my noggin and had to cut the rest of my head short to even it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is good too, nothing fancy but it effectively holds the whole kit.</li>
            <li> My fiance looks great and trimmed up. Its so easy to cut his hair now. The different trim attachments allow me to cut his hair and trim his beard with the same  trimmer! a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a cordless, rechargeable beard trimmer that had guards for longer hair length than my previous trimmer. The fact that it doubled as a hair trimmer sealed the deal, since I was also looking for something to replace my old Wahl. When I used it to trim my beard, I was very happy with it. The guide stays in place, it cuts the hair evenly and it&#x27;s able to get in all the nooks and crannies for a clean, even cut.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy with the beard trimming I decided to use it to cut my hair. Bad idea. I&#x27;m not sure if all the hair that got caught between the guide and the blades is to blame, but while cutting the hair on the side of my head I heard an unpleasant \\&quot;GSHHHHRRTTT!\\&quot; I had the guide set to 12mm and this thing had cut a swath almost down to the skin. Two stripes down the side of my head. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this since I hadn&#x27;t purchased the \\&quot;Vanilla Ice\\&quot; model, and I was pretty upset. I got out my trusty Wahl and had to cut my hair down to 1/8\\&quot; to cover it up, but the stripes are still fairly visible.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it as a beard trimmer because I like many of the functions - the blades come out for easy cleaning, the strength while cordless is pretty impressive - but will never use it as a hair trimmer again. I don&#x27;t care if a study comes out that says stripes accidentally cut in your hair will cause an army of Scarlett Johanssons clad only in bacon to appear at your doorstep. Never. Again.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, and the USB charge feature is great on international travel. The combs, however, are made out of very cheap, brittle plastic and break at the slightest stress. Remington then tries to charge $4 for a replacement comb, with $6 S&amp;H.</li>
            <li> good price, not very ease to clean hair from cutting blades</li>
            <li> Husband has used for over a year. Works great. Was a replacement for a different brand that died.</li>
            <li> The guards are flimsy plastic and the setting gauge uses a tiny font that is hard to read.  Otherwise, it is an pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li> These comb attachments are virtually worthless; they fall off very easily, and snag small hairs.</li>
            <li> Great product somehow the battery does not last strong enough for one great cut.</li>
            <li> it is ok it is not strong but it is good</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great on my sons head, lots is attachments, and love the duel charging option</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that cuts their own hair.  Very powerful and smooth cutting.  Like the USB recharging.</li>
            <li> I use this just to trim my sideburns, and it works fine. It&#x27;s not super high powered like the clippers they use at the salon, so you will most likely have to finish off your sideburns with a razor. The top pops open so you can run water through it to clean it which is a great feature to have.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it once and it did the job. I bought it solely for my head and not beard and it worked like a charm. Did wonder why it came with a little oil bottle as I had read it never needed it, but in the manual it says that a little maintenance is required every 6 months or so. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I expected was very nice product, I am satisfied with the product, as they offer, pay the right price, I will continue watching deals, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I recomment this Razor to all MEN!!! What a beautiful machiene and a perfect cut. No need to worry about nicks or cuts, this machiend gives the closest ofr shaves with no worry at all</li>
            <li> I had read many good reviews about this product before purchased it. The clipper worked strongly. However, the comb which has multi clock levels were too bad. Put a little pressure on it, the comb will slide inside and ... my hair were cut shorter than I expected (I mean really short cause it&#x27;s the last clock). I have tried different combs sold with this product, they do not have good clock  If this clipper comes with better combs, this is a really good product</li>
            <li> When it came in a generic white cardboard box I was concerned about the quality. Remington seems to have skimped on packaging to put more into the product. It is well built and very powerful. Haven&#x27;t had the battery run down on me yet. This thing cuts like a corded barber shop clipper. One pass on either setting, no sticking, like a hot knife through butter. This will cut ANY hair very quickly.  Some of those cool looking body grooming clippers (Phillips, Norelco, Braun, ect) have just 6 height settings, some the guards don&#x27;t even come off so you can mark. Remington gives you three combs with 15 height settings. This enables you to cut any hair on your body. The down side is the combs do feel a bit flimsy. Given the weight of the product, I would hate to drop it and see the comb break. If you press very hard on the combs they will go down a notch. Here&#x27;s the thing, you&#x27;re not supposed to press the combs very hard against your head or body. It cuts hair very easily, all you need to do is guide it through along the contour of your skin.  Luckily Remington sells all the combs on their website. For the price this just can&#x27;t be beat for quality.</li>
            <li> This Remington HC5550 does the job as you would expect.  The variable adjustable combs work generally well except that they clog with hair easily and you have to back off to clean.  There is no solution for this if you are cutting hair longer than 1/8&amp;#34;.  Holds charge well and charges fairly quickly.  Not very heavy for beard and mustache trimming.  I deducted a star because the vibrating blade was not properly adjusted so was not cutting close.</li>
            <li> A little large but does a great job....would have liked a stand for it to come with but over all a very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Darrell</li>
            <li> The HC 5550 cuts really well, it cleans up easily, the cord/less options is nice, and I like the idea of having one comb that adjusts in size, but because of the design of the combs, they tend to trap the cut hair inside them instead of just letting it all fall to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they don&#x27;t make a tapered comb (for trimming around your ears) for this product (and none of their other tapers will fit).</li>
            <li> The first and most important thing a trimmer ought to do is cut hair without yanking or pulling it, and without scratching or cutting me. This unit gets an A+ for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it ought to be easy to use, no matter where you are. This unit charges from a computer&#x27;s USB port, which means you can also use the charger for your Android or iPhone. No cord means you can walk around, use it where you want, and not have the cord in your way. Another A+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, it ought to be easy to set to cut the length you want. The adjustable combs make this easy enough, although they will move if pressed. A-.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it ought to clean up easily. Just pop the cutter up and run it under the faucet. Another A+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is right, and I don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong.</li>
            <li> Works well with the variable settings available, especially for hair trimming, but as others have noted, it&#x27;s a bit large for beard and moustache trimming. Especially like its corded and cord free feature.</li>
            <li> I used it on my whole head once a week (number 3). it gets the job done. has a bit of a cheap feel when its being used, thats why i gave it 4 not 5 startz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for only a few months but so far no problems.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I can give my husband hair cuts.  It was new, never opened and it works perfectly.  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is my second HC550, first one the battery finally gave up after 2 years of regular use.  I love the versatility.  If you take proper care of blades they do not break as many people claim, they are just plastic after all and won&#x27;t withstand a fall while attached.  The boost feature is great and the built in thinner is another huge plus.</li>
            <li> This product is not accurrately described and useless for me because the beard trimmer settings are either much too close stuble or your have to leave beard hair length about 1/2 plus inches long. Other trimmers by Remington for less money have many more settings for length.  This product is more about cutting your hair or if you have a relatively long beard. I just ordered the remington MB200 that i already had and works fine; just thought i might upgrade to something &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; but wrong.</li>
            <li> While the clippers work good, the problem is the blade attachments suck and the charging!  They break constantly and the wall charger is faulty (they frequently die).  I can only charge mine using a computer or another USB based charger (currently using iPAD 12w charger) which isn&#x27;t big enough to give it full charging speed as it is only 1.2A not 1.5A like the stock charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also takes a long time to charge and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had them replace the blades once as it broke within a week, but they have all since broken months later and it is only usable bare blade.  Dealing with Remington was not a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Great product! Does the job for my husband&#x27;s beard &amp; mustache. Now he&#x27;s using it to shave his head. I&#x27;ll recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I used this unit today for the first time and what a joy.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmed my beard, and moustache using the Stubble Comb, taking this off for finishing work. Such a easy, quiet unit to use; within a short space of time my facial hair was trimmed to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;Such a easy job of cleaning the unit once finished trimming; was just the icing on the cake for me.&lt;br /&gt;It all bundles up nicely into its carry case once finished with.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that was missing was a Blade Guard, but I sent a email to Customer Service for one to be sent out. A small oversight I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this was to replace the Wahl brand hair trimmer that I had used for over five years. My main use for it was to do a close trim of my whole body, including head and face. The reason this loses a star for me is it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; control. If you have used a Wahl trimmer, you will know what I&#x27;m talking about. There&#x27;s a lever on the side that slides the bottom plate up and down and provides a slight protection trim so you don&#x27;t nick yourself as easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a close trim, the attachments are absolutely worthless. Forget even using the smallest attachment as it will still leave your hair way too long. What I like to do is use a trimmer on my face that will bring it down short even to then use my electric razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to do that with this, you have to use no attachments. Then you get a really close trim. It scared the crap out of me the first time I tried it without an attachment. I read a couple reviews where they said they did used it that way okay so that helped build my confidence. Ironically enough, I only caught my skin once when I first tried it and it was on my mustache part of my face but not enough to bleed or anything just a catch. Since then I haven&#x27;t had a single hair pull or anything (and I did the rest of my head and body).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually cuts faster than the Wahl did amazingly. And the reasons why this is better than the Wahl is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is cordless - I&#x27;m not tied to the wall where the outlet is anymore.&lt;br /&gt;2. You can clean it like an electric razor - open the cutter part and wash it under the sink. You don&#x27;t even have to oil it like I did the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;3. Has a usb charger port. I can use even my laptop on the go to charge it. Haven&#x27;t tried this yet but I love the ingenuity of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you can get over the scare factor of using a trimmer without a trim guard to get an extremely close trim, this is for you. If you are using this as a traditional hair cut device, I&#x27;m sure it will work fine. Sorry, my review wasn&#x27;t for that as I&#x27;m not using it for a traditional hair cut.</li>
            <li> So, I contacted amazon.com and told them that when I received the trimmer, but it didn&#x27;t have a blade guard. They couldn&#x27;t send just the guard to me but emailed me a label print to attach to the box and immediately sent me a new trimmer (I think I was given a whole month to send the first one back, but I sent it out the next day). I opened the new trimmer set and again, NO BLADE GUARD. But since it does come with a travel baggie and I won&#x27;t be using any of the trimmer size guards, I&#x27;ll probably just always put one of the three size guards on and set it in the travel bag, so the blades don&#x27;t get damaged. Just a little disappointed that the set doesn&#x27;t have a blade guard, as listed in the packing materials. But amazon.com was very helped, fast, and covered the shipping cost of the return. And it&#x27;s amazing they send you the new set before you have sent back the old one...great customer service so 4 stars!</li>
            <li> Great. I have had these two years now. It hasn&#x27;t needed any oil and I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have used old version of Remington for last 7 years. It doesnt charge anymore and plug is broken so had to buy new. I&#x27;ve chosen HC 5550 expecting same performance and I can this tell is one is much worse.&lt;br /&gt;First of all different inputs they split in the middle which is not pleasant for your skin face when you shave a bear and you can&#x27;t reach hair close to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;I had to shave my head several times all over again and final result was that i still had few longer hair that I shouldn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;Those inputs they have sliding regulation which is good but when you shaved your head they stuck there and you can&#x27;t really move it all the way down until you clean it...and cleaning...they do have two wash buttons which you press and sccezor blade comes out, but they used some type of foam there that sticks all the hair and you can&#x27;t wash them. Last thing..blade worms so high that it can burn your skin if you try trim bear after cutting your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I normally do not waste my time writing about things i bought..but this shaver is ridiculous bad. Whoever design it looked at only the handle shape and button..which looks nice but only on store display.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it and I hope they will redesign it. Whoever likes this trimmer I dont think they ever used good one in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it faster than i bought it. Need to look at other company now. Sorry Remington.</li>
            <li> I was actually skeptical about this product when I read the reviews, but this thing works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of complaints said that the guards were cheap and break easily... YEAH, if you DROP the thing while the guard is attached. A lot of things break when you drop them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other complaints said that the guards bend too easily when you&#x27;re pressing... I tested this out... and I don&#x27;t understand why you needed to press that hard in the first place? I can hold it up against in my head for the whole cut (I shave my entire head) without having to press as hard as it needs to be pressed to bend in any way that would make a difference to the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing works, it cut my hair and I&#x27;m happy. Its motor is stronger than my Philips Norelco clippers that I had before this (don&#x27;t know the model off-hand, but it was a slightly older one). Battery seems well as I had taken approximately 40 minutes to finish shaving my head (i&#x27;m kind of careful about it). Soooo yeah... I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t be afraid to at least try it out!!</li>
            <li> Probably the best value for money.&lt;br /&gt;Searched through a lot of products before getting this one.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. Holds charge well. The assorted combs are quite accurate and well built.</li>
            <li> This is an OK clipper, I have a better Remington, I only got this because of voltage requirements. I love the idea of USB charging though. I can take it with my laptop and charge it where ever I go.</li>
            <li> Nice product. You can choose the size you want up to 42 mm with 15 different length setting.You can use it even  to trim your beard.  It is very easy to use. This is my second Power Haircut of Remington Products. Previous one worked well for 18 months. This one is also doing good.</li>
            <li> This clippers worked great for the first month or two.  When it was working I used to buzz my hair and bring my beard to stubble.  I began to notice issues with it not holding a charge and ultimately not charging at all.  I am pretty sure the micro usb connection end closest to the shavers base had a loose connection which did not allow this product to work well very long.  I would like to give it more stars because when it was working it seemed to do a decent job.  However the evident poor craftsmanship makes me doubt if I should buy this one again or even the namebrand.  I am open to suggestions at this point..</li>
            <li> Works great a must buy</li>
            <li> Great pair of clippers. Feel great in the hand. Very durable and easy to hold. Definitely worth it and would likely buy another one....</li>
            <li> I keep my head trimmed pretty short and have had problems finding a good trimmer that doesn&#x27;t pull until I tried the Remington HC5550.  It cuts smooth, fast, and easy and I wish I had found it years ago.  The charge lasts a long time, I&#x27;ve only had it 3 weeks so far and haven&#x27;t had to charge it since the initial charge.  If you cut hair at home, I highly recommend this Remington.</li>
            <li> When I charged it for the first time everything was OK on the second time the indicator that was supposed to shine didn&#x27;t work and I am not sure if it is charging as it should. Otherwise the trimmer works. I am wondering if there is a problem with the battery or the charging unit... tried to charge it via USB it does the same thing nothing is happening...</li>
            <li> It cut the hair alright, the main issue I had was that cut hair kept getting building up between the blade and body of the machine.  I would have to stop, take off the guard. And clean out the built-up hair.... It was a messing cleanup, but I have been spoiled by last clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last one was a Remington hkvac 2000 and it was the best clippers I have ever own and I am sad that Remington stop making them... It cut  hair awesome, did not have to worry about stopping to un gunk the clippers, cleanup was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did Remington ever stop making them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning these and trying out Philips Norelco Qt4070</li>
            <li> I like the power and versatility of this trimmer.  Might be a little larger than some, but it has lots of combs for haircuts down to beard and sideburn trimming.  Really nice.  Smooth action, lots of power, fits you hand well, and good battery life</li>
            <li> Useful, very convenient, simple sense is good</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people saying lots of things and apparently folks who buy lots of different clippers.  But since I am guessing most are like me, you don&#x27;t buy every brand of clipper on the market.  This Remington HC5550 has worked well for me.  I make a relatively short cut and do it myself.  It is easy to handle.  The charge lasted plenty long to complete my cut.  I&#x27;m not a styling freak, just like my hair to maintain a nice even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will it work for longer cuts?  No idea.  I don&#x27;t do longer cuts.  But if you do relative short cuts, and/or tapered cuts, or even love those high and tights, this Trimmer will do the job quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it now for doing follow up, light trimming, and it once again is easy for me to handle and gave me no problems.  I am guessing, a pro-barber may not choose this, but I am not running a barber shop.  I am cutting my own hair, and it does the job quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How durable is it?  Good question.  If you don&#x27;t toss it around, and continuously drop it, it seems plenty durable for normal home use.  Dropping it now an again from sink top level or even average shoulder level shouldn&#x27;t harm it.  Though like anything, if you do that repeatedly, you likely will break it.</li>
            <li> Pro: This is a great machine. Heavy weight (but not too heavy) suggests quality components, the rubberized grip, the buttons, lights, etc... and the standard mini-USB charger. Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The worst comb design ever. I have short hair. I could not get a cut with the hair comb, and was able to get something with the beard trimmer comb, but had to fight with it. There are NO markings (well, they are but visible) to see where you have the length setting. So easy to screw up -- like I did and cut too short. Not very many length settings too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary. For 100% refund policy, I&#x27;d say you should try it if you don&#x27;t see something better. I found a Noreclo/Phillips with just one comb (built in) that uses a dial to adjust the length. Not as solid a machine, but seems to work better to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Panasonic! I purchased this one after two Panasonics broke in the same place on the trimmer guides. This one cuts much better and cleans up very easy! Great for travel or at home. Good size and holds a pretty good charge. Love this one as if I neglect to keep the goatee trimmed up it cuts right through it!</li>
            <li> Power does not last very long 3-4 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> This clipper is not good for making a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;I had a WAHL clipper before and it worked great. I wanted a cordless one and I bought this Remington clipper and that was a big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;When I set the clipping length I never know what is the real length and I always get a haircut that is way too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of this clipper after using it two times and I bought a cordless WAHL that works great and is very easy to use. This useless Remington clipper will go to the recycle.</li>
            <li> This product cuts hair very well. I have not used it on facial hair,&lt;br /&gt;but I&#x27;ve cut my son&#x27;s hair with it multiple times and been very&lt;br /&gt;satisfied. Unlike other hair trimmers in this price range, these&lt;br /&gt;clippers are more heavy duty and cut smoothly. Usually, this kind of&lt;br /&gt;trimmer feels a little flimsy and I&#x27;m always worried that the head&lt;br /&gt;attachments are going to bread; they often do. However, this unit is&lt;br /&gt;sturdy and feels more professional that the 2 or 3 others I&#x27;ve used. I&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This will work wonders for what I need.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a cordless one for a long time.  Perfection.</li>
            <li> я не заметил что там нет регулятора длинны когда покупал и это сильно ограничивает возможности для стрижки  хотя сама машинка работает хорошо</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very beautiful! My daughter loves etotot 1.7 product is delighted he ideally suited to it and combined with many other things!</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough about how I like it. only had it a short time so I&#x27;ll have to wait to give a real good review. Jim Sullivan</li>
            <li> Woth the mony, work great,</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this at first, but after a couple of uses this clipper is quite all right.  My 7 year old Remington was needing another twin battery replacement, and being on my last comb for the clipper, it was time to replace what&#x27;s been a great grooming tool for me.  I was skeptical about the adjustable combs that came with the new clipper, but they align and work just fine.  Where I&#x27;d may several passes with the old clipper before there was no more hair being clipped, the new is done after two passes.  I really like being able to flick open the blade to simple wash the blades and drive mechanism.  Also the battery life is exceptional, compared to my old unit (ever after replacing the batteries).</li>
            <li> Works well and cleans up in a snap.</li>
            <li> Solid piece of manscaping equipment.  I use the 15mm setting for a medium-ish length beard.  The charge lasts for over a week and the unit is easily cleaned.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great but batt lasted only 18 mo on mine</li>
            <li> All is fine good stuff and nice quality buy every time again.Can tell about that support is very nice and friendly....Thanks</li>
            <li> Very nice product, before I bought this, I had tried two of them from other brands and i wasnt satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one after reading the reviews carefully and there you go its actually worth my money. Its really easy to use and clean after. Battery is quite awesome, holds change pretty well. I charged it once and used it and it still had enough juice when i next used it after a month to trim my hair. I would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clips are very easy to put on and change or to adjust the size. Very nice product!!</li>
            <li> works great, love the rechargable and multiple settings</li>
            <li> As a guy that cuts his own hair (buzz cut), I have experimented with several trimmers and was regularly annoyed by the cord getting in my way.  Fortunately with this razor which I have had for about a year and a half now, that is not an issue. Some might worry about battery life, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with that.  One full charge usually last me about two to three cuts.  My only gripe is that the attachments are a pain to switch out and are a bit flimsy (one has even broken already). Overall very handy.</li>
            <li> If you use it straight, without the attachments, it&#x27;s good enough I suppose. But the attachments are the worst I have ever experienced. They slip, don&#x27;t stay in one setting even when held there with one finger. I really believe this very poor performance is purposely designed into the product. Remington in my opinion is NOT a company to be trusted. Making attachments that will stay in place is not rocket science. Never again.</li>
            <li> The cumbs can&#x27;t be replaced, they are easy to break but hard to get a replacement. Not even from the direct manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Dec of 2011 and use it once a week to clip my hair. It worked great, up until now, less than two years later. The battery is starting to die and unlike other clippers that can be plugged in the wall and draw power through the socket, this one can&#x27;t. It only is recharged through the socket, but if it can&#x27;t hold a charge than you can&#x27;t use it for more than a few seconds. However, I called Remington, got through to customer service with no hold time whatsoever and after briefly explaining the situation they offered to send me a new one and a return shipping label to return my dieing clippers with the receipt from my order history in Amazon. Great service!</li>
            <li> Has a lot of good points about it as already stated by other reviewers.  However, it&#x27;s not a good beard trimmer, probably because it&#x27;s too wide for that purpose, leaving the trim rather uneven.</li>
            <li> Bought it on sale and because the reviews were great. I found it okay only. It does the job but it feels really like cheap plastic, especially the accessories . USB charging is convenient but not a must have feature. Did not come with a case, just a bag that does not fit the accessories nor charger.</li>
            <li> This is my third hair clipper and to be honest, it is the best one I have owned so far. You can tell straight out of the box that it is well made and not cheap or flimsy like some of the other ones you might see. The wife went berserker on my head the other day and now I am regretting having allowed her to \\&quot;practise\\&quot; on me. At least hair grows back. The different attachments will allow you to get the length that you require. Happy clipping!</li>
            <li> Good quality. works fine. cuts smooth.  I charged it from 220V by mistake, the device was overheat but not damaged. still works, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to do the same :)</li>
            <li> Received it sooner than estimated.Packaging was great and it works like a pro</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean cutting</li>
            <li> This is one of the few trimmer I&#x27;ve used that te attachments fit snugly and I don&#x27;t worry they will pop off during use. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and have no complaints. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this razor. too big!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME I SAVED SO MUCH MONEY I RECOMMEND FOR FUTURE PURCHASES!!! 100% RELIABLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M SO GLAD I FOUND IT!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with tugging or pulling (as the razor industry has humorously called it). I have a thick beard, but this cuts through it with little effort. Also very nice that there is a quick-release setting which pops up the head of the trimmer for quick washing to remove excess hair. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  The heading reads Haircut and beard trimmer.  They are more designed for a beard than your head.  They are okay if that is what you intend to use them for but if you need hair clippers, try something else</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell when it was charged or not at first, heads up, blinks when charging, if it steadies, its charged. I thought the light was supposed to turn green or something, guess not . Use it about 1 or two times a month for a haircut, Can keep a charge for atleast 2 hairs cuts (about 20 min each). Sharp, dose good cuts. Cant really do super tight fancy things, but great for a maintenance free haircut. The blade also pops out for super easy cleaning. Wireless is awesome too, you can cut your hair on the roof and let your hairs fall down on all the unsuspecting people below, but why would you do that weirdo</li>
            <li> These are pretty awesome for the price. I did notice that they looked like they had greasy finger prints on them when I received them in the mail today but that&#x27;s my only gripe though. I just used them to cut my hair (I&#x27;m a black guy sooooooo yea) and they did a damn good job. My hair came out nice and even using the second largest guard. These can also be used for a beard if you know what you&#x27;re doing.  Shipped extremely fast (I get free to day shipping but its been less than 24 hours since I ordered them). Also very good noise level even on turbo.</li>
            <li> Very nice for trimming the beard and cutting hair. In total I actually bought four of them because when my friends tried  mine they wanted one too. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> The guards for this product are cheap plastic and are not very accurate. They skip from 3 to 6 to 9, can&#x27;t get in between. And when I used it on my eyebrows the plastic guard bent (very easily) and I nearly took a chunk of my eyebrow off. For trimming hair and etc it may work just fine, but for beards and other fine trimming do not use this product.</li>
            <li> bad bad bad that&#x27;s all I want to say waste of money.Dont buy this .dose not hold charge battery dies after one day.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 for the men in my life....husband and sons.  They love them!</li>
            <li> Very smooth and active. I recommend this to everyone it has style and a lot of function to use it</li>
            <li> The product is nothing to shout about...basically you pay for what you get. The cordless operation is seemed good but it can only last around 40mins. There is no way to change the battery. The idea of having micro USB cable is good. But you can only use the generic micro usb (5V) to charge the clipper. You cannot turn on and operate the clipper with the normal usb cable. If you ever want to use power supply then you have no choice but to use the supplied DC adapter with the funny tip on top of the USB plug (3.2V with 1.5A).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You basically also cannot use generic DC adapter to power up the clipper as you cannot find the weird USB with the funny tip to slot into the clipper to power it. So, for Asian and Europe buyer, be aware that you need step down transformer to use this little clipper as the supplied DC adapter is for 110v 60hz input with 3.2V 1.5A output.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good, and it arrived in a very short time without any kinds of delay, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> It has this cool feature so you can wash it thoroughly so its always very clean and the different types of razors it has come in very handy</li>
            <li> Much larger than I anticipated, that&#x27;s really my only qualm is that they advertise it as a &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34;. Much more powerful than my old one, charges off USB</li>
            <li> My sons really like this, it seems very sturdy</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reputation of Remmington as a quality shaver, but was extremely disappointed.  Battery took especially long to charge, and within 4 months, the battery died completely. To call this item \\&quot;Precision Power Haircut\\&quot; is a real misnomer.  When it worked, it lacked the power of a typical shaver, although it seemed to cut okay.  But each time, the battery lasted for less and less time, until it stopped working.  I am very disappointed, and would not recommend buying this machine.</li>
            <li> Son uses it to trim his beard and buzz his hair.  Although he has not done it, the ability to charge via a USB port sounds great for on-the-go guys.  The titanium coated click-and-wash blades are also a nice feature.  It does the job for him and he is satisfied.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really do haircut if you have a very short hair. It&#x27;s good for beard cutting though.</li>
            <li> These clippers are sweet. I love the length combs because they make it so that you can adjust lengths without it being a huge difference, so I can use it to give myself a haircut and even do a nice fade on my own head. It cuts really smooth. The fact that you can open it up and run it under water to clean it out is very convenient. The only con is that you have to charge it for 14 hours (granted you can use it plugged into the wall too) and I hate that it&#x27;s a USB because it wiggles out while you&#x27;re cutting and so it can just stop. But all around amazing clippers. Highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> Comes with all types of attachments! , and it works! Shipment was fast and well protected. Will buy again if needed!</li>
            <li> Nice product! Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> After many years of cutting my husbands beard and hair,this has been the best I have ever purchased. I would recommend this item highly,it comes with everything you need and when charged is very powerful. thanks .</li>
            <li> I had to use a shorter one and it came out terrible! Not reccomended  for anyone for hair at least.</li>
            <li> Very soft, works great.  Just what I was hoping to find.  I dont use it much, but when I do, it does not pull hair like other machines doo</li>
            <li> it looks fancy but works just alright</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as new, but it didn&#x27;t came in the Manufacturer Package. It looks like a open box package.</li>
            <li> I love the portability of this, so that you do not have to have it plugged in during use.  It recharges easily, cleans up quickly after use and stores easily in soft case to protect it between uses.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these, and this is my FINAL attempt at trying out Remington products.  THE BATTERY LIFE STINKS with this one and the other three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAME ON ME when trying them three times.  Contacted Remington, and asked how to remove and replace the battery and a cryptic, &amp;#34;Battery is not replaceable...&amp;#34;  HMMM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I requested a replacement at no charge:  waited a week, no reply.  AVOID REMINGTON TRIMMERS!</li>
            <li> This haircut and beard trimmer is somewhat one of the best I have ever used.I am very pleased with this product and I would recommend to anyone. This is an outstanding product .</li>
            <li> This is a nice item as I expected. Powerful and easy to run. I also used it for my dog, works great.</li>
            <li> Seller didn&#x27;t describe the item correct . It&#x27;s work with 120v current.I have 220v item burned when I put it to charge</li>
            <li> This unit is heavy duty and does an excellent job of cutting my hair. I would reccommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT .CHARGE LASTS LONGER THAN EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Not really for facial hair. Gave it to my bf as a gift and he ended up buying another one for his goatee and just using this one to trim his head hair.</li>
            <li> good build the clips break easily</li>
            <li> Second time I buy this and second time the stubble combs breaks. Very disappointing you cannot get a replacement only for the comb.</li>
            <li> i bought this trimmer because of the reviews, i&#x27;ve had a beard for about 10 years, and keep it at a short length - anywhere from 6mm-12mm. some cons.&lt;br /&gt;this unit is HUGE, it feels like your holding a 40oz in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;the plastic attachments cracked twice on me, during a shave. both times they were replaced by Remington.&lt;br /&gt;there are huge gaps in between the plastic blades on the attachment, which leaves uneven lines. also the plastic blades (blades may be the wrong word) bend while you are shaving, which leaves again - uneven lines.&lt;br /&gt;i had high hopes, but sadly this trimmer will join the other trimmers that didn&#x27;t live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> very satisfied-good product</li>
            <li> The big comb broke right away</li>
            <li> The on/off switch malfunctioned after a couple of months use - (had to flick back and forth many times to turn off), then the battery simply died after almost 2 years. The attachments are also made from very brittle plastic, so be careful carrying any of them in a bag as they break easily and become unusable.</li>
            <li> The unit cuts well, it&#x27;s easy to clean but...&lt;br /&gt;1) the first trim combs/guard broke the first time I took them on a flight. I tried to be careful after that but in a few weeks they were all broken. It is impossible to it use after that.&lt;br /&gt;2) it takes a good 12 hours to recharge it.</li>
            <li> The best in this price</li>
            <li> This trimmer/shaver works very well, nothing much to complain about except for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smaller trimmer to trim mustaches and other parts of beards. It&#x27;s very handy that you can keep it plugged in while using it compared to other trimmers that have to be used on a charge. It&#x27;s also easy to use and easy to clean, just wished it had a smaller trimmer as well!</li>
            <li> The Heads are junk, they break easily. I had an older version of the non-turbo model, it was way more solid and reliable. This model feels flimsy, the blade speed is not consistent for some reason and it has much less power than my old one.</li>
            <li> An use haircut high price but low quality. There are one missing part (Blade Gaurd &amp;#34;F&amp;#34;) and a broken part (Stubble comb &amp;#34;A&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recommend</li>
            <li> Nice quality product and very happy with the purchase. I wouldn&#x27;t trade this for any other trimmer in the world.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon but feel compelled to write a review so hopefully it will save someone else from making the mistake of buying one of these.  I&#x27;ve owned it for a couple of years now and I have no idea why I haven&#x27;t replaced it yet but I am on Amazon at this time to do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issues with it are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The guard teeth are weak and are guaranteed to break on you so go ahead and buy spare guards.&lt;br /&gt;2.  If you try to use this on battery power alone the power is very week and won&#x27;t cut your hair properly.&lt;br /&gt;3.  If you try to solve #2 but keeping it plugged in when you cut your hair the horribly designed USB cord connection will constantly come unplugged on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily with a little cut tape I&#x27;ve kept this thing in use but even that isn&#x27;t allowing the cord to function properly now so it&#x27;s time to replace this.  I&#x27;m not sure why USB charging was thought to be a good idea, are people really in a situation ever where they need to trim their hair and they have access to USB power but not a regular outlet?</li>
            <li> Overall I like the product most of it because of the cordless option and it does the job, but the combs are very weak and easily broken.</li>
            <li> this does not work for short beard</li>
            <li> After over a month wait on I-parcel i have finally received this item.... Not as thin as expected and blade get heat up very quickly I was concerned if it may heat up more and burn my skin end up taking a lot longer than expected....</li>
            <li> Great, well made product in every way, except the blade is too wide for beard trimming</li>
            <li> Lasted 3 years.  I guess I can&#x27;t expect more.</li>
            <li> It satisfies my requirements and its very handy to use uncorded. A pity that its only 110V, when travelling a transformer is needed</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have to cut my hair for my job every 2 weeks and this trimmer does the job well.  I love using the USB to charge.  That is such a convience.  I highly recommend.  Wish it had a fading attachment though.</li>
            <li> Excente producto, gracias.....</li>
            <li> powerful enough, but the length was not controlled very well</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but they never last more than 6 months. I&#x27;ve gone through two of these in a year... they suddenly just stop working after regular use (once or twice weekly, max).</li>
            <li> so far one of the better trimmers i&#x27;ve owned and i seem to go through them, the wash functionality is great it feels better constructed than competitive brands at the same price point, it is larger and heavier than other brands i&#x27;ve owned, the actual blades give a more comfortable cut, it remains to be seen if they stay sharp, this seems to be where all the other brands fall down, the blades become dull or even a bit rusty.</li>
            <li> Good product. It has lasted the test of time and is still keeping my facial hair minimal.</li>
            <li> Cut great easy to clean need more goodies with it.</li>
            <li> Very well built ! excellent quality ! if you&#x27;re planning to use it to shave your head or trim your beard, then its the best choice ! it does&#x27;nt trim down to the skin which isnt ideal if you&#x27;re planning to remove all your hair !</li>
            <li> I have bought this product thinking that it will work forever. I used once it worked and when i tried using it for the second time it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since i tried charging it but nothing helps. Its just purely a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> works great.  I use these every other day to keep head trimmed. the brushes on the head are soft on scalp as you trim. I pretty much always use them in boost mode. Have had no issues with leaving them off the charger for a week at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these clippers were great for a bit; But they no longer charge. The plug is corroded probably from water. DONT get them wet. Even though they say they are waterproof. Then, when I tried to reach the Remington via email they never responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great clippers for the first year, then they are disposable.</li>
            <li> Great power hair cut machine. with different attachments it serves your different hair cut needs. Easy to use safely. It has a great recharble battery which lasts longer in one charge.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend as a Christmas gift, but the item package is not an official printed manufacture box of Remington, the box looks like a warehouse or refurbished box, not retail one. I was really disappointment about this item, based on this poor product package, I doubt the quality of product as well. I won&#x27;t give this to my friend as a gift.</li>
            <li> Product looks cool and ergonomic design with backlit adds to its attractive appearance. VERY sharp and precise during hair trimming. Charge holds up-- but then again I don&#x27;t take so much time cutting my hair. Has many features, and much easier to clean than my previous Sharper Image groomer.</li>
            <li> this can not trim beards, there is no small settings or attachments and it is a very large trimmer. do not buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 10 months now to shave my head every 1-2 weeks. Still works great. I get about 10-12 uses before recharging. Four stars because recharging takes forever. I can&#x27;t comment on the guards because I don&#x27;t use them. The cordless aspect is great and if the battery dies during a cut you can just plug it in with the recharging cord and keep cutting.</li>
            <li> Great product by a great company, the settings are perfect and give you a perfect, even, and clean trim to your beard(which is all i use it for so i cant give a review on how it does for haircuts). For the money you spend and the quality of the job this trimmer does you will be extremely pleased with it, best trimmer i have used.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to clean.  Only complaint is easy to hit button that causes guard to slip while in use. Have cut multiple &amp;#34;holes&amp;#34; in head during use.</li>
            <li> clippers are two big for beard ..i dont want to return it but i dont recommend it to any one who wants to trim beard ..its good for cutting long hairs like the barbers.</li>
            <li> found one that works like its supposed to!!!!</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to keep clean, but I like everything else about it. It cuts beautifully.</li>
            <li> excellent recommending</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic thank you</li>
