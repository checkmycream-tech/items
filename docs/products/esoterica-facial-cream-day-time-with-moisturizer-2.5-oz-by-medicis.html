            <li> I have really sensitive skin, so this caused a small outbreak of acne around my cheeks and nose.</li>

            <li> My freckles have faded drastically, and the dark patch under my eye is gone, and my acne scars are faded and almost gone.</li>
            <li> The yellow logo makes my foundation makeup  too thick.</li>
            <li> The fading is subtle and it&#x27;s not a miracle, but I also don&#x27;t have further breakouts when using.</li>
            <li> and I have little dis coloration on my face.</li>
            <li> It was so embarassing because it always looked like a had a little moustache or five o&#x27;clock shadow there.  </li>

            <li> The delivery and service were great.  Sadly the product was not good for me.  I became terribly allergic and developed blisters everywhere!</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer and fade cream</li>
            <li> I decided to try Esoterica before turning to a dermatologist.  I am so glad I did.  I just started using the product and already notice a change after 2 days!  Maybe I am just wishing, and I should have taken a before picture, but I really feel this is making a difference.  I was a bit worried about all the comments about the \\&quot;smell\\&quot;.  I was expecting it to smell like a foot or worse, BUT IT DOESNT SMELL!  In fact, the scent is very pleasant and smells refreshing.  But I guess everyone is entitled to their opinions...I will continue to use this and hope my skin keeps getting lighter and more even toned!</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal! I had some darker spots on my fact and around my eyes and after a month of usage its all gone.  Also, it makes my skin smoother. I saw my family after being away for a few months and they were shocked about the difference in my skin tone.  Beautiful!</li>
            <li> On time and good product as well</li>
            <li> no change in skin tone</li>
            <li> This product shipped fast, thank you! I wish the scent was a little more pleasing, but has been several days now and I guess I&#x27;m getting used to it. The cream feels good on my skin. My skin tends to look a little oily after a few hours, so sometimes I wash my face and then apply more. I use this in conjunction with the Esoterica Facial Cream for Night Time as well. I am see very slight results so far and think this may actually work on my dark spots long term.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Amazon is the only place that ships it for a good price, great for dark skinned females. I have been using this product for years and I have little dis coloration on my face.</li>
            <li> I had melasma on my upper lip due to oral contraceptives.  Had no idea what it was until I started reading articles online.  It was so embarassing because it always looked like a had a little moustache or five o&#x27;clock shadow there.  This product (used in conjunction with the nighttime product) worked wonders!  I would wash my face &amp; then gently rub it in and give it a couple of minutes to soak in before applying lotion, makeup, etc.  Has no odor whatsoever.  It took about 2-3 months of doing this morning and night to fully go away but sooo worth it if you do have a medical problem like I did, hooray!</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.  My complexion has improved.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for over 35 years. They work for me. I use daily. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It work better than on my skin. All the other fantasy brand name strip my skin of it natural oil. I would recommend this to anyone who want a clear skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and I think the ingredience has changed. I&#x27;ve been looking for it, and finally found it, at Amozon</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, price ok. And product really does lighten your skin and, removes dark circles and spots but you must use it twice and, be patient.. Can&#x27;t find product in regular stores anymore.. thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> I order the pink day cream. Instead, the day cream with sun screen yellow logo sent. I am stocked sending it back due to my work schedule.  I am currently using one of it. I will definitely review the product.  I miss the pink logo face cream because it makes my make up flawless.  The yellow logo makes my foundation makeup  too thick.</li>
            <li> It really works and is not too greasy. I like how it feels in the skin and the soft scent. My sister tried it too and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I ordered Esoterica facial cream, but what I received was regular esoterica cream.  I was very disappointed I did not get the facial cream.  I like the products but I already had the regular cream.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR YOUR SKIN WITH CONSISTENT USE. I JUST PURCHASE ANOTHER JAR OF THIS CREAM.</li>
            <li> I love this version of this product.  The night and SPF versions are a bit sticky.  This goes on well and feels great.  The fading is subtle and it&#x27;s not a miracle, but I also don&#x27;t have further breakouts when using.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for over 30 yrs.  It last a long time too, only need a little to spread on</li>
            <li> A Good product to use</li>
            <li> Maybe it would of worked better if I would of exfoliate first so this cream could penetrate better. I&#x27;m not for sure if it woukd of made a difference or not. It was a better moisturizer than fade cream. I didn&#x27;t make me break out so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> Esoterica keeps my skin moist and safe from the sun. Excellent if you have dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for over ten years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful!...i&#x27;m already seeing results...it&#x27;s only been two weeks!...i&#x27;ve recommende it to my beautician and coworkers...three others have already ordered</li>
            <li> I love this fragranonce and they don&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or. sticky.  I also like the thicknesss and that they are not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have used esoterica cream since I was a teenager, it still does the trick on freckles!</li>
            <li> this cream is a great cream that ive used for many many many years. its always taken care of my skin and kept the scares off my face</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing! I decided to give it a try because I wanted to fade my freckles, some brown patches I had under my eye, as well as a few acne scars. Don&#x27;t expect results right away, because it does take some time. I really started to see results after about a month. Be aware that this cream may cause acne, depending on your skin type of course. I have really sensitive skin, so this caused a small outbreak of acne around my cheeks and nose. HOWEVER, after using it twice daily for a few weeks, my skin got used to it and it no longer causes me to break out. I found that it works best if applied with a cotton ball. Using my fingers just caused more oil, which meant more acne and oily skin. Now that I have been using this for a little over a month, I have seen an amazing improvement. It has actually helped reduce acne, I rarely get any now, and when I do, they are small and hard to see. My freckles have faded drastically, and the dark patch under my eye is gone, and my acne scars are faded and almost gone. It also faded the darkness under my eyes, and made my skin have an even tone and look bright and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this cream again. Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time,it&#x27;s work on my face since I started using it. Yes it&#x27;s lightens my dark or brownish on my face, I really like it.</li>
