            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Still my favorite gel foam and has been for years and years!</li>
            <li>I received Style Sexy Hair.</li>
            <li>It might work better on hair</li>
            <li>I love this gel</li>
            <li>Was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>The gel foam is OK</li>
            <li>The product gives hair full body with a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair so easy to style.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this when it was available in Walgreen and Wegmans.</li>
            <li>My hair is silver and not only does this give me a great style that holds up to humidity, but it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my hair.</li>
            <li>Works great for short hair.</li>
            <li>I liked it much better when it was SHORT SEXY HAIR.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any more volume in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it and the price it right.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick mailing to me.</li>
            <li>Great product for short, fine hair as it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>This give my short, fine hair volume!</li>
            <li>What I received did not work like the Short Sexy Hair product I had used before.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Some products make my hair look like a funny color.</li>
            <li>This always does the trick for my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The turn-around for receipt was much sooner than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair appear much thicker.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way, I was so happy to have found this on AMAZON</li>
            <li>Be sure to shake the can before each use, and give the pump only a short squeeze, because it foams up in your hand and you don&#x27;t want to use too much.  </li>
            <li>I am going back to Big sexy hair root pump plus</li>
            <li>It does tend to cut the shine, so my hair isn&#x27;t as shiny when I use it, but the trade-off is well worth it to get the extra volume and let my hair style hold</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the same company but definitely not the same product.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple fo times to figure out the pump action.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely not a good choice for those of us with fine hair that can be weighed down easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin, fine, straight and silky.  </li>
            <li>This new formula is harder to work with after drying your hair and it tends to make it greasy looking.</li>

            <li> This new formula is harder to work with after drying your hair and it tends to make it greasy looking.</li>
            <li> It lies flat on my head and needs something to give it body and texture.  </li>
            <li> The gel goes a long way and continues to foam as it sits in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is less expensive, so I purchased a quantity.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my damp hair after I shampoo, but you can also add it to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I received this gel foam in a black can with only 5 ounces of product and not in the silver can with 5.3 ounces.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely NOT.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS GETTING HARDER TO FIND.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to give a little volume to my fine hair, but it was so heavy on my hair that I tried using it several times and my hair just felt dirty and sticky.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually one to give a product several chances and don&#x27;t usually throw unused products away, but this just made my hair feel too gross.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a VERY small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> Does not make hair stiff.</li>
            <li> It is awful and was a big waste of money.</li>

            <li> I did not receive this product. I received Style Sexy Hair. I&#x27;m sure the same company but definitely not the same product. What I received did not work like the Short Sexy Hair product I had used before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when it was available in Walgreen and Wegmans. I ordered this online when the product was discontinued. This stuff online is NOT the same stuff, even though the can is the same. It is awful and was a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the same can as the product described  as &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; hair product.  I wanted short hair product in yellow can</li>
            <li> I purchased this to give a little volume to my fine hair, but it was so heavy on my hair that I tried using it several times and my hair just felt dirty and sticky.  I&#x27;m usually one to give a product several chances and don&#x27;t usually throw unused products away, but this just made my hair feel too gross.  It might work better on hair that&#x27;s thicker but it&#x27;s definitely not a good choice for those of us with fine hair that can be weighed down easily.</li>
            <li> I did not get this someone subtitled another product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any more volume in my hair.  I am going back to Big sexy hair root pump plus</li>
            <li> I love this gel it is great. It gives my hair lots of body and I can control my curls which is especially nice living in Florida</li>
            <li> The product gives hair full body with a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser no longer carries it so I resorted to an online purchase.  I love that it is less expensive, so I purchased a quantity.  What a deal!</li>
            <li> The turn-around for receipt was much sooner than I anticipated.  I am very happy with the product.  It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it since Fall 2013.  However, I ordered several cans and each and every one of them had multiple dents in the container which leads me to the conclusion that whomever sold this on Amazon bought up SECONDS.  This should have been advertised as such.  Would I buy from this seller again?  Absolutely NOT.</li>
            <li> The only product for short hair. My hair is silver and not only does this give me a great style that holds up to humidity, but it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my hair. Some products make my hair look like a funny color.</li>
            <li> Perfect as always.  This always does the trick for my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for short hair. Only takes a VERY small amount to do the job.Thanks for the quick mailing to me.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says it will do. Makes your hair so easy to style.  Give a lot of volume too.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, I was so happy to have found this on AMAZON</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product. This give my short, fine hair volume!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; formula in this product....I liked it much better when it was SHORT SEXY HAIR.  This new formula is harder to work with after drying your hair and it tends to make it greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I have very fine fly away hair, this product gives me the body I need for styling. Does not make hair stiff.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND IT IS GETTING HARDER TO FIND.  EVERY TIME THEY COME OUT WITH A PRODUCT TO MY LIKING, THEY DECIDE TO DISCONTINUE.  HOPE THIS ONE STAYS ON THE MARKET.  GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple fo times to figure out the pump action.  The gel goes a long way and continues to foam as it sits in your hand.  It gives my hair the volume it needs.  The only thing I dislike about this product is that the foam continues to come out of the container and it has to be wiped several times.  I will keep this in stock at my house.</li>
            <li> Great product for short, fine hair as it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite gel foam and has been for years and years!</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, fine, straight and silky.  It lies flat on my head and needs something to give it body and texture.  This foam adds body and volume, and enables my hair to hold the &amp;#34;tease&amp;#34; when I tease it.  It makes my hair appear much thicker.  It does tend to cut the shine, so my hair isn&#x27;t as shiny when I use it, but the trade-off is well worth it to get the extra volume and let my hair style hold it&#x27;s shape when I tease it.  As other reviewers have noted, a little goes a long way. Be sure to shake the can before each use, and give the pump only a short squeeze, because it foams up in your hand and you don&#x27;t want to use too much.  I use this on my damp hair after I shampoo, but you can also add it to dry hair.  I am very satisfied and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I received this gel foam in a black can with only 5 ounces of product and not in the silver can with 5.3 ounces.  The gel foam is OK but I wonder if it is what I thought I was buying?</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I get a lot of control and volume in my hair. I would recommend it and the price it right.</li>
