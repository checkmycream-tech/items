            <li>this works great!!</li>
            <li>but I read all the reviews saying it was the best</li>
            <li>so I put some Aveeno lotion on, the combo is perfect.  </li>

            <li>it works very , very good</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t use any good towels when you&#x27;re wiping your face off afterwards because it WILL stain them!</li>
            <li>Since using it (about a month ago) my breakouts have stopped and the ones I had are healing beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I am happy to write that my daughter&#x27;s complexion has improved dramatically.  </li>
            <li>We are really happy and will continue ordering.</li>
            <li>No amount of moisturizer could combat the flaky, irritated skin I experienced after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li>it works great</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Nano cleanse is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>My daughter has experienced acne since 7th grade.  </li>
            <li>Seller is great but product did nothing to help his acne</li>
            <li>It really is great for clearing and cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I am really happy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results and I would recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>The product is inexpensive and you get a lot for your money which is great</li>
            <li>i still have one or 2 pimples here and there (period acne), but i am completly happy with my results.</li>
            <li>She has great skin</li>
            <li>and this got great reviews</li>
            <li>SO many years ago!!</li>
            <li>why I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>Most irritated I&#x27;ve ever seen my skin!!</li>
            <li>Not abrasive but very effective.</li>
            <li>Been of so many products in the market like proactiv+, zaine skin set produtcts from philippines, Olay and thailand products but nothing works great on my face until I read out wonderful comments about this Nanocleanse in Amazon.com</li>
            <li>Amazing cleanser!</li>
            <li>I is amazing my son&#x27;s skin is clearing up so well!</li>
            <li>is loving the product!</li>
            <li>this is the best facewash I ever use I love it</li>
            <li>I am about three weeks in and even my aesthetician has commented on the remarkable improvement of my skin&#x27;s condition.  </li>
            <li>Great - works better than Proactive!</li>
            <li>Then I use the Nanocleanse with the Olay Pro-x skin cleansing brush and follow up with a good moisturizer (changes depending on the season and my skin that night).  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s almost a good feeling - like</li>
            <li>Will keep using for now, thought it was good for the price and would like to see what happens in 60 days.</li>
            <li>May be good</li>
            <li>So I wanted to use this a good amount of time before I wrote a review.</li>
            <li>I probably use a good nickel size.</li>
            <li>It still lasts me a good 3-4 months before I need to get another bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tryed Almost every thing out there drug store wise, proactive, nothing&#x27;s helped in the slightest.</li>
            <li>I have been assured it is good to use</li>
            <li>It will sting on your skin but in a good way.</li>
            <li>It was a good try, but didnt help my acne problem.</li>
            <li>good .</li>
            <li>Good luck with whatever you choose</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>it is a good product but needs to be part of a program.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good luck.  </li>
            <li>Good soap.  </li>
            <li>So this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer!!!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a magical serum that made my face flawless, but it was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>In terms of my acne - words cannot adequately express what a WONDER this product is!!!</li>
            <li>But this was not the one, good but not as effective as we would have liked.   </li>
            <li>My teenagers use this product and they love it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this face wash!</li>
            <li>Whoever created this precious cleanser is a GENIOUS!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>I love this face wash!</li>
            <li>but my face feels and looks better!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more please with this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how to start this amazing review.</li>
            <li>this product is freaking amazing...</li>
            <li>but what it has done to my face is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I never write reviews but this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Since they have reformulated this product it&#x27;s lost its amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using the benzoyl peroxide on my forehead, as it cleared up my spots nicely.  </li>
            <li>It honestly didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>Really liked this product.</li>
            <li>Splash your face with warm water, place a dime size amount on your palm and</li>
            <li>This is the perfect cleanser, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and  it feels  so nice....</li>
            <li>I was using DDF, which is also a great product, but after 3 days I am seeing a significant difference in my face.</li>
            <li>Great if you work out or ride bike and use sun tan lotion as it leaves face clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong though</li>
            <li>We switched to the Acne Free system and we had fairly good results</li>
            <li>So far we are really happy with this product and would recommend it!</li>
            <li>We have tried everything from Acne free to Proactive and this is superior.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy so far with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>So far it is working great!!</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best treatment ever!!</li>
            <li>I honestly dont even have to use this product more than once a day...</li>
            <li>This has been the best face wash for my 12 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>and it did a significant amount of good within three days.&lt;br /&gt;Wel</li>
            <li>I would love to recommend this product coz so great makes me more beautiful and get back my confidence...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it one more month</li>
            <li>Although I still experience a pimple here and there (immediately apply the acsonix to fight it), it is 99% better</li>
            <li>It has really done a great job controlling acne</li>
            <li>It clears my skin better and faster than proactiv.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been getting as many breakouts-</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but I had better luck with another product.</li>
            <li>More along the lines of a home chemical peel.</li>
            <li>Kept trying so many products throughout Amazon and all of them made me break out.</li>
            <li>So many of them had paid reviews</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love you</li>
            <li>I think it would have worked better if he had used all three steps two times a day.  </li>
            <li>I believe if he washed his face with Nanocleanse two times a day he would see even more of an improvement.</li>
            <li>I think my problem may be more hormonal ( I&#x27;m 21)</li>
            <li>it says to as it&#x27;s my morning routine, it could of worked better if ised at directed.</li>
            <li>I feel better with my face even though with me my breakouts are from my hormones</li>
            <li>I used proactive for about a year and my opinion is that this product is way better.</li>
            <li>but my skin is much better than it was a month ago....</li>
            <li>I like this face wash because it makes my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great product but don&#x27;t overuse as it tends to be very drying.</li>
            <li>Okay for the rest of my skin washing after a workout.  </li>
            <li>I plan to use 4 more days.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My complexion is better after 1 month.</li>
            <li>Be sure to fallow as directed per instructions.</li>
            <li>Then I use Pronexin scrub on top of it.</li>
            <li>I love Nanocleanse</li>
            <li>I leave the wash on my skin for more than about 60 seconds, it starts burning.  </li>
            <li>I Love That Stuff</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using more than once a day or else</li>
            <li>Worked better than any face wash</li>
            <li>My daughter has struggled with acne for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li>LOVE Nanocleanse.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions.</li>
            <li>I rub for about 2 minutes then splash water on my face and rub once more before I wash it all off.</li>
            <li>My acne is mostly hormone based</li>
            <li>I am ordering more for her.</li>
            <li>blemish free!</li>
            <li>Their are so many acne products out</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work any better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This stuff is stronger than most on the market.  </li>
            <li>love this product and recommend it to anyone who is struggling with acne.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used an antibiotic for acne in over 9 months and my face looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>Maybe its meant for people with more severe acne.</li>
            <li>then looks FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing how smooth my skin is now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not some magic potion</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really healthy for your skin</li>
            <li>Ok  </li>
            <li>She tried proactive but that seemed to make her break out even more</li>
            <li>Overall - I love this product  and am so happy that I purchased it!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>My husband did some research and convinced me to try it out because it was rated as top 10 acne products.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is a scrub.  </li>
            <li>i was covered mostly on my cheecks and chin.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I need a quarter or more just to cover face and neck.</li>
            <li>Worked ok.</li>
            <li>Now I just wash it with warm water, make sure it&#x27;s clean and drink water.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling I get after I use this product on my face very clean</li>
            <li>FINALLY found a product that I LOVE!!!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>clean face with warm water &amp;</li>
            <li>Thanks to the reviews I read about it, I found them to be true, thank you good reviews!</li>
            <li>I read some reviews on this product and have seen some pretty good responses about it, so</li>
            <li>I like the smell which is very important to me, tried many others and they all smelled like sewage, this one has a light smell</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>it will actually burn your face good shipper good product would recommend</li>
            <li>However my face is very soft and feels great.</li>
            <li>This product works great to clear acne!  </li>
            <li>I bought my very first bottle and honestly for a while</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my face feels after each wash.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks more smooth</li>
            <li>I used to not be able to leave the house with out make up on, because I was so embarrassed of my skin, but now, I feel completely comfortable without</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t smell good but does that really matter?</li>
            <li>You know what I did write a good review about half way through the bottle, but by time the end of the bottle hit I wasn&#x27;t at all happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost one month, I was pretty excited about getting this product based on all the good reviews</li>
            <li>used it twice a day as directed feeling so clean after wash love the smell too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nanoccleanse is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nanocleanse is too strong for my face.</li>
            <li>Really good stuff, I highly recommend it for your teen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have scarring which I hope will vanish over time, but I love the smooth and clean feeling I get with this acne wash.  </li>
            <li>i have used many products on my face; acne free, proactive, clean and clear,ect.</li>
            <li>, this works great and no dry out !</li>
            <li>Just keep doing your moisturizing regimen and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>At night I use a more mild facewash to avoid irritation.</li>
            <li>I am super glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I love how Nanocleanse has changed my life and allowed me to live more carefree and confident.</li>
            <li>Nanocleanse has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Has made a huge difference in my cystic acne.</li>
            <li>and I saw a huge difference in their skin!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has truly made a HUGE difference in my life.</li>
            <li>I gave it an honest shot, but my skin really doesn&#x27;t like this formula.</li>
            <li>I have tried many over the counter and prescription products, with no longer term success.  </li>
            <li>As a light sulfur smell</li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;m acne free.</li>
            <li>but I will tell you what I do, which is very close to what the label says -- I spread the product on my face, attempting to avoid my eye area, and then add a bit of warm water.  </li>
            <li>and then I wash it off and apply oil free moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My rating was based on the results of Nanocleanse - keep my face acne free or clearing up acne.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my face acne free.</li>
            <li>, i am acne free.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I honestly wish I had taken before and after pictures, because everyone is always commenting on how clear and smooth my skin looks now!</li>
            <li>We have tried many other products and considering this is all she is using and a moisturizer we are happy.</li>
            <li>just felt really clean and smooth</li>
            <li>and it does keep face clean and free of acne.  </li>
            <li>but that is easily remedied with a nose-strip and a quick cleanse with Nanocleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and his skin has improved significantly.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth everyone trying!</li>
            <li>My original review was a raving 5 star.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for one wk and have noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>this does work great however if you have a sensative face do not leave on very long</li>
            <li>1) clean face with just water, and damp skin  </li>
            <li>There are some exfoliant-like beads in the cleanser that lightly clean and get at that oiliness</li>
            <li>So again, are hoping the continued use of this will help with getting her face clean.  </li>
            <li>and she does feel this helps to clean it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft looks more healthy</li>
            <li>Not to mention that the rest of my skin looks polished, clear, and feels fantastic!!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face a little red but it smells great, has great ingredients</li>
            <li>This stripped my skin of its natural oils which made my skin super oily which caused more break outs!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally working, so go ahead and make fun. :-P  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken them to the dermatologist since then and was told that a simple benzoil P wash would have been good.  </li>
            <li>, i have only used this product a couple of times, but so far so good, it makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>I really wish i had the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula, it seems to have gotten better reviews.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied with this latest order.</li>
            <li>But any who I&#x27;ve used nanocleanse for 3mnths and just ordered some more it really does keep my skin under control</li>
            <li>but my  face is starting to look  really good  now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to rub for an over extended amount of time, or feel that I really have to work in this product thinking it will help me achieve better results.  </li>
            <li>remember this needs to be on your face for about a min or so for it to have the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>Very nice product, did exactly as it said and cleared my face quickly, will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li>As an accurate graduate with little to no acne, my girlfriend recommended this saying it changed her skin, helped with oil control, and made her complexion great.</li>
            <li>At first it was like rubbing fire on your face, but if you rub it gently it&#x27;s fine and for no longer then stated on the bottle.</li>
            <li>In the morning I just do a quick scrub with the Nanocleanse in the shower.</li>
            <li>If you have Mild To Severe acne this can help.  </li>
            <li>Nanocleanse is a great facial cleanser, I really like the way my skin feels after using the product.</li>
            <li>This product is super.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mild acne since I was a kid..</li>
            <li>I use just a dab to wash my face twice a day and it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Super price.</li>
            <li>I got a quick response from them</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my son because he has mild acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have not stopped using my regular Oxy products; this product is a superb addition to the overall arsenal.</li>
            <li>Of course it brought a ton of stuff to the surface but it cleared up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I used a mild antibiotic for my acne for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I cannot express more love for another facial cleanser...</li>
            <li>I have mild acne.</li>
            <li>This scrub will get rid of most (I need acne meds too) of your acne, leave your face feeling clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>The very next day after my first try I saw major awesome results.</li>
            <li>It has not once irritated my skin and it has made my skin acne free within the first week.</li>
            <li>So, sure I still get 1-2, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>After the first week, I noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I have only been taking it for about a week and already have amazing results.</li>
            <li>After a week or so you do not even notice the burn and trust me, it is worth every second of &amp;#34;discomfort&amp;#34; because the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>It took awhile, but was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is not smelly, not greasy/oily, and leaves my face feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>So far I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t 100% been clear but it is so much better than it ever has been.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>I struggled with adult acne for years and experienced constant breakouts.  </li>
            <li>My skin stays clear and healthy looking all the time since I&#x27;ve had this product (even during that time of the month).  </li>
            <li>so I think the more natural route was the way to go for me.</li>
            <li>And on the rare occasions when I go through a breakout</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the price</li>
            <li>Worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I honestly tried a lot of different products and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working very nice so far and hasn&#x27;t left any skin redness.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth now, soft and almost blemish free for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth, soft and blemish free for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>man were they right</li>
            <li>This face wash has really helped clean up my face.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face soft and clean though!</li>
            <li>Best facewash for acne prone skin, only need a little.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s better than something like Proactive, but seems to be good so far!</li>
            <li>It definitely helps clear up acne and the results were surprisingly soon.</li>
            <li>It is really nice using a product that kills AND prevents acne AND DEOSNT DRY my skin.</li>
            <li>and my scin is still looking great follow the directions and do not scrub too hard</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>what exactly happened</li>
            <li>It made me break out more than I have in the last 10 years!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been exactly a month of using it</li>
            <li>I have tried many products and this is the only one that cleared my acne within a month&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>but I had to use so many different washes and stringents and creams to keep it at bay.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this I didn&#x27;t avoid my eye area</li>
            <li>Thank you so much !</li>
            <li>i first ordered pronexin and that was so garbage</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been searching for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products so I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>this is most likely because the Nanocleanse was cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li>If you are considering getting this, you ABSOLUTELY MUST GET IT!</li>
            <li>This product works at first, maybe in two to three weeks you see a change.</li>
            <li>it still isnt pretty skin...</li>
            <li>Pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think with nanocleanse and proper dieting it could be a magical potion</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin condition is different and takes time, but I&#x27;m glad I started using this product because my face is acne-free.</li>
            <li>Works well at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty consistent with it using as directed for five days now, this morning being my sixth.  </li>
            <li>By day three, this and my preferred moisturizer had given me smooth, soft skin.  </li>
            <li>and you see a difference within the first 3 days.</li>
            <li>I would say it completely cleared his face in about 2 weeks, but we did notice significant improvement in about 3 days.</li>
            <li>If you have even mildly sensitive skin, which most acne sufferers have, I suggest you look elsewhere for products specifically designed to treat sensitive as well as acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>At first he didn&#x27;t mind it too much.</li>
            <li>The acne is not completely gone but looks a ton better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just an odor while washing, but it stays with you pretty much throughout the day.</li>
            <li>At first it burnt my face but than I realized I was  putting to much on my face.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry skin like most acne cleansers.</li>
            <li>I had a super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it was strong enough to combat my acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 19 now and have pretty much tried everything, from the cheap Walmart face washes, to proactive, and nothing ever gave lasting results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s does dry out my face some, but I use Olay moisturizer right after I wash my face and its fine.</li>
            <li>One last thing, I go to an esthetician every 3-4 months for a light chemical peel which also makes my face look fresh and new.</li>
            <li>It also feels greasy on my skin and the walnut shells meant for exfoliation are not ground nearly fine enough.  </li>
            <li>I get huge cysts and break outs all over my forehead almost daily.  </li>
            <li>His forehead and underneath his nose was absolutely covered with acne.</li>
            <li>so I needed to find something that would work fast.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping too...</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would make a difference for me</li>
            <li>It did not work as fast as the time was stated.</li>
            <li>I found Nanocleanse and have to say it really works.  </li>
            <li>I was very optimistic after reading the reviews but very dissapointed after my kids started using it.  </li>
            <li>reason why it still gets 3 stars is because this product did make my complexion much brighter and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleasner I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for 2 months</li>
            <li>so much I don&#x27;t rinse it off</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really need it either.</li>
            <li>I tried everything like Bye Bye Blemish, Acne Free and Proactive&amp;#60;~a total JOKE.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing again real soon.</li>
            <li>He told me it didn&#x27;t really help his acne at all.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to notice some changes .</li>
            <li>but if you want real results go for this...ps.i</li>
            <li>The seller is also very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the way this cleanser smells</li>
            <li>some reviews also reviews on amazon were very helpful as well.</li>
            <li>thanks to Nanocleanse</li>
            <li>so much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really cant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and like I said I wanted to try Clenziderm by Obagi and didnt like it as much as this.</li>
            <li>the ingredients from the imposter lists Glycolic Acid instead of sulfur and is made in Provo, Utah NOT Orem, Utah where the real product is made.   </li>
            <li>It is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>Feels like I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and nothing really helped.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone.very reasonable price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a scrub and works really well.</li>
            <li>I SWEAR TO GOD after one use of nano cleanse my skin felt soooo much softer.....</li>
            <li>One night it was really hurting</li>
            <li>Only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but for clear skin, who cares.  </li>
            <li>I use day and night doesn&#x27;t dry out face and clears up your face pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>I found Nanocleanse when searching for natural cleansers and thought I might take the more \\&quot;organic\\&quot; route, but something still with some key ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and finally feel confident to go without foundation.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many face washes and this is one stands far above them all.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has been able to keep my skin clear for months.  </li>
            <li>It also smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>When I do break out due to hormones, the acne seems to go away faster and heal better with Nanocleanse.</li>
            <li>I still need to use other products to diminish the discolored scars but I am confident that with time they will disappear.  </li>
            <li>My son uses it and at first it really helped clear his acne</li>
            <li>This stuff is not too strong, not too stinky, and doesn&#x27;t overly dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>When I use it, my existing acne dies very quickly and there is no new acne at all.</li>
            <li>Seriously, i have tried so many face washes and this one wins. !</li>
            <li>A few months back I read an article with some amazing success she had by using two products.</li>
            <li>This is the first cleanser that has worked on my adult acne.</li>
            <li>it can make your face pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>I started getting adult acne for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>I have bought this multiple times and so far it works fine</li>
            <li>Less IS more in this case.</li>
            <li>I always had issues with blackheads on my nose, and  I have previously tried proactive, murad and many over the counter others.</li>
            <li>I tried so many products and finally found something that actually works.  </li>
            <li>but that is one of the main ingredients to fight acne.</li>
            <li>I am a mild to moderate acne sufferer.</li>
            <li>Moderate when I am using products that dont work I will have about 20 pimples and mild when the product works somewhat but doesnt get rid of everything...</li>
            <li>Now as I am older the acne has moved to my chin and cheek area</li>
            <li>I have had mild to severe acne since I was in Middle school.</li>
            <li>(I thought) that makes this better than the next face wash and actually has drawbacks like:</li>
            <li>In reference to their claim, his face wasn&#x27;t completely clear in 72 hours, but already looked a little bit better within the first 2 days.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very aware of facial products and treatments, I was trained for three years.</li>
            <li>Followed the directions, and sure enough, within a few days the clearing up was in full swing.  </li>
            <li>Her overall facial complexion has improved tremendously and immediately after the first week of application!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for anyone with acne to try this</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for those who have Cystic Acne...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>so I had really high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>I doubt i will re order(With the pricebeing high, esp.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend Nanocleanse and Pronexin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying this product</li>
            <li>yet the rating was high.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a great doctor and understands that I have been struggling for so long and was so pleased I had finally find something that did not cause my skin to break out even worse, peel, flake or become incredibly sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and this is the first acne product that did not dry skin, I wish I would have found this product long ago.</li>
            <li>I will admit I use a little more than they say to.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m praying with a little more time it does</li>
            <li>it could be a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This product will clear your fast in a matter of days.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old and up until about two years ago I had pretty clear skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, everyday and have never had better results.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and</li>
            <li>It seems to me, from reading ALL the reviews and my research and experiences, that nanocleanse works OK on the big red angry acne, but causes problems when dealing with more mild cases.  </li>
            <li>Nice value, only need a little bit.</li>
            <li>so you end up scrubbing away at your newly inflamed skin.</li>
            <li>Tried everything from clean and clear to proactive and either it didn&#x27;t work or my face was peeling from how dry it got.</li>
            <li>It may cause a slight redness, but it goes away and your face really does feel clean.</li>
            <li>I massage my face for about 30 seconds, gently, and let the product sit for at least a minute... maybe more.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried Nanocleanse on a whim and WOW!</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it burns your face for the first week.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using this product because I decided to try other face scrubs instead, but I will most likely use it once a week just till I finish the tube, and will probably not be purchasing another</li>
            <li>I have now developed a few more pimples and the old ones have not gone.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just buying my second bottle, so this stuff really lasts!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this wash for several years and haven&#x27;t built up an &amp;#34;immunity&amp;#34; to it, like I have with so many other washes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many acne cleansers in the past including proactive.</li>
            <li>and my skin has cleared up almost completely!  </li>
            <li>.............remember what we put in our body reflects on the outside ;)  </li>
            <li>I also bought the Acnetame pills as well, so far no complaints!</li>
            <li>I mean I am happy when other products dont give me new pimples and eventually kills the pimples I already had</li>
            <li>have two teen-aged boys who I knew would not go though a series of cleansing steps.(lets face it, after a long day, who wants to spend all that extra time in the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;The product shipped quickly</li>
            <li>I know the... overwhelming stress and let down when you wash your face constantly and nothing works.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and soft!</li>
            <li>Now his face is much more clear of pimples, black heads &amp; red spots.  </li>
            <li>and there &amp; ive been using this product for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, besides more oily skin &amp; it that it leaves my face a little red sometimes.</li>
            <li>I would say at this point, using this face wash for over 2 months, that I am 90% clear.  </li>
            <li>and my face is SO CLEAR.</li>
            <li>It did help clear up some of my face</li>
            <li>It did clear up some, but not drastically so that i would swear by it.</li>
            <li>Product advertised 3 days to clear blackheads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29 and my skin is perfectly clear now.</li>
            <li>She has cystic acne and  since using this product, we have noticed it has helped clear her face up.  </li>
            <li>I apply A&amp;D ointment on my face after using the product at night so my face looks clear and moisturized in the morning.</li>
            <li>not that I wouldnt do ANYTHING for clear skin -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If that is the price for clear skin, who cares.</li>
            <li>As long as she uses it twice a day, her skin stays pretty clear.</li>
            <li>i am noe 98% clear.</li>
            <li>my skin has stayed clear.  </li>
            <li>My 11 year old son has been using this for almost 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li>(Btw...a friend of mine suggested frequently changing his pillow case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 36 year old mom of 4.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult Acne.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 15 year old son.  </li>
            <li>far as I know I didn&#x27;t sign up for any monthly plan like proactive</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>but I have some faith with the progress that I have seen so far that they may be cleared completely.  </li>
            <li>We tried everything for our 13 year old.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 17year old son.</li>
            <li>I have oily and sensitive skin along with eczema.</li>
            <li>Finally a face wash that is gentle enough that it does not overdry my skin but powerful enough to fight acne and keep it gone.</li>
            <li>First product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time that continuously works day after day.</li>
            <li>It helps my skin feel soft &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I think it has done well for my complexion, but it makes your face smell like dirt for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>dealing with adult acne for almost 3 years now.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my teenager because it&#x27;s a natural face wash.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin this may not be the wash for you.  </li>
            <li>Buying for my nephew who says it works very well when used daily.</li>
            <li>Very drying can only use once a day.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked for me; I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>So far my routine in working.</li>
            <li>It took about two month and face cleared completely.</li>
            <li>I was using Murad and it did not work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>I have combination sensitive skin that is prone to acne.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft and its been healing my acne quicker than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>and we also have different sensitives, while others have not so much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally mind it as it&#x27;s absolutely nothing I can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li>i am 30 years old and suffered moslty from cystic acne.</li>
            <li>My (adult) face is breaking out again and this isn&#x27;t clearing the acne like it did before.</li>
            <li>32 years old with breakouts/adult acne on the sides of my face/chin:</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A majority of the cysts occurred on my jawlines, I would normally have both sides covered with these cysts and the second they would clear up, a new batch would begin.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry skin problems after using nanocleanse, chances are you are using too much nanoclense!    </li>
            <li>So it has been about 3 months that I bought this product and its still half full.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s usually about 3 small pimples that clear up quickly, instead of before when I would get 10 or more at a time.</li>
            <li>and I like the results I&#x27;m seeing - less acne and clears up quickly.</li>
            <li>If you have teenage boys, you know how hard it is to get them to use any kind of skin products on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>but you decide how much you want to scrub and how long you want to leave the scrub on.</li>
            <li>My face is pretty clear other than my chin area.</li>
            <li>My skin is also no longer red; I used to have a lot of blotchiness, my skin tone is now completely normal.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about two and a half months with no break outs other than one or two blemishes during the most hormonal time of the month.</li>
            <li>I never had acne as a teen but for some reason as a 33yr old adult now have it..</li>
            <li>I must say, on day one my face felt fresh, despite the slight tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I feel this product is really working and will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li>I definitely do not recommend this for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>(i had the boys put small amounts all around their face) and massage for two minutes, be careful not to get near eyes)&lt;br /&gt;splash face with warm water to rinse and pat face dry.</li>
            <li>I have tried other more expensive products with no results and this product is almost a dream come true.</li>
            <li>I have never had such clear looking skin.  </li>
            <li>but I finally have clear skin.</li>
            <li>The pores on my nose are clear and a lot smaller.</li>
            <li>Not only did the breakouts clear</li>
            <li>I barely had the product on my face and it started to burn.</li>
            <li>so i did start to use twice daily, 45 seconds as my face is sensitive</li>
            <li>I have battled with severe cystic acne my entire adult life...  </li>
            <li>I put it on a damp face - not a wet face but damp-</li>
            <li>I have to find another decent product for dry skin and not change the cleanser becausewell it works with the pimples...</li>
            <li>I have oily acne prone skin and my skin is only somewhat sensitive.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t make my face worse, didn&#x27;t make it exceptionally better either.</li>
            <li>I think its more of a trial and error game.</li>
            <li>I will warn that it took my skin some time to adjust as it can be a little harsh (experienced redness and a little burning during first few weeks of using, but</li>
            <li>My face gets really red and is super dried out.  </li>
            <li>No dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li>I should probably do this routine in the morning also, but I have very sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t use facial scrubs, so I was a bit worried when I first saw the granules in it, but I found this cleanser is very genial and doesn&#x27;t overly dry.</li>
            <li>and you can actually feel it all your face the others I could barely feel on my face, thumbs up, so far no adult acne</li>
            <li>I was ready to buy another supply of his three step system and decided to shop around and see if anything out there had less steps involved.  </li>
            <li>When using this I also recommend using a mask for dark spots and acne scars to clear everything completely.</li>
            <li>I tried EVERYTHING, but the natural ingredients in this product don&#x27;t dry me out or make me have breakouts.</li>
            <li>2) use penny sized amount of nanocleanse (one for left face, another for right face)  3) massage each side until it gets all sticky (usually 2 minutes)  4)</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me, try just using it once at night if using it twice makes your face dry or really red.</li>

            <li> it works very , very good</li>
            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t use any good towels when you&#x27;re wiping your face off afterwards because it WILL stain them!</li>
            <li> Since using it (about a month ago) my breakouts have stopped and the ones I had are healing beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am happy to write that my daughter&#x27;s complexion has improved dramatically.  </li>
            <li> We are really happy and will continue ordering.</li>

            <li> Seller is great but product did nothing to help his acne</li>

            <li> and I am really happy</li>

            <li> and this got great reviews</li>
            <li> SO many years ago!!</li>
            <li> why I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> Most irritated I&#x27;ve ever seen my skin!!</li>
            <li> Not abrasive but very effective.</li>
            <li> Been of so many products in the market like proactiv+, zaine skin set produtcts from philippines, Olay and thailand products but nothing works great on my face until I read out wonderful comments about this Nanocleanse in Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Amazing cleanser!</li>
            <li> I is amazing my son&#x27;s skin is clearing up so well!</li>
            <li> is loving the product!</li>
            <li> this is the best facewash I ever use I love it</li>
            <li> I am about three weeks in and even my aesthetician has commented on the remarkable improvement of my skin&#x27;s condition.  </li>
            <li> Great - works better than Proactive!</li>
            <li> Then I use the Nanocleanse with the Olay Pro-x skin cleansing brush and follow up with a good moisturizer (changes depending on the season and my skin that night).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s almost a good feeling - like</li>
            <li> Will keep using for now, thought it was good for the price and would like to see what happens in 60 days.</li>
            <li> May be good</li>
            <li> So I wanted to use this a good amount of time before I wrote a review.</li>
            <li> I probably use a good nickel size.</li>
            <li> It still lasts me a good 3-4 months before I need to get another bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tryed Almost every thing out there drug store wise, proactive, nothing&#x27;s helped in the slightest.</li>
            <li> I have been assured it is good to use</li>
            <li> It will sting on your skin but in a good way.</li>
            <li> It was a good try, but didnt help my acne problem.</li>
            <li> good .</li>
            <li> Good luck with whatever you choose</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> it is a good product but needs to be part of a program.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good luck.  </li>
            <li> Good soap.  </li>
            <li> So this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer!!!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a magical serum that made my face flawless, but it was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> In terms of my acne - words cannot adequately express what a WONDER this product is!!!</li>
            <li> But this was not the one, good but not as effective as we would have liked.   </li>
            <li> My teenagers use this product and they love it!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this face wash!</li>
            <li> Whoever created this precious cleanser is a GENIOUS!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash!</li>
            <li> but my face feels and looks better!</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more please with this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to start this amazing review.</li>
            <li> this product is freaking amazing...</li>
            <li> but what it has done to my face is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Since they have reformulated this product it&#x27;s lost its amazing results.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using the benzoyl peroxide on my forehead, as it cleared up my spots nicely.  </li>
            <li> It honestly didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product.</li>
            <li> Splash your face with warm water, place a dime size amount on your palm and</li>
            <li> This is the perfect cleanser, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and  it feels  so nice....</li>
            <li> I was using DDF, which is also a great product, but after 3 days I am seeing a significant difference in my face.</li>
            <li> Great if you work out or ride bike and use sun tan lotion as it leaves face clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong though</li>
            <li> We switched to the Acne Free system and we had fairly good results</li>
            <li> So far we are really happy with this product and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> We have tried everything from Acne free to Proactive and this is superior.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy so far with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> So far it is working great!!</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best treatment ever!!</li>
            <li> I honestly dont even have to use this product more than once a day...</li>
            <li> This has been the best face wash for my 12 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> and it did a significant amount of good within three days.&lt;br /&gt;Wel</li>
            <li> I would love to recommend this product coz so great makes me more beautiful and get back my confidence...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it one more month</li>
            <li> Although I still experience a pimple here and there (immediately apply the acsonix to fight it), it is 99% better</li>
            <li> It has really done a great job controlling acne</li>
            <li> It clears my skin better and faster than proactiv.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been getting as many breakouts-</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li> but I had better luck with another product.</li>
            <li> More along the lines of a home chemical peel.</li>
            <li> Kept trying so many products throughout Amazon and all of them made me break out.</li>
            <li> So many of them had paid reviews</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love you</li>
            <li> I think it would have worked better if he had used all three steps two times a day.  </li>
            <li> I believe if he washed his face with Nanocleanse two times a day he would see even more of an improvement.</li>
            <li> I think my problem may be more hormonal ( I&#x27;m 21)</li>
            <li> it says to as it&#x27;s my morning routine, it could of worked better if ised at directed.</li>
            <li> I feel better with my face even though with me my breakouts are from my hormones</li>
            <li> I used proactive for about a year and my opinion is that this product is way better.</li>
            <li> but my skin is much better than it was a month ago....</li>
            <li> I like this face wash because it makes my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product but don&#x27;t overuse as it tends to be very drying.</li>
            <li> Okay for the rest of my skin washing after a workout.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use 4 more days.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My complexion is better after 1 month.</li>
            <li> Be sure to fallow as directed per instructions.</li>
            <li> Then I use Pronexin scrub on top of it.</li>
            <li> I love Nanocleanse</li>
            <li> I leave the wash on my skin for more than about 60 seconds, it starts burning.  </li>
            <li> I Love That Stuff</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using more than once a day or else</li>
            <li> Worked better than any face wash</li>
            <li> My daughter has struggled with acne for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li> LOVE Nanocleanse.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I rub for about 2 minutes then splash water on my face and rub once more before I wash it all off.</li>
            <li> My acne is mostly hormone based</li>
            <li> I am ordering more for her.</li>
            <li> blemish free!</li>
            <li> Their are so many acne products out</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is stronger than most on the market.  </li>
            <li> love this product and recommend it to anyone who is struggling with acne.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an antibiotic for acne in over 9 months and my face looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> Maybe its meant for people with more severe acne.</li>
            <li> then looks FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing how smooth my skin is now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not some magic potion</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really healthy for your skin</li>
            <li> Ok  </li>
            <li> She tried proactive but that seemed to make her break out even more</li>
            <li> Overall - I love this product  and am so happy that I purchased it!</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> My husband did some research and convinced me to try it out because it was rated as top 10 acne products.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is a scrub.  </li>
            <li> i was covered mostly on my cheecks and chin.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I need a quarter or more just to cover face and neck.</li>
            <li> Worked ok.</li>
            <li> Now I just wash it with warm water, make sure it&#x27;s clean and drink water.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling I get after I use this product on my face very clean</li>
            <li> FINALLY found a product that I LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> clean face with warm water &amp;</li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviews I read about it, I found them to be true, thank you good reviews!</li>
            <li> I read some reviews on this product and have seen some pretty good responses about it, so</li>
            <li> I like the smell which is very important to me, tried many others and they all smelled like sewage, this one has a light smell</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> it will actually burn your face good shipper good product would recommend</li>
            <li> However my face is very soft and feels great.</li>
            <li> This product works great to clear acne!  </li>
            <li> I bought my very first bottle and honestly for a while</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my face feels after each wash.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks more smooth</li>
            <li> I used to not be able to leave the house with out make up on, because I was so embarrassed of my skin, but now, I feel completely comfortable without</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t smell good but does that really matter?</li>
            <li> You know what I did write a good review about half way through the bottle, but by time the end of the bottle hit I wasn&#x27;t at all happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost one month, I was pretty excited about getting this product based on all the good reviews</li>
            <li> used it twice a day as directed feeling so clean after wash love the smell too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nanoccleanse is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nanocleanse is too strong for my face.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, I highly recommend it for your teen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have scarring which I hope will vanish over time, but I love the smooth and clean feeling I get with this acne wash.  </li>
            <li> i have used many products on my face; acne free, proactive, clean and clear,ect.</li>
            <li> , this works great and no dry out !</li>
            <li> Just keep doing your moisturizing regimen and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> At night I use a more mild facewash to avoid irritation.</li>
            <li> I am super glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I love how Nanocleanse has changed my life and allowed me to live more carefree and confident.</li>
            <li> Nanocleanse has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Has made a huge difference in my cystic acne.</li>
            <li> and I saw a huge difference in their skin!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has truly made a HUGE difference in my life.</li>
            <li> I gave it an honest shot, but my skin really doesn&#x27;t like this formula.</li>
            <li> I have tried many over the counter and prescription products, with no longer term success.  </li>
            <li> As a light sulfur smell</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m acne free.</li>
            <li> but I will tell you what I do, which is very close to what the label says -- I spread the product on my face, attempting to avoid my eye area, and then add a bit of warm water.  </li>
            <li> and then I wash it off and apply oil free moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My rating was based on the results of Nanocleanse - keep my face acne free or clearing up acne.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my face acne free.</li>
            <li> , i am acne free.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I honestly wish I had taken before and after pictures, because everyone is always commenting on how clear and smooth my skin looks now!</li>
            <li> We have tried many other products and considering this is all she is using and a moisturizer we are happy.</li>
            <li> just felt really clean and smooth</li>
            <li> and it does keep face clean and free of acne.  </li>
            <li> but that is easily remedied with a nose-strip and a quick cleanse with Nanocleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and his skin has improved significantly.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth everyone trying!</li>
            <li> My original review was a raving 5 star.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one wk and have noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> this does work great however if you have a sensative face do not leave on very long</li>
            <li> 1) clean face with just water, and damp skin  </li>
            <li> There are some exfoliant-like beads in the cleanser that lightly clean and get at that oiliness</li>
            <li> So again, are hoping the continued use of this will help with getting her face clean.  </li>
            <li> and she does feel this helps to clean it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft looks more healthy</li>
            <li> Not to mention that the rest of my skin looks polished, clear, and feels fantastic!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face a little red but it smells great, has great ingredients</li>
            <li> This stripped my skin of its natural oils which made my skin super oily which caused more break outs!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally working, so go ahead and make fun. :-P  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken them to the dermatologist since then and was told that a simple benzoil P wash would have been good.  </li>
            <li> , i have only used this product a couple of times, but so far so good, it makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> I really wish i had the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula, it seems to have gotten better reviews.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied with this latest order.</li>
            <li> But any who I&#x27;ve used nanocleanse for 3mnths and just ordered some more it really does keep my skin under control</li>
            <li> but my  face is starting to look  really good  now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to rub for an over extended amount of time, or feel that I really have to work in this product thinking it will help me achieve better results.  </li>
            <li> remember this needs to be on your face for about a min or so for it to have the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> Very nice product, did exactly as it said and cleared my face quickly, will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> As an accurate graduate with little to no acne, my girlfriend recommended this saying it changed her skin, helped with oil control, and made her complexion great.</li>
            <li> At first it was like rubbing fire on your face, but if you rub it gently it&#x27;s fine and for no longer then stated on the bottle.</li>
            <li> In the morning I just do a quick scrub with the Nanocleanse in the shower.</li>
            <li> If you have Mild To Severe acne this can help.  </li>
            <li> Nanocleanse is a great facial cleanser, I really like the way my skin feels after using the product.</li>
            <li> This product is super.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild acne since I was a kid..</li>
            <li> I use just a dab to wash my face twice a day and it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Super price.</li>
            <li> I got a quick response from them</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son because he has mild acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have not stopped using my regular Oxy products; this product is a superb addition to the overall arsenal.</li>
            <li> Of course it brought a ton of stuff to the surface but it cleared up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I used a mild antibiotic for my acne for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I cannot express more love for another facial cleanser...</li>
            <li> I have mild acne.</li>
            <li> This scrub will get rid of most (I need acne meds too) of your acne, leave your face feeling clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> The very next day after my first try I saw major awesome results.</li>
            <li> It has not once irritated my skin and it has made my skin acne free within the first week.</li>
            <li> So, sure I still get 1-2, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> After the first week, I noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I have only been taking it for about a week and already have amazing results.</li>
            <li> After a week or so you do not even notice the burn and trust me, it is worth every second of &amp;#34;discomfort&amp;#34; because the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> It took awhile, but was worth it.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is not smelly, not greasy/oily, and leaves my face feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> So far I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t 100% been clear but it is so much better than it ever has been.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> I struggled with adult acne for years and experienced constant breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays clear and healthy looking all the time since I&#x27;ve had this product (even during that time of the month).  </li>
            <li> so I think the more natural route was the way to go for me.</li>
            <li> And on the rare occasions when I go through a breakout</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the price</li>
            <li> Worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I honestly tried a lot of different products and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working very nice so far and hasn&#x27;t left any skin redness.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth now, soft and almost blemish free for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth, soft and blemish free for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> man were they right</li>
            <li> This face wash has really helped clean up my face.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face soft and clean though!</li>
            <li> Best facewash for acne prone skin, only need a little.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s better than something like Proactive, but seems to be good so far!</li>
            <li> It definitely helps clear up acne and the results were surprisingly soon.</li>
            <li> It is really nice using a product that kills AND prevents acne AND DEOSNT DRY my skin.</li>
            <li> and my scin is still looking great follow the directions and do not scrub too hard</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> what exactly happened</li>
            <li> It made me break out more than I have in the last 10 years!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been exactly a month of using it</li>
            <li> I have tried many products and this is the only one that cleared my acne within a month&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> but I had to use so many different washes and stringents and creams to keep it at bay.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this I didn&#x27;t avoid my eye area</li>
            <li> Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> i first ordered pronexin and that was so garbage</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been searching for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products so I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> this is most likely because the Nanocleanse was cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li> If you are considering getting this, you ABSOLUTELY MUST GET IT!</li>
            <li> This product works at first, maybe in two to three weeks you see a change.</li>
            <li> it still isnt pretty skin...</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think with nanocleanse and proper dieting it could be a magical potion</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin condition is different and takes time, but I&#x27;m glad I started using this product because my face is acne-free.</li>
            <li> Works well at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty consistent with it using as directed for five days now, this morning being my sixth.  </li>
            <li> By day three, this and my preferred moisturizer had given me smooth, soft skin.  </li>
            <li> and you see a difference within the first 3 days.</li>
            <li> I would say it completely cleared his face in about 2 weeks, but we did notice significant improvement in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> If you have even mildly sensitive skin, which most acne sufferers have, I suggest you look elsewhere for products specifically designed to treat sensitive as well as acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> At first he didn&#x27;t mind it too much.</li>
            <li> The acne is not completely gone but looks a ton better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just an odor while washing, but it stays with you pretty much throughout the day.</li>
            <li> At first it burnt my face but than I realized I was  putting to much on my face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin like most acne cleansers.</li>
            <li> I had a super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it was strong enough to combat my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 now and have pretty much tried everything, from the cheap Walmart face washes, to proactive, and nothing ever gave lasting results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does dry out my face some, but I use Olay moisturizer right after I wash my face and its fine.</li>
            <li> One last thing, I go to an esthetician every 3-4 months for a light chemical peel which also makes my face look fresh and new.</li>
            <li> It also feels greasy on my skin and the walnut shells meant for exfoliation are not ground nearly fine enough.  </li>
            <li> I get huge cysts and break outs all over my forehead almost daily.  </li>
            <li> His forehead and underneath his nose was absolutely covered with acne.</li>
            <li> so I needed to find something that would work fast.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping too...</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would make a difference for me</li>
            <li> It did not work as fast as the time was stated.</li>
            <li> I found Nanocleanse and have to say it really works.  </li>
            <li> I was very optimistic after reading the reviews but very dissapointed after my kids started using it.  </li>
            <li> reason why it still gets 3 stars is because this product did make my complexion much brighter and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleasner I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for 2 months</li>
            <li> so much I don&#x27;t rinse it off</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really need it either.</li>
            <li> I tried everything like Bye Bye Blemish, Acne Free and Proactive&amp;#60;~a total JOKE.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing again real soon.</li>
            <li> He told me it didn&#x27;t really help his acne at all.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to notice some changes .</li>
            <li> but if you want real results go for this...ps.i</li>
            <li> The seller is also very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the way this cleanser smells</li>
            <li> some reviews also reviews on amazon were very helpful as well.</li>
            <li> thanks to Nanocleanse</li>
            <li> so much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really cant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and like I said I wanted to try Clenziderm by Obagi and didnt like it as much as this.</li>
            <li> the ingredients from the imposter lists Glycolic Acid instead of sulfur and is made in Provo, Utah NOT Orem, Utah where the real product is made.   </li>
            <li> It is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> Feels like I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and nothing really helped.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone.very reasonable price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scrub and works really well.</li>
            <li> I SWEAR TO GOD after one use of nano cleanse my skin felt soooo much softer.....</li>
            <li> One night it was really hurting</li>
            <li> Only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but for clear skin, who cares.  </li>
            <li> I use day and night doesn&#x27;t dry out face and clears up your face pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> I found Nanocleanse when searching for natural cleansers and thought I might take the more \\&quot;organic\\&quot; route, but something still with some key ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and finally feel confident to go without foundation.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many face washes and this is one stands far above them all.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has been able to keep my skin clear for months.  </li>
            <li> It also smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I do break out due to hormones, the acne seems to go away faster and heal better with Nanocleanse.</li>
            <li> I still need to use other products to diminish the discolored scars but I am confident that with time they will disappear.  </li>
            <li> My son uses it and at first it really helped clear his acne</li>
            <li> This stuff is not too strong, not too stinky, and doesn&#x27;t overly dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> When I use it, my existing acne dies very quickly and there is no new acne at all.</li>
            <li> Seriously, i have tried so many face washes and this one wins. !</li>
            <li> A few months back I read an article with some amazing success she had by using two products.</li>
            <li> This is the first cleanser that has worked on my adult acne.</li>
            <li> it can make your face pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> I started getting adult acne for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I have bought this multiple times and so far it works fine</li>
            <li> Less IS more in this case.</li>
            <li> I always had issues with blackheads on my nose, and  I have previously tried proactive, murad and many over the counter others.</li>
            <li> I tried so many products and finally found something that actually works.  </li>
            <li> but that is one of the main ingredients to fight acne.</li>
            <li> I am a mild to moderate acne sufferer.</li>
            <li> Moderate when I am using products that dont work I will have about 20 pimples and mild when the product works somewhat but doesnt get rid of everything...</li>
            <li> Now as I am older the acne has moved to my chin and cheek area</li>
            <li> I have had mild to severe acne since I was in Middle school.</li>
            <li> (I thought) that makes this better than the next face wash and actually has drawbacks like:</li>
            <li> In reference to their claim, his face wasn&#x27;t completely clear in 72 hours, but already looked a little bit better within the first 2 days.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very aware of facial products and treatments, I was trained for three years.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions, and sure enough, within a few days the clearing up was in full swing.  </li>
            <li> Her overall facial complexion has improved tremendously and immediately after the first week of application!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for anyone with acne to try this</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for those who have Cystic Acne...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> so I had really high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> I doubt i will re order(With the pricebeing high, esp.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend Nanocleanse and Pronexin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this product</li>
            <li> yet the rating was high.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a great doctor and understands that I have been struggling for so long and was so pleased I had finally find something that did not cause my skin to break out even worse, peel, flake or become incredibly sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and this is the first acne product that did not dry skin, I wish I would have found this product long ago.</li>
            <li> I will admit I use a little more than they say to.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m praying with a little more time it does</li>
            <li> it could be a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This product will clear your fast in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and up until about two years ago I had pretty clear skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, everyday and have never had better results.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and</li>
            <li> It seems to me, from reading ALL the reviews and my research and experiences, that nanocleanse works OK on the big red angry acne, but causes problems when dealing with more mild cases.  </li>
            <li> Nice value, only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> so you end up scrubbing away at your newly inflamed skin.</li>
            <li> Tried everything from clean and clear to proactive and either it didn&#x27;t work or my face was peeling from how dry it got.</li>
            <li> It may cause a slight redness, but it goes away and your face really does feel clean.</li>
            <li> I massage my face for about 30 seconds, gently, and let the product sit for at least a minute... maybe more.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried Nanocleanse on a whim and WOW!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it burns your face for the first week.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using this product because I decided to try other face scrubs instead, but I will most likely use it once a week just till I finish the tube, and will probably not be purchasing another</li>
            <li> I have now developed a few more pimples and the old ones have not gone.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just buying my second bottle, so this stuff really lasts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wash for several years and haven&#x27;t built up an &amp;#34;immunity&amp;#34; to it, like I have with so many other washes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many acne cleansers in the past including proactive.</li>
            <li> and my skin has cleared up almost completely!  </li>
            <li> .............remember what we put in our body reflects on the outside ;)  </li>
            <li> I also bought the Acnetame pills as well, so far no complaints!</li>
            <li> I mean I am happy when other products dont give me new pimples and eventually kills the pimples I already had</li>
            <li> have two teen-aged boys who I knew would not go though a series of cleansing steps.(lets face it, after a long day, who wants to spend all that extra time in the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;The product shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I know the... overwhelming stress and let down when you wash your face constantly and nothing works.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and soft!</li>
            <li> Now his face is much more clear of pimples, black heads &amp; red spots.  </li>
            <li> and there &amp; ive been using this product for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, besides more oily skin &amp; it that it leaves my face a little red sometimes.</li>
            <li> I would say at this point, using this face wash for over 2 months, that I am 90% clear.  </li>
            <li> and my face is SO CLEAR.</li>
            <li> It did help clear up some of my face</li>
            <li> It did clear up some, but not drastically so that i would swear by it.</li>
            <li> Product advertised 3 days to clear blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and my skin is perfectly clear now.</li>
            <li> She has cystic acne and  since using this product, we have noticed it has helped clear her face up.  </li>
            <li> I apply A&amp;D ointment on my face after using the product at night so my face looks clear and moisturized in the morning.</li>
            <li> not that I wouldnt do ANYTHING for clear skin -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If that is the price for clear skin, who cares.</li>
            <li> As long as she uses it twice a day, her skin stays pretty clear.</li>
            <li> i am noe 98% clear.</li>
            <li> my skin has stayed clear.  </li>
            <li> My 11 year old son has been using this for almost 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> (Btw...a friend of mine suggested frequently changing his pillow case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 36 year old mom of 4.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult Acne.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old son.  </li>
            <li> far as I know I didn&#x27;t sign up for any monthly plan like proactive</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> but I have some faith with the progress that I have seen so far that they may be cleared completely.  </li>
            <li> We tried everything for our 13 year old.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 17year old son.</li>
            <li> I have oily and sensitive skin along with eczema.</li>
            <li> Finally a face wash that is gentle enough that it does not overdry my skin but powerful enough to fight acne and keep it gone.</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time that continuously works day after day.</li>
            <li> It helps my skin feel soft &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I think it has done well for my complexion, but it makes your face smell like dirt for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> dealing with adult acne for almost 3 years now.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenager because it&#x27;s a natural face wash.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this may not be the wash for you.  </li>
            <li> Buying for my nephew who says it works very well when used daily.</li>
            <li> Very drying can only use once a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked for me; I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> So far my routine in working.</li>
            <li> It took about two month and face cleared completely.</li>
            <li> I was using Murad and it did not work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> I have combination sensitive skin that is prone to acne.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face soft and its been healing my acne quicker than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> and we also have different sensitives, while others have not so much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally mind it as it&#x27;s absolutely nothing I can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li> i am 30 years old and suffered moslty from cystic acne.</li>
            <li> My (adult) face is breaking out again and this isn&#x27;t clearing the acne like it did before.</li>
            <li> 32 years old with breakouts/adult acne on the sides of my face/chin:</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> A majority of the cysts occurred on my jawlines, I would normally have both sides covered with these cysts and the second they would clear up, a new batch would begin.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin problems after using nanocleanse, chances are you are using too much nanoclense!    </li>
            <li> So it has been about 3 months that I bought this product and its still half full.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually about 3 small pimples that clear up quickly, instead of before when I would get 10 or more at a time.</li>
            <li> and I like the results I&#x27;m seeing - less acne and clears up quickly.</li>
            <li> If you have teenage boys, you know how hard it is to get them to use any kind of skin products on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> but you decide how much you want to scrub and how long you want to leave the scrub on.</li>
            <li> My face is pretty clear other than my chin area.</li>
            <li> My skin is also no longer red; I used to have a lot of blotchiness, my skin tone is now completely normal.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about two and a half months with no break outs other than one or two blemishes during the most hormonal time of the month.</li>
            <li> I never had acne as a teen but for some reason as a 33yr old adult now have it..</li>
            <li> I must say, on day one my face felt fresh, despite the slight tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I feel this product is really working and will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I definitely do not recommend this for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> (i had the boys put small amounts all around their face) and massage for two minutes, be careful not to get near eyes)&lt;br /&gt;splash face with warm water to rinse and pat face dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive products with no results and this product is almost a dream come true.</li>
            <li> I have never had such clear looking skin.  </li>
            <li> but I finally have clear skin.</li>
            <li> The pores on my nose are clear and a lot smaller.</li>
            <li> Not only did the breakouts clear</li>
            <li> I barely had the product on my face and it started to burn.</li>
            <li> so i did start to use twice daily, 45 seconds as my face is sensitive</li>
            <li> I have battled with severe cystic acne my entire adult life...  </li>
            <li> I put it on a damp face - not a wet face but damp-</li>
            <li> I have to find another decent product for dry skin and not change the cleanser becausewell it works with the pimples...</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin and my skin is only somewhat sensitive.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t make my face worse, didn&#x27;t make it exceptionally better either.</li>
            <li> I think its more of a trial and error game.</li>
            <li> I will warn that it took my skin some time to adjust as it can be a little harsh (experienced redness and a little burning during first few weeks of using, but</li>
            <li> My face gets really red and is super dried out.  </li>
            <li> No dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I should probably do this routine in the morning also, but I have very sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use facial scrubs, so I was a bit worried when I first saw the granules in it, but I found this cleanser is very genial and doesn&#x27;t overly dry.</li>
            <li> and you can actually feel it all your face the others I could barely feel on my face, thumbs up, so far no adult acne</li>
            <li> I was ready to buy another supply of his three step system and decided to shop around and see if anything out there had less steps involved.  </li>
            <li> When using this I also recommend using a mask for dark spots and acne scars to clear everything completely.</li>
            <li> I tried EVERYTHING, but the natural ingredients in this product don&#x27;t dry me out or make me have breakouts.</li>
            <li> 2) use penny sized amount of nanocleanse (one for left face, another for right face)  3) massage each side until it gets all sticky (usually 2 minutes)  4)</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, try just using it once at night if using it twice makes your face dry or really red.</li>
            <li> I even waited a long time and used the whole bottle to wait for results but it only dried up my face and didn&#x27;t help with acne.</li>
            <li> It did turn my face red the first time I used it, which I did not mind as that was an immediate indication of something going on, and the redness subsided within a few minutes as I expected it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited initially because of all of the great reviews, but unfortunately for me it didn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of Nanocleanse to get the whole job done.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a white wash cloth and use a white towel to dry my face after washing it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t remove eye make up, get it anywhere near my eyes and my skin gets red and painful for a good 20 mins, and a little does not go a long way.</li>
            <li> I also need to mention that it has minimized my dark spots from old acne blemishes.</li>
            <li> I think the tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This cleanser contains a lot of the ingredients that I&#x27;ve used with success in the past but the combination used in this product dried my skin out to such an extent that it actually produced additional breakouts.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this new one with glycolic acid and green tea ect.</li>
            <li> I think the red face is the cleanser going in and killing all bacteria and bad stuff, I honestly dont know.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for about a week to use another face wash only to help with the dry skin</li>
            <li> It also has the potential to dry your face out.</li>
            <li> and now I have specific towels I use to dry my face with that</li>
            <li> For anyone who has boys, can mostly likely agree that time consuming personal grooming is not high on their list!  </li>
            <li> On closer inspection the back of the imposter bottle lists only 1 active ingredient while the actual Nano Cleanse lists 3!!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this, my face would burn a little and be red, but it would subside after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> and my skin seems to clear a little but not all the way</li>
            <li> As of today - April 12th - he has considerably reduced his acne to just a few pop-ups.</li>
            <li> They are not completely gone</li>
            <li> My son had been using another teen acne product and it was not really giving him the results he wanted.  </li>
            <li> and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Do not leave on too long .&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> And then I do the unthinkable, the unpardonable...</li>
            <li> It has a strange smell, but worked for me.</li>
            <li> (I did) to not leave it on as long as they suggest just so you can see how your face reacts.</li>
            <li> NOT  a miracle worker, it does not clear your skin in &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> my face is not clear yet</li>
            <li> Skin is not clear after using product, it takes longer than 72 hours too work.  </li>
            <li> Better than any acne body wash I have tired in the past.</li>
            <li> At the time, I had large, painful pimples on my jaw line along with mild acne on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m cutting down to using once a day, even though it&#x27;s not working as expected I feel comfortable using it because of the high quality ingredients so imma</li>
            <li> Being a teenage boy with very oily skin, It is very hard to find a product that seems to work.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the product does stain towels (as warned by other buyers as well)</li>
            <li> , i may as well try one more week, but i am a little fed up with how lousy customer service seems to be and the product changing and no one knowing, and now this.  </li>
            <li> I still have minor breakouts every now and then, but this stuff works so well!</li>
            <li> Definitely works on acne and other skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin and bleach my rags</li>
            <li> I would suggest that people should try this out but not to get worried with the dry skin</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Dabbing my face dry, not rubbing.</li>
            <li> though was it did dry out my forehead area and had to use lotion.</li>
            <li> The boys skin does not peel or dry out from this product</li>
            <li> , then pat my face dry..</li>
            <li> Even though I followed the directions when I patted my chin dry with the towel (after rinsing off the face wash)</li>
            <li> well this product doesnt leave me with dry skin.</li>
            <li> but when they leave me with dry skin it is just another issue...</li>
            <li> but I think why it doesnt dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> No new acne break out.</li>
            <li> I no longer have any major trouble spots.</li>
            <li> My son had a bad case of acne pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li> Secondly, it does not diminish previous acne scars.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped clear acne, still get a few small ones but nothing like I had before using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am 41 and have been having acne for a little while now, tried several things and nothing would help.</li>
            <li> Only reason I did not give it a 5 is it smells a little like sulfur.</li>
            <li> My face will still be a little red after using this still, but it doesn&#x27;t burn anymore.</li>
            <li> I used to get big zits not just little pimples, and I don&#x27;t get those anymore</li>
            <li> My skin is starting to break out again in those little bumps.  </li>
            <li> It does leave his face a little red after he washes with it</li>
            <li> and you only use a little at a time</li>
            <li> it was hard to tell the good from the bad.</li>
            <li> The only negative is it had a sulfur smell but its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Nano cleanse helped me rid my acne after only a few days and kept it away.</li>
            <li> Then I put the Nanocleanse on my wet face and rub it on my face and my body (where there are pimples) in circular motions and AVOID YOUR EYE AREA.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> Pronexin is a green facial scrub for acne as well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few facial cleansers that has not over-dried my face.</li>
            <li> I wet my face, put about a dime size in my hand and massage in an upward motion for about 1-2 minutes</li>
            <li> I spent $25 on this medicine and whether it works or not I won&#x27;t buy it again as it stains my towels.</li>
            <li> But i give this product 2 stars because it&#x27;s not what i expected.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a few different products including the Obagi Clenziderm.</li>
            <li> Something I haven&#x27;t had in a while, dealing with constant trouble areas.  </li>
            <li> Not as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> A few of the small bumps on my forehead have gotten significantly bigger and redder than they were last week.  </li>
            <li> I have used this and it left my skin really dry and only made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a couple of months as a little will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> His face hasn&#x27;t totally cleared up, but getting there slowly, with no new break outs.</li>
            <li> He asked me to send him a picture of the label so he could look it up and let his other patients know about it.</li>
            <li> It has not irritated my skin or make it excessively oily, plus, I noticed my blackheads and whiteheads are starting to disappear after two days.  </li>
            <li> I used per the directions and like all the other products that promise to do what they say, it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I had severe acne due to my medications.</li>
            <li> I have bought every other product out there both drugstore and department.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other products or vitamins, just Nanocleanse in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> Cons: Like other posts have mentioned there is a burning sensation, but nothing that is intolerable.</li>
            <li> Cleans well but leaves skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out, and had dry flakey skin for a couple days.</li>
            <li> I workout every day and eat pretty healthy but my skin was crazy bad.</li>
            <li> Adult acne sucks!</li>
            <li> and I have not had a single cystic breakout!!!</li>
            <li> wet fingertips with little bit of water and lather</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ohh, only negative thing...</li>
            <li> I am not saying it will work for everyone, but I have sensitive skin and the propensity to make it worse through my misguided interventions.  </li>
            <li> so I was doubtful if I was even going to be able to use this product</li>
            <li> She is getting so down with having this type of acne.  </li>
            <li> So after narrowing down a bunch of products I decided to go with Nanocleanse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has cleared my moderate acne in just a few days!!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for a week, my acne has gotten a little worse, I think my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> A few other reviewers wrote about this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is some slight burning</li>
            <li> I still seem to get some pimples when I use it although who knows, maybe I get less than I would if not using anything.</li>
            <li> I still get some pimples but much less.</li>
            <li> Been using few days ago and slowly clearing up my bumpy facial skin.</li>
            <li> Less pimples, less blackheads, but dryer skin.</li>
            <li> and rub rub rub for about a minute to a minute and a half.</li>
            <li> It even gets my black heads.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that I suffered from adult cystic acne that was painful to touch and would leave deep, discolored scars on my face - not many but enough that it was noticeable.</li>
            <li> The product is for some reason very pale and doesn&#x27;t have the same effects as past products.</li>
            <li> Not good for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was another failed attempt at finding an acne wash that actually works, but about a month into using it twice a day, everyday, my face starting clearing up.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, took a long time to work and caused more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Just wished it was a little less pricey...</li>
            <li> It is smart for bad acne sufferers to use paper towels to dry their faces anyway</li>
            <li> I did a little online research &amp; found NanoCleanse.  </li>
            <li> I assured him it was ALL due to this unbelievable product.</li>
            <li> Did a little research before I tried this item out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just use a little and don&#x27;t let it stay longer in your face.</li>
            <li> Well just a little</li>
            <li> and it does sting a little</li>
            <li> and my acne seems to be going away a little at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hands down I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My make-up removal consists of washing my face with  Dead Sea Salt Soap (which I purchase through Amazon) twice to remove all make-up, dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised how quickly my troubled spots disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Ingredients have harsh chemicals but it also has ingredients that prevents side effects from the harsh chemicals  </li>
            <li> He ran out of it Once and within a few days acne started returning.</li>
            <li> My acne has begun to diminish and even though I still get a few pimples here</li>
            <li> , I only use it once a day because it was irritating my face.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within a few days.</li>
            <li> Dead skin cells may appear so don&#x27;t forget to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> He used it sparingly according to the directions but it dried his skin out.</li>
            <li> this product is harsh at firt</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and then apply a lotion after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> it seemed to get worse actually.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dried up my skin too.</li>
            <li> So I decided to give it a shot got my order few days</li>
            <li> I had a few pimples come out..</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first in trying this product because it was not well known like Proactiv or Murad or SkinID.</li>
            <li> have to keep you updated in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> i have gone through 4 bottles now and still use it everyday.</li>
            <li> saw results in a few days!!&lt;br /&gt;***but</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if its the nanocleanse helping, the meds, my stress is going down or all three.</li>
            <li> Nanocleanse worked in less than 1 week and we will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> The makers changed the ingredients though so if you don&#x27;t get the one with the sulfur, you will notice less impact :/</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, I had a problem with cystic acne (that&#x27;s the boil-like acne that&#x27;s really painful) &amp; for someone in their thirties, it&#x27;s embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Big, deep, painful zits would pop up all around my chin and mouth.</li>
            <li> It usually starts turning white and ill keep rubbing a little longer then wash off.</li>
            <li> I havethrown out all my other acne-related cleansers and spot treatments!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breaking out pretty bad lately.  </li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t really know if it is agood sign or bad.  </li>
            <li> I know how much having \\&quot;bad skin\\&quot; impacts self esteem.</li>
            <li> My 17yos has struggled with acne for the past couple years.  </li>
            <li> No more acne.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t want to go on Accutane, as we have heard so many bad reviews!!  </li>
            <li> I may get one or two small pimples maybe once per month.</li>
            <li> I use a small quarter size amount and rub it on my damp face with my fingertips.</li>
            <li> I have had troubled skin for the last 3-4 years and have used everything; including vitamins, acnepril, using proactive (for 18 months), mary kay (9 months)</li>
            <li> would likely break out, look horrible, and prove one more product useless...</li>
            <li> It contained all the acne fighters wrapped into one but it didn&#x27;t give me the redness and peeling that I usually get.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave product feedback, but I felt I needed to for this product...</li>
            <li> Today, I have no acne (besides small pimples that pop up sometimes around that time of month).</li>
            <li> I visualize the ingredients valiantly battling my nasty face germs (and winning)</li>
            <li> I have not experienced the burning that other customers report.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving bad ratings but this was too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and using this only twice a day dried my face horribly.</li>
            <li> Was a complete waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> In the weeks to come of using Nanocleanse, I expected the results to fade away and my troubled skin to reappear like it had in the past.</li>
            <li> I wanted desperately to stop using the antibiotic, and tried everything in the market from cheap solutions to very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Back in April I was getting really desperate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m under a lot of stress lately so that might be the cause of my outbreaks.</li>
            <li> It may work for those with small breakouts, but it was too expensive to waste my money on trying it again.</li>
            <li> I had very bad breakouts, uneven skin tones and scars, but this products seriously cleared it almost completely!</li>
            <li> not that I have a serious issue.</li>
            <li> From research, i have discovered that over exfoliating is bad for the skin, so i am going to use cetaphil alone to wash as well as  the BP again at night, and the Nanocleanse only once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that I have found with all acne washes, is that they are not good make-up removers.  </li>
            <li> Yet another expensive waste of money...</li>
            <li> I decided to add a star, my face broke out worse</li>
            <li> I started when my breakouts are the worse around that time of month.</li>
            <li> Too irritating for my face.  </li>
            <li> Made my acne worse and</li>
            <li> This product has my skin even worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> I am 24 and have had acne since my teens when it was worse and dominantly located in my t-zone area.</li>
            <li> I do believe his acne would be worse without using it.</li>
            <li> Others ive tried made my face worse or no results.</li>
            <li> But they stood behind their guarantee.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this product every day and night I could see a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now and my acne is probably twice as bad as it was when I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dried their skin so bad.  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter had horrible acne on her forehead and chin.  </li>
            <li> but so far, my skin looks terrible.</li>
            <li> The only  thing  bad  is the  stinging and that  it kinda smells  bad.</li>
            <li> just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Im Sad</li>
            <li> Sorry Nanocleanse, you&#x27;ve lost me.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this product does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> Gone are the big horrible pimples I used to get</li>
            <li> Nanocleanse has a weird odor</li>
            <li> and I get the worst, embarrassing big almost cystic acne-looking blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use this product after I had stopped but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Sadly even now  </li>
            <li> Believe me I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I have graduated from college now</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone who suffers from blackheads</li>
            <li> proactive is horrible, don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super terrible but it always scars and is painful</li>
            <li> I have had horrible acne problems for the past 40 years.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product ill never buy anything else!</li>
            <li> Made my skin so much worse!!</li>
            <li> Sorry nanocleanse!</li>
            <li> Very sad that it didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> It smells bad and irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> My mom was shocked.</li>
            <li> but I ended up disappointed ...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still get some pimples every so often, but they aren&#x27;t cystic and insane like they used to be.</li>
            <li> When I say worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had, I mean WORST acne ever</li>
            <li> So annoying man.</li>
            <li> Also when buying on Amazon you don&#x27;t have to worry about being caught up in some auto ship crap from the website that sells this product.</li>
            <li> My son 16 had very bad acne until we bought this face wash.  </li>
            <li> This product was terrible.</li>
            <li> My kids acne seemed to have gotten worst using this product.  </li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> have horrible discoloration on them.</li>
            <li> In my experience, When i used this it literally looked like my face just cooked in the sun all day :(!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Probably the best acne face wash that I have ever used.  I have suffered from acne for over 20 years and I have tried everything(Proactive, Murad, Mario Badescu, and everything from the drug store). Nothing ever gave me noticeable results.  This finally helped.  I would say at this point, using this face wash for over 2 months, that I am 90% clear.  I have always had a combination of white heads and cystic acne.  A majority of the cysts occurred on my jawlines, I would normally have both sides covered with these cysts and the second they would clear up, a new batch would begin.  I now have two, they are much smaller, not red and gone within a week.  So, sure I still get 1-2, but I can live with that. My skin is also no longer red; I used to have a lot of blotchiness, my skin tone is now completely normal. The one thing that I have found with all acne washes, is that they are not good make-up removers.  So I have learned to remove my make-up with a separate cleanser before I use this.  My make-up removal consists of washing my face with  Dead Sea Salt Soap (which I purchase through Amazon) twice to remove all make-up, dirt and oil.  Then I use the Nanocleanse with the Olay Pro-x skin cleansing brush and follow up with a good moisturizer (changes depending on the season and my skin that night).  In the morning I just do a quick scrub with the Nanocleanse in the shower.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son has been using this for almost 2 weeks now. Nanocleanse has made a huge difference. His forehead and underneath his nose was absolutely covered with acne. We tried ProActive but didn&#x27;t see a big difference for the price. We switched to the Acne Free system and we had fairly good results but the acne suddenly seemed to be out of control.  We started Nanocleanse on April 2nd. Within 2 days he could tell a difference. As of today - April 12th - he has considerably reduced his acne to just a few pop-ups. (Btw...a friend of mine suggested frequently changing his pillow case. We&#x27;ve been doing that too.)  So far we are really happy with this product and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any reaction to the products.  It&#x27;s only been a 1 week of use. So far so good.  No new acne break out.</li>
            <li> Nanocleanse is a wonderful product!  It has helped my daughter with her facial acne.  Her overall facial complexion has improved tremendously and immediately after the first week of application!  I would highly recommend for anyone with acne to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Mom Stephanie</li>
            <li> I am 41 and have been having acne for a little while now, tried several things and nothing would help. Found this on a website where it was listed  the #1 acne control for over 40.....man were they right, this works great and no dry out !</li>
            <li> This product gave my face a burning sensation and also let burn marks around my mouth. I now use it as a form of body wash.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how quickly my troubled spots disappeared.  I would highly recommend this product for those who have Cystic Acne...</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser alot! It cleared up my acne and it brightens my face.  I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> My 17yos has struggled with acne for the past couple years.  At first he didn&#x27;t mind it too much. Then it started to bother him so he asked me to buy something for it.  I did a little online research &amp; found NanoCleanse.  In reference to their claim, his face wasn&#x27;t completely clear in 72 hours, but already looked a little bit better within the first 2 days.  He&#x27;s been using it for a couple weeks &amp; his acne is going away.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> this wash is incredible!! it doesn&#x27;t make my acne go 100% away, I get a couple flair ups during my time of month, but it makes my skin so smooth, my pores look smaller, my oily skin has decreased,   my scars have even gone away. just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost one month, I was pretty excited about getting this product based on all the good reviews but I ended up disappointed ... It seemed to work in the beginning but not anymore. I&#x27;ll give it one more month and I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 36 year old mom of 4. I workout every day and eat pretty healthy but my skin was crazy bad. Big, deep, painful zits would pop up all around my chin and mouth. Adult acne sucks! I never had acne unt I turned 28. I&#x27;ve tried all the acne washes and lotions with no help. I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day during my shower and I use CeraVe cream (from the tub not the lotion pump) for a year now and my face is SO CLEAR. I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult Acne.  Having tried Murad and Proactiv, I was still had issues.  Using Nanocleanse along with Acsonix has truly helped.  Although I still experience a pimple here and there (immediately apply the acsonix to fight it), it is 99% better then what I was experiencing.</li>
            <li> If you have Mild To Severe acne this can help.  Ingredients have harsh chemicals but it also has ingredients that prevents side effects from the harsh chemicals  If you have dry skin problems after using nanocleanse, chances are you are using too much nanoclense!    I recommend my directions:  1) clean face with just water, and damp skin  2) use penny sized amount of nanocleanse (one for left face, another for right face)  3) massage each side until it gets all sticky (usually 2 minutes)  4) wet fingertips with little bit of water and lather face again  5) clean face with warm water &amp; thats it!    hope it helps</li>
            <li> My teenagers use this product and they love it!  It has really done a great job controlling acne but it is not over drying for their face.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. I barely had the product on my face and it started to burn. After removing it, the rest of the day felt as though I had gotten a sunburn on my face.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter had horrible acne on her forehead and chin.  I purchased Nanocleanse after reading several reviews.  I am happy to write that my daughter&#x27;s complexion has improved dramatically.  It took awhile, but was worth it.  It does need to be used twice daily as the directions state.  I noticed that she never skips on washing her face now.....is loving the product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  It clears my skin better and faster than proactiv.  I constantly break out because of my birth control so I needed to find something that would work fast.  I also have a sulfur acne cream. This product will clear your fast in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 15 year old son.  We have tried everything from Acne free to Proactive and this is superior.  He likes that it&#x27;s one step.  Only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but for clear skin, who cares.  I would say it completely cleared his face in about 2 weeks, but we did notice significant improvement in about 3 days. We are really happy and will continue ordering. He ran out of it Once and within a few days acne started returning.</li>
            <li> My son had suffered a severe acne break out, so I bought him the nanocleanse. He&#x27;s been using it for over 2 months now. His face hasn&#x27;t totally cleared up, but getting there slowly, with no new break outs.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I haven&#x27;t been getting as many breakouts- am wondering why they sent me another one in the mail this month though -as far as I know I didn&#x27;t sign up for any monthly plan like proactive does....does any one know why they send another one?Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t show up on my monthly statement.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! I have been using it for about two and a half months with no break outs other than one or two blemishes during the most hormonal time of the month. I love how smooth my face feels after each wash. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the product does stain towels (as warned by other buyers as well) so I bought a white wash cloth and use a white towel to dry my face after washing it.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out, and had dry flakey skin for a couple days.</li>
            <li> This cleanser contains a lot of the ingredients that I&#x27;ve used with success in the past but the combination used in this product dried my skin out to such an extent that it actually produced additional breakouts. Along with the drying ingredients, it is also a scrub so you end up scrubbing away at your newly inflamed skin. No amount of moisturizer could combat the flaky, irritated skin I experienced after using this cleanser. If you have even mildly sensitive skin, which most acne sufferers have, I suggest you look elsewhere for products specifically designed to treat sensitive as well as acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Grandaughter and she loves it....has problems with acne....fast shipping too...Just wished it was a little less pricey...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me at all. I even waited a long time and used the whole bottle to wait for results but it only dried up my face and didn&#x27;t help with acne. I was really hoping this would make a difference for me</li>
            <li> It works miracles best product for Ance</li>
            <li> This is the first cleanser that has worked on my adult acne. It is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING!! Cleaneers: Neurtigena, Pro-Activ, Murad, etc. I&#x27;ve been on oral anti-biotics for 3 plus months at a time while using topical anti-biotics as well. I&#x27;ve tried various versions of the pill, tetracycline, Retin-A (NIGHTMARE!!!) and Accutane. So, I have literally tried it all (aside from the laser and chemical peels I cannot afford). Then I tried Nanocleanse on a whim and WOW! I quit the Retin-A and went in to see my Dermo for my check up and he was amazed at the results. I assured him it was ALL due to this unbelievable product. He asked me to send him a picture of the label so he could look it up and let his other patients know about it. He&#x27;s a great doctor and understands that I have been struggling for so long and was so pleased I had finally find something that did not cause my skin to break out even worse, peel, flake or become incredibly sensitive to the touch. I use it at night In the shower when I wash my make-up off. I also work out so I use it on my chest and shoulders where I used to get acne when I sweat. No more acne. A little goes a long way. There are some exfoliant-like beads in the cleanser that lightly clean and get at that oiliness but you decide how much you want to scrub and how long you want to leave the scrub on. I wish I knew about this stuff SO many years ago!! Best of luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for years. A few months back I read an article with some amazing success she had by using two products. They were acnepril and nanocleanse. Acnepril helps fight hormonal acne and works from the inside out. Nanocleanse is a great facial cleanser, I really like the way my skin feels after using the product. I usually don&#x27;t use facial scrubs, so I was a bit worried when I first saw the granules in it, but I found this cleanser is very genial and doesn&#x27;t overly dry. It&#x27;s been working very nice so far and hasn&#x27;t left any skin redness. My skin is so smooth now, soft and almost blemish free for the first time in years. Nanocleanse is now apart of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Tried everything from clean and clear to proactive and either it didn&#x27;t work or my face was peeling from how dry it got. Nanocleanse works great!!!! No dry flaky skin. You can help but getting one or two spot pimples but I would rather that than a crappy product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter.  It works well and is helpful, but not a cure-all.  Only reason I did not give it a 5 is it smells a little like sulfur.</li>
            <li> They changed the ingredient so now I&#x27;m battling acne again. Don&#x27;t buy this new one with glycolic acid and green tea ect. Going to try and find the one with sulfur. Now my face feels like a cheese grater!</li>
            <li> I am 72 hours into the use of this product.  I can see some changes in my skin condition.  My skin feels and looks more smooth and I can see a decrease in blackheads.  They are not completely gone but I have some faith with the progress that I have seen so far that they may be cleared completely.  I am very happy so far with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and up until about two years ago I had pretty clear skin.  I had no idea what exactly happened but I started breaking out all the time.  I have acne scars and up until recently, constant breakouts.  I have tried every type of drugstore brand facial cleansers, proactive, Murad, etc. and none of them worked.  I decided to give this a try before going to a dermatologist and getting something prescribed.  I am SO glad I did.  Since using it (about a month ago) my breakouts have stopped and the ones I had are healing beautifully. Every now and then I notice that some of the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; that was stuck in my pores starts to make its way towards the surface but that is easily remedied with a nose-strip and a quick cleanse with Nanocleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some slight burning but it&#x27;s almost a good feeling - like the product is actually getting into my pores and cleaning them out.  I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> FINALLY found a product that I LOVE!!! I like the fact that it is not smelly, not greasy/oily, and leaves my face feeling fresh.  Will DEFINITELY purchasing this product in the future.</li>
            <li> We tried everything for our 13 year old. Nothing touched it, dermatologist; acne soap; proactive, nothing. Nanocleanse worked in less than 1 week and we will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 17year old son. For anyone who has boys, can mostly likely agree that time consuming personal grooming is not high on their list!  So i have been searching for a product that is a one step process to take care of his acne.  But this was not the one, good but not as effective as we would have liked.   Did seem to keep the out breaks somewhat in check, and that was a plus. Will keep using for now, thought it was good for the price and would like to see what happens in 60 days.</li>
            <li> Did a little research before I tried this item out. Read through websites, advertisements and customer reviews. This product is super. It is the best tool I have in my arsenal to fight acne!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this product all the time and he stands by it.  it works great and i know he will use for months to come</li>
            <li> Has made a huge difference in my cystic acne. I have tried other more expensive products with no results and this product is almost a dream come true. I have not experienced the burning that other customers report. Great product!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  You have to be patient but will see results in six weeks.  My acne has begun to diminish and even though I still get a few pimples here and there, they are smaller and seem to go away faster.  I tried so many products and finally found something that actually works.  It may cause a slight redness, but it goes away and your face really does feel clean.</li>
            <li> I have had issues for years. I have tried everything from store bought products, to home remedies and this product has worked wonders! I use it twice a day, everyday and have never had better results.</li>
            <li> It did not work as fast as the time was stated. It did help clear up some of my face but I had better luck with another product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now (as directed) and I still have spots. NOPE NOPE NOPE.</li>
            <li> Product has changed and it no longer contains salcylic acid and sulfur. It made me break out more than I have in the last 10 years!  Before they changed the formula it was the only thing that worked for me. Now I need to find something else.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product.  I have oily and sensitive skin along with eczema. It has not irritated my skin or make it excessively oily, plus, I noticed my blackheads and whiteheads are starting to disappear after two days.  It also smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not good for daily use.  More along the lines of a home chemical peel. I have normal skin and this stuff starts burning almost immediately.  May be good 4 once a week as a chem peel type of product.  My face is very red 4 hrs after use.</li>
            <li> This product saved my life!!!!! Kept trying so many products throughout Amazon and all of them made me break out. So many of them had paid reviews it was hard to tell the good from the bad. So annoying man. I&#x27;ve had mild acne since I was a kid.. But this product is truly the bees knees!!!! Cleared my skin in one week and has been fighting it off. If your in between products.. Just get this one and save urself the hassle, money, and time!!! :) thank u nano cleanse I love you lol</li>
            <li> So far so good. Just started to use it. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin like most acne cleansers. Nice value, only need a little bit. I think the tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My son had been using another teen acne product and it was not really giving him the results he wanted.  I think it would have worked better if he had used all three steps two times a day.  That was the problem - the three steps.  If you have teenage boys, you know how hard it is to get them to use any kind of skin products on a regular basis.  I was ready to buy another supply of his three step system and decided to shop around and see if anything out there had less steps involved.  I found Nanocleanse and have to say it really works.  My son had a bad case of acne pretty much everywhere and his skin has improved significantly.  The acne is not completely gone but looks a ton better.  His skin is not as red and fewer zits overall. I believe if he washed his face with Nanocleanse two times a day he would see even more of an improvement.</li>
            <li> My kids acne seemed to have gotten worst using this product.  It dried their skin so bad.  I was very optimistic after reading the reviews but very dissapointed after my kids started using it.  I&#x27;ve taken them to the dermatologist since then and was told that a simple benzoil P wash would have been good.  Im Sad though that i have not found what works for my kids</li>
            <li> I have suffered with blackheads all my life tried everything from scrubs to facials they always came back within a week of trying this product i could see my balckheads going away and my pores shrinking it has now been about 3 weeks and my scin is still looking great follow the directions and do not scrub too hard my face never broke out or got red just felt really clean and smooth would recommend to anyone who suffers from blackheads</li>
            <li> So I wanted to use this a good amount of time before I wrote a review. It&#x27;s been about a year, so here we go.  This is the only product I have used that has continuously worked. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still get some pimples every so often, but they aren&#x27;t cystic and insane like they used to be. I also don&#x27;t get pimples as often as I used to.  I will admit I use a little more than they say to. I probably use a good nickel size. It still lasts me a good 3-4 months before I need to get another bottle. When I first started using this, my face would burn a little and be red, but it would subside after a few minutes. My face will still be a little red after using this still, but it doesn&#x27;t burn anymore. I guess your face just has to get used to it.  I&#x27;m definitely a fan, and will continue to purchase.   UPDATE (10/4/15):  They changed the formula. I gave it an honest shot, but my skin really doesn&#x27;t like this formula. I&#x27;ve been breaking out pretty bad lately.  Sorry Nanocleanse, you&#x27;ve lost me.</li>
            <li> Edit:: I decided to add a star, my face broke out worse so i did start to use twice daily, 45 seconds as my face is sensitive and it did a significant amount of good within three days.&lt;br /&gt;Wel it didn&#x27;t make my face worse, didn&#x27;t make it exceptionally better either. I&#x27;ve tryed Almost every thing out there drug store wise, proactive, nothing&#x27;s helped in the slightest. It&#x27;s not super terrible but it always scars and is painful so I had really high hopes for this. I think my problem may be more hormonal ( I&#x27;m 21) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been exactly a month of using it, I only use it once a day because it was irritating my face. At first it was like rubbing fire on your face, but if you rub it gently it&#x27;s fine and for no longer then stated on the bottle. So maybe with the combo of only using it once a day and I don&#x27;t always do it for the two mins it says to as it&#x27;s my morning routine, it could of worked better if ised at directed. At night I use a more mild facewash to avoid irritation. It did clear up some, but not drastically so that i would swear by it. I will contine to use what I have and if I see noted improvement at the end of the bottle I would buy again, and will edit review.</li>
            <li> I still seem to get some pimples when I use it although who knows, maybe I get less than I would if not using anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost two months. I started when my breakouts are the worse around that time of month. It did dry out my skin and bleach my rags but I also use a lotion to help with the dryness. My face hasn&#x27;t 100% been clear but it is so much better than it ever has been. My pimples are easier to come out and my face seems brighter. I stopped using it for about a week to use another face wash only to help with the dry skin then that time of the month came again and I went back on it. I feel better with my face even though with me my breakouts are from my hormones not that I have a serious issue. I used proactive for about a year and my opinion is that this product is way better. I would suggest that people should try this out but not to get worried with the dry skin just have some lotion to put on after and don&#x27;t use color rags. I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend! I use day and night doesn&#x27;t dry out face and clears up your face pretty quickly! I just hope it stays working and fixes all my acne issues! I will be ordering this faithfully if the results continue</li>
            <li> NOT  a miracle worker, it does not clear your skin in &#x27;&#x27;seven days.&#x27;&#x27; I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, I still get break outs but my skin is much better than it was a month ago.... i&#x27;m gonna keep using it and see where it goes.... wish me luck....</li>
            <li> I like this face wash because it makes my face nice and smooth. It seems to make my pores smaller. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it burns your face for the first week. However it doesn&#x27;t do that anymore since I have been using it for about a month now.</li>
            <li> this does work great however if you have a sensative face do not leave on very long it will actually burn your face good shipper good product would recommend</li>
            <li> This product works great to clear acne!  I have tried many products and this is the only one that cleared my acne within a month&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> It smells bad and irritates my skin. I tried using it just once a day than on to twice a week but it still irritated my skin so I stopped using it. Was a complete waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> Great product but don&#x27;t overuse as it tends to be very drying.</li>
            <li> Great. This stuff is not too strong, not too stinky, and doesn&#x27;t overly dry out my skin. Just keep doing your moisturizing regimen and you will be fine. I&#x27;ve had cystic acne and body acne my entire life. I finally feel like this is starting to control it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, I highly recommend it for your teen.&lt;br /&gt;I worked wonders for our family. Thanks to the reviews I read about it, I found them to be true, thank you good reviews!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for years. Finally a face wash that is gentle enough that it does not overdry my skin but powerful enough to fight acne and keep it gone.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used. My acne was moderate but I had to use so many different washes and stringents and creams to keep it at bay. Once I started using Nanocleanse I noticed a difference within a few days. I use just a dab to wash my face twice a day and it has helped tremendously. It&#x27;s does dry out my face some, but I use Olay moisturizer right after I wash my face and its fine. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser ever! My daughters have never had clearer skin.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Has helped !!!!!</li>
            <li> Just what my son wanted</li>
            <li> I used per the directions and like all the other products that promise to do what they say, it did nothing. Blackheads on the nose didn&#x27;t stop or even dissipate.</li>
            <li> Too irritating for my face.  Okay for the rest of my skin washing after a workout.  Have been using this for over a month.  It hasn&#x27;t cleared up my skin, but there is some improvement.</li>
            <li> So it has been about 3 months that I bought this product and its still half full. I was using this product twice a day but after a week of using it my face started getting red and itchy. I continued using it because it does mention possible irritation; however, it came the day when I put it on my face and my face got completely red and started burning! it didn&#x27;t go away for about an hour or so. I have stopped using this product because I decided to try other face scrubs instead, but I will most likely use it once a week just till I finish the tube, and will probably not be purchasing another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why it still gets 3 stars is because this product did make my complexion much brighter and healthier looking. My coworkers noticed the difference in my skin, but since I do not like the burning sensation I will not be purchasing it anymore. I definitely do not recommend this for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Works well. Clears up redness every time. Worth the $$$. First product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time that continuously works day after day.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll I&#x27;m 12 and I have like a teens acne. me and my mom were searching for everything and this seemed to be the number one face wash in every website. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and it is seeming to work. I used to get big zits not just little pimples, and I don&#x27;t get those anymore and my skin seems to clear a little but not all the way and I am getting blackheads.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered that the formula for nanocleanse has changed to glycolic acid instead of salicylic acid.  I was upset when i recieved a different formula than shown on the nanocleanse website.  I have been assured it is good to use, i have only used this product a couple of times, but so far so good, it makes my skin feel nice. Edit one week after i started to use Nanocleanse. I have now developed a few more pimples and the old ones have not gone.  The Nanocleanse people say i should stick with it for another week or two.  I guess i am stuck, i may as well try one more week, but i am a little fed up with how lousy customer service seems to be and the product changing and no one knowing, and now this.  I really wish i had the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula, it seems to have gotten better reviews. Edit after 2 weeks of use.  I have noticed some change, i don&#x27;t really know if it is agood sign or bad.  A few of the small bumps on my forehead have gotten significantly bigger and redder than they were last week.  Some of the smaller bumps have gotten even smaller though.  I have started using BP on my forehead just at night to get these big ones under control. Edit after 1 month of use.  I stopped using the benzoyl peroxide on my forehead, as it cleared up my spots nicely.  I have been using nanocleanse by itself 2x a day for about a week now.  My skin is starting to break out again in those little bumps.  Seems to me that the exfoliating properties of Nanocleanse irritates my skin.  From research, i have discovered that over exfoliating is bad for the skin, so i am going to use cetaphil alone to wash as well as  the BP again at night, and the Nanocleanse only once or twice a week.  It seems to me, from reading ALL the reviews and my research and experiences, that nanocleanse works OK on the big red angry acne, but causes problems when dealing with more mild cases.  Very disappointed, took a long time to work and caused more breakouts. I doubt i will re order(With the pricebeing high, esp. with international shipping).</li>
            <li> Nano cleanse is a great product. Being a teenage boy with very oily skin, It is very hard to find a product that seems to work. Nano cleanse helped me rid my acne after only a few days and kept it away. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Super price. I love the feeling I get after I use this product on my face very clean</li>
            <li> It helps my skin feel soft &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use a little and don&#x27;t let it stay longer in your face. Otherwise, it will leave reddish marks on your face.  It will go away in couple of minutes though.</li>
            <li> Product advertised 3 days to clear blackheads.  I have been using twice a day for  10 days with no results on blackheads on the back of my neck.  I plan to use 4 more days.  If still no results I will return for refund.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleasner I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for 2 months and I can tell the difference when I use it my face is not clear yet but I&#x27;m praying with a little more time it does</li>
            <li> this is the best facewash I ever use I love it</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it to prevent break outs. Great price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My complexion is better after 1 month. Be sure to fallow as directed per instructions. I still get some pimples but much less.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to start this amazing review. Here it goes: Nanocleanse is a white scrub cleanser for any type of acne on your body and/or your face. I had severe acne due to my medications. I&#x27;m 29 and my skin is perfectly clear now. I worked for Estée Lauder at Nordstrom in Chicago and I&#x27;m very aware of facial products and treatments, I was trained for three years. So please trust me while reading my review. Believe everything I type! I wash my face with Seacret mud soap for acne treatments. Then I put the Nanocleanse on my wet face and rub it on my face and my body (where there are pimples) in circular motions and AVOID YOUR EYE AREA. The first time I tried this I didn&#x27;t avoid my eye area and I woke up with swollen eyes so be careful. It will sting on your skin but in a good way. The stinging just means that Nanocleanse is killing your bacteria. I count to 60 seconds and then another 60 seconds while rubbing. Two minutes of exfoliating. Then I use Pronexin scrub on top of it. Same thing, circular motions and avoiding my eyes. Pronexin is a green facial scrub for acne as well. I love Nanocleanse so much I don&#x27;t rinse it off, I use it as a mask! Every morning and I sleep with it on at night! The very next day after my first try I saw major awesome results. I washed my face, looked in the mirror and said, &amp;#34;Oh my God, WOW!&amp;#34; After 4 days, your face will be flawless. Dead skin cells may appear so don&#x27;t forget to use moisturizer. I have oily skin so I use Mario Badescu moisturizer for oily skin. It&#x27;s $18 online and at Nordstrom. Concealer? Nope! Not anymore! Foundation? Well just a little but I don&#x27;t really need it either. My mom was shocked. I tried everything like Bye Bye Blemish, Acne Free and Proactive&amp;#60;~a total JOKE. Forget Proactive! HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend Nanocleanse and Pronexin. If Nanocleanse was $1,000 I would buy it in a heartbeat. But it&#x27;s only $25. Whoever created this precious cleanser is a GENIOUS! Believe me! I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now and my acne is probably twice as bad as it was when I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I leave the wash on my skin for more than about 60 seconds, it starts burning.  My face gets really red and is super dried out.  I&#x27;m only using it once a day now for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep using it, hoping it will eventually work but so far, my skin looks terrible.</li>
            <li> You know what I did write a good review about half way through the bottle, but by time the end of the bottle hit I wasn&#x27;t at all happy. It honestly didn&#x27;t do anything. I then found this product http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Cure-Treatment-System-Supply/dp/B0000535CI and let me tell you what. AMAZING!!!  I have only been taking it for about a week and already have amazing results. So if you are reading this review and struggle with acne go with the Natures Cure 2 part acne system.</li>
            <li> I Love That Stuff it works very , very good</li>
            <li> Amazing cleanser! So far it is working great!! I will be purchasing again real soon. Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> My daughter has experienced acne since 7th grade.  She is in 10th grade now and nothing seems to help.  She has cystic acne and  since using this product, we have noticed it has helped clear her face up.  We are hoping that it will continue as time and use go on.  She is getting so down with having this type of acne.  We don&#x27;t want to go on Accutane, as we have heard so many bad reviews!!  So again, are hoping the continued use of this will help with getting her face clean.  She is in multiple sports and she does feel this helps to clean it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied with this latest order. The product is for some reason very pale and doesn&#x27;t have the same effects as past products. It doesn&#x27;t even have the same smell. Hopefully this can be rectified I have ordered this product for well over a year.</li>
            <li> Still have pimples after two months of use. It turns your face completely red after using it from the sulfur in it. It was a good try, but didnt help my acne problem. Would not get again</li>
            <li> This face wash has really helped clean up my face. My face is not perfect but it&#x27;s definitely better then it was. I no longer have any major trouble spots. When using this product it makes my face really red for a couple of minutes and it does sting a little but it all goes away. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne since the age of 12 and have tried almost every product prescription and non-perscription. I had almost given up in trying to find a product that actually worked until I found nano cleanse. I have used it now for 3 years and it is the only acne product that has worked for me. When using this I also recommend using a mask for dark spots and acne scars to clear everything completely. (for example: Philosophy&#x27;s oxygen peel)</li>
            <li> Very nice product, did exactly as it said and cleared my face quickly, will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> So far I think it has done well for my complexion, but it makes your face smell like dirt for the rest of the day. It&#x27;s not just an odor while washing, but it stays with you pretty much throughout the day. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using more than once a day or else it can make your face pretty sensitive. Not sure it&#x27;s better than something like Proactive, but seems to be good so far!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my teenage nephew. He told me it didn&#x27;t really help his acne at all. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Seller is great but product did nothing to help his acne</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser!  I struggled with adult acne for years and experienced constant breakouts.  I have tried many over the counter and prescription products, with no longer term success.  Once I started using this cleanser, my skin cleared!  My skin is so smooth, soft and blemish free for the first time in years. Nanocleanse is now part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> amazing!!!!!!! dealing with adult acne for almost 3 years now.  I get huge cysts and break outs all over my forehead almost daily.  I was using DDF, which is also a great product, but after 3 days I am seeing a significant difference in my face. I would say for any product reviews are helpful, but after 3 years of spending tons of $$ on diff brands, you have to find what works for your face.  I would highly recommend trying this product</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this product does not work for me.  After 2 months of use, nothing has changed.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I have had horrible acne problems for the past 40 years. I have tried everything for my acne. I have been on medication, topical medication, tried Proactiv, Vitamin A. You name it, I have tried it and nothing has worked until Nanocleanse. I started using this product 6 months ago and I am amazed that I no longer have any blemishes. Gone are the big horrible pimples I used to get (actually looked like boils). I may get one or two small pimples maybe once per month. But after using the Nanocleanse and Acsonix, the pimples are actually gone the next day. I have never had such clear looking skin.  It took 40 years but I finally have clear skin. Thank you Nanocleanse.</li>
            <li> Ever since I was 11 I have suffered from acne. I&#x27;m 19 now and have pretty much tried everything, from the cheap Walmart face washes, to proactive, and nothing ever gave lasting results. Back in April I was getting really desperate and I found this quiz online that had me answer a bunch of questions about the type of acne I had and so on, and I ended up getting matched with Nanocleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of April I bought my very first bottle and honestly for a while I thought it was another failed attempt at finding an acne wash that actually works, but about a month into using it twice a day, everyday, my face starting clearing up. I honestly wish I had taken before and after pictures, because everyone is always commenting on how clear and smooth my skin looks now! I used to not be able to leave the house with out make up on, because I was so embarrassed of my skin, but now, I feel completely comfortable without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now mid July and I&#x27;m just buying my second bottle, so this stuff really lasts! Also, don&#x27;t use any good towels when you&#x27;re wiping your face off afterwards because it WILL stain them!</li>
            <li> Worked better than any face wash I&#x27;ve used (: very happy with this product</li>
            <li> My daughter has struggled with acne for many years.  She has been using this for about 7 weeks now, and her face has improved a lot.  It is not perfect, there are still pimples, but it definitely is much better than it was, and we will continue to use this product. We have tried many other products and considering this is all she is using and a moisturizer we are happy.</li>
            <li> My son 16 had very bad acne until we bought this face wash.  Now his face is much more clear of pimples, black heads &amp; red spots.  It does leave his face a little red after he washes with it but it goes away.  Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenager because it&#x27;s a natural face wash. He used it sparingly according to the directions but it dried his skin out.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!! I have bought every other product out there both drugstore and department. Nothing else has ever worked. Cleared up my skin in about 2 days. This is a miracle product ill never buy anything else!</li>
            <li> I have used this faithfuly for a month with no progress what so ever. I was really hoping to notice some changes . Very sad that it didnt work for me. I didnt have the drying effect everyone was complaining about but it didnt work on my acne. My face is pretty clear other than my chin area. So was hoping this would help with my breakouts on chin. DID NOT help at all.</li>
            <li> this product is freaking amazing...i first ordered pronexin and that was so garbage my face stayed oily...this product is harsh at firt but if you want real results go for this...ps.i never thought i would be the type of person wrighting a review</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  It really is great for clearing and cleaning your skin.  It takes my makeup off without any problems.  I will warn that it took my skin some time to adjust as it can be a little harsh (experienced redness and a little burning during first few weeks of using, but not longer experience that)  If you have sensitive skin this may not be the wash for you.  I use this everyday and then apply a lotion after I get out of the shower and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this wash for several years and haven&#x27;t built up an &amp;#34;immunity&amp;#34; to it, like I have with so many other washes.  My skin stays clear and healthy looking all the time since I&#x27;ve had this product (even during that time of the month).  It lasts for a couple of months as a little will go a long way.  The seller is also very helpful.  I had ordered some and never received it.  I got a quick response from them and they sent me a replacement immediately.</li>
            <li> Great - works better than Proactive!</li>
            <li> LOVE Nanocleanse. Make sure you follow the directions. Less IS more in this case. I use a small quarter size amount and rub it on my damp face with my fingertips. I rub for about 2 minutes then splash water on my face and rub once more before I wash it all off. Dabbing my face dry, not rubbing. Works like a charm. I have had troubled skin for the last 3-4 years and have used everything; including vitamins, acnepril, using proactive (for 18 months), mary kay (9 months) etc. and nothing worked... it seemed to get worse actually. I don&#x27;t have acne anywhere else on my body except my face, specifically my cheeks and chin. I found Nanocleanse when searching for natural cleansers and thought I might take the more \\&quot;organic\\&quot; route, but something still with some key ingredients in it. I researched this product, it&#x27;s ingredients and reviews and decided to try it out - knowing my face would likely break out, look horrible, and prove one more product useless... but that didn&#x27;t happen. After the first week, I noticed a significant difference. It wasn&#x27;t a magical serum that made my face flawless, but it was noticeably better. My face just felt cleaner, smoother, and happier. Exactly what I have been searching for. No 3 step processes, bleaching my hand towels, or spending 15 minutes, twice a day washing my face. In the weeks to come of using Nanocleanse, I expected the results to fade away and my troubled skin to reappear like it had in the past. What happened was the opposite - my face became clearer and people could noticeably see a difference. My acne is mostly hormone based so I think the more natural route was the way to go for me. When I do break out due to hormones, the acne seems to go away faster and heal better with Nanocleanse. I don&#x27;t use any other products or vitamins, just Nanocleanse in the morning and at night. I have been using this product for a year now and would recommend it to everyone. I love how Nanocleanse has changed my life and allowed me to live more carefree and confident.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! This is one of the few facial cleansers that has not over-dried my face. It definitely helps clear up acne and the results were surprisingly soon. I like to use this at night before going to bed. You only need a small amount of Nanocleanse to get the whole job done.  I love this face wash!</li>
            <li> I have used this and it left my skin really dry and only made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> Buying for my nephew who says it works very well when used daily. He prefers to the multiple step system of Proactive.</li>
            <li> the best acne cleanser</li>
            <li> Repeat purchase of the product and it does keep face clean and free of acne.  Great if you work out or ride bike and use sun tan lotion as it leaves face clean.  As a light sulfur smell but that is one of the main ingredients to fight acne.</li>
            <li> Mypreteen daughter has tried several acne wash products.  This one seems to help her in the fight against acne the best.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for a week, my acne has gotten a little worse, I think my skin is sensitive so I&#x27;m cutting down to using once a day, even though it&#x27;s not working as expected I feel comfortable using it because of the high quality ingredients so imma keep trying it for a while</li>
            <li> I just bought the 3 nano cleanse with serum a week ago ,and my skin looks the best it has ever since I was a kid. I always had issues with blackheads on my nose, and  I have previously tried proactive, murad and many over the counter others. I am 51 years old and finally feel confident to go without foundation. The pores on my nose are clear and a lot smaller. I wish I knew about nano cleanse a lot sooner!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son because he has mild acne. This product seems to help . I&#x27;ve tried many products so I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Best facewash for acne prone skin, only need a little. Do not leave on too long .&lt;br /&gt;Very good . One of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too impressed. I&#x27;m under a lot of stress lately so that might be the cause of my outbreaks. I hope so because I&#x27;m 32! Anyway, besides using nanocleanse I&#x27;m also on an antibiotic called bactrim for my skin. So I&#x27;m not sure if its the nanocleanse helping, the meds, my stress is going down or all three. But I believe I remember reading after a weeks use you&#x27;ll see the difference. Not so much. I didn&#x27;t start noticing any change until the second week&lt;br /&gt; What I did notice though was it did dry out my forehead area and had to use lotion. I used the recommended dosage of a wash in the morning and at night. Good luck with whatever you choose I think its more of a trial and error game. You gotta find what works for you. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Skin is not clear after using product, it takes longer than 72 hours too work.  Left red acne marks on face.  it is a good product but needs to be part of a program.  Very drying can only use once a day.</li>
            <li> I have tried many acne cleansers in the past including proactive. This is, by far, the best treatment ever!! I also purchased this product with acnepril capsules which I also think has helped. Nanocleanse has a weird odor but you get used to it. It also has the potential to dry your face out. I apply A&amp;D ointment on my face after using the product at night so my face looks clear and moisturized in the morning. I also need to mention that it has minimized my dark spots from old acne blemishes. One last thing, I go to an esthetician every 3-4 months for a light chemical peel which also makes my face look fresh and new.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked for me; I was pleasantly surprised.  Followed the directions, and sure enough, within a few days the clearing up was in full swing.  It did turn my face red the first time I used it, which I did not mind as that was an immediate indication of something going on, and the redness subsided within a few minutes as I expected it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not stopped using my regular Oxy products; this product is a superb addition to the overall arsenal.</li>
            <li> I have battled with severe cystic acne my entire adult life...  This has freed me and my skin from the pain and humiliation that comes with cystic acne.  I tried every OTC and rx acne treatment out there...  Nothing worked.  I have been using it for a month and the results speak for themselves!</li>
            <li> I like the smell which is very important to me, tried many others and they all smelled like sewage, this one has a light smell and you can actually feel it all your face the others I could barely feel on my face, thumbs up, so far no adult acne but its only been a week.</li>
            <li> Made my acne worse and every time I put it on I would have feel a burn and once I&#x27;d wash it off my face would be looking red like I had a sun burn</li>
            <li> I know the... overwhelming stress and let down when you wash your face constantly and nothing works. This stuff works! This scrub will get rid of most (I need acne meds too) of your acne, leave your face feeling clean and very soft. I am so thankful to have found this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my friend. She loves it  and said the acne came out of the skin. I am ordering more for her.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product. It contained all the acne fighters wrapped into one but it didn&#x27;t give me the redness and peeling that I usually get. I am 41 still battling acne this product did wonders.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the way this cleanser smells but what it has done to my face is amazing.  My skin is smooth and this is the first acne product that did not dry skin, I wish I would have found this product long ago.</li>
            <li> Been using few days ago and slowly clearing up my bumpy facial skin. Didn&#x27;t dried up my skin too. The products works wonder into my face coz I had a super sensitive skin. Been of so many products in the market like proactiv+, zaine skin set produtcts from philippines, Olay and thailand products but nothing works great on my face until I read out wonderful comments about this Nanocleanse in Amazon.com yet the rating was high. So I decided to give it a shot got my order few days later.&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice a day as directed feeling so clean after wash love the smell too. I apply arbutin serum (H-I-M istry) I knew meant for men but works for women too. Hope it will totally cleared up my facial skin back into the way it was before...blemish free! I would love to recommend this product coz so great makes me more beautiful and get back my confidence...just be patient!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to nanocleanse I got yah!</li>
            <li> I started to notice my acne improving after about three days of using this! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now and my acne is 90% gone! And on the rare occasions when I go through a breakout it&#x27;s usually about 3 small pimples that clear up quickly, instead of before when I would get 10 or more at a time.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Made my skin so much worse!! This stripped my skin of its natural oils which made my skin super oily which caused more break outs!</li>
            <li> This acne cleanser works wonders!!! It has cleared my moderate acne in just a few days!! This product is well worth the price and you only use a little at a time so it lasts a while. Very happy with this purchase. Going to buy some more when i run out!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my body not my face but it works well. Better than any acne body wash I have tired in the past. Nanocleanse is too strong for my face.</li>
            <li> I did  a lot of research before ordering this product. Their are so many acne products out their who claim &amp;#34;clear skin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;that it could be a little overwhelming. I went on you tube to get some reviews also reviews on amazon were very helpful as well. So after narrowing down a bunch of products I decided to go with Nanocleanse.&lt;br /&gt;I have two teen-aged boys who I knew would not go though a series of cleansing steps.(lets face it, after a long day, who wants to spend all that extra time in the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;The product shipped quickly and I couldn&#x27;t wait for the boys to try it, and just after two days of them using it , their acne was disappearing and I saw a huge difference in their skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Nanoccleanse is so easy to use. Splash your face with warm water, place a dime size amount on your palm and (i had the boys put small amounts all around their face) and massage for two minutes, be careful not to get near eyes)&lt;br /&gt;splash face with warm water to rinse and pat face dry. You are to use it every morning and every night. SIMPLE AS THAT!! I  The boys skin does not peel or dry out from this product so no need for moisturizers. ( this product does stain towels!)&lt;br /&gt;I definitely give this product a thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried every cleanser out there..even Proactive...proactive is horrible, don&#x27;t waste your money.. I even bought cleanser from the salon recommended by my esthetician. Yet another expensive waste of money...I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and it is incredible!! I never had acne as a teen but for some reason as a 33yr old adult now have it.. thanks to Nanocleanse I don&#x27;t have it anymore, I started to see a difference in about 2 weeks. I wet my face, put about a dime size in my hand and massage in an upward motion for about 1-2 minutes, then pat my face dry.. every night. I should probably do this routine in the morning also, but I have very sensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to dry out my skin. So far my routine in working. I had a few pimples come out..this is most likely because the Nanocleanse was cleaning my pores. But now I&#x27;m acne free. I also use BareMinerals make-up...I don&#x27;t even have to use lotion and I used to have problems with my skin drying out or being too oily in some spots. This is the perfect cleanser, I highly recommend it! Also when buying on Amazon you don&#x27;t have to worry about being caught up in some auto ship crap from the website that sells this product.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for my face. I tried EVERYTHING, but the natural ingredients in this product don&#x27;t dry me out or make me have breakouts. In just about 3 weeks, my face was clearer and smoother. It&#x27;s been over a year and this is the only product I swear by!</li>
            <li> makes you smell like sulfur ?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that actually works! I had very bad breakouts, uneven skin tones and scars, but this products seriously cleared it almost completely! I still have minor breakouts every now and then, but this stuff works so well! But keep in mind you have to use it at night and in the morning for the best results. I have tried so many face washes and this is one stands far above them all. If you are considering getting this, you ABSOLUTELY MUST GET IT! Seriously, i have tried so many face washes and this one wins. !</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with Acne forever. I&#x27;ve had chemical peels numerous times and still the acne would come back.  This stuff is stronger than most on the market.  Of course it brought a ton of stuff to the surface but it cleared up quickly.  Not a miracle worker but Id recommend it to anyone who struggles with acne</li>
            <li> Even though I followed the directions when I patted my chin dry with the towel (after rinsing off the face wash) it stained my face towel.  A few other reviewers wrote about this.  This staining is simply NOT acceptable.  I spent $25 on this medicine and whether it works or not I won&#x27;t buy it again as it stains my towels.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for two weeks with no results. It felt like it was working but I don&#x27;t think it was strong enough to combat my acne. It may work for those with small breakouts, but it was too expensive to waste my money on trying it again.</li>
            <li> This product works so well!  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and my skin has cleared up almost completely!  I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day, instead of twice due to my sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s been miraculous!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave product feedback, but I felt I needed to for this product...&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and recommend it to anyone who is struggling with acne. I used a mild antibiotic for my acne for over 10 years. I wanted desperately to stop using the antibiotic, and tried everything in the market from cheap solutions to very expensive ones. About 6 months ago, I found Nanocleanse. At the time, I had large, painful pimples on my jaw line along with mild acne on my forehead and cheeks. Two days after using Nanoclease, my pimples almost went away. Today, I have no acne (besides small pimples that pop up sometimes around that time of month). I haven&#x27;t used an antibiotic for acne in over 9 months and my face looks better than it ever has. I even recommended this to my brother-in-law and he loves it too. This product has truly made a HUGE difference in my life.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to compare to proactive because it is quite a bit cheaper.  It did not contol breakouts at all for me.  In addition I did not like the smell of this product.  It also feels greasy on my skin and the walnut shells meant for exfoliation are not ground nearly fine enough.  I will return to using the proactive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of all the good reviews. But i give this product 2 stars because it&#x27;s not what i expected. Maybe its meant for people with more severe acne. I get pimples here and there &amp; ive been using this product for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, besides more oily skin &amp; it that it leaves my face a little red sometimes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan.  I am 47 and I get the worst, embarrassing big almost cystic acne-looking blemishes.  And then I do the unthinkable, the unpardonable...I squeeze and pick. Within 2 days this product let me know it was working.  I am about three weeks in and even my aesthetician has commented on the remarkable improvement of my skin&#x27;s condition.  I am not saying it will work for everyone, but I have sensitive skin and the propensity to make it worse through my misguided interventions.  I know the product comes with usage guidance but I will tell you what I do, which is very close to what the label says -- I spread the product on my face, attempting to avoid my eye area, and then add a bit of warm water.  I massage my face for about 30 seconds, gently, and let the product sit for at least a minute... maybe more.  I visualize the ingredients valiantly battling my nasty face germs (and winning) and then I wash it off and apply oil free moisturizer.  It&#x27;s totally working, so go ahead and make fun. :-P  Good luck.  I know how much having \\&quot;bad skin\\&quot; impacts self esteem.</li>
            <li> This product works at first, maybe in two to three weeks you see a change. Less pimples, less blackheads, but dryer skin. However if you get off this acne treatment for even a week it&#x27;s as if your face explodes with acne. When I say worst acne I&#x27;ve ever had, I mean WORST acne ever and it&#x27;s scarring. I tried to use this product after I had stopped but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do anything. Now I just wash it with warm water, make sure it&#x27;s clean and drink water. This product has my skin even worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> I was almost giving up on the product. It took about two month and face cleared completely. I recommend it for you all!! Be patient!</li>
            <li> Yes 5 stars I give this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemme tell you I am a mild to moderate acne sufferer. Moderate when I am using products that dont work I will have about 20 pimples and mild when the product works somewhat but doesnt get rid of everything... I am 24 and have had acne since my teens when it was worse and dominantly located in my t-zone area. Now as I am older the acne has moved to my chin and cheek area and I still get some around my nose and suffer from blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now why I LOVE this product!! I recently found Amazon &amp;#34;Best Sellers&amp;#34; and decided to see what people are using for Acne... SO HAPPY! I ended up buying a few different products including the Obagi Clenziderm. I thoroughly like this product so much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I put it on a damp face - not a wet face but damp- and rub rub rub for about a minute to a minute and a half. It usually starts turning white and ill keep rubbing a little longer then wash off. After that my skin is RED everywhere the product touched. It stays red for about ten minutes then looks FABULOUS! I honestly dont even have to use this product more than once a day... sometimes I dont even wash my face at all that day and pimples dont start flowing in overnight. I love this product. It cleared ALL my acne up. When I use it, my existing acne dies very quickly and there is no new acne at all. I think the red face is the cleanser going in and killing all bacteria and bad stuff, I honestly dont know. It even gets my black heads. I cannot express more love for another facial cleanser... I really cant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now why I prefer this one to others that are on the best sellers... well this product doesnt leave me with dry skin. I mean I am happy when other products dont give me new pimples and eventually kills the pimples I already had but when they leave me with dry skin it is just another issue... it still isnt pretty skin... I have to find another decent product for dry skin and not change the cleanser becausewell it works with the pimples... what a headache. and I like simplicity! - not that I wouldnt do ANYTHING for clear skin -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product however... the second ingredient after water is shea butter which is obviously washed off but I think why it doesnt dry out my skin. It is really nice using a product that kills AND prevents acne AND DEOSNT DRY my skin. Pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use it once a day and I am really happy and like I said I wanted to try Clenziderm by Obagi and didnt like it as much as this. I am super glad I found this product. And I dont mind having a red face for ten minutes at all..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ohh, only negative thing... this bleaches my towels. Not all my towels were bleached by this but about 50% of them were.... They were bleached from me drying my face off AFTER washing my face with this... it isnt even on my face anymore and somehow still bleaches my towels... It is smart for bad acne sufferers to use paper towels to dry their faces anyway but this product worked so well I felt I didnt need to do that and now I have specific towels I use to dry my face with that have horrible discoloration on them. If that is the price for clear skin, who cares.</li>
            <li> I started getting adult acne for the first time in my life. I tried some over the counter products and nothing worked. Once I started using this product every day and night I could see a dramatic improvement. I have been using it now for 2 months and it&#x27;s amazing how smooth my skin is now. Be patient and give this product time to work. I just bought my 2nd tube because I believe in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from moderate or sever acne,but I have breakouts especially when it&#x27;s getting close to that time of month(hormonal) ...................as we all know hormonal is working from with in, I have  yet to find a product that helps with that!!!! But any who I&#x27;ve used nanocleanse for 3mnths and just ordered some more it really does keep my skin under control it&#x27;s soft looks more healthy I can even go without make up if I wanted to I like this product it&#x27;s not some magic potion but it&#x27;s really healthy for your skin and I think with nanocleanse and proper dieting it could be a magical potion.............remember what we put in our body reflects on the outside ;)  But overall I will continue to use this product  I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> Ok  so I have had  this for while now and I like it! At first it burnt my face but than I realized I was  putting to much on my face.Sadly even now  it stings  sometimes  I just  put  ganier moisturizing cream on my face and  it feels  so nice.... but my  face is starting to look  really good  now. The only  thing  bad  is the  stinging and that  it kinda smells  bad.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped clear acne, still get a few small ones but nothing like I had before using this product.  I was using Murad and it did not work nearly as well.  Will continue to use Nanocleanse.</li>
            <li> My rating was based on the results of Nanocleanse - keep my face acne free or clearing up acne. I have been using this Nanocleanse for a couple months and I like the results I&#x27;m seeing - less acne and clears up quickly. I&#x27;m happy with the results and I would recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This exfoliating face wash did not work for my skin type. I have oily acne prone skin and my skin is only somewhat sensitive. I have mild acne. I&#x27;ve used benzoyl peroxide facial cleansers before and they only made my skin slightly red. In my experience, When i used this it literally looked like my face just cooked in the sun all day :(!! Such a freaking nightmare!! I only used it once though. Maybe if i continued using it..it may have worked but, how could i when my face literally looked and felt like it was on fire. Most irritated I&#x27;ve ever seen my skin!! Would not recommend for somebody with my skin type. Sorry nanocleanse!</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with clearing up acne.</li>
            <li> This has been the best face wash for my 12 year old daughter. She tried proactive but that seemed to make her break out even more so I searched for an alternative for her. I read reviews on this an thought I would give it a try. The results have been great for her!! As long as she uses it twice a day, her skin stays pretty clear.</li>
            <li> Cleans well but leaves skin a little dry. Definitely works on acne and other skin blemishes. I have bought this multiple times and so far it works fine</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and using this only twice a day dried my face horribly. It leaves your face soft and clean though!</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware! I have been using Nano Cleanse for 2 years and have purchased it from this site but for the second time in a row I have been sent a product that &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; like Nano Cleanse but is not the actual product. Each time this has happened the seller claims to be Wheeler Saxon but PAY ATTENTION- the ingredients from the imposter lists Glycolic Acid instead of sulfur and is made in Provo, Utah NOT Orem, Utah where the real product is made.   The bottle is the same and the packaging looks similar too. However the facial cleanse is thinner, looks lighter, smells different, and does not provide the same benefits as the actual product. On closer inspection the back of the imposter bottle lists only 1 active ingredient while the actual Nano Cleanse lists 3!! Do not be fooled by whatever the product the seller claiming to be Wheeler Saxon is selling. It is not the real thing. See the attached photos for evidence. (The imposter bottle is on the left)  It should be noted that I suffered from adult cystic acne that was painful to touch and would leave deep, discolored scars on my face - not many but enough that it was noticeable. I did the Proactive thing but that was too $$$. I did Retin-A treatments but they weren&#x27;t enough to stop the cysts. I stumbled across this product and read some reviews - I figured I had nothing to lose so I purchased 1 bottle on a whim.  Pros: The product is inexpensive and you get a lot for your money which is great and it does not require a subscription for automated refills like Proactive did. In terms of my acne - words cannot adequately express what a WONDER this product is!!! I started using it when there were 3 cysts on my face and within 3 days 2 of them were gone. No scars, no pain, nothing left of them. I have been using this product now for over 2 months and I have not had a single cystic breakout!!! - NOT ONE!!! Not to mention that the rest of my skin looks polished, clear, and feels fantastic!! I am a true believer!!! I havethrown out all my other acne-related cleansers and spot treatments!!!  Cons: Like other posts have mentioned there is a burning sensation, but nothing that is intolerable. After a week or so you do not even notice the burn and trust me, it is worth every second of &amp;#34;discomfort&amp;#34; because the results are amazing. Secondly, it does not diminish previous acne scars. In every sense of the word it is a cleanser and nothing else. I still need to use other products to diminish the discolored scars but I am confident that with time they will disappear.  Overall - I love this product  and am so happy that I purchased it!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, I had a problem with cystic acne (that&#x27;s the boil-like acne that&#x27;s really painful) &amp; for someone in their thirties, it&#x27;s embarrassing. After about three days, my face was so broke out that I considered throwing the entire tube into the trash but I stuck with it for three weeks and I am so glad I did. Not only did the breakouts clear but my face feels and looks better!</li>
            <li> I have combination sensitive skin that is prone to acne. I was very skeptical at first in trying this product because it was not well known like Proactiv or Murad or SkinID. My husband did some research and convinced me to try it out because it was rated as top 10 acne products. I use to break out after using makeup even thoroughly cleaning my face every night, but now my skin has not had a pimple since June 2012. This product is working wonders for me. The only thing I dislike about it is the smell. It has a strange smell, but worked for me. Everyone&#x27;s skin condition is different and takes time, but I&#x27;m glad I started using this product because my face is acne-free.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have know about this sooner! Believe me I was skeptical. I read a lot of reviews, did a bit of research, and finally decided to give this a try. I also bought the Acnetame pills as well, so far no complaints! Feels like I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and nothing really helped. I&#x27;ve only used this for a month now but I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now, and there has literally been no improvement. I was so excited initially because of all of the great reviews, but unfortunately for me it didn&#x27;t work :( However my face is very soft and feels great. I thought the benzoyl peroxide and the saclayic acid together would be a winner, especially with my oily skin. I have mild-moderate acne, so I thought this would work immediately.</li>
            <li> Immediate clearing of skin. Not abrasive but very effective. Would recommend to anyone.very reasonable price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Very good product. My son uses it and at first it really helped clear his acne but now it does not seem to be working quite as well. I do believe his acne would be worse without using it.</li>
            <li> Hands down I would recommend this product! I have tried everything I could possibly try and nothing worked. Others ive tried made my face worse or no results. I was amazed this helped even the cystic ones when nothing else has. My face has cleared up 90% and I&#x27;ll get the occasional time of the month pimple but that&#x27;s it. If you have sensitive skin like me, try just using it once at night if using it twice makes your face dry or really red. (Which goes away with some moisturizer)</li>
            <li> I is amazing my son&#x27;s skin is clearing up so well!</li>
            <li> Good soap.  It&#x27;s a scrub and works really well. Helps keep my face acne free.</li>
            <li> We have tryed a lot of stuff this works great!!</li>
            <li> Worth a shot. Works well at first. Why the re-breakout? I don&#x27;t know. But they stood behind their guarantee. So this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I have had mild to severe acne since I was in Middle school. Needless to say I have graduated from college now and it&#x27;s about time I found a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for 1 week and my acne seems to be going away a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it twice daily and it started burning my face. So I changed it to once a day and gradually changed it to twice a day like the instructions say to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t smell good but does that really matter? It leaves my face soft and its been healing my acne quicker than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will have to keep you updated in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for years now.  It seems as though everything I have tried, always ended in vain.  I read some reviews on this product and have seen some pretty good responses about it, so I figured I&#x27;d try this before I opted for the Proactive route.  I&#x27;ve been pretty consistent with it using as directed for five days now, this morning being my sixth.  I must say, on day one my face felt fresh, despite the slight tingling sensation.  By day three, this and my preferred moisturizer had given me smooth, soft skin.  Something I haven&#x27;t had in a while, dealing with constant trouble areas.  Now, I know I have acne scarring, but I can definitely feel the difference already.  I love the fact that this is a scrub.  I don&#x27;t have to rub for an over extended amount of time, or feel that I really have to work in this product thinking it will help me achieve better results.  I just use as directed.  I know that it&#x27;s exfoliating and cleaning my face.  Now, it does have a tiny, sting or tingling sensation to it, especially the longer its applied for me.  Please keep in mind everyone is completely different and we also have different sensitives, while others have not so much.  I don&#x27;t personally mind it as it&#x27;s absolutely nothing I can&#x27;t stand.  I have scarring which I hope will vanish over time, but I love the smooth and clean feeling I get with this acne wash.  Overall, I feel this product is really working and will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this is an amazing product. I was breaking out on my body and it was so embarrassing. I honestly tried a lot of different products and nothing worked. I SWEAR TO GOD after one use of nano cleanse my skin felt soooo much softer..... After one week 1x a day my acne was gone. I will forever buy this product. Definitely worth everyone trying! It&#x27;s very strong though so I recommend if you use it on your face (I did) to not leave it on as long as they suggest just so you can see how your face reacts. Moisturizer will be key. The only negative is it had a sulfur smell but its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to see if there is a difference but haven&#x27;t notices a big changes. I will update in another month or so.</li>
            <li> i have used many products on my face; acne free, proactive, clean and clear,ect. i have had acne since i was 14 and now, becausr of nanocleanse, i am acne free. i am 30 years old and suffered moslty from cystic acne. i was covered mostly on my cheecks and chin. i am noe 98% clear. i still have one or 2 pimples here and there (period acne), but i am completly happy with my results. i have gone through 4 bottles now and still use it everyday. Get it!! you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> My original review was a raving 5 star.  Since they have reformulated this product it&#x27;s lost its amazing results.  My (adult) face is breaking out again and this isn&#x27;t clearing the acne like it did before.</li>
            <li> As an accurate graduate with little to no acne, my girlfriend recommended this saying it changed her skin, helped with oil control, and made her complexion great. She has great skin so I tried it. There&#x27;s nothing here (I thought) that makes this better than the next face wash and actually has drawbacks like: doesn&#x27;t remove eye make up, get it anywhere near my eyes and my skin gets red and painful for a good 20 mins, and a little does not go a long way. It says use a dime size but I feel like I need a quarter or more just to cover face and neck. Overall, it&#x27;s just so so.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day, at night in the shower I slather a quarter size amount on my face and let it sit on there as I wash the rest of me. I wash it off last. It leaves my face a little red but it smells great, has great ingredients and you see a difference within the first 3 days. The makers changed the ingredients though so if you don&#x27;t get the one with the sulfur, you will notice less impact :/</li>
            <li> I was using it for awhile but didn&#x27;t see any improvement. But I will try another attempt to see if I want see a difference.</li>
            <li> Worked ok. Not as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne on my forehead, and I have tried everything (even proactive), but nothing worked&lt;br /&gt;I did alot of research and this got great reviews, so I tried it and it worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;I saw results in a few days!!&lt;br /&gt;***but remember this needs to be on your face for about a min or so for it to have the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;thank you Nanocleanse!</li>
            <li> 32 years old with breakouts/adult acne on the sides of my face/chin: after 3 uses...98% GONE! I use a make up remover pad afterwards as well because my make up isn&#x27;t fully off after wash...a wash that works truly! Look beautiful and feel beautiful!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one wk and have noticed a significant difference. The redness is gone and so is the swelling.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I was doubtful if I was even going to be able to use this product but I read all the reviews saying it was the best so I tried it and I am so glad I did! It has not once irritated my skin and it has made my skin acne free within the first week. I couldn&#x27;t be more please with this product!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has been able to keep my skin clear for months.  I always had monthly breakouts, which I attributed to hormones.  Since, I&#x27;ve been using this product my skin has stayed clear.  You do need to use a moisterizer with it, my skin did get red and after a couple of days it was burning.  One night it was really hurting so I put some Aveeno lotion on, the combo is perfect.  My skin is clear and soft!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving bad ratings but this was too harsh for my sensitive skin. It gave me a bumpy itchy rash where I used it.</li>
