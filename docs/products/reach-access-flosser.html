            <li>Good item, good value</li>
            <li>My dentist tells me flossers like these aren&#x27;t as good as dental floss used &amp;#34;the old-fashioned way&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It was good while I had it</li>
            <li>very pleased</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love this Reach Flosser!  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite inventions ever!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>It is so easy I&#x27;m happy to do it three times a day.  </li>
            <li>This product makes flossing so easy, but the really great thing is how thorough it is.  </li>
            <li>I liked everything except the diameter of the dental floss used.</li>
            <li>The mint flavored refill packs are nice.</li>
            <li>I am able to floss one-handed, reach between all my teeth, and to do a good job of flossing.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of pricey and environmentally unfriendly</li>
            <li>I own three (home, car and travel).</li>
            <li>and I noticed this new product and thought it would be perfect for the kids</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>And exponentially more effective.</li>
            <li>So far very happy.</li>
            <li>Go for the &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; models as they most effectively remove plaque.</li>
            <li>Soo easy to floss with!</li>
            <li>Most of my teeth allow the flosser in with no resistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so much better than flossing with just a string of floss wrapped around your fingers.</li>
            <li>The obvious way to use it isn&#x27;t the best way.</li>
            <li>Love using this instead of just dental floss.  </li>
            <li>--works better but the floss tend to come lose all the time.</li>
            <li>All in all we&#x27;re pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I struggled with flossing for many years.</li>
            <li>I also use the tips more than once and wash thoroughly between uses to not be wasteful.</li>
            <li>Best way to reach all the way to the back of your mouth and floss in areas that were otherwise unreachable.  </li>
            <li>Since I bout this product I floss more often.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Dislike that I have to get more replacement separately.</li>
            <li>This is the best flosser I&#x27;ve ever had, it actually gets me to floss.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite comedians, Mitch Hedberg, once said:&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>comment couldn&#x27;t be more spot on.</li>
            <li>My dentist even noticed how much better my teeth were once I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love the mint flavored refills.</li>
            <li>Mine broke after many years of use</li>
            <li>After visiting my dentist (after how many years), I was informed that I had gingivitis, and that I needed to start flossing immediately.</li>
            <li>I love flossing now.</li>
            <li>Would give more than 5 stars if I could.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The design also makes it challenging to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Indeed I used it twice a day now for most of the teeth and</li>
            <li>so I hurt myself too many times forcing the floss in between.  </li>
            <li>I accidentally discovered this product in the toothcare aisle the day after my dentist told me to floss more.  </li>
            <li>this product comes in are now recyclable in most areas.  </li>
            <li>The Reach flosses should be available in bags of 75+, not packages of 11-20!</li>
            <li>I floss so much more, and much better with the Reach Flosser.</li>
            <li>I found using string floss to be, well, challenging, er.</li>
            <li>The idea is great, and this could be a very convenient way to floss your teeth.</li>
            <li>Btw, you can rinse and reuse the flosser more than once.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any pain or discomfort, when using this, and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Dental health is very important and these one of my most important buys.</li>
            <li>Reach is better than the knockoffs - refills stay in place stronger, easier to use as the orientation fits in your mouth easily.  </li>
            <li>- this will make the floss go between your teeth more easily.</li>
            <li>When I found this easy flosser, I was very excited.</li>
            <li>The Reach Flosser is a great way to get the job of flossing done in a far easier manner.</li>
            <li>but it still wasn&#x27;t as easy as this.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing so easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, with the flossing act itself made simpler, the flossing material is also easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Practical and safe to use, allowing me to keep my mouth clean wherever you are.</li>
            <li>I can easily see what I&#x27;m doing, and I haven&#x27;t had the floss break yet, even with my tightly-packed teeth.  </li>
            <li>The heads are easy to put on and take off the handle.</li>
            <li>It got between my teeth easily</li>
            <li>However, there is an easy way to get the floss in between.  </li>
            <li>If you use your jaws they are easily controlled.  </li>
            <li>Great product that I am having trouble finding in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far superior to competitive products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>The replaceable head/cartridge dislodges easily on the competitive product leaving it stuck in your teeth.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s plenty of floss for &amp;#34;taking care of business&amp;#34; with dental hygiene, the it&#x27;s easy to get between the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>and now it really is as easy as brushing.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to replace snap on heads.  </li>
            <li>This product has made flossing easy and guitt-free.</li>
            <li>This thing makes it easy.</li>
            <li>and *seemed* quite strong, HOWEVER</li>
            <li>Works like the previous one and fits the floss picks perfectly.</li>
            <li>That one is still fine.</li>
            <li>This was and is a huge motivator for me to keep flossing every day.</li>
            <li>The Glide tape fit between my rear teeth -</li>
            <li>It works fantastic.</li>
            <li>This flosser has fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long-time non-flosser, and the primary reason for that was that I just couldn&#x27;t make it work.  </li>
            <li>The item was shipped and delivered to me in just a few days, the product is wonderful</li>
            <li>I know how important it is to floss.</li>
            <li>I say it even makes it more fun</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the most powerful deodorant.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re as uncoordinated as I am, and you&#x27;re able to floss better and more frequently with these (like I do), you may come out ahead.</li>
            <li>This is great for reaching and flossing your back teeth.  </li>
            <li>Not only does REACH make this great product, I also like its toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>To be fair, this flosser is far superior to just using a regular roll of floss and certainly better than those cheap plastic disposable one-use pieces of junk that come in packs of 100.</li>
            <li>it is sooooooo much easier to use and much more enjoyable than floss.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Your jaw is stronger than your fingers and its force is more easily controlled, so the floss will pop between your teeth more easily and it won&#x27;t go too far into your gums once it pops through.</li>
            <li>My Dentist tells me that this device doesn&#x27;t replace the more common string floss, or ribbon floss, and she is right, but it is the best thing for a very quick and easy floss after a meal, or whenever you get something caught in your teeth.  </li>
            <li>With this thing, flossing is super duper easy, and really cheap.</li>
            <li>But not its super easy.</li>
            <li>Instead, use the opposing jaw to push on the back of the device - making this possible is the magic that makes this device so awesome.</li>
            <li>P.S. Received from a diffferent Company name than what the original invoice showed.</li>
            <li>original review:  </li>
            <li>My main consideration is how easy and enjoyable it is floss with the Reach.</li>
            <li>I expect that the more I do it, the easier and more natural it will get.  </li>
            <li>The design is perfect for those hard to reach molars.</li>
            <li>Additionally  you are throwing away a lot more plastic since you are discarding the whole unit.</li>
            <li>I grew up without fluoridated water and have a mouth full of mercury fillings.  </li>
            <li>It feels good to finally be taking care of my gums.</li>
            <li>This makes flossing so much easier and more convenient.  </li>
            <li>Note:  Although I like this flosser, I lowered the stars to three because both my dental technician and a dentist in an online article said that flossers like this don&#x27;t get deeply enough into the pockets around the teeth to do that much good.  </li>
            <li>-- a flosser doesn&#x27;t need to be as long as a toothbrush, you hold it closer to the top for leverage and precision, so there&#x27;s a lot of handle that you don&#x27;t need, but that doesn&#x27;t really affect performance, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>but in this day age quick follow up to internet shopping</li>
            <li>BTW, pass up the Rexall and super budget flossers --</li>
            <li>I got one of these from Reach&#x27;s website when they first launched them, as a sample for free.</li>
            <li>Flossing is now my new favorite pastime.  </li>
            <li>This solves all the problems, making it much faster and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>How economical is that?</li>
            <li>This works nicely, and with regular use it becomes easier and easier to use.   </li>
            <li>It sounds kind of gross</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t figure out if the value is worth the price bump over store brands.</li>
            <li>Liked using Reach Flosser to get back teeth and to remove food stuck between teeth.  </li>
            <li>, I have some hand issues and this product really helps, thanks!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy and just feels natural.</li>
            <li>I tried other flossing devices and none of those were as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The right way requires some coordination that will take time to learn.</li>
            <li>PS, reach has a coupon on the website for $1 off this product right now.</li>
            <li>When I had my free one, I was too cheap to buy the refill packs, and as gross as it may sound, I was able to use the SAME flosser head for six months.</li>
            <li>I have a waterpik as well but prefer this to get my teeth really feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove an old disposable head, and just as easy to install a new disposable head.  </li>
            <li>It takes only seven minutes for many foods, especially the sweet foods most Americans eat, to begin the decaying process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Better still, you can use both hands easily, one on the handle and one near the head.  </li>
            <li>i had used one before but could not locate another one locally, it works great as a flosser since I only have use of one hand</li>
            <li>Right now I am looking into getting an interdental brush which is made to be inserted into the cracks between the teeth, and which may work better than both this flosser and regular dental</li>
            <li>the product live up to its name; really makes flossing and access easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found a way to floss easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>Great for flossing in those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>I found this flosser to be most practical of several on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to floss regularly but I&#x27;ve become much better at it after buying the Reach Flosser.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason, the act of flossing is one of those things where everybody knows they should do it, but many people just don&#x27;t make that extra effort.  </li>
            <li>Germ-o-phobes will use a different head for every floss, but most will just wash it off afterwards and use it until it wears/frays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ever since i started using the Reach flosser i have been able to only go once every 6 months</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>This is the first reach brush I have used and it works well.  </li>
            <li>I like it just as much as the hummingbird floss and its 1/4 of the price!</li>
            <li>Makes flossing so much easier!</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>JUNK, breaks on the first row of teeth.</li>
            <li>bought it as a bck up handle and it was what i exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>Sadly almost unavailable in markets, nowadays, yet still the best in its category of shopping.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I preferred the more substantial feel of the Dolphin when flossing.</li>
            <li>I had higher hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Or it&#x27;s a pain to have to insert your fist into your mouth first.  </li>
            <li>However, you must first separate the cardboard from the plastic bubble.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I would prefer it if the filament were a little thicker and more fibrous, instead of being so smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as steady and powerful as you get.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to ANYONE because it really has made flossing so much easier for me!</li>
            <li>first time I used the flosser, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I started using it and discovered that it&#x27;s so EASY to floss and flossing only takes 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Just keep it in the same spot as your toothbrush for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m amazed how easy it is to get to the back of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>and you will be flossing all the time because it is easy and simple.</li>
            <li>With the Reach flosser, it&#x27;s easy to reach all upper and lower teeth!</li>
            <li>CVS makes some handy self-contained flossers for substantially less.</li>
            <li>How smart, I thought.  </li>
            <li>You just buy floss and string it on, which is infinitely more economical and less wasteful than this</li>
            <li>works fine, wish regular floss could be strung  in between the bow instead of having to purchase floss cartridges separately.</li>
            <li>Most poeple, I think, just quickly pop the floss between their teeth, so it&#x27;s hard to see how regular floss can be so much better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to hold and lets you get into deep hard to reach areas easily.</li>
            <li>The availability of ready-made refills make the chore of flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li>HAHAHA</li>
            <li>I actually now enjoy it because the Reach flosser gently massages my gums and leaves them feeling so much cleaner than brushing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>oh so much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like fumbling around with a string of floss, so this is much nicer for me, and you get to keep your fingers out of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find battery-powered ones any longer, the manual still does the trick very well.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves them now.</li>
            <li>the size makes things very convenient.</li>
            <li>This  item worked very well, until my dog got a hold of it.</li>
            <li>He absolutely can&#x27;t do without it.  </li>
            <li>If you wriggle in the floss like using a line, you would hold the handle much closer to the mouth.  </li>
            <li>Just bit gently on the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>Makes flossing much easier to do.</li>
            <li>and this thing really works.  </li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, your recycler will throw the whole thing away</li>
            <li>This product is much easier to use than floss, and can do a thorough job using just one hand.</li>
            <li>However, if you are the type of person who appreciates high quality floss that doesn&#x27;t shred, stay away from this product!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the handle lasts long.</li>
            <li>The grip of Reach&#x27;s Access Flosser is long and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>But then I realized that it isn&#x27;t enough to just slide the filament between my teeth; I needed to wiggle it around in a circular motion to clean the area.  </li>
            <li>Makes it much faster which makes doing it more frequently less of a hassle.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth the waste of changing heads to make it this easy to get to teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you are in the same situation--want to floss regularly, but can&#x27;t seem to get into a good pattern--this simple invention may be just the kick-start you need.  </li>
            <li>The cute little saw things weren&#x27;t much</li>
            <li>this would happen sometimes just after I put in a brand new floss cartridge!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Added later:  After using this flosser for a couple weeks, I&#x27;m experiencing the same thing that other reviewers have experienced.  </li>
            <li>Your first natural inclination will be to use your arm/hand/finger muscles to force the floss between your teeth, just as you do with normal floss.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this personal flossing tool makes the \\&quot;chore\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It makes flossing simple and quick.</li>
            <li>These last two points are more of a personal preference, but I felt ripped off by the Reach every time the floss would just break without reason or warning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe as it&#x27;s used medically inside and outside the body.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>For everyone else I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the mint flavored flosser heads.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find them in the stores near me!!  </li>
            <li>of the other reviews complain that the floss snaps too easily.</li>
            <li>and I normally used Glide tape.</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to flossing now because something about using this product is fun.</li>
            <li>, I figured I would probably have to pay them $9.00, but I decided it would be worth it to support a local business.  </li>
            <li>This flosser really helps make it easier to floss everyday because it&#x27;s so much less a chore and more comfortable to do.</li>
            <li>I can keep it right next to my toothbrush, prompting me to floss before brushing every time.</li>
            <li>Brand new in package and seem to be what it says it is.</li>
            <li>flossing makes you live longer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the market for a new one now (and am also going to get one for my boyfriend).</li>
            <li>New Year struck, and a new year&#x27;s resolution was struck.  </li>
            <li>So now I insert the filament (which sometimes requires a back-and-forth motion if the space is tight), and then I move the flosser around to clean the whole area.  </li>
            <li>I first tried using regular string floss</li>
            <li>This is the tool that finally got me to floss consistently.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I&#x27;m flossing regularly, and the dentist-induced guilt is gone!</li>
            <li>The Reach Access Flosser is an extremely simple device for using the disposable Reach Flosser heads, and it works exactly as it is supposed to work.  </li>
            <li>They have a convenient angle and the bristles last longer than most other brands.</li>
            <li>The Everyday Flossers are more expensive to manufacture and, though I like the Reach flossers more, I&#x27;m not willing to pay the greater price.</li>
            <li>Pulling off both of these moves at the same time takes a little practice, but once I got the hang of it, flossing is now fast and easy, which was never the case before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hard to find item but found it and love it, thanks for carrying it would recomment it to all who are looking for a similar item</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fit it between a few rear teeth - spacing too</li>
            <li>Instead of using dental floss that can get caught between teeth, and even rip (that has been my experience), the floss band is part of a plastic device (or \\&quot;wand\\&quot; - as I would call it) that helps do the job, as far as cleaning hard-to-reach canines, as well as front teeth.</li>
            <li>Really reaches the back of your teeth.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this if you have the same problem as me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Couple that with the complete inability to see what I was doing with two fists shoved in my mouth, and it was a recipe for frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually floss too much.</li>
            <li>Makes reaching the back teeth much easier.</li>
            <li>, it broke far too</li>
            <li>(though if we were vampires, I wonder if our teeth would always just naturally sparkle?)</li>
            <li>I much prefer the smaller disposable flossers.</li>
            <li>With the Reach Access, it is at least 75% easier and faster to floss 100% more sanitary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The non-slip grip is a bit far away from the mouth.  </li>
            <li>Who wants to re-use a flosser because only seven comes in a packet?</li>
            <li>But I love it - went without for a few months when CVS stopped carrying the flosser itself and only carried the refills</li>
            <li>Many of my patients, that would normally be unable to floss at all, can now use this \\&quot;Easy Flosser\\&quot; with ease because of the long, no-slip handle.</li>
            <li>No other product like it as far as I am concerned !</li>
            <li>Even though I have a small mouth I can easily floss each tooth.</li>
            <li>This product lets me get it done quickly without any mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and makes flossing everyday feasible (for the lazy).</li>
            <li>I ordered a new Reach flosser, because my old one snapped a the neck after years of daily use.</li>
            <li>It basically allows you to go right in because the floss is perpendicular to the handle instead of most others where the floss goes the same direction as the handle which causes you to contort into weird angles and stretch your cheeks to get into where you need to go.</li>
            <li>My daughter can use this easily getting the molars which can be really hard to access.</li>
            <li>But so easy to use for the hard to reach molars.</li>
            <li>My dentist gave me the handle starter because I have a hard time reaching my back teeth with the top care side handle ones.</li>
            <li>For my New Year&#x27;s resolution I decided I would start flossing regularly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For people like me with teeth very close together: Learning to use this device optimally will take a few weeks (yes, really).</li>
            <li>As a dental hygienist, getting patients to floss regularly is a major undertaking.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a toothbrush handy, use tooth pics and rinse your mouth with water, and the rinsing part is very important after drinking sugary soft drinks, which are horrible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had really coordinated fingers, and the annoyance (however minor) of wrapping floss around my fingers and maneuvering it through my mouth was enough to keep me from doing it.</li>
            <li>It will also readily dissolve in water on contact with wet</li>
            <li>first I thought that I would have to floss the right side of my mouth with my left hand, which felt awkward; but then I found a way to hold the flosser with my right hand which felt natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the easiest method to quickly and conveniently floss all your teeth, including those hard to reach back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, my dentist is adamant that it would not replacing flossing with a regular string floss as the taute string on this will only get a tangent on the tooth and not wrap around the tooth for thorough placque removal.</li>
            <li>there is no excuse anymore!</li>
            <li>A few of my teeth are quite tight but I am able to get to them by gently moving the flosser back and forth as I work it through the tight spot.</li>
            <li>The floss is thin, rounded and strong.  </li>
            <li>starters, you won&#x27;t have to mess around with winding the floss around your fingers and guessing as to how much you need.  </li>

            <li> Good item, good value</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me flossers like these aren&#x27;t as good as dental floss used &amp;#34;the old-fashioned way&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It was good while I had it</li>
            <li> very pleased</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I love this Reach Flosser!  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite inventions ever!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> It is so easy I&#x27;m happy to do it three times a day.  </li>
            <li> This product makes flossing so easy, but the really great thing is how thorough it is.  </li>
            <li> I liked everything except the diameter of the dental floss used.</li>
            <li> The mint flavored refill packs are nice.</li>
            <li> I am able to floss one-handed, reach between all my teeth, and to do a good job of flossing.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of pricey and environmentally unfriendly</li>
            <li> I own three (home, car and travel).</li>
            <li> and I noticed this new product and thought it would be perfect for the kids</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> And exponentially more effective.</li>
            <li> So far very happy.</li>
            <li> Go for the &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; models as they most effectively remove plaque.</li>
            <li> Soo easy to floss with!</li>
            <li> Most of my teeth allow the flosser in with no resistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so much better than flossing with just a string of floss wrapped around your fingers.</li>
            <li> The obvious way to use it isn&#x27;t the best way.</li>
            <li> Love using this instead of just dental floss.  </li>
            <li> --works better but the floss tend to come lose all the time.</li>
            <li> All in all we&#x27;re pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I struggled with flossing for many years.</li>
            <li> I also use the tips more than once and wash thoroughly between uses to not be wasteful.</li>
            <li> Best way to reach all the way to the back of your mouth and floss in areas that were otherwise unreachable.  </li>
            <li> Since I bout this product I floss more often.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Dislike that I have to get more replacement separately.</li>
            <li> This is the best flosser I&#x27;ve ever had, it actually gets me to floss.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite comedians, Mitch Hedberg, once said:&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> comment couldn&#x27;t be more spot on.</li>
            <li> My dentist even noticed how much better my teeth were once I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love the mint flavored refills.</li>
            <li> Mine broke after many years of use</li>
            <li> After visiting my dentist (after how many years), I was informed that I had gingivitis, and that I needed to start flossing immediately.</li>
            <li> I love flossing now.</li>
            <li> Would give more than 5 stars if I could.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design also makes it challenging to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Indeed I used it twice a day now for most of the teeth and</li>
            <li> so I hurt myself too many times forcing the floss in between.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally discovered this product in the toothcare aisle the day after my dentist told me to floss more.  </li>
            <li> this product comes in are now recyclable in most areas.  </li>
            <li> The Reach flosses should be available in bags of 75+, not packages of 11-20!</li>
            <li> I floss so much more, and much better with the Reach Flosser.</li>
            <li> I found using string floss to be, well, challenging, er.</li>
            <li> The idea is great, and this could be a very convenient way to floss your teeth.</li>
            <li> Btw, you can rinse and reuse the flosser more than once.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any pain or discomfort, when using this, and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Dental health is very important and these one of my most important buys.</li>
            <li> Reach is better than the knockoffs - refills stay in place stronger, easier to use as the orientation fits in your mouth easily.  </li>
            <li> - this will make the floss go between your teeth more easily.</li>
            <li> When I found this easy flosser, I was very excited.</li>
            <li> The Reach Flosser is a great way to get the job of flossing done in a far easier manner.</li>
            <li> but it still wasn&#x27;t as easy as this.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing so easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, with the flossing act itself made simpler, the flossing material is also easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> Practical and safe to use, allowing me to keep my mouth clean wherever you are.</li>
            <li> I can easily see what I&#x27;m doing, and I haven&#x27;t had the floss break yet, even with my tightly-packed teeth.  </li>
            <li> The heads are easy to put on and take off the handle.</li>
            <li> It got between my teeth easily</li>
            <li> However, there is an easy way to get the floss in between.  </li>
            <li> If you use your jaws they are easily controlled.  </li>
            <li> Great product that I am having trouble finding in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far superior to competitive products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> The replaceable head/cartridge dislodges easily on the competitive product leaving it stuck in your teeth.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of floss for &amp;#34;taking care of business&amp;#34; with dental hygiene, the it&#x27;s easy to get between the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> and now it really is as easy as brushing.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to replace snap on heads.  </li>
            <li> This product has made flossing easy and guitt-free.</li>
            <li> This thing makes it easy.</li>
            <li> and *seemed* quite strong, HOWEVER</li>
            <li> Works like the previous one and fits the floss picks perfectly.</li>
            <li> That one is still fine.</li>
            <li> This was and is a huge motivator for me to keep flossing every day.</li>
            <li> The Glide tape fit between my rear teeth -</li>
            <li> It works fantastic.</li>
            <li> This flosser has fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time non-flosser, and the primary reason for that was that I just couldn&#x27;t make it work.  </li>
            <li> The item was shipped and delivered to me in just a few days, the product is wonderful</li>
            <li> I know how important it is to floss.</li>
            <li> I say it even makes it more fun</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the most powerful deodorant.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re as uncoordinated as I am, and you&#x27;re able to floss better and more frequently with these (like I do), you may come out ahead.</li>
            <li> This is great for reaching and flossing your back teeth.  </li>
            <li> Not only does REACH make this great product, I also like its toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> To be fair, this flosser is far superior to just using a regular roll of floss and certainly better than those cheap plastic disposable one-use pieces of junk that come in packs of 100.</li>
            <li> it is sooooooo much easier to use and much more enjoyable than floss.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Your jaw is stronger than your fingers and its force is more easily controlled, so the floss will pop between your teeth more easily and it won&#x27;t go too far into your gums once it pops through.</li>
            <li> My Dentist tells me that this device doesn&#x27;t replace the more common string floss, or ribbon floss, and she is right, but it is the best thing for a very quick and easy floss after a meal, or whenever you get something caught in your teeth.  </li>
            <li> With this thing, flossing is super duper easy, and really cheap.</li>
            <li> But not its super easy.</li>
            <li> Instead, use the opposing jaw to push on the back of the device - making this possible is the magic that makes this device so awesome.</li>
            <li> P.S. Received from a diffferent Company name than what the original invoice showed.</li>
            <li> original review:  </li>
            <li> My main consideration is how easy and enjoyable it is floss with the Reach.</li>
            <li> I expect that the more I do it, the easier and more natural it will get.  </li>
            <li> The design is perfect for those hard to reach molars.</li>
            <li> Additionally  you are throwing away a lot more plastic since you are discarding the whole unit.</li>
            <li> I grew up without fluoridated water and have a mouth full of mercury fillings.  </li>
            <li> It feels good to finally be taking care of my gums.</li>
            <li> This makes flossing so much easier and more convenient.  </li>
            <li> Note:  Although I like this flosser, I lowered the stars to three because both my dental technician and a dentist in an online article said that flossers like this don&#x27;t get deeply enough into the pockets around the teeth to do that much good.  </li>
            <li> -- a flosser doesn&#x27;t need to be as long as a toothbrush, you hold it closer to the top for leverage and precision, so there&#x27;s a lot of handle that you don&#x27;t need, but that doesn&#x27;t really affect performance, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> but in this day age quick follow up to internet shopping</li>
            <li> BTW, pass up the Rexall and super budget flossers --</li>
            <li> I got one of these from Reach&#x27;s website when they first launched them, as a sample for free.</li>
            <li> Flossing is now my new favorite pastime.  </li>
            <li> This solves all the problems, making it much faster and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> How economical is that?</li>
            <li> This works nicely, and with regular use it becomes easier and easier to use.   </li>
            <li> It sounds kind of gross</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t figure out if the value is worth the price bump over store brands.</li>
            <li> Liked using Reach Flosser to get back teeth and to remove food stuck between teeth.  </li>
            <li> , I have some hand issues and this product really helps, thanks!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy and just feels natural.</li>
            <li> I tried other flossing devices and none of those were as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The right way requires some coordination that will take time to learn.</li>
            <li> PS, reach has a coupon on the website for $1 off this product right now.</li>
            <li> When I had my free one, I was too cheap to buy the refill packs, and as gross as it may sound, I was able to use the SAME flosser head for six months.</li>
            <li> I have a waterpik as well but prefer this to get my teeth really feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove an old disposable head, and just as easy to install a new disposable head.  </li>
            <li> It takes only seven minutes for many foods, especially the sweet foods most Americans eat, to begin the decaying process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Better still, you can use both hands easily, one on the handle and one near the head.  </li>
            <li> i had used one before but could not locate another one locally, it works great as a flosser since I only have use of one hand</li>
            <li> Right now I am looking into getting an interdental brush which is made to be inserted into the cracks between the teeth, and which may work better than both this flosser and regular dental</li>
            <li> the product live up to its name; really makes flossing and access easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a way to floss easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> Great for flossing in those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I found this flosser to be most practical of several on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to floss regularly but I&#x27;ve become much better at it after buying the Reach Flosser.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason, the act of flossing is one of those things where everybody knows they should do it, but many people just don&#x27;t make that extra effort.  </li>
            <li> Germ-o-phobes will use a different head for every floss, but most will just wash it off afterwards and use it until it wears/frays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ever since i started using the Reach flosser i have been able to only go once every 6 months</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li> This is the first reach brush I have used and it works well.  </li>
            <li> I like it just as much as the hummingbird floss and its 1/4 of the price!</li>
            <li> Makes flossing so much easier!</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> JUNK, breaks on the first row of teeth.</li>
            <li> bought it as a bck up handle and it was what i exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> Sadly almost unavailable in markets, nowadays, yet still the best in its category of shopping.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I preferred the more substantial feel of the Dolphin when flossing.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> Or it&#x27;s a pain to have to insert your fist into your mouth first.  </li>
            <li> However, you must first separate the cardboard from the plastic bubble.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I would prefer it if the filament were a little thicker and more fibrous, instead of being so smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as steady and powerful as you get.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to ANYONE because it really has made flossing so much easier for me!</li>
            <li> first time I used the flosser, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I started using it and discovered that it&#x27;s so EASY to floss and flossing only takes 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Just keep it in the same spot as your toothbrush for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed how easy it is to get to the back of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> and you will be flossing all the time because it is easy and simple.</li>
            <li> With the Reach flosser, it&#x27;s easy to reach all upper and lower teeth!</li>
            <li> CVS makes some handy self-contained flossers for substantially less.</li>
            <li> How smart, I thought.  </li>
            <li> You just buy floss and string it on, which is infinitely more economical and less wasteful than this</li>
            <li> works fine, wish regular floss could be strung  in between the bow instead of having to purchase floss cartridges separately.</li>
            <li> Most poeple, I think, just quickly pop the floss between their teeth, so it&#x27;s hard to see how regular floss can be so much better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to hold and lets you get into deep hard to reach areas easily.</li>
            <li> The availability of ready-made refills make the chore of flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li> HAHAHA</li>
            <li> I actually now enjoy it because the Reach flosser gently massages my gums and leaves them feeling so much cleaner than brushing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> oh so much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like fumbling around with a string of floss, so this is much nicer for me, and you get to keep your fingers out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find battery-powered ones any longer, the manual still does the trick very well.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves them now.</li>
            <li> the size makes things very convenient.</li>
            <li> This  item worked very well, until my dog got a hold of it.</li>
            <li> He absolutely can&#x27;t do without it.  </li>
            <li> If you wriggle in the floss like using a line, you would hold the handle much closer to the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Just bit gently on the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Makes flossing much easier to do.</li>
            <li> and this thing really works.  </li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, your recycler will throw the whole thing away</li>
            <li> This product is much easier to use than floss, and can do a thorough job using just one hand.</li>
            <li> However, if you are the type of person who appreciates high quality floss that doesn&#x27;t shred, stay away from this product!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the handle lasts long.</li>
            <li> The grip of Reach&#x27;s Access Flosser is long and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> But then I realized that it isn&#x27;t enough to just slide the filament between my teeth; I needed to wiggle it around in a circular motion to clean the area.  </li>
            <li> Makes it much faster which makes doing it more frequently less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth the waste of changing heads to make it this easy to get to teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you are in the same situation--want to floss regularly, but can&#x27;t seem to get into a good pattern--this simple invention may be just the kick-start you need.  </li>
            <li> The cute little saw things weren&#x27;t much</li>
            <li> this would happen sometimes just after I put in a brand new floss cartridge!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Added later:  After using this flosser for a couple weeks, I&#x27;m experiencing the same thing that other reviewers have experienced.  </li>
            <li> Your first natural inclination will be to use your arm/hand/finger muscles to force the floss between your teeth, just as you do with normal floss.</li>
            <li> Luckily, this personal flossing tool makes the \\&quot;chore\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It makes flossing simple and quick.</li>
            <li> These last two points are more of a personal preference, but I felt ripped off by the Reach every time the floss would just break without reason or warning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe as it&#x27;s used medically inside and outside the body.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> For everyone else I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the mint flavored flosser heads.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find them in the stores near me!!  </li>
            <li> of the other reviews complain that the floss snaps too easily.</li>
            <li> and I normally used Glide tape.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to flossing now because something about using this product is fun.</li>
            <li> , I figured I would probably have to pay them $9.00, but I decided it would be worth it to support a local business.  </li>
            <li> This flosser really helps make it easier to floss everyday because it&#x27;s so much less a chore and more comfortable to do.</li>
            <li> I can keep it right next to my toothbrush, prompting me to floss before brushing every time.</li>
            <li> Brand new in package and seem to be what it says it is.</li>
            <li> flossing makes you live longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the market for a new one now (and am also going to get one for my boyfriend).</li>
            <li> New Year struck, and a new year&#x27;s resolution was struck.  </li>
            <li> So now I insert the filament (which sometimes requires a back-and-forth motion if the space is tight), and then I move the flosser around to clean the whole area.  </li>
            <li> I first tried using regular string floss</li>
            <li> This is the tool that finally got me to floss consistently.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I&#x27;m flossing regularly, and the dentist-induced guilt is gone!</li>
            <li> The Reach Access Flosser is an extremely simple device for using the disposable Reach Flosser heads, and it works exactly as it is supposed to work.  </li>
            <li> They have a convenient angle and the bristles last longer than most other brands.</li>
            <li> The Everyday Flossers are more expensive to manufacture and, though I like the Reach flossers more, I&#x27;m not willing to pay the greater price.</li>
            <li> Pulling off both of these moves at the same time takes a little practice, but once I got the hang of it, flossing is now fast and easy, which was never the case before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hard to find item but found it and love it, thanks for carrying it would recomment it to all who are looking for a similar item</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fit it between a few rear teeth - spacing too</li>
            <li> Instead of using dental floss that can get caught between teeth, and even rip (that has been my experience), the floss band is part of a plastic device (or \\&quot;wand\\&quot; - as I would call it) that helps do the job, as far as cleaning hard-to-reach canines, as well as front teeth.</li>
            <li> Really reaches the back of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this if you have the same problem as me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple that with the complete inability to see what I was doing with two fists shoved in my mouth, and it was a recipe for frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually floss too much.</li>
            <li> Makes reaching the back teeth much easier.</li>
            <li> , it broke far too</li>
            <li> (though if we were vampires, I wonder if our teeth would always just naturally sparkle?)</li>
            <li> I much prefer the smaller disposable flossers.</li>
            <li> With the Reach Access, it is at least 75% easier and faster to floss 100% more sanitary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The non-slip grip is a bit far away from the mouth.  </li>
            <li> Who wants to re-use a flosser because only seven comes in a packet?</li>
            <li> But I love it - went without for a few months when CVS stopped carrying the flosser itself and only carried the refills</li>
            <li> Many of my patients, that would normally be unable to floss at all, can now use this \\&quot;Easy Flosser\\&quot; with ease because of the long, no-slip handle.</li>
            <li> No other product like it as far as I am concerned !</li>
            <li> Even though I have a small mouth I can easily floss each tooth.</li>
            <li> This product lets me get it done quickly without any mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use and makes flossing everyday feasible (for the lazy).</li>
            <li> I ordered a new Reach flosser, because my old one snapped a the neck after years of daily use.</li>
            <li> It basically allows you to go right in because the floss is perpendicular to the handle instead of most others where the floss goes the same direction as the handle which causes you to contort into weird angles and stretch your cheeks to get into where you need to go.</li>
            <li> My daughter can use this easily getting the molars which can be really hard to access.</li>
            <li> But so easy to use for the hard to reach molars.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me the handle starter because I have a hard time reaching my back teeth with the top care side handle ones.</li>
            <li> For my New Year&#x27;s resolution I decided I would start flossing regularly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For people like me with teeth very close together: Learning to use this device optimally will take a few weeks (yes, really).</li>
            <li> As a dental hygienist, getting patients to floss regularly is a major undertaking.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a toothbrush handy, use tooth pics and rinse your mouth with water, and the rinsing part is very important after drinking sugary soft drinks, which are horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had really coordinated fingers, and the annoyance (however minor) of wrapping floss around my fingers and maneuvering it through my mouth was enough to keep me from doing it.</li>
            <li> It will also readily dissolve in water on contact with wet</li>
            <li> first I thought that I would have to floss the right side of my mouth with my left hand, which felt awkward; but then I found a way to hold the flosser with my right hand which felt natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest method to quickly and conveniently floss all your teeth, including those hard to reach back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, my dentist is adamant that it would not replacing flossing with a regular string floss as the taute string on this will only get a tangent on the tooth and not wrap around the tooth for thorough placque removal.</li>
            <li> there is no excuse anymore!</li>
            <li> A few of my teeth are quite tight but I am able to get to them by gently moving the flosser back and forth as I work it through the tight spot.</li>
            <li> The floss is thin, rounded and strong.  </li>
            <li> starters, you won&#x27;t have to mess around with winding the floss around your fingers and guessing as to how much you need.  </li>
            <li> So far this year I have flossed every day due to the ease of flossing.</li>
            <li> Remember the old saying: Be true to your teeth or they will be false to you!  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty hard to admit but until I got this gadget I never flossed.</li>
            <li> This one is much easier to use for a lazy person like me</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Reach Access\\&quot; flosser didn&#x27;t last nearly as long for me or my kids as the Dolphin flossers</li>
            <li> The Reach is a little better, but the flosser replacements are a rip-off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like you need to use a new cartridge for every few teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and fits into difficult spaces in the mouth .</li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised it fits in between my tight teeth.</li>
            <li> Personally, I use standard floss before I go to bed, but the Reach Access Flosser for all other flossing needs.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I&#x27;m one of those people who is angry at doctors and dentists because they are all over-charging the public and trying to get rich.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and it definitely beats using the traditional floss and other flossers.</li>
            <li> The actual floss in these heads is low quality and not waxed enough that if you have tight gaps between your teeth</li>
            <li> This item is difficult to find in stores and I enjoy buying from Amazon, so I shop here quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> You no longer have an excuse not to floss</li>
            <li> I hope Johnson &amp; Johnson keeps this product in production for a long time.</li>
            <li> long anyway.</li>
            <li> You wonder why they haven&#x27;t thought of this long time ago...  </li>
            <li> This is basically a toothbrush with a bit of floss stretched out on the end.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because the handle is unnecessarily long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected and works for my needs, it was packaged well and would recommend to any needing the same product.</li>
            <li> Once in I can&#x27;t stop fast enough so the line cut through to my gum at the worse angel.  </li>
            <li> after a couple of weeks I can floss with a single head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to keep plain floss from slipping out of my fingers without going with a really long piece, wrapping it multiple times around my fingers, and cutting off the blood flow to my fingers.</li>
            <li> not exaggerating when I say it has cut in half the time it takes to properly floss my</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve been having trouble flossing regularly get this product.</li>
            <li> I have trouble flossing my back teeth.</li>
            <li> Since using it I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with my back teeth.</li>
            <li> I only change the insert thing once every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as expected, I&#x27;ve used it already</li>
            <li> Food residue trapped in the voids between teeth and gum simply rots.  </li>
            <li> I got the message and carefully read some reviews again.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no slagging.  </li>
            <li> Wet the floss and dip it in baking soda before using.  </li>
            <li> The handle goes into the center of your mouth, and the floss is at the correct angle to get between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I literally buy these for all of my family and friends and creepily give them hand held flossers for no reason ;-) I was never a flosser because it&#x27;s so hard to get floss back into the molars, but this utterly fixes that problem.</li>
            <li> I had carefully eliminated the other possibilities.  </li>
            <li> If this flosser used high quality floss I&#x27;d switch permanently, but unfortunately the quality of the floss is just too low for me to use this product.</li>
            <li> Since I floss daily, why should I spend between five and seven dollars for seven flossers when I can buy a bag of 90-150 CVS Everyday Flossers for substantially less?</li>
            <li> Also, I have several patients that are unable to effectively manipulate conventional floss due to medical problems (arthritis, MS, stroke patients to name a few), and the small flossers with toothpicks on the end are just as difficult to handle.</li>
            <li> Recently I tried some of the small ones that seem to have taken over.the market.</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on whether your teeth have any sharp areas that will cut up the floss.</li>
            <li> so usually I would inadvertently gag myself trying to floss my molars with regular floss.</li>
            <li> Reach floss handle, on the other hand, is just what I need.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t shred every other use.  </li>
            <li> the floss retention stops on the ends are sharp and will shred your lips and the lining of your mouth.ps on the ends are sharp and will shred your lips and the lining of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The amount of force necessary to get floss between my teeth resulted in broken floss, fibrous floss leftovers stuck between my teeth, and in some cases simply the inability to force the floss between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dental picks, self threading dental floss, conventional dental floss, and mini flossers.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for myself so that I could try it, to help decide whether or not to recommend it to my patients, and I haven&#x27;t used conventional floss since.</li>
            <li> My husband uses the flosser as his large hands make it difficult for him to floss with dental floss alone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to hold the string while trying to floss--especially for the teeth in the back.</li>
            <li> Even with regular floss, I have a hard time getting between all of my teeth, but the floss cleaners that are used with the access flosser get between all of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have teeth that are very close together, making flossing a time-consuming and difficult affair.</li>
            <li> so they can be washed down the drain when you rinse.</li>
            <li> I have avoided flossing because I couldn&#x27;t stand to put my fingers in my mouth with that sharp little string.  </li>
            <li> Flossing is part of my routine now, and I feel so much less guilt when I think about the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have always had difficulty flossing, being unable to fingers to the back of my mouth in order to floss using regular floss.  </li>
            <li> With a cleaning now costing $95, this device may enable me to see the dentist less</li>
            <li> I found it to be very difficult to manoeuvre, very time consuming, and even worse, I would have to shove my hand way up in my mouth to get my back teeth (which was definitely a no-no).</li>
            <li> Received 2 starter kits that contain the flosser and a few refills, not worth the effort to return.  </li>
            <li> - I was looking for the Oral - B Humming bird Floss because my left arm and hand are slightly disabled and I&#x27;m unable to use my left hand to help me floss</li>
            <li> Flossing doesn&#x27;t make a mess, like brushing one&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li> I have tight spacing between my teeth</li>
            <li> I started using this flosser when my kids were little and just started flossing.  </li>
            <li> Then came the bow thing that let you wrap the floss around a little bow</li>
            <li> The Dolphin flosser has occassionally frayed a little, but has never snapped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I continue to be amazed at how this little devise has changed a lifetime of resistance to flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They very cynically did this to try to extract as much money from the consumer (you) as possible.</li>
            <li> the floss will indeed snap eventually, but it usually lasts a long time and gets icky before it snaps, so you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it that</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t judge it until after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> received this device as a gift a few years ago, before which I had flossed probably once a month (and even that might be a liberal estimate).  </li>
            <li> I always have trouble using dental floss.</li>
            <li> but they are worse than using simple floss lines.  </li>
            <li> And if you hate flossing because that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve ever tried, then you will likely be very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do wish there were other colors, but I don&#x27;t think this is too expensive at almost any cost, for the benefit of your teeth and overall oral health.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss my teeth specially with a thread flosser.</li>
            <li> Will never lose circulation in my figures from wrapping floss around them too tight ever again!</li>
            <li> If your teeth is like Tom Cruise (shifted), it will be very tight at some spots.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a small bag.  </li>
            <li> I always ended up drooling all over like the alien in \\&quot;Aliens\\</li>
            <li> I have tried and failed to floss daily</li>
            <li> I wish dentists around the country start giving these flossers to their clients instead of tooth brushes or dental floss, the usual practice after a visit</li>
            <li> I have always had an abnormally small mouth</li>
            <li> , I was unable to find the Hummingbird floss which is the only type of floss I&#x27;ve used in 7 years</li>
            <li> They are at the wrong angle for the back of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I expect that I can use it for a few days at least.  </li>
            <li> In short, they&#x27;re too expensive.</li>
            <li> I floss everyday now, before was sporadic to say the least.</li>
            <li> Besides, each of the CVS flossers has a small handle attached, so you can still reach the hard to get areas.</li>
            <li> Others are too thin and sharp and cut my gum when I forced them</li>
            <li> Broken in less 2 weeks, Floss is not sturdy and it breaks in your teeth</li>
            <li> The floss shred after a few use, making it very expensive than simple floss lines.  </li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t like it and was hard for them to use</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;People who smoke cigarettes, they say &#x27;You don&#x27;t know how hard it is to quit smoking.&#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as hard as it is to start</li>
            <li> I had an extremely hard time before</li>
            <li> For some reason, I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this at Walmart and CVS (but they sell the floss head refills; go figure)</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time developing a flossing routine.  </li>
            <li> It was so hard for me to floss until I got one of these a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> Your muscles will tire and you risk cutting up your gums once the floss finally pops through.</li>
            <li> At least I know the reason I hadn&#x27;t been using it.</li>
            <li> Some may find it awkward on front teeth, but I just use the standard string floss for them: as I don&#x27;t think this product was designed for front teeth anyway.</li>
            <li> I floss at least twice a day, and all the teeth.</li>
            <li> Icky food partials don&#x27;t go flying all over the bath room, they remain in the mouth</li>
            <li> Baking soda can be abrasive on delicate shiny surfaces but not on organic tissues.  </li>
            <li> Either I hurt my gum when I forced the floss in, or I hurt my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the floss are too thick to get between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It takes a tedious and often painful process (flossing) and makes it much simpler.</li>
            <li> I hated flossing because my teeth are so tight and the floss cut into my fingers (they are always dry and cracked, so it sliced in</li>
            <li> With traditional floss, getting the back teeth was almost impossible, and I hated putting my fingers in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have one recommendation: offer an option with thin Glide-type tape snap-on heads.  </li>
            <li> Try sprinkle into your worse trash bin and see what happens.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> I hate putting my hands in my mouth to use regular floss.</li>
            <li> I was horrible at flossing -- and didn&#x27;t care to improve my frequency or technique (which were almost never and shoddy, respectively).  </li>
            <li> After a lifetime of never flossing because I absolutely hated it, I am now flossing about five times a week -- the only times I don&#x27;t are when I&#x27;m really exhausted at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> I have very tightly fitted teeth and consequently have found it very difficult to floss.  </li>
            <li> The floss was difficult to impossible to get between my tightly spaced teeth.  </li>
            <li> The string floss was painful on the fingers, and other flossers were awkward.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this.</li>
            <li> 2 days ago, I purchased a Dentek Comfort flosser; bah, the angle is wrong, making it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> But still I gave up on flossing because it&#x27;s too difficult on my irregular teeth.  </li>
            <li> Also, the cartridge idea seems to be an expensive idea.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are difficult</li>
            <li> Unable to use floss because of hand disability.</li>
            <li> The REACH Access Flosser does this miserable job in seconds and makes brushing one&#x27;s teeth that is otherwise a chore that not only is inefficient, but time consuming.</li>
            <li> However, as crazy as it sounds, with this flosser I have been flossing every day and reaping the benefits of healthier teeth/</li>
            <li> Flossing with a line of dental floss can be a bit of a pain and dirty.</li>
            <li> impossible.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get this stuff through</li>
            <li> I know I have to floss because not flossing gave me bad breath.  </li>
            <li> have a tip for bad breath too.  </li>
            <li> Very cynical product.</li>
            <li> This beats those stupid bags of plastic flossers you use once and toss, and now see laying on parking lots and on sides of roads.   </li>
            <li> very disappointed filed a claim also with amazon</li>
            <li> The string-o-floss is awful to use.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I found this flosser to be most practical of several on the market. The availability of ready-made refills make the chore of flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dental picks, self threading dental floss, conventional dental floss, and mini flossers. This is by far the easiest method to quickly and conveniently floss all your teeth, including those hard to reach back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say it has cut in half the time it takes to properly floss my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sell unflavored and mint flavored refills for these.</li>
            <li> This flosser is perfect for people who have crowded teeth but don&#x27;t like using string floss. My daughter can use this easily getting the molars which can be really hard to access.</li>
            <li> I have one recommendation: offer an option with thin Glide-type tape snap-on heads.  If your Flosser could be purchased with Glide tape, I&#x27;d rate your product &#x27;5-Stars&#x27; and call it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your product was recommended by my dental hygienist. I told her I had difficulty flossing between my rear teeth.  I have tight spacing between my teeth and I normally used Glide tape. Knowing the Reach Access Flosser did not employ Glide-type tape, I ordered your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later I received the Flosser.  I liked everything except the diameter of the dental floss used. I couldn&#x27;t fit it between a few rear teeth - spacing too tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequently, I discovered Oral B Glide Floss Picks.  I purchased a small bag.  The Glide tape fit between my rear teeth - BUT, I vastly preferred the size and feel of the Reach Access Flosser!</li>
            <li> With this thing, flossing is super duper easy, and really cheap. Every time I go to the dentist, he tells me my mouth in is in wonderful condition. You no longer have an excuse not to floss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to floss regularly but I&#x27;ve become much better at it after buying the Reach Flosser.  The problem for me was that it took forever flossing with regular dental floss since I have like no space between my teeth, and not to be gross I always ended up drooling all over like the alien in \\&quot;Aliens\\&quot; HAHAHA I did try the dental picks but it still wasn&#x27;t as easy as this. This product lets me get it done quickly without any mess.</li>
            <li> didnt get one of my items havent had any response been over 48 hours. very disappointed filed a claim also with amazon but in this day age quick follow up to internet shopping is a must</li>
            <li> the product live up to its name; really makes flossing and access easy.</li>
            <li> For my New Year&#x27;s resolution I decided I would start flossing regularly. I have tried and failed to floss daily so I knew I needed extra help. I stumbled on this product and decided to give it a try. It works fantastic. I can get to all my teeth even the two wisdom teeth I still have. A few of my teeth are quite tight but I am able to get to them by gently moving the flosser back and forth as I work it through the tight spot. Most of my teeth allow the flosser in with no resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so much better than flossing with just a string of floss wrapped around your fingers. So far this year I have flossed every day due to the ease of flossing. I actually now enjoy it because the Reach flosser gently massages my gums and leaves them feeling so much cleaner than brushing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been having trouble flossing regularly get this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a flosser on a trip to Mexico a couple of years ago and bought the Reach Flosser and some refill packs. Recently I tried some of the small ones that seem to have taken over.the market. They are a lot messier and more difficult  to use.  Additionally  you are throwing away a lot more plastic since you are discarding the whole unit. With the Reach Flosser you only throw out a tiny flosser bow that snaps onto the end of the handle. My main consideration is how easy and enjoyable it is floss with the Reach. It is so easy I&#x27;m happy to do it three times a day.  I hope Johnson &amp; Johnson keeps this product in production for a long time.</li>
            <li> Brand new in package and seem to be what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I grew up without fluoridated water and have a mouth full of mercury fillings.  I have always gone to the dentist twice a year for checkup and cleanings.  Every time I went, my dental hygienist would tell me to floss regularly.  And I never did.  Perhaps I would floss once a week when I had something stuck in my teeth.  The string-o-floss is awful to use.  About three years ago, a friend visited and he brought me one of these flossers and a couple of refills.  I started using it and discovered that it&#x27;s so EASY to floss and flossing only takes 30 seconds.  Overnight I was converted to a daily flosser!  I use the floss until it breaks but I do rinse it off after each use.  I noticed that the hygienist stop telling me to floss daily and at my last visit I commented that she no longer instructed me to floss.  Her response.... that&#x27;s because regular flossing is noticeable.  Buy one of these along with the 100 pack of refills and you&#x27;ll have a happy mouth.</li>
            <li> The Reach Flosser is a great way to get the job of flossing done in a far easier manner. Instead of using dental floss that can get caught between teeth, and even rip (that has been my experience), the floss band is part of a plastic device (or \\&quot;wand\\&quot; - as I would call it) that helps do the job, as far as cleaning hard-to-reach canines, as well as front teeth. I didn&#x27;t experience any pain or discomfort, when using this, and my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> One of the best flossers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Makes flossing so easy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son when he came home for a visit.  I started using this flosser when my kids were little and just started flossing.  I first tried using regular string floss and they didn&#x27;t like it and was hard for them to use and I noticed this new product and thought it would be perfect for the kids and they have been using this flosser ever since and they are 20 and 23 now.  My husband also uses this flosser.  I prefer the Johnson &amp; Johnson reach Dentotape.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this. I buy them for everone I know.  Changed my life. Literally.  flossing makes you live longer and I never flossed before I owned this. Now I can&#x27;t sleep if I haven&#x27;t flossed. Reach is better than the knockoffs - refills stay in place stronger, easier to use as the orientation fits in your mouth easily.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Will do business with seller again. very pleased</li>
            <li> I have teeth that are very close together, making flossing a time-consuming and difficult affair. Then I found this product and now I floss in no time at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I tried other flossing devices and none of those were as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people like me with teeth very close together: Learning to use this device optimally will take a few weeks (yes, really). The obvious way to use it isn&#x27;t the best way. The right way requires some coordination that will take time to learn. So don&#x27;t judge it until after a few weeks. Your first natural inclination will be to use your arm/hand/finger muscles to force the floss between your teeth, just as you do with normal floss. Don&#x27;t do that. Your muscles will tire and you risk cutting up your gums once the floss finally pops through. Instead, use the opposing jaw to push on the back of the device - making this possible is the magic that makes this device so awesome. Your jaw is stronger than your fingers and its force is more easily controlled, so the floss will pop between your teeth more easily and it won&#x27;t go too far into your gums once it pops through. Also, use your fingers to move the device slightly back and forth while you apply pressure with your jaw - this will make the floss go between your teeth more easily. Pulling off both of these moves at the same time takes a little practice, but once I got the hang of it, flossing is now fast and easy, which was never the case before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other reviews complain that the floss snaps too easily. This hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me - the floss will indeed snap eventually, but it usually lasts a long time and gets icky before it snaps, so you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it that long anyway. I guess it depends on whether your teeth have any sharp areas that will cut up the floss.</li>
            <li> Love using this instead of just dental floss.  Really reaches the back of your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the only way to floss.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, the act of flossing is one of those things where everybody knows they should do it, but many people just don&#x27;t make that extra effort.  Luckily, this personal flossing tool makes the \\&quot;chore\\&quot; oh so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, you won&#x27;t have to mess around with winding the floss around your fingers and guessing as to how much you need.  Instead, you have a device shaped like a toothbrush, but with a snap-on flosser head.  Just keep it in the same spot as your toothbrush for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with the flossing act itself made simpler, the flossing material is also easy to manage.  Germ-o-phobes will use a different head for every floss, but most will just wash it off afterwards and use it until it wears/frays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this device as a gift a few years ago, before which I had flossed probably once a month (and even that might be a liberal estimate).  However, as crazy as it sounds, with this flosser I have been flossing every day and reaping the benefits of healthier teeth/gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are in the same situation--want to floss regularly, but can&#x27;t seem to get into a good pattern--this simple invention may be just the kick-start you need.  It was for me!</li>
            <li> Sometimes to do something it&#x27;s just a matter of making it easier to do in order to get into the habit.  This flosser really helps make it easier to floss everyday because it&#x27;s so much less a chore and more comfortable to do.</li>
            <li> I got one of these from Reach&#x27;s website when they first launched them, as a sample for free. I had it for almost three years I think, until my dog got a hold of it on a road trip recently. I&#x27;m in the market for a new one now (and am also going to get one for my boyfriend). I do wish there were other colors, but I don&#x27;t think this is too expensive at almost any cost, for the benefit of your teeth and overall oral health. The mint flavored refill packs are nice. When I had my free one, I was too cheap to buy the refill packs, and as gross as it may sound, I was able to use the SAME flosser head for six months. How economical is that? This beats those stupid bags of plastic flossers you use once and toss, and now see laying on parking lots and on sides of roads.   PS, reach has a coupon on the website for $1 off this product right now. Obviously only for use at a retailer.</li>
            <li> An easier alternative to flossing with string floss.</li>
            <li> Practical and safe to use, allowing me to keep my mouth clean wherever you are. I can also carry in my wallet discreetly and use it whenever I needed.</li>
            <li> Genius product. Will never lose circulation in my figures from wrapping floss around them too tight ever again! A must have for people with teeth.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble using dental floss. It&#x27;s hard to hold the string while trying to floss--especially for the teeth in the back. Then came the bow thing that let you wrap the floss around a little bow--works better but the floss tend to come lose all the time. The Reach Flosser has a tooth brush-like handle to reach the back of the mouth for those hard-to-reach teeth and it&#x27;s a \\&quot;snap\\&quot; (literally) to replace the floss \\&quot;heads\\&quot;. You wonder why they haven&#x27;t thought of this long time ago...  Highly recommended.  p.s. I wish dentists around the country start giving these flossers to their clients instead of tooth brushes or dental floss, the usual practice after a visit--we&#x27;ve got tons of them in our medicine cabinet and never get to use them (with the Braun electric tooth brush and these Reach flosser, why would you?). So marketing guys from Reach--get a hint now!</li>
            <li> This is basically a toothbrush with a bit of floss stretched out on the end. I don&#x27;t like fumbling around with a string of floss, so this is much nicer for me, and you get to keep your fingers out of your mouth. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because the handle is unnecessarily long -- a flosser doesn&#x27;t need to be as long as a toothbrush, you hold it closer to the top for leverage and precision, so there&#x27;s a lot of handle that you don&#x27;t need, but that doesn&#x27;t really affect performance, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I have trouble flossing my back teeth. This device gives me the leverage I need to do this. The floss it taunt and does not give way when being used.</li>
            <li> Broken in less 2 weeks, Floss is not sturdy and it breaks in your teeth</li>
            <li> Ordered replacement flossers, 28 per pack.  Received 2 starter kits that contain the flosser and a few refills, not worth the effort to return.  P.S. Received from a diffferent Company name than what the original invoice showed.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t snap on us. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to hold and lets you get into deep hard to reach areas easily. All in all we&#x27;re pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I struggled with flossing for many years. The string floss was painful on the fingers, and other flossers were awkward. This flosser has literally changed my life. I floss twice a day now and NEVER miss a day. I couldn&#x27;t imagine not flossing. I used to require teeth cleanings once every 3 months and even then there was a lot of build up and my gums would bleed. Ever since i started using the Reach flosser i have been able to only go once every 6 months and my gums do not bleed. Highly recommended! I don&#x27;t know what i would do if they stopped making these.</li>
            <li> This access flosser was recommended to me by my dental hygienist.  I had asked for a recommendation for flossing teeth one-handed as I was to have rotator cuff surgery on my dominant arm.  This flosser has fit the bill.  I am able to floss one-handed, reach between all my teeth, and to do a good job of flossing.  I am very satisfied.  Even with regular floss, I have a hard time getting between all of my teeth, but the floss cleaners that are used with the access flosser get between all of my teeth.  Thank you for a product that has made it possible to have a clean-feeling mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty hard to admit but until I got this gadget I never flossed. I got chewed out the last time I went to the dentist so I picked up one of these flossers at the grocery store. I have always had an abnormally small mouth so usually I would inadvertently gag myself trying to floss my molars with regular floss. This baby fits in my mouth well and doesn&#x27;t gag me! I was also pleasantly surprised it fits in between my tight teeth. I would recommend this to ANYONE because it really has made flossing so much easier for me! I also use the tips more than once and wash thoroughly between uses to not be wasteful.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me the handle starter because I have a hard time reaching my back teeth with the top care side handle ones. Since using it I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with my back teeth. At least I know the reason I hadn&#x27;t been using it. No stores in my area will carry it for some reason.     I really recommend this if you have the same problem as me. Some may find it awkward on front teeth, but I just use the standard string floss for them: as I don&#x27;t think this product was designed for front teeth anyway.</li>
            <li> Awesome ! No other product like it as far as I am concerned !</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find them in the stores near me!!  I recommend this product daily, to all my patients!  I am a Registered Dental Hygienist!</li>
            <li> Best way to reach all the way to the back of your mouth and floss in areas that were otherwise unreachable.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Bought after shoulder surgery to help me floss one-handed but may keep using it indefinitely.</li>
            <li> Received what was advertised, and delivery was on time!</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  I&#x27;m a long-time non-flosser, and the primary reason for that was that I just couldn&#x27;t make it work.  The amount of force necessary to get floss between my teeth resulted in broken floss, fibrous floss leftovers stuck between my teeth, and in some cases simply the inability to force the floss between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple that with the complete inability to see what I was doing with two fists shoved in my mouth, and it was a recipe for frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the Reach Access Flosser, it&#x27;s almost like brushing my teeth.  I can easily see what I&#x27;m doing, and I haven&#x27;t had the floss break yet, even with my tightly-packed teeth.  The first couple of times I used it I went through two floss heads per session, as the string started to shred, but it didn&#x27;t break and didn&#x27;t leave any fibers in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after a couple of weeks I can floss with a single head.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> As a dental hygienist, getting patients to floss regularly is a major undertaking. When I found this easy flosser, I was very excited. I purchased one for myself so that I could try it, to help decide whether or not to recommend it to my patients, and I haven&#x27;t used conventional floss since. Flossing is about cleaning the sides, and area in between teeth that a regular toothbrush cannot reach. This works nicely, and with regular use it becomes easier and easier to use.   Also, I have several patients that are unable to effectively manipulate conventional floss due to medical problems (arthritis, MS, stroke patients to name a few), and the small flossers with toothpicks on the end are just as difficult to handle. Many of my patients, that would normally be unable to floss at all, can now use this \\&quot;Easy Flosser\\&quot; with ease because of the long, no-slip handle. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Easiest way to floss and my dentist with my flossing results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these for 6+ years until my battery-powered one died. I can&#x27;t find battery-powered ones any longer, the manual still does the trick very well. 2 days ago, I purchased a Dentek Comfort flosser; bah, the angle is wrong, making it difficult to use. After 2 days of use I (I gave the Dentek one last shot), I&#x27;m back on the Reach Access flosser.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had great dental checkups with this.</li>
            <li> Great Product for those who struggle to floss. Since I bout this product I floss more often. It makes flossing simple and quick.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss my teeth specially with a thread flosser. This one is much easier to use for a lazy person like me</li>
            <li> Great for flossing in those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like brushing your teeth but without sticking 2/3 of your hands in your mouth. It&#x27;s super easy to use and makes flossing everyday feasible (for the lazy).</li>
            <li> as promised. looks durable and simply it seems to get the job done. I will update if anything changes. get it</li>
            <li> This is the tool that finally got me to floss consistently. The heads are easy to put on and take off the handle. I&#x27;ve had only one of the heads&#x27; floss snap off in about 6 months of use. It sounds kind of gross but you can see food particles/plaque that you missed by just brushing. This was and is a huge motivator for me to keep flossing every day. For people who need the satin type of floss, this product may not be an option as the heads only have the waxy type of floss. For everyone else I highly, highly recommend this product. It makes flossing as close to effortless as possible. At my local Target, the refill heads are actually cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li> Reach Acceess FlosserWorks great It is easy to handle and fits into difficult spaces in the mouth . good service and price.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the one I bought 5 years or so ago. Couldn&#x27;t find one at a brick and mortar store, just the consumable picks for it. Works like the previous one and fits the floss picks perfectly.</li>
            <li> Went from flossing twice a year to twice a day as soon as this arrived. It takes a tedious and often painful process (flossing) and makes it much simpler. I actually look forward to flossing now because something about using this product is fun. It feels good to finally be taking care of my gums.</li>
            <li> This is the first reach brush I have used and it works well.  I would buy again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Love it. Actually floss too much. My whole family loves them now. I gave as presents to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to keep plain floss from slipping out of my fingers without going with a really long piece, wrapping it multiple times around my fingers, and cutting off the blood flow to my fingers. This solves all the problems, making it much faster and comfortable. Try it if you have my issues.</li>
            <li> Dislike that I have to get more replacement separately. But so easy to use for the hard to reach molars. there is no excuse anymore!</li>
            <li> Dental health is very important and these one of my most important buys. Everyone should use this product!&lt;br /&gt;I use these all day, every day.</li>
            <li> Reach Access Flosser is the only flosser that works for me, period! Easy to use and the handle lasts long.</li>
            <li> This is the best flosser I&#x27;ve ever had, it actually gets me to floss. It is kind of pricey and environmentally unfriendly but I have yet to find another flosser that uses the same angle. It basically allows you to go right in because the floss is perpendicular to the handle instead of most others where the floss goes the same direction as the handle which causes you to contort into weird angles and stretch your cheeks to get into where you need to go.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped and delivered to me in just a few days, the product is wonderful - I was looking for the Oral - B Humming bird Floss because my left arm and hand are slightly disabled and I&#x27;m unable to use my left hand to help me floss, I was unable to find the Hummingbird floss which is the only type of floss I&#x27;ve used in 7 years so I thought I would give this one a shot. I like it just as much as the hummingbird floss and its 1/4 of the price!</li>
            <li> Makes flossing so much easier!</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Ever. Can&#x27;t figure out if the value is worth the price bump over store brands. But I love it - went without for a few months when CVS stopped carrying the flosser itself and only carried the refills and I missed it every day.</li>
            <li> JUNK, breaks on the first row of teeth. Oral-B had the good ones, but they are no where to be found. Zero stars, if that was an option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a way to floss easily and quickly. Youll find flossing is just part of your brushing regimen.</li>
            <li> I know how important it is to floss. But I just couldn&#x27;t get myself to do it regularly. One of my favorite comedians, Mitch Hedberg, once said:&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;People who smoke cigarettes, they say &#x27;You don&#x27;t know how hard it is to quit smoking.&#x27; Yes I do. It&#x27;s as hard as it is to start flossing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That comment couldn&#x27;t be more spot on. But the Reach Access Flosser makes it easier than ever. And exponentially more effective. My dentist even noticed how much better my teeth were once I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you already floss regularly, this will change your life!</li>
            <li> This makes flossing so much easier and more convenient.  Dare I say it even makes it more fun :)  I love the mint flavored refills.</li>
            <li> Mine broke after many years of use and I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement at my local drug stores.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Soo easy to floss with! Dont know why they stopped selling in stores.</li>
            <li> After visiting my dentist (after how many years), I was informed that I had gingivitis, and that I needed to start flossing immediately. So I bought some regular floss. I found it to be very difficult to manoeuvre, very time consuming, and even worse, I would have to shove my hand way up in my mouth to get my back teeth (which was definitely a no-no). So I got the reach access flosser: problem solved.    p.s. Buy extra snap on heads.</li>
            <li> bought it as a bck up handle and it was what i exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> I love flossing now. I could never get myself to floss before. But not its super easy. the size makes things very convenient.</li>
            <li> Excellent and very comfortable in use. Sadly almost unavailable in markets, nowadays, yet still the best in its category of shopping.</li>
            <li> I hated flossing because my teeth are so tight and the floss cut into my fingers (they are always dry and cracked, so it sliced in easily.)&lt;br /&gt;Now I floss at least twice a day, and all the teeth. Not just the problem areas. I can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Good item, good value</li>
            <li> Oh man. For the first time in my life, I&#x27;m flossing regularly, and the dentist-induced guilt is gone! I&#x27;ve never had really coordinated fingers, and the annoyance (however minor) of wrapping floss around my fingers and maneuvering it through my mouth was enough to keep me from doing it. I tried the plastic throw-away flossers (with the 2-inch-long handles) but using them and their tiny handles was still enough of a barrier to let me stay lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reach floss handle, on the other hand, is just what I need. I can keep it right next to my toothbrush, prompting me to floss before brushing every time. It&#x27;s quick and easy and just feels natural. Flossing is part of my routine now, and I feel so much less guilt when I think about the dentist.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I love this Reach Flosser!  Makes reaching the back teeth much easier.</li>
            <li> To be fair, this flosser is far superior to just using a regular roll of floss and certainly better than those cheap plastic disposable one-use pieces of junk that come in packs of 100. And if you hate flossing because that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve ever tried, then you will likely be very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;d like to compare this flosser to the one that I&#x27;ve switched to now:&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B0047TIK8Y Butler Dolphin 250 Advancing Flosser, Size: 1]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Reach Access\\&quot; flosser didn&#x27;t last nearly as long for me or my kids as the Dolphin flossers have.&lt;br /&gt;The floss in the \\&quot;Reach\\&quot; itself didn&#x27;t shred at all and *seemed* quite strong, HOWEVER, it broke far too often!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter twice had the floss snap as soon as she started flossing and the same happened to me a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;And this would happen sometimes just after I put in a brand new floss cartridge! The Dolphin flosser has occassionally frayed a little, but has never snapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also felt like the Reach flosser had thinner &amp; rounder floss (felt like fishing line) and didn&#x27;t remove food particles as well as the Dolphin. Lastly, I preferred the more substantial feel of the Dolphin when flossing. These last two points are more of a personal preference, but I felt ripped off by the Reach every time the floss would just break without reason or warning. We&#x27;re not a family of vampires, so I don&#x27;t think our teeth are any sharper than anyone else&#x27;s... (though if we were vampires, I wonder if our teeth would always just naturally sparkle?)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I managed before these flossers came out. I even keep one in my car. They are great.</li>
            <li> This  item worked very well, until my dog got a hold of it. He really enjoyed chewing it to death !! Now I have to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I literally buy these for all of my family and friends and creepily give them hand held flossers for no reason ;-) I was never a flosser because it&#x27;s so hard to get floss back into the molars, but this utterly fixes that problem. Perfect product. Would give more than 5 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money saving note: I only change the insert thing once every few weeks. After I floss I just wash it off thoroughly and it lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this product.  The floss was difficult to impossible to get between my tightly spaced teeth.  The design also makes it challenging to maneuver. I much prefer the smaller disposable flossers.</li>
            <li> I floss almost nightly now and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the health of my gums. Flossing is not such a hassle anymore. Even though I have a small mouth I can easily floss each tooth.</li>
            <li> Flossing with a line of dental floss can be a bit of a pain and dirty. With the Reach Access, it is at least 75% easier and faster to floss 100% more sanitary. Icky food partials don&#x27;t go flying all over the bath room, they remain in the mouth so they can be washed down the drain when you rinse.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as expected, I&#x27;ve used it already and I works just great, I have some hand issues and this product really helps, thanks!!!</li>
            <li> hard to find item but found it and love it, thanks for carrying it would recomment it to all who are looking for a similar item</li>
            <li> My husband uses the flosser as his large hands make it difficult for him to floss with dental floss alone.  He absolutely can&#x27;t do without it.  This item is difficult to find in stores and I enjoy buying from Amazon, so I shop here quite a bit.  He definitely would recommend this item to anyone having difficulty flossing with dental floss alone!</li>
            <li> I know I have to floss because not flossing gave me bad breath.  I had carefully eliminated the other possibilities.  Food residue trapped in the voids between teeth and gum simply rots.  But still I gave up on flossing because it&#x27;s too difficult on my irregular teeth.  Either I hurt my gum when I forced the floss in, or I hurt my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried various flossing tools but they are worse than using simple floss lines.  They turn slag after one tooth, or you need to tighten the floss for every tooth.  The floss shred after a few use, making it very expensive than simple floss lines.  They are at the wrong angle for the back of the teeth.  Or it&#x27;s a pain to have to insert your fist into your mouth first.  Some of the floss are too thick to get between my teeth.  Others are too thin and sharp and cut my gum when I forced them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have come across Reach Access before but I simply don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s different.  Also, the cartridge idea seems to be an expensive idea.  Last week, an acquaintance offered me a mint chewing gum.  I got the message and carefully read some reviews again.  After reading this Access I rushed to get one to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give it 5 stars as it answers all my prayers.  The floss is thin, rounded and strong.  It got between my teeth easily and it didn&#x27;t shred every other use.  Indeed I used it twice a day now for most of the teeth and the floss is still in very good shape.  There&#x27;s absolutely no slagging.  So, depending on how \\&quot;bad\\&quot; your teeth is, I can safely say that the overall cost isn&#x27;t that expensive.  It&#x27;s not like you need to use a new cartridge for every few teeth.  I expect that I can use it for a few days at least.  You can always dip it in diluted hydrogen peroxide in between use if you have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed how easy it is to get to the back of your teeth.  You can even align the angle of attack by looking the mirror.  Your view isn&#x27;t blocked by your hand.  If your teeth is like Tom Cruise (shifted), it will be very tight at some spots.  And if your teeth aren&#x27;t that regular, you have to adjust to the orientation of the two teeth.  Every bit of technique helps in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The non-slip grip is a bit far away from the mouth.  If you wriggle in the floss like using a line, you would hold the handle much closer to the mouth.  However, there is an easy way to get the floss in between.  Just bit gently on the cartridge.  My teeth are difficult so I hurt myself too many times forcing the floss in between.  Once in I can&#x27;t stop fast enough so the line cut through to my gum at the worse angel.  Often I bleed in several occasions in one setting.  If you use your jaws they are easily controlled.  You can bit on jelly without breaking it up into two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better still, you can use both hands easily, one on the handle and one near the head.  It&#x27;s as steady and powerful as you get.  Also, when I take the floss out, I won&#x27;t shoot stuff from my mouth onto the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tip for bad breath too.  Wet the floss and dip it in baking soda before using.  It have to be powder since dissolved baking soda does nothing.  It&#x27;s safe as it&#x27;s used medically inside and outside the body.  It&#x27;s one of the most powerful deodorant.  Try sprinkle into your worse trash bin and see what happens.  Baking soda can be abrasive on delicate shiny surfaces but not on organic tissues.  It will also readily dissolve in water on contact with wet surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already used it twice today and I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> Great product that I am having trouble finding in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far superior to competitive products that I have tried. The replaceable head/cartridge dislodges easily on the competitive product leaving it stuck in your teeth. I threw all of those away.</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me flossers like these aren&#x27;t as good as dental floss used &amp;#34;the old-fashioned way&amp;#34;.  But if you&#x27;re as uncoordinated as I am, and you&#x27;re able to floss better and more frequently with these (like I do), you may come out ahead.</li>
            <li> This is great for reaching and flossing your back teeth.  My husband uses it all the time instead of getting toothpicks.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have this I would never ever floss.  You know when you go to the dentist and they always yell at you because you don&#x27;t floss regularly?  Well buy one of these and you will be flossing all the time because it is easy and simple.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing much easier to do. Now I never forget to floss because i just need to pick up my flosser and use it after brushing.</li>
            <li> Very cynical product. Compare this product with the &amp;#34;Flossaid Dental Floss Holder.&amp;#34; With the Flossaid Dental Floss Holder, you don&#x27;t have to buy refills aka. replacement heads. You just buy floss and string it on, which is infinitely more economical and less wasteful than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, you end up spending a huge amount of money on refills (around 165$ a year!!!!!!!!!!!!). Do the math. They very cynically did this to try to extract as much money from the consumer (you) as possible. Don&#x27;t be fooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also think of the tons of these things that end up in landfills...</li>
            <li> So far very happy. Takes the annoyance of traditional flossing out of the equation. Makes it much faster which makes doing it more frequently less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I was horrible at flossing -- and didn&#x27;t care to improve my frequency or technique (which were almost never and shoddy, respectively).  I accidentally discovered this product in the toothcare aisle the day after my dentist told me to floss more.  That was 8 months ago.  Flossing is now my new favorite pastime.  This product makes flossing so easy, but the really great thing is how thorough it is.  I own three (home, car and travel).</li>
            <li> Only way I will floss my teeth  - When my local stores stopped carrying the product, I didn&#x27;t know what to do.  I still have my wisdom teeth and  it is the only product that allows me to get to the the back.</li>
            <li> The Reach Access Flosser is an extremely simple device for using the disposable Reach Flosser heads, and it works exactly as it is supposed to work.  It&#x27;s easy to remove an old disposable head, and just as easy to install a new disposable head.  My Dentist tells me that this device doesn&#x27;t replace the more common string floss, or ribbon floss, and she is right, but it is the best thing for a very quick and easy floss after a meal, or whenever you get something caught in your teeth.  Personally, I use standard floss before I go to bed, but the Reach Access Flosser for all other flossing needs.  It&#x27;s just the fastest way to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia so I can&#x27;t use traditional flossing methods without injury. The grip of Reach&#x27;s Access Flosser is long and easy to hold. There&#x27;s plenty of floss for &amp;#34;taking care of business&amp;#34; with dental hygiene, the it&#x27;s easy to get between the teeth and gums. I especially recommend this product for folks with hand issues.</li>
            <li> I have always had difficulty flossing, being unable to fingers to the back of my mouth in order to floss using regular floss.  I stumbled on Reach Access Flosser  and this thing really works.  Flossing using Reach Access Flosser is very similar to brushing your teeth.  This works very well.  My days of frustration with flossing are over.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very tightly fitted teeth and consequently have found it very difficult to floss.  This flosser is the best and now I floss every day.</li>
            <li> Note:  Although I like this flosser, I lowered the stars to three because both my dental technician and a dentist in an online article said that flossers like this don&#x27;t get deeply enough into the pockets around the teeth to do that much good.  However, I have flossed my teeth with regular floss enough to question whether regular floss gets into those pockets either.  Most poeple, I think, just quickly pop the floss between their teeth, so it&#x27;s hard to see how regular floss can be so much better.  Right now I am looking into getting an interdental brush which is made to be inserted into the cracks between the teeth, and which may work better than both this flosser and regular dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review:  I decided to ask my local pharmacy to order this flosser for me.  Seeing prices of $6 online (and up!), I figured I would probably have to pay them $9.00, but I decided it would be worth it to support a local business.  Well, their price was $3.29.  It made me realize that online prices aren&#x27;t always the best.  I now intend to get my string refills from the local pharmacy also.  (Since writing this, I found the flosser at my supermarket for $3.19.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the flosser, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my teeth.  But then I realized that it isn&#x27;t enough to just slide the filament between my teeth; I needed to wiggle it around in a circular motion to clean the area.  So now I insert the filament (which sometimes requires a back-and-forth motion if the space is tight), and then I move the flosser around to clean the whole area.  I would prefer it if the filament were a little thicker and more fibrous, instead of being so smooth.  Personally I think that the manufacturer needs to make filament refills in different thicknesses (perhaps they do, but I&#x27;m not seeing that here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought that I would have to floss the right side of my mouth with my left hand, which felt awkward; but then I found a way to hold the flosser with my right hand which felt natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my life I have avoided flossing because I couldn&#x27;t stand to put my fingers in my mouth with that sharp little string.  I would try it once and then immediately give up.  But with this device I see the potential to start flossing every day.  I expect that the more I do it, the easier and more natural it will get.  Frankly, I&#x27;m one of those people who is angry at doctors and dentists because they are all over-charging the public and trying to get rich.  With a cleaning now costing $95, this device may enable me to see the dentist less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are concerned about the environment:  bubble packs like the one this product comes in are now recyclable in most areas.  However, you must first separate the cardboard from the plastic bubble.  If you don&#x27;t, your recycler will throw the whole thing away (the economics of recycling doesn&#x27;t allow recyclers to separate materials).  Once you&#x27;ve pulled the cardboard off the bubble, you should recycle the bubble with your cans and bottles, and the cardboard with your paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added later:  After using this flosser for a couple weeks, I&#x27;m experiencing the same thing that other reviewers have experienced.  After a lifetime of never flossing because I absolutely hated it, I am now flossing about five times a week -- the only times I don&#x27;t are when I&#x27;m really exhausted at bedtime.  With traditional floss, getting the back teeth was almost impossible, and I hated putting my fingers in my mouth.  This device makes it possible where it wasn&#x27;t possible before.  I don&#x27;t understand why dentists don&#x27;t hand these things out to their patients instead of toothbrushes.  However, as I said before, I&#x27;d like the filament to be thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started flossing at my desk.  Flossing doesn&#x27;t make a mess, like brushing one&#x27;s teeth can, so there&#x27;s no reason to stand at the mirror to do it.  I continue to be amazed at how this little devise has changed a lifetime of resistance to flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t force the floss between your teeth aggressively, you&#x27;ll find that the filament will last for weeks.  It does, however, fray and get thinner as it is used.  The result is that it also gets sharper, and you have to take care not to cut your gums.</li>
            <li> It was good while I had it but I lost mine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t floss before. I do now. What else can I say. I would give five stars if they could figure out a way to make this work as well without having to replace the head every time you floss, sometimes even while flossing, that is if you could have the floss on a spool or something. But it&#x27;s worth the waste of changing heads to make it this easy to get to teeth. I had an extremely hard time before and now it really is as easy as brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought multiple units of this flosser because I want them around when I need them. They work great and I use them daily.</li>
            <li> Unable to use floss because of hand disability. Discovered the Reach Access Flosser two years ago and plan to continue using it.  This product is much easier to use than floss, and can do a thorough job using just one hand. Fairly easy to replace snap on heads.  With the Reach flosser, it&#x27;s easy to reach all upper and lower teeth!</li>
            <li> Best flossing tool on the market in my opinion...or the opinion of my teeth</li>
            <li> yes i could not find this devise locally. i had used one before but could not locate another one locally, it works great as a flosser since I only have use of one hand</li>
            <li> This works great!! I have a waterpik as well but prefer this to get my teeth really feeling clean. Very easy to use. I also highly recommend the mint flavored flosser heads.</li>
            <li> Having big hands makes it more difficult to use traditional threaded floss.&lt;br /&gt;This REACH ACCESS FLOSSER has solved the problem I had been having all my life in making flossing a habit.&lt;br /&gt;Simply put... it is sooooooo much easier to use and much more enjoyable than floss.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it gains in popularity and is here to stay!</li>
            <li> This product has made flossing easy and guitt-free. It possible for me to floss as I should.</li>

            <li> One of my favorite inventions ever! I hate putting my hands in my mouth to use regular floss.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and it definitely beats using the traditional floss and other flossers. The design is perfect for those hard to reach molars. For some reason, I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this at Walmart and CVS (but they sell the floss head refills; go figure) so I just decided to order it from Amazon. Will continue to use this for years to come.</li>
            <li> The worst part of brushing is having to floss. Wrapping the stuff around fingers and trying to reach all of one&#x27;s teeth is a hassle, and it&#x27;s ineffective. The REACH Access Flosser does this miserable job in seconds and makes brushing one&#x27;s teeth that is otherwise a chore that not only is inefficient, but time consuming. Not only does REACH make this great product, I also like its toothbrushes. They have a convenient angle and the bristles last longer than most other brands. Go for the &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; models as they most effectively remove plaque. Also, brush often. It takes only seven minutes for many foods, especially the sweet foods most Americans eat, to begin the decaying process. If you don&#x27;t have a toothbrush handy, use tooth pics and rinse your mouth with water, and the rinsing part is very important after drinking sugary soft drinks, which are horrible. Remember the old saying: Be true to your teeth or they will be false to you!  EDIT/ADDENDUM: Although these are great flossers, I&#x27;m deducting a couple of stars because of the comparative cost. In short, they&#x27;re too expensive. CVS makes some handy self-contained flossers for substantially less. The Reach flosses should be available in bags of 75+, not packages of 11-20! So I&#x27;m ditching my Reach handle and am switching to the CVS Everday Flossers®. The Reach is a little better, but the flosser replacements are a rip-off. Who wants to re-use a flosser because only seven comes in a packet? Why not sell them a hundred at a time? Besides, each of the CVS flossers has a small handle attached, so you can still reach the hard to get areas. Since I floss daily, why should I spend between five and seven dollars for seven flossers when I can buy a bag of 90-150 CVS Everyday Flossers for substantially less? The Everyday Flossers are more expensive to manufacture and, though I like the Reach flossers more, I&#x27;m not willing to pay the greater price. BTW, pass up the Rexall and super budget flossers -- the floss retention stops on the ends are sharp and will shred your lips and the lining of your mouth.ps on the ends are sharp and will shred your lips and the lining of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I floss so much more, and much better with the Reach Flosser. My dentist recommended it and I love it! I want to floss all the time now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected and works for my needs, it was packaged well and would recommend to any needing the same product.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time developing a flossing routine.  I found using string floss to be, well, challenging, er. impossible.  The cute little saw things weren&#x27;t much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Christmas, I was visiting my brother-in-law and sister-in-law.  In their bathroom I noticed a Reach Access flosser.  How smart, I thought.  The handle goes into the center of your mouth, and the floss is at the correct angle to get between your teeth.  It is substantial, like a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New Year struck, and a new year&#x27;s resolution was struck.  The resolution stuck.  I floss now.</li>
            <li> Liked using Reach Flosser to get back teeth and to remove food stuck between teeth.  However, my dentist is adamant that it would not replacing flossing with a regular string floss as the taute string on this will only get a tangent on the tooth and not wrap around the tooth for thorough placque removal.</li>
            <li> After a cavity I&#x27;m now a flosser.  This thing makes it easy.</li>
            <li> The idea is great, and this could be a very convenient way to floss your teeth. I like the idea of not having to put my hand in my mouth while flossing. However, if you are the type of person who appreciates high quality floss that doesn&#x27;t shred, stay away from this product! The actual floss in these heads is low quality and not waxed enough that if you have tight gaps between your teeth it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get this stuff through and when you do get it through, it shreds to pieces in the process. If this flosser used high quality floss I&#x27;d switch permanently, but unfortunately the quality of the floss is just too low for me to use this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> works fine, wish regular floss could be strung  in between the bow instead of having to purchase floss cartridges separately.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new Reach flosser, because my old one snapped a the neck after years of daily use. It is an awesome idea, awesome product and I especially love the mint flavored refill flossers. Btw, you can rinse and reuse the flosser more than once. My dentist even approved the technique.</li>
            <li> It was so hard for me to floss until I got one of these a couple of years ago. That one is still fine. I order refills through Amazon subscription. I floss everyday now, before was sporadic to say the least.</li>
