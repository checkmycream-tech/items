            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>This Bodywash competes with the markets best.</li>
            <li>Great Product!!!!</li>
            <li>That put together with the beautiful packaging, I had to try this one out.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product,I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect amount of fragrance - not too strong.</li>
            <li>That said, this smell seems to stick to my person longer (a good thing) and isn&#x27;t overbearing.</li>
            <li>Good smell, but Bath &amp; Bodywoks Mahogany woods is much better option!</li>
            <li>Amazon is much higher here but the product is great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, the scent is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>the kind that gets carried away with packaging but</li>
            <li>(The exception to this was yesterday where it was warm</li>
            <li>It lathers up nice, too.</li>
            <li>Was told the light, pleasant scent was nice.</li>
            <li>I does have a nice clean and pleasant smell, but it is not sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Very strong perfume.  </li>
            <li>Although it has a mild smell that is nothing like TOBS, it still smells very nice.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I love this body-wash.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this body wash.</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on the aroma.</li>
            <li>I have fell in love with TOBS sandalwood products, but because of the price I went looking for something to use more often.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, smell could be a lot stronger compared to others men&#x27;s sandalwood products.</li>
            <li>The liquid gel is thinner than most body washes, so it could be easy to over-use.</li>
            <li>but i would prefer if it was more strongly sandalwood scented.</li>
            <li>This sandalwood smells GREAT, and when my wife first smelled it, her first reaction was &amp;#34;ooo, manly!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>When I popped the bottle open to smell it in the store it smelled great</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has no artificial ingredients contained and no  animal testing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do a lot of manual labor, I sit at a computer most of the day for my job, so I can&#x27;t tell you whether or not this will be good enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>also liked the smell itself as it didn&#x27;t hit me as too sweet or flowery, but it wasn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;sandalwood&#x27; either.  </li>
            <li>Very nice aroma and lathers better than any other product I have used before.</li>
            <li>I felt clean and refreshed after showering and</li>
            <li>the pleasant, mild scent lasted several hours.</li>
            <li>A true winner.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a true sandalwood scent, this is not the product for you.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say the smell isnt really a true Sandwood scent</li>
            <li>I read some complaints about how it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, but that is exactly the point.  </li>
            <li>Cleans, refreshes with a mild Sandlewood scent.</li>
            <li>Well I have to say that I really do love the scent and as other writers pointed out, it does lather nicely.  </li>
            <li>That it&#x27;s all natural, cruelty free, etc is another huge plus.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews of products too often but this product sure surprised me</li>
            <li>Unlike most body washes, it doesn&#x27;t completely douse you with fragrances.  </li>
            <li>We have purchased every men&#x27;s body wash under the sun until he finally decided this is his favorite.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>I will say that I am very pleased with this for an everyday body wash.</li>
            <li>The shape of the bottle is curved, like a large flask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s twice as much here on</li>
            <li>so I didnt&#x27; expect to smell much of it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent, and this line of product but target sells it for half the cost at 4.99.</li>
            <li>As a body wash it is effective and I do feel clean and if you care about natural ingredients or animal safe practices this could be for you, but if you&#x27;re just a fan of sandalwood you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li>those are a lot of different smells, and most of us don&#x27;t think about whether or not they conflict with each other instead of compliment.  </li>
            <li>Pretty solid stuff.</li>
            <li>However, the price point is ridiculously high and I ended up finding it at my local Target store for under $7.00.  </li>
            <li>Never the less, it has a slightly musky and appealing scent.  </li>
            <li>but in actual use somehow it turns into a nearly scentless body wash.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s close enough for a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a 14 year old drenched in Axe body spray.</li>

            <li> This is the first body wash that i have come across where even after the end of the day, if I smell my forearm, I can smell the subtle smell of sandalwood.  </li>
            <li> I tossed it because it contains sodium benzoate and other unnatural and potentially carcinogenic compounds.</li>
            <li> but of course, they usually only last  few hours.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell bad, it&#x27;s just a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> I always think of these different things as everyday cologne, in that you want to smell nice/appealing, but you don&#x27;t want to burnout the nostrils of everyone that passes you.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> If you have used other body washes before, you may have come across ones that say something like, &amp;#34;24 hours guarantee.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> : you put on your body wash, your shampoo, your shaving cream/soap, deodorant, and maybe some other hygiene products every day including whatever detergent you use for your clothes...</li>
            <li> I mean, just stop and think about it for a second</li>
            <li> The scent of the body wash is slightly medicinal, but not off-putting.  </li>
            <li> Also, the orange has little micro-beads in it to scrub off dead skin and all that.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful but yet not too weak.  </li>
            <li> This just adds a very small subtle hint instead of conflicting with every other scent you put on your body.  </li>
            <li> Seems to get the job done without irritating my skin, which some liquid soaps do.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to give Every Man Jack a try.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite body wash. We have purchased every men&#x27;s body wash under the sun until he finally decided this is his favorite. Whew!</li>
            <li> Good smell, but Bath &amp; Bodywoks Mahogany woods is much better option!</li>
            <li> OK. I don&#x27;t write reviews of products too often but this product sure surprised me and I just had to write one.  If you have used other body washes before, you may have come across ones that say something like, &amp;#34;24 hours guarantee.&amp;#34;  Always felt that the scent should last 24 hours but of course, they usually only last  few hours.  Always wondered how companies get away with it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the kind that gets carried away with packaging but sandalwood is my weakness.  That put together with the beautiful packaging, I had to try this one out.  (I would buy from Target. It&#x27;s twice as much here on Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the scent is absolutely amazing.  Not very powerful but yet not too weak.  What made me write the review.  This is the first body wash that i have come across where even after the end of the day, if I smell my forearm, I can smell the subtle smell of sandalwood.  Never before has that happened.  (The exception to this was yesterday where it was warm and I sweated a lot so I didnt&#x27; expect to smell much of it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! A definite must have!!</li>
            <li> This Bodywash competes with the markets best. Cleans, refreshes with a mild Sandlewood scent. A true winner.</li>
            <li> No sandalwood scent will actually stay on you. When I popped the bottle open to smell it in the store it smelled great and I&#x27;m a big sandalwood fan, but in actual use somehow it turns into a nearly scentless body wash. As a body wash it is effective and I do feel clean and if you care about natural ingredients or animal safe practices this could be for you, but if you&#x27;re just a fan of sandalwood you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Arrived Timely!  Great Product!!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good, smell could be a lot stronger compared to others men&#x27;s sandalwood products.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, and this line of product but target sells it for half the cost at 4.99. Amazon is much higher here but the product is great! Please do something here amazon. 5 star product 1 star price</li>
            <li> I love this body-wash.</li>
            <li> The shape of the bottle is curved, like a large flask. The ergonomics of this shape makes it easier to pour out. The liquid gel is thinner than most body washes, so it could be easy to over-use. The scent of the body wash is slightly medicinal, but not off-putting.  I felt clean and refreshed after showering and the pleasant, mild scent lasted several hours.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance and I like the soap. Seems to get the job done without irritating my skin, which some liquid soaps do.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as it stated it was the last one -- NOT.  Well I have to say that I really do love the scent and as other writers pointed out, it does lather nicely.  I love the fact that it has no artificial ingredients contained and no  animal testing.  However, the price point is ridiculously high and I ended up finding it at my local Target store for under $7.00.  My wife loves the scent and actually enjoys using it herself.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pleasing but i would prefer if it was more strongly sandalwood scented.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing! I saw this same product in target for $8. I feel like I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this body wash. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of fragrance - not too strong. I only wish it was easier to find.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift. Was told the light, pleasant scent was nice. Didn&#x27;t need a lot to feel as it had done the job. Left his skin feeling hydrated. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Does NOT smell like Sandalwood.  Very strong perfume.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m enough of a Bro to wear this.  Otherwise it works.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product,I love it. Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> I tossed it because it contains sodium benzoate and other unnatural and potentially carcinogenic compounds.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a true sandalwood scent, this is not the product for you.  I does have a nice clean and pleasant smell, but it is not sandalwood.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Very nice aroma and lathers better than any other product I have used before. I have had many compliments on the aroma.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash.  I read some complaints about how it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, but that is exactly the point.  Unlike most body washes, it doesn&#x27;t completely douse you with fragrances.  Instead, it just adds a hint of its &#x27;sandalwood&#x27; scent.  I mean, just stop and think about it for a second: you put on your body wash, your shampoo, your shaving cream/soap, deodorant, and maybe some other hygiene products every day including whatever detergent you use for your clothes...those are a lot of different smells, and most of us don&#x27;t think about whether or not they conflict with each other instead of compliment.  This just adds a very small subtle hint instead of conflicting with every other scent you put on your body.  I always think of these different things as everyday cologne, in that you want to smell nice/appealing, but you don&#x27;t want to burnout the nostrils of everyone that passes you.  This helped me along those lines.  As a disclaimer: I am an office worker in that I don&#x27;t do a lot of manual labor, I sit at a computer most of the day for my job, so I can&#x27;t tell you whether or not this will be good enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the smell itself as it didn&#x27;t hit me as too sweet or flowery, but it wasn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;sandalwood&#x27; either.  Never the less, it has a slightly musky and appealing scent.  Others pointed out that you can find it at Target for a couple bucks cheaper so if you want to check your local Target, go for it.  I will say that I am very pleased with this for an everyday body wash.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about this product. I have fell in love with TOBS sandalwood products, but because of the price I went looking for something to use more often. Although it has a mild smell that is nothing like TOBS, it still smells very nice. It lathers up nice, too. Don&#x27;t be afraid to give Every Man Jack a try.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust the bottle - always double bag it when traveling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t like the fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell bad, it&#x27;s just a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid stuff. I wouldn&#x27;t say the smell isnt really a true Sandwood scent but it&#x27;s close enough for a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a 14 year old drenched in Axe body spray.</li>
            <li> I got the orange bottle before, as I like citrus-y smells. This sandalwood smells GREAT, and when my wife first smelled it, her first reaction was &amp;#34;ooo, manly!&amp;#34; Big points there. But it&#x27;s different than its orange counterpart. It doesn&#x27;t seem to lather as well, not to say it doens&#x27;t lather, just not as well as the orange. Also, the orange has little micro-beads in it to scrub off dead skin and all that. This one doesn&#x27;t. That said, this smell seems to stick to my person longer (a good thing) and isn&#x27;t overbearing. That it&#x27;s all natural, cruelty free, etc is another huge plus.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my fiance and he loves it! It smells amazing!</li>
