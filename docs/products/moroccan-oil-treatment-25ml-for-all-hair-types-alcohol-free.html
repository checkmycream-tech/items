            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but I had better results with the .85oz after blow drying my hair and the smell of it was better than the 25ml</li>
            <li>It gives moisture and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy :)</li>
            <li>top of that by the time I realized it won&#x27;t be here in the &#x27;prime&#x27; window</li>

            <li>I have fine/straight hair that easily gets burned or damaged through daily styling, and this oil really protects it while eliminating tangles and keeps it smelling great!</li>
            <li>This moroccan oil makes hair really smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>J bought it after all the great reveiws but my hair is color treated and started turning white when I was 13.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used this regularly for a couple months and it is just now to the top of the label.  </li>
            <li>You need the real thing and this is it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order more of the small bottle..</li>
            <li>Please be aware and read that it is only 25 ml.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed a marked improvement of texture and strength.  </li>
            <li>I have 3c natural hair.</li>
            <li>A small amount made my fine, chemically straightened hair REALLY soft.  </li>

            <li> A small amount made my fine, chemically straightened hair REALLY soft.  </li>
            <li> First, you must use a very, VERY small amount of this oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few years now, and have ordered it in the past from Amazon and this is very over priced!!  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected for the cost&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a must have for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I can not live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> The key is to use just a little.</li>
            <li> Was very very disappointing to get this tiny bottle;  the picture looks like it is the full size one, but it is the miniature; my hair stylist sells a bottle three times as big as this one for $20; it is also not an american product (meaning the writing on it are a different language); very disappointed; go to your hair stylist and you can buy it cheaper and better...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Again, you uses barely enough to work into your hair (my thick, shoulder length hair uses less than 1/2 the size of a dime).  </li>
            <li> Way overpriced for such a small bottle!  </li>
            <li> So little for the price</li>
            <li> For me, thia was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> too expensive for such a small bottle...</li>
            <li> I felt cheated by the small bottle.</li>
            <li> The price is a little annoying, but I&#x27;ve tried cheaper alternatives or products that claim to have Moroccan oil in them and they just don&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will be returning the bottle.</li>
            <li> very disappointment!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it.. So little for the price</li>
            <li> First, you must use a very, VERY small amount of this oil.  I use it immediately after towel drying my hair and I have noticed a marked improvement of texture and strength.  I do not use curling/flat irons on my hair regularly, but when I do, I add an extra &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; of this all over my hair before begining.  I have not noticed any smell as another reviewer had noted.  Again, you uses barely enough to work into your hair (my thick, shoulder length hair uses less than 1/2 the size of a dime).  I&#x27;ve used this regularly for a couple months and it is just now to the top of the label.  The key is to use just a little.</li>
            <li> Its okay but I had better results with the .85oz after blow drying my hair and the smell of it was better than the 25ml so I huess the next time I order I&#x27;ll order more of the small bottle..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if youve ever tried purchasing this any where else but it&#x27;s expensive.  Amazon saved my life. This is a must have for dry hair.  It gives moisture and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy :)</li>
            <li> too expensive for such a small bottle...</li>
            <li> Was very very disappointing to get this tiny bottle;  the picture looks like it is the full size one, but it is the miniature; my hair stylist sells a bottle three times as big as this one for $20; it is also not an american product (meaning the writing on it are a different language); very disappointed; go to your hair stylist and you can buy it cheaper and better...&lt;br /&gt;on top of that by the time I realized it won&#x27;t be here in the &#x27;prime&#x27; window; I could not cancel the order any more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very very disappointment!!</li>
            <li> I am a bit sensitive to odors; however, my hairdresser recommended this becaue I have kind of frizz hair.  Not only did it make my hair look like I had put salad oil on it, I couldn&#x27;t breathe all day.  The scent is a combination in insence and body odor.  Sorry!</li>
            <li> Way overpriced for such a small bottle!  I get it cheaper at my hair salon.  Try to find it somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I can not live without this stuff! I use is for myself, my son and daughter. It smells great and has helped my hair grow extremely fast. My hair looks healthier too!</li>
            <li> I actually use this product in the salon I work at and I loved the smell and how it manages my hair and I wanted some of my own. I love it &amp; this product leaves your hair with an amazing scent!</li>
            <li> This is a miniature bottle.  Please be aware and read that it is only 25 ml.  I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a few years now, and have ordered it in the past from Amazon and this is very over priced!!  I was rushing out the door, did a quick search on Amazon, saw the large size bottle and placed my order.  Very disappointed and will be returning the bottle.</li>
            <li> A small amount made my fine, chemically straightened hair REALLY soft.  The price is a little annoying, but I&#x27;ve tried cheaper alternatives or products that claim to have Moroccan oil in them and they just don&#x27;t cut it.  You need the real thing and this is it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff!! Keeps my hair shiny, healthy, and growing.</li>
            <li> This moroccan oil makes hair really smooth and shiny. I have fine/straight hair that easily gets burned or damaged through daily styling, and this oil really protects it while eliminating tangles and keeps it smelling great! I bought the same size/brand in my salon for upwards of $45.</li>
            <li> It was so good as I expected. I&#x27;ve bought this product before and it was good, I got the same this time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have 3c natural hair. This product stays in my hair for days. I even use it to massage my scalp 3 times a week. A little goes a long way. My hair already looks and feels better. I&#x27;ve already ordered my second bottle. This is now a staple in my hair care .</li>
            <li> I felt cheated by the small bottle. Didn&#x27;t realize I was ordering the travel size. Nice one, you got me.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference with this product. J bought it after all the great reveiws but my hair is color treated and started turning white when I was 13. I cut my hair to help bring back some life but that didnt help the shine. For me, thia was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected for the cost&lt;br /&gt;I love this product&lt;br /&gt;Amazon shipped perfect</li>
