            <li>i find this peddle very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>This works about a million times better then the piece of junk &amp;#34;15 dollar value&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have way better pedals</li>

            <li> Yeah just got the Footpedal not the same in the picture very disappointed</li>
            <li> works well as a back up pedal...i own my own shop and like how sensitive it  is to the touch</li>
            <li> This works about a million times better then the piece of junk &amp;#34;15 dollar value&amp;#34; Stainless Steel flat thin pedal that came with my power supply, mostly because this one always makes contact when I push it down! Just what its supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great control but have not been able to use it since the second day I had it. It is jammed or something will not work to turn on or off no matter what I have tried to get it to.I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Great product. I purchased two pedals the 360 pro and also one of those flat metal pedals for 15 dollars. People say you get what you pay for , not in this case. The pro 360 tattoo foot pedal is a great product for a cheap price works every push. The more expensive pedal was cheaply made and it doesn&#x27;t hold current u have to place your foot in a certain spot for it to work correctly</li>
            <li> I have way better pedals but I needed a backup. These are nice if your in a pinch or if your mobile for parties or whatever</li>
            <li> Got this product three months ago and still working perfect! Very impressed!</li>
            <li> I am new to tattooing and now i have a professional type pedal to power my gun. I am super happy.</li>
            <li> Connection broke after a few days. Had to re-solder wire and eventually ended up tossing it and buying a better one.</li>
            <li> This is not even the pedal I got when i ordered it. It is some bunk one with an extra clip cord attached to it and it doesnt even work, glad it was cheap but it was a waste of my time</li>
            <li> I got this pedal and it was great through three tattoos. On my fourt tattoo it just stopped working in the middle of it. Luckily I didnt throw out my previous pedal.</li>
            <li> Pedal sticks occasionally but works fine otherwise</li>
            <li> Love it! Easy to use!</li>
            <li> i Have to tattoo with my socks on in order to use my big toe as an activator because the switch is tempermental...but it works...no gem but you can 8 for the same price...</li>
            <li> POS broke after using it twice and that was only for a matter of maybe six hours I used it for.</li>
            <li> easy transactiion, just as described.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, good quality, and it looks absoluty cool!!!!!! i find this peddle very comfortable to use. and its not spotty. great product would suggest to anyone!</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister&#x27;s son who is 18 he said he loves it and works well! very very happy with it!</li>
            <li> works great, arrived when specified</li>
