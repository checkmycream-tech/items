            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I guess by now you haved figured out that i LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>But i liked the smell and it seems to have a glitter effect in my hair.</li>
            <li>Honestly,  I was a bit sceptical.</li>
            <li>My hair is very easy to get heat damage, so I&#x27;m glad that this product effectively prevented that.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it -</li>
            <li>Not my favorite product, I still prefer serum.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I lived somewhere humid there might be a bit of a difference in how it reacts with my hair, but until then I won&#x27;t know for sure.</li>
            <li>Favorite product for post washed/conditioned hair.  </li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many reviews...</li>
            <li>I like it :)</li>
            <li>This product also helps to keep your hair healthy even if you dye it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite styling cream.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t able to find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>This seems to work best for me in the winter, when it is dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heat protectant PLUS if you are natural its nice for a wash n go (you see more defined coils).</li>
            <li>This is the BEST stuff I&#x27;ve ever found to put in my hair to blow dry it straight!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mostly used it right after washing my hair, then brushing it</li>
            <li>BUT, it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>and  you have to clean it often or these particles would stay on your hair...</li>
            <li>It looks as if I still have a relaxer and it stays straight for more than a week.</li>
            <li>My hair is super curly &amp; hates summer.</li>
            <li>This is sooooo much better than heat protectant, leaves hair soft with no residual while treats it!</li>
            <li>This is by far not only the best heat protector that I have EVER used, it is also my new product to use as a wash-n-go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>After I use it my hair is soft, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many smoothers/heat protectans but this one is not as good as others I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
            <li>All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
            <li>I found this to work pretty nicely when flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my thin frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>more to buy here on the Big Island Hawaii at a retail outlet.</li>
            <li>Being the most expensive in their line they&#x27;re not necessarily the best.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this product</li>
            <li>nice a smooth for thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li>The blow dry cream is a much better product.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s amazing how much this product keeps the friz down to a minimum.</li>
            <li>but it actually just calms the curls and gives the hair a nice normal sheen (makes it soft looking).  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly within  a few days and I am quite satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that keeps my hair straight, moistened and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I have medium straight hair so maybe i am not qualified to say if it works.</li>
            <li>I absolutely can&#x27;t stand this stuff.</li>
            <li>The straight and smooth look and fell of your hair last much longer.  </li>
            <li>I have very frizzy, curly hair - and this says it&#x27;s a straightening balm -</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference when I used this product.</li>
            <li>My hair dries much nicer and smoother and straightens easier when using it.    </li>
            <li>I love my natural hair, but when I want to straighten it, I want it to last.</li>
            <li>i have found so far!!!</li>
            <li>I get frizzy hair sometimes and this product really helps with the frizziness more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a smooth look and feel when I straighten it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used K-pak smoothing balm for many years but buying it for the first time on Amazon because I try to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li>I apply a pea sized amount to baby fine hair and allow hair to air dry.  </li>
            <li>It took a lot more effort to get my hair straight and the next day some of my hair kinked back up.  </li>
            <li>gives some shine, soft and make it easy to use the flat iron....</li>
            <li>I washed my hair a few days later and thankfully my curls bounced back beautifully.</li>
            <li>The flip top should have been taped shut, much of the product had leaked out during shipping making for a very messy package.</li>
            <li>My hear is about 80-90 centimeters long and is turns into a bird&#x27;s nest quickly.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>Works wonders no matter the shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve used, a bottle usually lasts me 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>Also works with blow dryer and round brush to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li>I needed a product that would protect my natural hair against heat damage when I straightened it.</li>
            <li>I travelled to Miami in the middle of summer and my flat ironed hair stayed straight much to my surprise.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone with Afro-curly hair who wants to straighten your hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love the Joico moisture shampoo and conditioner, but I bought this K-Pak and K-Pak deep conditioner, and I&#x27;m not satisfied with K-Pak products.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine thin semi-frizzy/semi-curly hair that can blow dry straight.</li>
            <li>He says it actually holds his hair and makes it soft.</li>
            <li>and it just stays smooth, then add a little after it&#x27;s almost dry.</li>
            <li>This stuff works and my hair stays straight as long as I want it to, without having to flat iron it every couple of days and damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>It did seem at first like the bottles had been previously used, but I think it was just the packaging material.</li>
            <li>No need to use a straight iron again only blow dry and your done!  </li>
            <li>After blow drying, the hair is soft and after flat ironing the hair is shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried way better for way less in the past (Silk Elements Megasilk Heat Protectant, Tresemme etc.</li>
            <li>It keeps it straight and soft minus the greasy feel of other straightening products.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick with lots of body, hard to keep smooth and straight.</li>

            <li> It keeps it straight and soft minus the greasy feel of other straightening products.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick with lots of body, hard to keep smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that it leaves some white film on your flat iron while you are doing your hair</li>
            <li> I am very careful about what I put on my hair and about using heat on my hair, and so far this product has done its job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li> but i pass the flat iron again on that</li>
            <li> But one person told me how their hair reacted with a flat iron and the humidity of Florida</li>
            <li> This makes my hair super soft &amp; shiny when I blow dry it and manageable (not all that ugly frizz) to wear in public natural.</li>
            <li> As a heat protector a little goes a long way, and my hair was soft and silky looking.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product very long, but I can say that it has done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this before I blow dry my hair a lot</li>
            <li> my hair is black and those white things make it look like dandruff...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very dry and anything this watery won&#x27;t keep a lot of moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> The smell only lasts a little while.</li>
            <li> It left my hair brittle, crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasing,  no product build up, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount daily after each shampoo.</li>
            <li> I will continue using other Joico products but not K-Pak.  </li>
            <li> A small amount is all that is necessary.</li>
            <li> Distribute it evenly and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t give up on this product, I may need to combine it with another product so that my hair isn&#x27;t so stiff and dry when using it.</li>
            <li> I could feel a lot of residue in my hair and it left it dull.  </li>
            <li> a spray heat protectant, same results less icky less money</li>
            <li> I like the way it works, smooths &amp; straightens with a slight shimmer.</li>
            <li> Yes this product may have a slight fish oil smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really curly, just dry and thin.</li>
            <li> It has a very sticky artificial feeling.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and helps retain moisture in hair.</li>
            <li> Always helps tame frizz on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive, but I hate trying out new products (especially cheaper ones) only to find out they don&#x27;t really work, and now I&#x27;m stuck with an entire bottle of crap that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> you can not use it as a just  leave in balm it would leave your hair too sticky and a bit stiff or hard...</li>
            <li> It does not soften the hair, instead it makes the hair feel very stiff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 5 yrs.  </li>
            <li> but it is hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad, or like you just came for the salon or anything</li>
            <li> I hated the way it made my hair feel.  </li>

            <li> I love this product.  I had to cut of a star because of the way it was packaged.  The flip top should have been taped shut, much of the product had leaked out during shipping making for a very messy package.</li>
            <li> i like it, the effect it does in my hair is great ... gives some shine, soft and make it easy to use the flat iron....the only thing is that it leaves some white film on your flat iron while you are doing your hair and  you have to clean it often or these particles would stay on your hair... my hair is black and those white things make it look like dandruff... but i pass the flat iron again on that and it melts back on my hair.. so it is ok!! the effect after all is what i like... i just shake my hair to get rid of those white residues ... you can not use it as a just  leave in balm it would leave your hair too sticky and a bit stiff or hard... the effect is when you use the straightener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used K-pak smoothing balm for many years but buying it for the first time on Amazon because I try to save a few dollars. Somehow, this is not the same as the one I bought at the beauty store. The balm texture from Amazon is rather sticky. It does not soften the hair, instead it makes the hair feel very stiff. The smell is also different from what I used to get.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now. I travelled to Miami in the middle of summer and my flat ironed hair stayed straight much to my surprise. I recommend this product for anyone with Afro-curly hair who wants to straighten your hair with a flat iron. After blow drying, the hair is soft and after flat ironing the hair is shiny. It looks as if I still have a relaxer and it stays straight for more than a week.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love as a heat protectant!</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that keeps my hair straight, moistened and tangle free.  Love it - but it is hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> Product arrived as if it had been opened and spilling out. Not my favorite product, I still prefer serum.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my thin frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Joico K-pak Smoothing Balm.  I have been using this product for at least 5 yrs.  I purchased this on Amazon because of the low price which included shipping.  It is $8-10. more to buy here on the Big Island Hawaii at a retail outlet. The product arrived quickly within  a few days and I am quite satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this smoothing balm... I bought it on the recommendation of my hairdresser a while back. I&#x27;ve since moved and need to find another place to buy this stuff from (enter, Amazon!)   I like the way it works, smooths &amp; straightens with a slight shimmer. It is a bit expensive, but I hate trying out new products (especially cheaper ones) only to find out they don&#x27;t really work, and now I&#x27;m stuck with an entire bottle of crap that doesn&#x27;t work. Which is why this is the only straightening balm I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Such a great product! I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair anymore. It keeps it straight and soft minus the greasy feel of other straightening products.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my frizzy and fly away hair.  I use a small amount daily after each shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have a 4b/a hair type and I find the consistency a bit watery for me. I live in the desert so it&#x27;s very dry and anything this watery won&#x27;t keep a lot of moisture in my hair. I&#x27;m sure if I lived somewhere humid there might be a bit of a difference in how it reacts with my hair, but until then I won&#x27;t know for sure. I&#x27;ve only used it as a leave in conditioner and haven&#x27;t put it to the test of heat via blow dying yet. On the plus side it smells great.</li>
            <li> Favorite product for post washed/conditioned hair.  Not too heavy and helps retain moisture in hair.</li>
            <li> it is really good to be used before brushing your hair</li>
            <li> I have medium straight hair so maybe i am not qualified to say if it works. But i liked the smell and it seems to have a glitter effect in my hair.</li>
            <li> Honestly,  I was a bit sceptical. There aren&#x27;t many reviews...well video reviews about this product. But one person told me how their hair reacted with a flat iron and the humidity of Florida so I had to try! Great product. The smell is pleasing,  no product build up, a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s a heat protectant PLUS if you are natural its nice for a wash n go (you see more defined coils). Those are my thoughts. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> My hair is super curly &amp; hates summer. My hair lady put this on my hair while damp &amp; it&#x27;s amazing how much this product keeps the friz down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I like it :)&lt;br /&gt;feels nice a smooth for thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a smooth look and feel when I straighten it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t stand this stuff. I regret purchasing. It has a very sticky artificial feeling. I&#x27;ve tried way better for way less in the past (Silk Elements Megasilk Heat Protectant, Tresemme etc. I&#x27;d say save your money and go w/ a spray heat protectant, same results less icky less money</li>
            <li> I love this product! I get frizzy hair sometimes and this product really helps with the frizziness more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. It also smells great and has a very light sparkle sheen to it.</li>
            <li> Always helps tame frizz on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Yes this product may have a slight fish oil smell BUT, it&#x27;s worth it!  The smell only lasts a little while. The straight and smooth look and fell of your hair last much longer.  It&#x27;s worth every penny. No need to use a straight iron again only blow dry and your done!  This product also helps to keep your hair healthy even if you dye it. My hair is thick with lots of body, hard to keep smooth and straight. I can&#x27;t go without my K-PAK smoothing balm.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!! I have very fine thin semi-frizzy/semi-curly hair that can blow dry straight. This makes my hair super soft &amp; shiny when I blow dry it and manageable (not all that ugly frizz) to wear in public natural. Best product for my hair i have found so far!!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST stuff I&#x27;ve ever found to put in my hair to blow dry it straight! I put it in my damp hair and it keeps my hair from frizzing and give it body too. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I use this before I blow dry my hair a lot and it seems to help with smoothing and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product very long, but I can say that it has done wonders for my hair. After I use it my hair is soft, smooth and shiny! I am very careful about what I put on my hair and about using heat on my hair, and so far this product has done its job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad, or like you just came for the salon or anything so that is a bonus!</li>
            <li> this is really great stuff!  I have very frizzy, curly hair - and this says it&#x27;s a straightening balm - but it actually just calms the curls and gives the hair a nice normal sheen (makes it soft looking).  I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
            <li> I love my natural hair, but when I want to straighten it, I want it to last. This stuff works and my hair stays straight as long as I want it to, without having to flat iron it every couple of days and damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest thing I&#x27;ve come across. My hear is about 80-90 centimeters long and is turns into a bird&#x27;s nest quickly. It&#x27;s not really curly, just dry and thin. Works wonders no matter the shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve used, a bottle usually lasts me 6 months or more. I&#x27;ve mostly used it right after washing my hair, then brushing it and it just stays smooth, then add a little after it&#x27;s almost dry.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite styling cream. It makes my hair nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t weight it down. Smells too.</li>
            <li> I am growing out a perm and have been using ISO Tamer Foam to straighten my hair.  It was the only product of that type I had tried so wanted to try something different.  The Joico Smoothing Balm has nothing on Tamer Foam.  It took a lot more effort to get my hair straight and the next day some of my hair kinked back up.  I could feel a lot of residue in my hair and it left it dull.  I will definitely stick with Tamer Foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Joico K-Pak for a while but doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many smoothers/heat protectans but this one is not as good as others I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s more expensive. I love the Joico moisture shampoo and conditioner, but I bought this K-Pak and K-Pak deep conditioner, and I&#x27;m not satisfied with K-Pak products.  I will continue using other Joico products but not K-Pak.  Being the most expensive in their line they&#x27;re not necessarily the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far not only the best heat protector that I have EVER used, it is also my new product to use as a wash-n-go. My hair was shiny and my curls were so well defined. NOTHING else compares to what this product did for my hair. As a heat protector a little goes a long way, and my hair was soft and silky looking. I received all sorts of compliments from my co-workers and family. I guess by now you haved figured out that i LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I found this to work pretty nicely when flat ironing my hair. Think I will continue to use it on the days I decide to flatten/straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> This seems to work best for me in the winter, when it is dry.  I apply a pea sized amount to baby fine hair and allow hair to air dry.  Also works with blow dryer and round brush to smooth my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me in the summer/humidity in the south.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product and I wasn&#x27;t happy at all.  I hated the way it made my hair feel.  The blow dry cream is a much better product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used it for years and it always works and it smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in the stores. Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I saw great reviews for this on Youtube and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I needed a product that would protect my natural hair against heat damage when I straightened it. I didn&#x27;t use anything but this as per a tutorial I saw on Youtube. It left my hair brittle, crunchy and stiff. My hair is very easy to get heat damage, so I&#x27;m glad that this product effectively prevented that. I washed my hair a few days later and thankfully my curls bounced back beautifully. I won&#x27;t give up on this product, I may need to combine it with another product so that my hair isn&#x27;t so stiff and dry when using it.</li>
            <li> It did seem at first like the bottles had been previously used, but I think it was just the packaging material. The product is good.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this product. He says it actually holds his hair and makes it soft. I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> The product does an excellent job of smoothing my hair and eliminating frizz. A small amount is all that is necessary.</li>
            <li> This is sooooo much better than heat protectant, leaves hair soft with no residual while treats it! Love it!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference when I used this product. It was as if I didn&#x27;t use anything, but maybe it has to do with the texture of my hair. I have relaxed african-american hair.</li>
            <li> Love this! My hair dries much nicer and smoother and straightens easier when using it.    Distribute it evenly and a little goes a long way! Makes hair so healthy!!    This is my go to product I always use and buy. Use sparingly to avoid overloading the hair, and it rocks!</li>
