            <li>use it on days I don&#x27;t wear foundation as well because it makes you skin look very healthy, it gives it a nice \\&quot;glow\\&quot; so to speak.</li>
            <li>I also like how creamy and not silicone-y (for lack of a better word!)</li>
            <li>This is fine as primer,,, but yet I do not find a good one...</li>
            <li>Good product for a cheap primer.  </li>

            <li>I love this primer.</li>
            <li>making them show more.</li>

            <li>Not my favorite, but it will work if you&#x27;re in a pickle.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this on the skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, stays on all day and comes off nicely at night.</li>
            <li>This primer is ok.</li>
            <li>I have some I like much better.</li>
            <li>More like  lotion than a primer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always tried to get my skin to look good with makeup and never had success until I purchase primer.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product</li>
            <li>Love all Rimmel products and this I put on before my makeup and it stays on all day</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and this primer is so perfect under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>This primer works as good as or better than some high end</li>
            <li>It keeps your foundation from creasing into fine lines (I have the start of crows feet around my eyes-</li>
            <li>It fills in acne scars, fine lines, basically it creates a smooth canvas for you to work</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time today, I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I was to see how smooth, fresh and bright my face looked.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s are huge differences in my foundation since I started using this-it glides on easier</li>
            <li>Always thought I needed a foundation coat to cover my skin for a smooth look - no longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it actually works GREAT.</li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely, really smooth.</li>
            <li>I could spend lots of money on the primers that are sold in department stores, but this one is fantastic AND it costs a fraction of those.</li>
            <li>Acts as a smooth &amp;#34;canvas&amp;#34; for my foundation.</li>
            <li>light, non-greasy, yet allows my makeup to glide on....</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t have the smooth coverage</li>
            <li>Thought I would try in light of the price.</li>
            <li>This primer is okay, not as great as I expected</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different primers and this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>I gave it to my sister, and it works a lot better for her, because she&#x27;s darker skinned than I am, so you can&#x27;t really see</li>
            <li>But overall, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this product, I just really wanted to find a cheaper place to buy it than my local drug store.</li>
            <li>I love Rimmel, and when I first bought a tube the lotion was white, smooth, and worked like a dream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the color, it makes the skin feel so soft, and so smooth, it&#x27;s almost worth</li>
            <li>as exactly as pictured here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first review</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good primer that really does seem to extend the wear of my face makeup (although I&#x27;m not sure I really notice it smoothing the texture of my skin or reducing pores).</li>
            <li>and I have a very oily face.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to use as much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like it smooths my face out though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Primers and how much of a difference they can make with a normal makeup routine.</li>
            <li>I think it was used because it wasn&#x27;t safety sealed and was only partially full.</li>
            <li>and I like this particular one because it has no tint- like a lotion.</li>
            <li>and I have been wearing makeup since high school.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m really bummed with this.</li>
            <li>Granted, the scar is small and not very deep, but it blended into the crack and smoothed it over so nicely, I was highly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasnt about to put something on my face that had clearly been used</li>
            <li>plus I thought I was looking old and wanted to try something for a lift.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it (as far as I can tell).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, but usually causes a little irritation to sensitive skin, which I have.</li>
            <li>I bought 001 just to be surprised that it&#x27;s an orangey red color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too oily and it does not dry out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Tube came almost empty</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> and I just bought this the other day.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> One day I decided to just wear the Rimmel 001 with a little loose powder as my foundation and what a difference!!  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be tinted like my previous order</li>
            <li> I purchased mine at Walgreen&#x27;s for half of this price and it would probably be even less at Walmart.</li>
            <li> because  i have a little bit of acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be translucent when it dries, and it almost is, but it does have a slight orange tint (it could be my skin, I&#x27;m particularly pale and pasty), and even underneath my foundation, you could see the tint.</li>
            <li> I never used primer until a few months ago because my foundation was looking shiney after a few hours</li>
            <li> Under foundation I still found that my foundation looked shiney after a few hours.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not ghostly pale, like me, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick so you only need to use a little bit to create a thin layer on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesnt work and it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product in store, but it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also never had any negative reactions to it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an organge texture and has a little scent nothing bad.</li>
            <li> so i was unable to even try it.</li>
            <li> , very expensive primers I have used.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product in store, but it&#x27;s hard to find. It&#x27;s a nice product, but usually causes a little irritation to sensitive skin, which I have.</li>
            <li> I love this primer. I never used primer until a few months ago because my foundation was looking shiney after a few hours plus I thought I was looking old and wanted to try something for a lift. I started with Rimmel 002 under foundation and then changed to Rimmel 001. Under foundation I still found that my foundation looked shiney after a few hours. One day I decided to just wear the Rimmel 001 with a little loose powder as my foundation and what a difference!!  I look so much younger. I think the foundation was getting caught in my wrinkles (I am 52) making them show more. Now my face looks bright and fresh and it no longer gets shiney.  Rimmel 001 has a bit of color and with a bit of powder and blush that is all I need.  I have never worn this \\&quot;less\\&quot; make up and I have been wearing makeup since high school.  Always thought I needed a foundation coat to cover my skin for a smooth look - no longer.  Never change Rimmel 001!!! I love it!!! Now I have to figure out what to do with all the bottles of foundation I have been trying over the last year or so!!</li>
            <li> Good product for a cheap primer.  Not my favorite, but it will work if you&#x27;re in a pickle.</li>
            <li> it doesnt work and it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it actually works GREAT. However, I didn&#x27;t realize it was tinted when I purchased it. It&#x27;s supposed to be translucent when it dries, and it almost is, but it does have a slight orange tint (it could be my skin, I&#x27;m particularly pale and pasty), and even underneath my foundation, you could see the tint. I gave it to my sister, and it works a lot better for her, because she&#x27;s darker skinned than I am, so you can&#x27;t really see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the color, it makes the skin feel so soft, and so smooth, it&#x27;s almost worth the orange color it makes my face. I tested it out on the back of my hand, where I have a little scar, and you couldn&#x27;t even see the scar after I put it on. Granted, the scar is small and not very deep, but it blended into the crack and smoothed it over so nicely, I was highly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not ghostly pale, like me, I&#x27;d recommend it. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s actually a great product, just not quite translucent for me.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is fine as primer,,, but yet I do not find a good one... If you can recommend me to cover imperfections tell me..</li>
            <li> Tube came almost empty so i was unable to even try it. I wasnt about to put something on my face that had clearly been used</li>
            <li> I thought it would be tinted like my previous order</li>
            <li> This primer works as good as or better than some high end, very expensive primers I have used. A little bit goes a long way with this. It is a bit thick so you only need to use a little bit to create a thin layer on your face.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it (as far as I can tell). It goes on very nicely, really smooth. It fills in acne scars, fine lines, basically it creates a smooth canvas for you to work with.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on days I don&#x27;t wear foundation as well because it makes you skin look very healthy, it gives it a nice \\&quot;glow\\&quot; so to speak. When I do use it with foundation, my foundation stays in place all day and goes on very smoothly. It keeps your foundation from creasing into fine lines (I have the start of crows feet around my eyes- yikes!) and acne scars/pits (and I have some big ones, don&#x27;t pick at your pimples people!).</li>
            <li> I could spend lots of money on the primers that are sold in department stores, but this one is fantastic AND it costs a fraction of those. It goes on smoothly, stays on all day and comes off nicely at night. Acts as a smooth &amp;#34;canvas&amp;#34; for my foundation.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I have ever used, bar none, including the pricey luxury store choices.....light, non-greasy, yet allows my makeup to glide on....love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. This primer is ok. I have some I like much better. It don&#x27;t have the smooth coverage like I like. More like  lotion than a primer.</li>
            <li> I love Rimmel, and when I first bought a tube the lotion was white, smooth, and worked like a dream. It was a white a blue bottled as exactly as pictured here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I only seem to find white and plum/burgundy colored bottles, where the contents are tinted orange-brown as noted in some of the comments. I guess it&#x27;s a redesign, so I purchased anyway just hoping it was as pictured and that the reviews stating its tinted were for an alternate product option. But of course the tinted lotion is what I received, NOT the white lotion as it is pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, though the product is not as pictured in the posting it works well as a primer. I do find it to be greasier and feel thicker/heavier than the white formula, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used primer before in my entire life and I just bought this the other day. My face is combination with oily t-zone, dry patches with flaky skin and acne, so when I would wear foundation, I would either look like I caked on my makeup or it is shiny as ever. I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Primers and how much of a difference they can make with a normal makeup routine. After using it for the first time today, I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I was to see how smooth, fresh and bright my face looked. I&#x27;ve always tried to get my skin to look good with makeup and never had success until I purchase primer. I was ecstatic. Not to mention how even and well it stayed all day. I LOVE this product and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good primer. And it&#x27;s a great price too. So that&#x27;s a plus also!</li>
            <li> This had a hand lotion type of smell and made my face break out. I think it was used because it wasn&#x27;t safety sealed and was only partially full. Would not recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Love all Rimmel products and this I put on before my makeup and it stays on all day and I have a very oily face.</li>
            <li> I like that your facial makeup stays on longer but  this product makes my skin too oily.</li>
            <li> This primer is okay, not as great as I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product, I just really wanted to find a cheaper place to buy it than my local drug store. I use this under my foundation as a primer and I like this particular one because it has no tint- like a lotion. It&#x27;s not too oily and it does not dry out. I&#x27;ve also never had any negative reactions to it!</li>
            <li> Thought I would try in light of the price. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a total makeup/nail polish junky.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different primers and this is by far the best!  There&#x27;s are huge differences in my foundation since I started using this-it glides on easier so I don&#x27;t need to use as much, it stays on a lot longer, my oily skin stays matte with maybe one powder touch-up or oil blotting sheet during the day.  One piece of advice-don&#x27;t purchase it through here.  I purchased mine at Walgreen&#x27;s for half of this price and it would probably be even less at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I use this primer all the time.  My skin is dry and this primer is so perfect under my makeup.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, alone without foundation. My skin has a beautiful,smooth,dewy appearance. Never thought I would go without my face make up. Soon I will try it with foundation, I can&#x27;t imagine! This is my first review and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just bought this to try and extend my foundation throughout the day. I bought 001 just to be surprised that it&#x27;s an orangey red color. I applied it to my face anyways thinking maybe it adjusts when on- I look like an Oompa Loompa. I&#x27;m still going to give it a chance and apply my foundation over it in hopes that it has some sort of contrast color effect but so far I&#x27;m really bummed with this.</li>
            <li> My makeup does stay on all day, it&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s an organge texture and has a little scent nothing bad. I don&#x27;t really feel like it smooths my face out though because  i have a little bit of acne. But my makeup does stay on all day</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good primer that really does seem to extend the wear of my face makeup (although I&#x27;m not sure I really notice it smoothing the texture of my skin or reducing pores). I also like how creamy and not silicone-y (for lack of a better word!) it is. Would I purchase it again? I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s THAT wonderful...I might choose to try something else. But overall, it is a good product.</li>
