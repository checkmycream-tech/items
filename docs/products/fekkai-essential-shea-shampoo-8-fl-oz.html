    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>In our opinion, Fekkai is the best brand for hair products out there.</li>
            <li>this is perfect!</li>
            <li>was actually really impressed.  </li>
            <li>, so this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Fekkai hair products for about a decade and this is one of the company&#x27;s best shampoos.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a shampoo that&#x27;s excellent at conditioning</li>
            <li>The shampoo felt so silky it was the best feeling</li>
            <li>Impressed.</li>
            <li>Great transaction.</li>
            <li>And if it makes her happy, then that&#x27;s all I care about.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and lingers but not in a sickly-perfume type way.</li>
            <li>then this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>My hair just smells and feels so great after using this product.</li>
            <li>but I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>After using the shampoo for a month, I&#x27;m happy to say this is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>recommend using this with matching conditioner which does a great job of making the hair manageable and silky.</li>
            <li>This Fekkai shampoo has a very nice scent and it smells so lovely when you are working it into a lather in your hair!!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I love it, the best product I found .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another reason I like this shampoo is because it&#x27;s delightfully scented by jasmine and exotic florals.</li>
            <li>Awesome smell great for any hair type and it made my hair full of lice bouncy luxurious</li>
            <li>This shampoo produces impressive lather, and has a pleasant, light floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair smell really good and feel noticeably softer.</li>
            <li>(Good...</li>
            <li>So if you need a De-Frizzer (that also lathers up and smells good) then pick this up.</li>
            <li>Although synthetic, the fragrance is so good that it attracts insects.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This did nothing good for my hair.</li>
            <li>If you can get used to the thickness of it, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>(although I used it twice because I loved the scent).</li>
            <li>Good for combating winter dryness.  </li>
            <li>Scent wise, this is Jasmine in a bottle with a touch of creamy shea which is nutty and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was immediately impressed with the rich creamy formula and the smell.</li>
            <li>An excellent shampoo that makes your hair clean and healthy and smells great too.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>Promises of top quality kept!</li>
            <li>When I first used this shampoo, I noted it felt richer and seemed to suds-up to the perfect degree.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Did I mention how amazing this smells?</li>
            <li>Smells nice, feels nice.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell and cleans well.  </li>
            <li>I received the product in exchange for honest review &amp; candid opinion.</li>
            <li>I received the product in exchange for honest review &amp; candid opinion.</li>
            <li>shampoo is a nice texture</li>
            <li>and I really liked that as well.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I&#x27;m kind of fickle like that.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as effective for frizz as I would&#x27;ve liked, but it is still a really nice moisturizing shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a nice smell and lathered up nicely.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell</li>
            <li>This product is so effective and efficient.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>My hair grew a lot this summer and this shampoo let it stay tangle free and moisturized even though I braid it a lot and often twist it in a bun at work, very nice</li>
            <li>After I rinsed my hair smelled great and was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>This product line is exceptional and I equally love the shea and the glossing shampoo.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good but doesn&#x27;t do any miracles (got it in attempt to save hair from damage, didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement after using this shampoo)</li>
            <li>&quot; It smells nice without being overpowering and the lovely fragrance stays in my hair after washing, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for an everyday shampoo and especially excellent for when you&#x27;re in a rush and don&#x27;t have time for conditioning.</li>
            <li>but the good thing is that my hair felt clean and softer than before, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>It smells nice -- a lot like you&#x27;d expect at a salon--not to strong but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how much and how quickly it lathered.</li>
            <li>Overall an awesome product.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been softer/shinier :)</li>
            <li>thing that would make it better was if it was cheaper...but can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li>Really love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo might work better for hair courser than mine.</li>
            <li>While this shampoo and conditioner is not my favorite of all time, it is still ok.  </li>
            <li>More often my problem is it tends to flyaway and look wind-blown.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Author of &amp;#34;1106 Grand Boulevard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I found so many better salon brand shampoos.</li>
            <li>May cost more then others out there</li>
            <li>Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.</li>
            <li>My guess is that it works better on thicker, coarser hair.</li>
            <li>I have received this product for free from Influenster and to give my honest review</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and the way it makes my hair feel and behave.</li>
            <li>It boasts \\&quot;jasmine and exotic florals.\\</li>
            <li>I love Fekkai&#x27;s products (or most of them).  </li>
            <li>I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>but there was nothing outstanding in my opinion to get me wanting to stick with this product.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of the shampoo itself is somewhere between shampoo and conditioner, so its very rich.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is rich and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>It smelled pretty good, and but I would not use it again.</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter does a great job of adding much needed moisture to the hair and making it smooth</li>
            <li>I received this as complimentary for testing purposes and love it!  </li>
            <li>I also love the fragrance which is light.  </li>
            <li>The Fekkai shea shampoo and conditioner are a great combination for keeping my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her hair was shinny, silky smooth, and the frizzy was contained to an astonishing amount.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and lovely jasmine, and the shampoo itself is so moisturizing I almost felt like I didn&#x27;t need to use the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>However, in the depth of summer I really need something to quell the frizzies, and this product surprisingly did not do that for me.</li>
            <li>received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and my honest review.</li>
            <li>My wife snapped this right out of my shower!!</li>
            <li>The first few uses are delightful, but it does not do a good job of removing styling products.  </li>
            <li>and  it rinses easily.  </li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have too strong a smell, nor is it too flowery.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair very soft and manageable, imparting a pleasant floral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good thing -- it&#x27;s a high quality scent.</li>
            <li>Great lather, addictive smell, washes off well and leaves hair soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for the first time today, and i already see amazing results.</li>
            <li>I honestly feel like I have gotten a hot oil treatment after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was able to react quickly and minimize the pain &amp; inflammation, but I was stung because there was a wasp in my hair.</li>
            <li>First, I was in love with the scent-a true amazing smelling, fresh from the salon scent!  </li>
            <li>The best shampoo hands down!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just one use with the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed a huge difference in my daughterâ€™s hair.</li>
            <li>The smell of jasmine is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Combine it with their conditioner and you&#x27;ll have a fantastic head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also leaves your hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>I think it just makes that type of hair a bit too smooth and slippery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a heavily fragranced product that would work best for hair that needs to be softened.</li>
            <li>When I shampoo, the scent makes the whole shower smell nice, but does not leave a smell on my hair.</li>
            <li>it was sulfate free</li>

            <li>Indulgent cleansing experience leaves hair feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this shampoo and conditioner in a free sample box, and let me tell you, the freebie worked, they&#x27;ve got me hooked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same shampoo for a while now and am happy with that product.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the Fekkai shampoo twice....just twice, and when I told my wife about it she went right to my bathroom, took the bottle and moved it into hers!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo does an ordinary job, at best.</li>
            <li>I have curly long hair and always use shea shampoos/conditioners and this one is great.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo as it leaves my hair soft and silky while feeling wonderfully clean and looking really healthy.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it not rinsing off cleanly.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t lather or rinse clean.</li>
            <li>Great for really dry brittle sun bleached hair.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling nice and silky, which I enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product Information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Infused with pure Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;-Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was great- as expected.  </li>
            <li>Contrary to another reviewer, I did not find this overly fragrant at all, but rather a nice, soft scent.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards I saw that it is full of unpronounceable chemicals</li>
            <li>Next, I loved the suds and the way it made my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>but honestly I have Suave natural with shea</li>
            <li>particular Fekkai Shea Shampoo is best for either once a week use (with other Fekkai shampoos like the PrX</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very nicer and my hair feels very clean after rinsing the product out.  </li>
            <li>It seems that the overall heat and brushing helps to get the oils all over my hair more so than just letting it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the build-up issue, I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Most days, this shampoo is more than enough.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this shampoo from Influenster and I love the way it keeps my hair hydrated and looking shiny and healthy, would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have super curly,dense,dry type 3b/c curls.</li>
            <li>That was pretty fantastic looking, and I&#x27;ve kept doing that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky with shampoo as my scalp dries out really easily with the cheaper ones</li>
            <li>I do not use a ton of products in my hair, so I usually make sure the products that I do choose to use are of good quality and pull their weight.</li>
            <li>Excellent shampoo for chemically treated hair, dry or coarse hair.</li>
            <li>the matching conditioner wasn&#x27;t strong enough to rehydrate or smooth it out!</li>
            <li>Other reviewers said that while they loved the Fekkai line of hair care, this particular &amp;#34;frizz smoothing&amp;#34; was not their favorite either.  </li>
            <li>Huge bonus, the fragrance is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- lathers very well for a sulfate free shampoo&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>(Received a 2 oz complimentary sample for testing/review)</li>
            <li>keep my hair pretty short, and shampoo is shampoo, as long as it lathers up and smells nice, I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent but that is the only thing it has going for it.</li>
            <li>The price was a concern, but if the product did what it promised, it would be worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received the product complimentary from Influenster to test and review</li>
            <li>I received this shampoo and the Shea butter conditioner as a complimentary sample to use and then review.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it rinses out well with our low flow shower head.</li>
            <li>Shea line is my favorite, paired with the conditioner and the cream in the pot that you leave in, it&#x27;s the ultimate for glossy, ultra smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I loved that this product was able to add moisture, shine and softness without weighing down my naturally wavy hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It must clean hair very well because after the shampoo, my old perm seems to revitalize a bit, my hair seems to have more wave in it.</li>
            <li>Oddly, this shampoo feels even thicker than the corresponding conditioner, but it still smells fantastic and works great for keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li>the shower, it actually smells first as citrus, a nice brisk citrus.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a heavily fragranced product that would work best for hair that needs to be softened.</li>
            <li>hair did come out really shiny, but that is likely to be the conditioner (not Fekkai brand) binding better to really clean hair, not the shampoo.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite line and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Thanks so very much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean scent, but not really a scent I enjoy for shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and am so glad to find it in my local Target rather than having to hunt a salon/spa to find it.</li>
            <li>but for once I&#x27;m actually willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li>Not sure which one I like best, but currently this Shea shampoo is the one i&#x27;m using</li>
            <li>For many people, Fekkai Shea Shampoo moisturizes enough that a separate conditioner isn&#x27;t needed.</li>
            <li>The Fekkai shampoo that worked better for me is the Reparative one, in the blue bottle.</li>
            <li>I have exactly the hair type targeted for this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I personally would not use it again, but my sister seems to love the product.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed about this product was the smell.</li>
            <li>The first thing I like about this shampoo is the fragrance.</li>
            <li>The shampoo goes on with a very light lather so it will require a few applications to get your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>My first sniff of this bottle, and I recognized the product as very fragrant.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list is a bit long, as are most shampoos you look at.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and leaves my hair squeaky clean without it feeling completely stripped.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s fragrance struck me as high quality but as too floral for many people, especially guys and anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While showering, the very first thing I noticed while I massaged a small amount of this shampoo into my short hair was the wonderful aroma of fragrant flowers mixed with tropical fruits.</li>
            <li>anti-frizz shampoos with largely negligible result.  </li>
            <li>I applied this shampoo to my head and it was pure heaven.</li>
            <li>It certainly works as a shampoo should</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend it</li>
            <li>The fragrance is actually pretty high quality, which the fragrance snob in me appreciates.</li>
            <li>I do prefer the Fekkai Glossing Shampoo over this Shea Shampoo but if you need to use a Shea shampoo to control frizz then this is a very good (albeit expensive) choice.</li>
            <li>You only need a little to get a great lather.  </li>
            <li>I really helps those frizzies.</li>
            <li>Now, I like fragrance, I really do, and I consider myself a bit of a fragrance snob.</li>
            <li>This shampoo scents the shower much</li>
            <li>So with some skepticism I tried Fekkai, not expecting much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my hair smooth and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t tangle as much when you comb it through.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s smoother after I wash it with a silky freshness to it and this Shea line smells really creamy and decadent.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo, it&#x27;s cleansing yet non-stripping.</li>
            <li>so I need something that will help keep my hair soft, manageable, strong, and able to withstand the dry Arizona heat as well as the daily blow-drying.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in adding any more moisture to it than with other shampoos</li>
            <li>I found it rich enough to skip using conditioner.</li>
            <li>The very next thing I noticed was the rich lathery foam which this shampoo creates.</li>
            <li>Mix it up by alternting with other Fekkai shampoos.nted by jasmine and exotic florals.</li>
            <li>I normally have to use a shampoo three or four times in one setting to get a good lather and ensure my hair is clean due to my tight coils.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I have used Fekkai Products in the past and they always prove to be effective but costly.  </li>
            <li>No Frizz&amp;#34; which is my favorite and hands down</li>
            <li>It is smoother, less frizzy and has more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Overview: have mildly oily hair after 2 days without showering, tried this out as a daily shampoo bc</li>
            <li>My hair is left tangle- free and soft.</li>
            <li>I prefer a crisp, clean hair fragrance, rather than a harsh, heavy, cloying scent that invades other people&#x27;s space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Fekkai, for helping make me more presentable; for making me feel better about myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even a day later, my hair still feels clean and wonderfully soft and silky, with no</li>
            <li>Normally I use Pantene or Organix Morrocan oil or Brazilian Keratin shampoos.</li>
            <li>After about three days of this, however, I started to notice that my hair was heavier and greasier looking than normal, and it wasn&#x27;t holding curl like it normally does.</li>
            <li>This product works very well at taming frizzy hair especially in humid environments even after the first use.  </li>
            <li>- I really enjoyed how my hair would look when I would let it naturally dry overnight and then curl it the following morning.</li>
            <li>Thick and rich, the Shea shampoo is floral without being overly sweet.</li>
            <li>Clean, but not stripped of its natural oils leaving it dry.  </li>
            <li>This is very rich and only a little bit is all you need to get a rich, sudsy lather that will not strip your hair, but gently cleanses it, conditions it with real Shea oil but does NOT weigh it down.</li>
            <li>After repeated use, I found that I still had as many flyaways as other regular, cheaper shampoos any way...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was a sample because I wouldn&#x27;t want to waste my money on this!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I used Fekkai for the first time when headed on a trip because they offer their products at the local store in travel sizes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I am only using the shampoo and not a shampoo/conditioner combo, I found that while my hair was clean, I didn&#x27;t notice any extra conditioning or softness in the texture.</li>
            <li>Hands down fabulous.</li>
            <li>(I have fine, slightly past shoulder length hair that tends to fall flat quickly.)</li>
            <li>, the bottle it tiny, and the cost, large.</li>
            <li>For external use only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;Infused with pure Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>The end result is very good with your hair feeling softer and looking less dried out than with other Shampoos.  </li>
            <li>loves this shampoo, and says that it keeps her hair soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too flowery and not too &#x27;masculine.&#x27;</li>
            <li>This is the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, but it may not be completely fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Give it a try, it&#x27;s quite concentrated so it does go far.</li>
            <li>I used both the shampoo and conditioner and was surprised at how soft and silky my hair felt.</li>
            <li>I am African-American with natural 4C type hair.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>This in itself is a feat as I have naturally curly/coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using a variety of Fekkai shampoo, conditioner and grooming products for a month now and my hair really does feels different</li>
            <li>I have been using this product as it makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is a relatively expensive shampoo, but I think that many people will find the price worth it.</li>
            <li>Both are expensive, so I&#x27;ll stick with the brand I have used and loved...</li>
            <li>On the first time, I noticed yellow jackets hovering near me when I was outside.</li>
            <li>Not to sound cliche, but a little really does go a very long way with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>First time ever that has happened to me, and the only thing different ... this product.</li>
            <li>Thatâ€™s not typically the case.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo because long ago I realized the value of shea butter in hair-care products.</li>
            <li>Where I live currently it not only leaves my hair dry but brittle as well and this really works.</li>
            <li>My normal routine consists of an herbal shampoo &amp; conditioner, followed by a heat protectant / anti-frizz spray, and then a heat source (curling iron, flat iron, blow dryer, etc.).</li>
            <li>I have some wily hair, especially in the southern summers when the humidity gets high.  </li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo and coordinating conditioner exclusively and have noticed my hair looks and feels smooth for at least 3 days</li>
            <li>Apparently this Fekkai shampoo has or is something called a &amp;#34;De-Frizzer&amp;#34;, and to keep from getting the Albert Einstein look, if you have longer hair, you may want to keep it &amp;#34;De-Frizzed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for dry hair.</li>
            <li>This particular Shea shampoo, however, is not great for my type of hair: which is massive amounts of fine hair.</li>
            <li>While it took a little more effort to rinse out than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used, other than twice-the-price Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li>Weighs down my hair just enough to eliminate frizz but not too much.</li>
            <li>I tend to switch shampoos often since I can&#x27;t ever seem to find one that I absolutely cannot live without, but think I may stick with Fekkai for awhile or at least until something else catches my eye that I have to try.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly, coarse textured hair that tends to be dry.</li>
            <li>The scent is a light almost artificial floral (different from some of the more Fruity and sharp scents in other Fekkai Shampoos).  </li>
            <li>Now, that&#x27;s a good thing and a bad thing.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> In our opinion, Fekkai is the best brand for hair products out there.</li>
            <li> this is perfect!</li>
            <li> was actually really impressed.  </li>
            <li> , so this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fekkai hair products for about a decade and this is one of the company&#x27;s best shampoos.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a shampoo that&#x27;s excellent at conditioning</li>
            <li> The shampoo felt so silky it was the best feeling</li>
            <li> Impressed.</li>
            <li> Great transaction.</li>
            <li> And if it makes her happy, then that&#x27;s all I care about.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and lingers but not in a sickly-perfume type way.</li>
            <li> then this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> My hair just smells and feels so great after using this product.</li>
            <li> but I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo for a month, I&#x27;m happy to say this is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> recommend using this with matching conditioner which does a great job of making the hair manageable and silky.</li>
            <li> This Fekkai shampoo has a very nice scent and it smells so lovely when you are working it into a lather in your hair!!  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I love it, the best product I found .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another reason I like this shampoo is because it&#x27;s delightfully scented by jasmine and exotic florals.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell great for any hair type and it made my hair full of lice bouncy luxurious</li>
            <li> This shampoo produces impressive lather, and has a pleasant, light floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair smell really good and feel noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> (Good...</li>
            <li> So if you need a De-Frizzer (that also lathers up and smells good) then pick this up.</li>
            <li> Although synthetic, the fragrance is so good that it attracts insects.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This did nothing good for my hair.</li>
            <li> If you can get used to the thickness of it, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> (although I used it twice because I loved the scent).</li>
            <li> Good for combating winter dryness.  </li>
            <li> Scent wise, this is Jasmine in a bottle with a touch of creamy shea which is nutty and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was immediately impressed with the rich creamy formula and the smell.</li>
            <li> An excellent shampoo that makes your hair clean and healthy and smells great too.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Promises of top quality kept!</li>
            <li> When I first used this shampoo, I noted it felt richer and seemed to suds-up to the perfect degree.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Did I mention how amazing this smells?</li>
            <li> Smells nice, feels nice.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell and cleans well.  </li>
            <li> I received the product in exchange for honest review &amp; candid opinion.</li>
            <li> I received the product in exchange for honest review &amp; candid opinion.</li>
            <li> shampoo is a nice texture</li>
            <li> and I really liked that as well.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I&#x27;m kind of fickle like that.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as effective for frizz as I would&#x27;ve liked, but it is still a really nice moisturizing shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a nice smell and lathered up nicely.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell</li>
            <li> This product is so effective and efficient.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> My hair grew a lot this summer and this shampoo let it stay tangle free and moisturized even though I braid it a lot and often twist it in a bun at work, very nice</li>
            <li> After I rinsed my hair smelled great and was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> This product line is exceptional and I equally love the shea and the glossing shampoo.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good but doesn&#x27;t do any miracles (got it in attempt to save hair from damage, didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement after using this shampoo)</li>
            <li> &quot; It smells nice without being overpowering and the lovely fragrance stays in my hair after washing, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for an everyday shampoo and especially excellent for when you&#x27;re in a rush and don&#x27;t have time for conditioning.</li>
            <li> but the good thing is that my hair felt clean and softer than before, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It smells nice -- a lot like you&#x27;d expect at a salon--not to strong but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how much and how quickly it lathered.</li>
            <li> Overall an awesome product.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer/shinier :)</li>
            <li> thing that would make it better was if it was cheaper...but can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li> Really love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo might work better for hair courser than mine.</li>
            <li> While this shampoo and conditioner is not my favorite of all time, it is still ok.  </li>
            <li> More often my problem is it tends to flyaway and look wind-blown.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Author of &amp;#34;1106 Grand Boulevard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I found so many better salon brand shampoos.</li>
            <li> May cost more then others out there</li>
            <li> Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.</li>
            <li> My guess is that it works better on thicker, coarser hair.</li>
            <li> I have received this product for free from Influenster and to give my honest review</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and the way it makes my hair feel and behave.</li>
            <li> It boasts \\&quot;jasmine and exotic florals.\\</li>
            <li> I love Fekkai&#x27;s products (or most of them).  </li>
            <li> I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> but there was nothing outstanding in my opinion to get me wanting to stick with this product.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the shampoo itself is somewhere between shampoo and conditioner, so its very rich.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is rich and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> It smelled pretty good, and but I would not use it again.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter does a great job of adding much needed moisture to the hair and making it smooth</li>
            <li> I received this as complimentary for testing purposes and love it!  </li>
            <li> I also love the fragrance which is light.  </li>
            <li> The Fekkai shea shampoo and conditioner are a great combination for keeping my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her hair was shinny, silky smooth, and the frizzy was contained to an astonishing amount.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and lovely jasmine, and the shampoo itself is so moisturizing I almost felt like I didn&#x27;t need to use the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> However, in the depth of summer I really need something to quell the frizzies, and this product surprisingly did not do that for me.</li>
            <li> received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and my honest review.</li>
            <li> My wife snapped this right out of my shower!!</li>
            <li> The first few uses are delightful, but it does not do a good job of removing styling products.  </li>
            <li> and  it rinses easily.  </li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have too strong a smell, nor is it too flowery.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair very soft and manageable, imparting a pleasant floral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good thing -- it&#x27;s a high quality scent.</li>
            <li> Great lather, addictive smell, washes off well and leaves hair soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the first time today, and i already see amazing results.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel like I have gotten a hot oil treatment after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was able to react quickly and minimize the pain &amp; inflammation, but I was stung because there was a wasp in my hair.</li>
            <li> First, I was in love with the scent-a true amazing smelling, fresh from the salon scent!  </li>
            <li> The best shampoo hands down!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just one use with the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed a huge difference in my daughterâ€™s hair.</li>
            <li> The smell of jasmine is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Combine it with their conditioner and you&#x27;ll have a fantastic head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also leaves your hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> I think it just makes that type of hair a bit too smooth and slippery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a heavily fragranced product that would work best for hair that needs to be softened.</li>
            <li> When I shampoo, the scent makes the whole shower smell nice, but does not leave a smell on my hair.</li>
            <li> it was sulfate free</li>

            <li> Indulgent cleansing experience leaves hair feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this shampoo and conditioner in a free sample box, and let me tell you, the freebie worked, they&#x27;ve got me hooked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same shampoo for a while now and am happy with that product.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the Fekkai shampoo twice....just twice, and when I told my wife about it she went right to my bathroom, took the bottle and moved it into hers!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo does an ordinary job, at best.</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair and always use shea shampoos/conditioners and this one is great.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo as it leaves my hair soft and silky while feeling wonderfully clean and looking really healthy.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it not rinsing off cleanly.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lather or rinse clean.</li>
            <li> Great for really dry brittle sun bleached hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling nice and silky, which I enjoyed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product Information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Infused with pure Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;-Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was great- as expected.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to another reviewer, I did not find this overly fragrant at all, but rather a nice, soft scent.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards I saw that it is full of unpronounceable chemicals</li>
            <li> Next, I loved the suds and the way it made my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> but honestly I have Suave natural with shea</li>
            <li> particular Fekkai Shea Shampoo is best for either once a week use (with other Fekkai shampoos like the PrX</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very nicer and my hair feels very clean after rinsing the product out.  </li>
            <li> It seems that the overall heat and brushing helps to get the oils all over my hair more so than just letting it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the build-up issue, I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Most days, this shampoo is more than enough.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this shampoo from Influenster and I love the way it keeps my hair hydrated and looking shiny and healthy, would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have super curly,dense,dry type 3b/c curls.</li>
            <li> That was pretty fantastic looking, and I&#x27;ve kept doing that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky with shampoo as my scalp dries out really easily with the cheaper ones</li>
            <li> I do not use a ton of products in my hair, so I usually make sure the products that I do choose to use are of good quality and pull their weight.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for chemically treated hair, dry or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> the matching conditioner wasn&#x27;t strong enough to rehydrate or smooth it out!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said that while they loved the Fekkai line of hair care, this particular &amp;#34;frizz smoothing&amp;#34; was not their favorite either.  </li>
            <li> Huge bonus, the fragrance is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- lathers very well for a sulfate free shampoo&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> (Received a 2 oz complimentary sample for testing/review)</li>
            <li> keep my hair pretty short, and shampoo is shampoo, as long as it lathers up and smells nice, I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent but that is the only thing it has going for it.</li>
            <li> The price was a concern, but if the product did what it promised, it would be worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received the product complimentary from Influenster to test and review</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo and the Shea butter conditioner as a complimentary sample to use and then review.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice and it rinses out well with our low flow shower head.</li>
            <li> Shea line is my favorite, paired with the conditioner and the cream in the pot that you leave in, it&#x27;s the ultimate for glossy, ultra smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I loved that this product was able to add moisture, shine and softness without weighing down my naturally wavy hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It must clean hair very well because after the shampoo, my old perm seems to revitalize a bit, my hair seems to have more wave in it.</li>
            <li> Oddly, this shampoo feels even thicker than the corresponding conditioner, but it still smells fantastic and works great for keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li> the shower, it actually smells first as citrus, a nice brisk citrus.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a heavily fragranced product that would work best for hair that needs to be softened.</li>
            <li> hair did come out really shiny, but that is likely to be the conditioner (not Fekkai brand) binding better to really clean hair, not the shampoo.</li>
            <li> but this is my favorite line and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Thanks so very much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clean scent, but not really a scent I enjoy for shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and am so glad to find it in my local Target rather than having to hunt a salon/spa to find it.</li>
            <li> but for once I&#x27;m actually willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li> Not sure which one I like best, but currently this Shea shampoo is the one i&#x27;m using</li>
            <li> For many people, Fekkai Shea Shampoo moisturizes enough that a separate conditioner isn&#x27;t needed.</li>
            <li> The Fekkai shampoo that worked better for me is the Reparative one, in the blue bottle.</li>
            <li> I have exactly the hair type targeted for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I personally would not use it again, but my sister seems to love the product.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed about this product was the smell.</li>
            <li> The first thing I like about this shampoo is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The shampoo goes on with a very light lather so it will require a few applications to get your hair clean.  </li>
            <li> My first sniff of this bottle, and I recognized the product as very fragrant.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is a bit long, as are most shampoos you look at.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and leaves my hair squeaky clean without it feeling completely stripped.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s fragrance struck me as high quality but as too floral for many people, especially guys and anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While showering, the very first thing I noticed while I massaged a small amount of this shampoo into my short hair was the wonderful aroma of fragrant flowers mixed with tropical fruits.</li>
            <li> anti-frizz shampoos with largely negligible result.  </li>
            <li> I applied this shampoo to my head and it was pure heaven.</li>
            <li> It certainly works as a shampoo should</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The fragrance is actually pretty high quality, which the fragrance snob in me appreciates.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the Fekkai Glossing Shampoo over this Shea Shampoo but if you need to use a Shea shampoo to control frizz then this is a very good (albeit expensive) choice.</li>
            <li> You only need a little to get a great lather.  </li>
            <li> I really helps those frizzies.</li>
            <li> Now, I like fragrance, I really do, and I consider myself a bit of a fragrance snob.</li>
            <li> This shampoo scents the shower much</li>
            <li> So with some skepticism I tried Fekkai, not expecting much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my hair smooth and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t tangle as much when you comb it through.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s smoother after I wash it with a silky freshness to it and this Shea line smells really creamy and decadent.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, it&#x27;s cleansing yet non-stripping.</li>
            <li> so I need something that will help keep my hair soft, manageable, strong, and able to withstand the dry Arizona heat as well as the daily blow-drying.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in adding any more moisture to it than with other shampoos</li>
            <li> I found it rich enough to skip using conditioner.</li>
            <li> The very next thing I noticed was the rich lathery foam which this shampoo creates.</li>
            <li> Mix it up by alternting with other Fekkai shampoos.nted by jasmine and exotic florals.</li>
            <li> I normally have to use a shampoo three or four times in one setting to get a good lather and ensure my hair is clean due to my tight coils.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I have used Fekkai Products in the past and they always prove to be effective but costly.  </li>
            <li> No Frizz&amp;#34; which is my favorite and hands down</li>
            <li> It is smoother, less frizzy and has more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Overview: have mildly oily hair after 2 days without showering, tried this out as a daily shampoo bc</li>
            <li> My hair is left tangle- free and soft.</li>
            <li> I prefer a crisp, clean hair fragrance, rather than a harsh, heavy, cloying scent that invades other people&#x27;s space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Fekkai, for helping make me more presentable; for making me feel better about myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even a day later, my hair still feels clean and wonderfully soft and silky, with no</li>
            <li> Normally I use Pantene or Organix Morrocan oil or Brazilian Keratin shampoos.</li>
            <li> After about three days of this, however, I started to notice that my hair was heavier and greasier looking than normal, and it wasn&#x27;t holding curl like it normally does.</li>
            <li> This product works very well at taming frizzy hair especially in humid environments even after the first use.  </li>
            <li> - I really enjoyed how my hair would look when I would let it naturally dry overnight and then curl it the following morning.</li>
            <li> Thick and rich, the Shea shampoo is floral without being overly sweet.</li>
            <li> Clean, but not stripped of its natural oils leaving it dry.  </li>
            <li> This is very rich and only a little bit is all you need to get a rich, sudsy lather that will not strip your hair, but gently cleanses it, conditions it with real Shea oil but does NOT weigh it down.</li>
            <li> After repeated use, I found that I still had as many flyaways as other regular, cheaper shampoos any way...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was a sample because I wouldn&#x27;t want to waste my money on this!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I used Fekkai for the first time when headed on a trip because they offer their products at the local store in travel sizes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I am only using the shampoo and not a shampoo/conditioner combo, I found that while my hair was clean, I didn&#x27;t notice any extra conditioning or softness in the texture.</li>
            <li> Hands down fabulous.</li>
            <li> (I have fine, slightly past shoulder length hair that tends to fall flat quickly.)</li>
            <li> , the bottle it tiny, and the cost, large.</li>
            <li> For external use only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;Infused with pure Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> The end result is very good with your hair feeling softer and looking less dried out than with other Shampoos.  </li>
            <li> loves this shampoo, and says that it keeps her hair soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too flowery and not too &#x27;masculine.&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, but it may not be completely fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Give it a try, it&#x27;s quite concentrated so it does go far.</li>
            <li> I used both the shampoo and conditioner and was surprised at how soft and silky my hair felt.</li>
            <li> I am African-American with natural 4C type hair.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> This in itself is a feat as I have naturally curly/coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using a variety of Fekkai shampoo, conditioner and grooming products for a month now and my hair really does feels different</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as it makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a relatively expensive shampoo, but I think that many people will find the price worth it.</li>
            <li> Both are expensive, so I&#x27;ll stick with the brand I have used and loved...</li>
            <li> On the first time, I noticed yellow jackets hovering near me when I was outside.</li>
            <li> Not to sound cliche, but a little really does go a very long way with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> First time ever that has happened to me, and the only thing different ... this product.</li>
            <li> Thatâ€™s not typically the case.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo because long ago I realized the value of shea butter in hair-care products.</li>
            <li> Where I live currently it not only leaves my hair dry but brittle as well and this really works.</li>
            <li> My normal routine consists of an herbal shampoo &amp; conditioner, followed by a heat protectant / anti-frizz spray, and then a heat source (curling iron, flat iron, blow dryer, etc.).</li>
            <li> I have some wily hair, especially in the southern summers when the humidity gets high.  </li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo and coordinating conditioner exclusively and have noticed my hair looks and feels smooth for at least 3 days</li>
            <li> Apparently this Fekkai shampoo has or is something called a &amp;#34;De-Frizzer&amp;#34;, and to keep from getting the Albert Einstein look, if you have longer hair, you may want to keep it &amp;#34;De-Frizzed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for dry hair.</li>
            <li> This particular Shea shampoo, however, is not great for my type of hair: which is massive amounts of fine hair.</li>
            <li> While it took a little more effort to rinse out than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used, other than twice-the-price Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li> Weighs down my hair just enough to eliminate frizz but not too much.</li>
            <li> I tend to switch shampoos often since I can&#x27;t ever seem to find one that I absolutely cannot live without, but think I may stick with Fekkai for awhile or at least until something else catches my eye that I have to try.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly, coarse textured hair that tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> The scent is a light almost artificial floral (different from some of the more Fruity and sharp scents in other Fekkai Shampoos).  </li>
            <li> Now, that&#x27;s a good thing and a bad thing.</li>
            <li> The price is steep, but you don&#x27;t need much of their product to get the results, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It was stripped of its shine and was very flat.</li>
            <li> The fourth day I decided to wash my hair in the morning then blow dry it out.</li>
            <li> Coarse, dry hair is smoothed to fluidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water/EAU, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Xylenesulfonate,</li>
            <li> Coarse, dry hair is smoothed to fluidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Water/EAU, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Xylenesulfonate,</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I just air dry, no dryers or other hair tools, and it&#x27;s not better than the products I normally use, so far after 2 weeks use.</li>
            <li> I also have long hair and blow it dry daily</li>
            <li> I was surprised that you only needed a small amount of conditioner for it to work.</li>
            <li> Strange combination, I know,</li>
            <li> All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on a regular basis, and find I went back to my regular shampoo after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Took way too long to get and it also looks like it been around for awhile.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry and frizzy and this shampoo seemed to help add moisture and manageability while styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave hair feeling dry, but conditioner is required to remove tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I color my hair the ends are always dry and</li>
            <li> dry hair is smoothed to fluidity.&lt;br /&gt;-Tip</li>
            <li> It left my hair sort of heavy, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than other shampoos I have used in the past, but it is highly concentrated and you only need to use a little.  </li>
            <li> When you rinse your hair it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s stripped of any extra oil nor does it feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> It left my hair moisturized but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> I was even less keen on it when I realized my hair was attracting yellow jacket</li>
            <li> When I need a little extra moisture I use the shea shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Shampoo arrived leaking due to loose cap.</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B001I2GMJ2 everyday brands]] just don&#x27;t last long while the [[ASIN:B007ZC2ZMM pseudo-luxury brands]] tend to feel heavy, like they&#x27;ve coated my hair with Teflon.  </li>
            <li> My hair sat very flat even after blow drying with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I live with my sister, and we unfortunately had a very different experience with Fekkai shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use what I have left, but not sure that I will purchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> usually shampoo twice on the scalp, and I found the smell and feel similar to a salon shampoo.</li>
            <li> hair felt tiny bit softer than usual</li>
            <li> The shampoo does lather well and unlike other reviewers</li>
            <li> I was mad because I ended up with more hair loss trying to work out the tangled dried mess it turned my hair into.</li>
            <li> But if you used only a small amount with each use, and taking into consideration</li>
            <li> Mix it up by alternating with other Fekkai shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;-Expertly tames frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mix it up by alternting with other Fekkai shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I had a hard time rinsing it from my hair even with smaller amounts applied.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I couldn&#x27;t wash it out completely, and it was difficult to blow dry.</li>
            <li> I did not like this shampoo for one reason: it weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> However, in the hair it the scent settles down to a floral.</li>
            <li> I felt like it weighed down my curls instead of helping them stay bouncy.</li>
            <li> But the lather and fragrance are such a treat, it can be treated as a guilty pleasure, or used only when one feels the need for pampering.</li>
            <li> My previous shampoo did not have this effect.</li>
            <li> , itâ€™s well worth the money for those that have tried endless products that fail to contain their frizzy, unhealthy looking</li>
            <li> /&gt;But it does not clean well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell out of the bottle is nothing to write home about, but that matters little when a product works so well.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, very coarse, curly and can be frizzy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair in terms of making it softer or less frizzy but I did notice my hair being fuller than it was in the past, after a month of using it.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t expect it to repel insects or tame</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Fekkai shampoo has a very nice scent and it smells so lovely when you are working it into a lather in your hair!!  It left my hair feeling so smooth and soft.  My hair tends to be dry and frizzy and this shampoo seemed to help add moisture and manageability while styling my hair.  Overall an awesome product.  (Received a 2 oz complimentary sample for testing/review)</li>
            <li> Part of my daily curly hair regimen.  Hands down fabulous.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo hands down!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have been using for years now.  I really helps those frizzies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and am so glad to find it in my local Target rather than having to hunt a salon/spa to find it. The smell of jasmine is light and not overpowering. The shampoo leaves my hair clean and moisturized. Sometimes I don&#x27;t use the conditioner and don&#x27;t necessarily miss it.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 1 month. My hair has never been softer/shinier :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that would make it better was if it was cheaper...but can&#x27;t have everything. I plan to keep using this!</li>
            <li> I love it, the best product I found .</li>
            <li> Really love this shampoo. Weighs down my hair just enough to eliminate frizz but not too much. Makes my hair smell really good and feel noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great transaction.</li>
            <li> This product was great- as expected.  I would recommend this.  I will buy again as needed.  Thanks so very much!</li>
            <li> Simply put, this shampoo rocks! On every level, it does what we want. Great lather, addictive smell, washes off well and leaves hair soft and smelling great. Combine it with their conditioner and you&#x27;ll have a fantastic head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, plus the Amazon price is lower than the price at a salon.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, feels nice. Also leaves your hair smooth and manageable. I honestly feel like I have gotten a hot oil treatment after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo produces impressive lather, and has a pleasant, light floral fragrance.  It cleans without stripping the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does not clean well.  The first few uses are delightful, but it does not do a good job of removing styling products.  Thus, after three or four shampoos, one is left with buildup and may need to use a clarifying shampoo to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a shampoo and conditioner.  It contains no detangling agents.  It does not leave hair feeling dry, but conditioner is required to remove tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, using it is an aesthetic delight.  The shampoo does an ordinary job, at best. But the lather and fragrance are such a treat, it can be treated as a guilty pleasure, or used only when one feels the need for pampering.</li>
            <li> Five stars for Fekkai overall. In our opinion, Fekkai is the best brand for hair products out there. This particular Shea shampoo, however, is not great for my type of hair: which is massive amounts of fine hair. I think it just makes that type of hair a bit too smooth and slippery. This shampoo is so nourishing, it almost felt like shampoo and conditioner in oneâ€” but Iâ€™ve never liked that effect. My scalp seemed to get a bit oilier than usual with some build up. This shampoo might work better for hair courser than mine. Huge bonus, the fragrance is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular Fekkai Shea Shampoo is best for either once a week use (with other Fekkai shampoos like the PrX Reparatives used in between), or for coarser, drier hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless: Recommended.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell great for any hair type and it made my hair full of lice bouncy luxurious</li>
            <li> My wife snapped this right out of my shower!! I was able to use the Fekkai shampoo twice....just twice, and when I told my wife about it she went right to my bathroom, took the bottle and moved it into hers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair pretty short, and shampoo is shampoo, as long as it lathers up and smells nice, I&#x27;m good to go. Apparently this Fekkai shampoo has or is something called a &amp;#34;De-Frizzer&amp;#34;, and to keep from getting the Albert Einstein look, if you have longer hair, you may want to keep it &amp;#34;De-Frizzed&amp;#34;. This is the reason my wife robbed me of my bottle of Shea Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves this shampoo, and says that it keeps her hair soft. (Good...I hate hard hair) And if it makes her happy, then that&#x27;s all I care about. So if you need a De-Frizzer (that also lathers up and smells good) then pick this up.</li>
            <li> I did not like this shampoo for one reason: it weighed my hair down. I felt like I couldn&#x27;t wash it out completely, and it was difficult to blow dry. My hair sat very flat even after blow drying with a round brush. It smelled pretty good, and but I would not use it again.</li>
            <li> While this shampoo and conditioner is not my favorite of all time, it is still ok.  Has a nice smell and cleans well.  It is very thick though and I had a hard time rinsing it from my hair even with smaller amounts applied.  Other reviewers said that while they loved the Fekkai line of hair care, this particular &amp;#34;frizz smoothing&amp;#34; was not their favorite either.  After repeated use, I found that I still had as many flyaways as other regular, cheaper shampoos any way... I&#x27;ll use what I have left, but not sure that I will purchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compare this shampoo / conditioner to &amp;#34;Living Proof - No Frizz&amp;#34; which is my favorite and hands down, Living Proof has this brand beat for smoothing hair ESPECIALLY in humid weather.  Both are expensive, so I&#x27;ll stick with the brand I have used and loved... no more Fekkai for me.</li>
            <li> My first sniff of this bottle, and I recognized the product as very fragrant. Now, I like fragrance, I really do, and I consider myself a bit of a fragrance snob. So I feel qualified to comment on the fragrance. The product&#x27;s fragrance struck me as high quality but as too floral for many people, especially guys and anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shower, it actually smells first as citrus, a nice brisk citrus. However, in the hair it the scent settles down to a floral. The fragrance is actually pretty high quality, which the fragrance snob in me appreciates. However, since I&#x27;m not keen on florals, I wasn&#x27;t initially keen on this. I was even less keen on it when I realized my hair was attracting yellow jacket wasps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fragrance in a product that attracts flying insects? Yes. Although synthetic, the fragrance is so good that it attracts insects. Now, that&#x27;s a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing -- it&#x27;s a high quality scent. The bad thing -- you will find flying insects near you and in your hair in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product twice. On the first time, I noticed yellow jackets hovering near me when I was outside. On the second time, I combed my fingers through my hair and I was stung. I was able to react quickly and minimize the pain &amp; inflammation, but I was stung because there was a wasp in my hair. First time ever that has happened to me, and the only thing different ... this product. I stopped using this product and no yellow jackets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you&#x27;re probably thinking, that was a fluke. And, it may have been. I don&#x27;t like the floral scent, so let me deduct 1 star for that and nothing for the wasp sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to product performance ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Shea Shampoo and Conditioner in combination. The shampoo is rich and lathers nicely. The conditioner is thick and indulgent. I would say that my hair felt softer to the touch after use. However, in the depth of summer I really need something to quell the frizzies, and this product surprisingly did not do that for me. So, I&#x27;ll deduct another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a heavily fragranced product that would work best for hair that needs to be softened. However, don&#x27;t expect it to repel insects or tame frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** I received the product in exchange for honest review &amp; candid opinion.

            <li> Promises of top quality kept! Moisturizing and cleansing power with the quality results you expect from the Fekkai product line.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for chemically treated hair, dry or coarse hair. This is very rich and only a little bit is all you need to get a rich, sudsy lather that will not strip your hair, but gently cleanses it, conditions it with real Shea oil but does NOT weigh it down. When you rinse your hair it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s stripped of any extra oil nor does it feel weighed down. It is like a very expensive salon shampoo at much less the cost. I very highly recommend it and I will be a repeat buyer-I&#x27;m hooked. As I color my hair the ends are always dry and the roots oily&#x3D;this is perfect!</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance of this shampoo. It&#x27;s not too flowery and not too &#x27;masculine.&#x27; When I shampoo, the scent makes the whole shower smell nice, but does not leave a smell on my hair. I&#x27;ve tried those tablets that you put into the shower and they dissolve to release a scent but I am disappointed in them. This shampoo scents the shower much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must clean hair very well because after the shampoo, my old perm seems to revitalize a bit, my hair seems to have more wave in it. My previous shampoo did not have this effect. However, I believe this shampoo might take some of the color out, or maybe the color was coming to the end of its effectiveness anyway. This is the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, but it may not be completely fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did come out really shiny, but that is likely to be the conditioner (not Fekkai brand) binding better to really clean hair, not the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have some wily hair, especially in the southern summers when the humidity gets high.  And I&#x27;ve been through all the supermarket and salon anti-frizz shampoos with largely negligible result.  The [[ASIN:B001I2GMJ2 everyday brands]] just don&#x27;t last long while the [[ASIN:B007ZC2ZMM pseudo-luxury brands]] tend to feel heavy, like they&#x27;ve coated my hair with Teflon.  So with some skepticism I tried Fekkai, not expecting much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually really impressed.  While it took a little more effort to rinse out than other shampoos I&#x27;ve used, other than twice-the-price Paul Mitchell it&#x27;s the only one that has truly kept my crazy hair in check after a 16-hour day.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly, coarse textured hair that tends to be dry. I like products made with shea because I can really use the moisturizing, even though it may be heavy for some hair types. Normally I use Pantene or Organix Morrocan oil or Brazilian Keratin shampoos. I have never used Fekkai brand hair care before so I looked forward to trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is a nice texture and I didn&#x27;t require a lot to shampoo -- maybe about a quarter sized dollop for my hair that is mid-back length and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually shampoo twice on the scalp, and I found the smell and feel similar to a salon shampoo. It smells nice -- a lot like you&#x27;d expect at a salon--not to strong but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am only using the shampoo and not a shampoo/conditioner combo, I found that while my hair was clean, I didn&#x27;t notice any extra conditioning or softness in the texture. I just air dry, no dryers or other hair tools, and it&#x27;s not better than the products I normally use, so far after 2 weeks use.</li>
            <li> Thick and rich, the Shea shampoo is floral without being overly sweet. I found it rich enough to skip using conditioner. It left my hair smooth and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> Overview: have mildly oily hair after 2 days without showering, tried this out as a daily shampoo bc it was sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- lathers very well for a sulfate free shampoo&lt;br /&gt;- smells good&lt;br /&gt;- creamy and hydrating&lt;br /&gt;- hair felt tiny bit softer than usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- not a lot of product&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s good but doesn&#x27;t do any miracles (got it in attempt to save hair from damage, didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement after using this shampoo)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo as it leaves my hair soft and silky while feeling wonderfully clean and looking really healthy.  I had tried the Apple Cider one in this line which takes all the harsh chemicals that build up from terrible water.  This Shea Butter does a great job of adding much needed moisture to the hair and making it smooth so it doesn&#x27;t tangle as much when you comb it through.  I also love the fragrance which is light.  I&#x27;m really picky with shampoo as my scalp dries out really easily with the cheaper ones but this one is actually repairing everything.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair and I&#x27;ve noticed that this actually does quench my hair. Where I live currently it not only leaves my hair dry but brittle as well and this really works. I just wished that it came in a bigger bottle for the price but for once I&#x27;m actually willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li> Not to sound cliche, but a little really does go a very long way with this shampoo.  I use a small amount and get maximum suds.  The conditioner and mask for this set are gone, and I still have over a third of this shampoo left.  I can&#x27;t quite tell how well the shampoo moisturizes, but I do like using it in conjunction with the conditioner and mask.  It&#x27;s gentle and leaves my hair squeaky clean without it feeling completely stripped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special. Expensive for what it is. Shampoo arrived leaking due to loose cap.</li>
            <li> I do not use a ton of products in my hair, so I usually make sure the products that I do choose to use are of good quality and pull their weight. My normal routine consists of an herbal shampoo &amp; conditioner, followed by a heat protectant / anti-frizz spray, and then a heat source (curling iron, flat iron, blow dryer, etc.). That is it. When I change shampoos or products, I can tell instantly what impact they have on my hair. I have greasy hair, so I wash it every 24 hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I began using this product - I&#x27;m just over 1/2 way done with it - I really enjoyed how my hair would look when I would let it naturally dry overnight and then curl it the following morning. After about three days of this, however, I started to notice that my hair was heavier and greasier looking than normal, and it wasn&#x27;t holding curl like it normally does. The fourth day I decided to wash my hair in the morning then blow dry it out. That was pretty fantastic looking, and I&#x27;ve kept doing that. It seems that the overall heat and brushing helps to get the oils all over my hair more so than just letting it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the build-up issue, I&#x27;m pleased with the product. The ingredient list is a bit long, as are most shampoos you look at. The smell is great and lingers but not in a sickly-perfume type way. Would recommend to purchase once or twice per year to change things up.</li>
            <li> I have used Fekkai Products in the past and they always prove to be effective but costly.  The Fekkai Essential Shea Shampoo is no different.  The scent is a light almost artificial floral (different from some of the more Fruity and sharp scents in other Fekkai Shampoos).  The shampoo goes on with a very light lather so it will require a few applications to get your hair clean.  The end result is very good with your hair feeling softer and looking less dried out than with other Shampoos.  This product works very well at taming frizzy hair especially in humid environments even after the first use.  I do prefer the Fekkai Glossing Shampoo over this Shea Shampoo but if you need to use a Shea shampoo to control frizz then this is a very good (albeit expensive) choice.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo because long ago I realized the value of shea butter in hair-care products. When I first used this shampoo, I noted it felt richer and seemed to suds-up to the perfect degree. My baby-fine hair doesn&#x27;t actually frizz, so that isn&#x27;t a problem with me. More often my problem is it tends to flyaway and look wind-blown. But no longer... Fekkai tamed it... :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I like this shampoo is because it&#x27;s delightfully scented by jasmine and exotic florals. I prefer a crisp, clean hair fragrance, rather than a harsh, heavy, cloying scent that invades other people&#x27;s space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Fekkai, for helping make me more presentable; for making me feel better about myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Betty Dravis, July 20, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Author of &amp;#34;1106 Grand Boulevard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  You only need a little to get a great lather.  Contrary to another reviewer, I did not find this overly fragrant at all, but rather a nice, soft scent.  I do not like perfumey smells, so this is perfect.  My hair is frizzy but also gets oily if I dont wash daily.  Strange combination, I know, but that&#x27;s my hair.  I also have long hair and blow it dry daily so I need something that will help keep my hair soft, manageable, strong, and able to withstand the dry Arizona heat as well as the daily blow-drying.  I&#x27;ve purchased salon products at the twice the price of Fekkai with the same or similar results.  That means they work well!  The Fekkai shea shampoo and conditioner are a great combination for keeping my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried the Fekkai glossing shampoo/conditioner and I really liked that as well.  Not sure which one I like best, but currently this Shea shampoo is the one i&#x27;m using and I love it.  I tend to switch shampoos often since I can&#x27;t ever seem to find one that I absolutely cannot live without, but think I may stick with Fekkai for awhile or at least until something else catches my eye that I have to try.  Yeah, I&#x27;m kind of fickle like that.</li>
            <li> I loved that this product was able to add moisture, shine and softness without weighing down my naturally wavy hair! I loved the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fekkai hair products for about a decade and this is one of the company&#x27;s best shampoos. If you&#x27;re looking for a shampoo that&#x27;s excellent at conditioning then this is a great choice. For many people, Fekkai Shea Shampoo moisturizes enough that a separate conditioner isn&#x27;t needed. Of course for maximum softness and manageability, a standalone conditioner should be used. Most days, this shampoo is more than enough. It leaves hair very soft and manageable, imparting a pleasant floral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price will be a concern for people that are used to shampoos from the grocery or supermarket. Yes, this is a relatively expensive shampoo, but I think that many people will find the price worth it. It&#x27;s great for an everyday shampoo and especially excellent for when you&#x27;re in a rush and don&#x27;t have time for conditioning.</li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair in terms of making it softer or less frizzy but I did notice my hair being fuller than it was in the past, after a month of using it. (I have fine, slightly past shoulder length hair that tends to fall flat quickly.) The shampoo does lather well and unlike other reviewers I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it not rinsing off cleanly. My only issue with it is that my hair was not any softer. The Fekkai shampoo that worked better for me is the Reparative one, in the blue bottle.</li>
            <li> I was sent a 2oz sample from Influenster. I have exactly the hair type targeted for this shampoo. It has a nice scent but that is the only thing it has going for it. It didn&#x27;t lather or rinse clean. It made my hair tangle and the matching conditioner wasn&#x27;t strong enough to rehydrate or smooth it out! I was mad because I ended up with more hair loss trying to work out the tangled dried mess it turned my hair into. This did nothing good for my hair. I&#x27;m glad it was a sample because I wouldn&#x27;t want to waste my money on this! I found so many better salon brand shampoos. I will stick to those in the future</li>
            <li> Great for really dry brittle sun bleached hair. This product line is exceptional and I equally love the shea and the glossing shampoo. When I need a little extra moisture I use the shea shampoo and conditioner. My hair just smells and feels so great after using this product. May cost more then others out there and I do have cheaper products I alternate with but this is my favorite line and worth the extra cost. Give it a try, it&#x27;s quite concentrated so it does go far. Love this!</li>
            <li> While showering, the very first thing I noticed while I massaged a small amount of this shampoo into my short hair was the wonderful aroma of fragrant flowers mixed with tropical fruits. The very next thing I noticed was the rich lathery foam which this shampoo creates. It actually did feel \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; and I was liking it. Afterwards I saw that it is full of unpronounceable chemicals so that was a downer but the good thing is that my hair felt clean and softer than before, hence the 4 stars. I just wish that haircare products would eliminate the chemicals already, I mean just how did humans wash their hair  100 years ago??</li>
            <li> I jumped at the chance to try FEKKAI ESSENTIAL SHEA SHAMPOO 8 FL OZ. My daughter has thick, course, frizzy hair. We are always on the lookout for a product to help tame her uncontrollable hair. The price was a concern, but if the product did what it promised, it would be worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use with the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed a huge difference in my daughterâ€™s hair. Wow! Her hair was shinny, silky smooth, and the frizzy was contained to an astonishing amount. I used both the shampoo and conditioner and was surprised at how soft and silky my hair felt. I too have frizzy, course hair, and the FEKKAI products made it as though I didnâ€™t. Even a day later, my hair still feels clean and wonderfully soft and silky, with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell out of the bottle is nothing to write home about, but that matters little when a product works so well. I was surprised that you only needed a small amount of conditioner for it to work. Thatâ€™s not typically the case. The shampoo lathers up, great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the bottle it tiny, and the cost, large. But if you used only a small amount with each use, and taking into consideration how well it works, itâ€™s well worth the money for those that have tried endless products that fail to contain their frizzy, unhealthy looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Infused with pure Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;-Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.&lt;br /&gt;-Indulgent cleansing experience leaves hair feeling smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;-Coarse, dry hair is smoothed to fluidity.&lt;br /&gt;-Tip from the Fekkai Salon: Use your fingers to massage scalp for the ultimate, invigorating experience.

            <li> Oddly, this shampoo feels even thicker than the corresponding conditioner, but it still smells fantastic and works great for keeping my hair soft. If you can get used to the thickness of it, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I live with my sister, and we unfortunately had a very different experience with Fekkai shampoo &amp; conditioner. Considering the rather steep price, I was expecting this to perform a miracle on my hair, but it didn&#x27;t. My hair was actually in worse condition after using this. It was stripped of its shine and was very flat. However, it worked wonders on my sister&#x27;s hair. I was shocked when her hair looked extremely shiny and voluminous after one wash! I&#x27;m not sure what the difference was. My sister has thick, dark virgin hair. I have thinner, blonde, color-treated hair. I suppose that is something to note if you&#x27;re thinking about buying this. My guess is that it works better on thicker, coarser hair. I personally would not use it again, but my sister seems to love the product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this shampoo from Influenster and I love the way it keeps my hair hydrated and looking shiny and healthy, would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed about this product was the smell. so yummy. and then the actual texture of the product, it looked so shiny. I applied this shampoo to my head and it was pure heaven. The shampoo felt so silky it was the best feeling Ive had from a shampoo in my life! I almost didn&#x27;t want to rinse it out, but the silky feeling and invigorating feeling was still there! I have received this product for free from Influenster and to give my honest review</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.  It smells like a mixture of cherries and jasmine.  I was impressed with how much and how quickly it lathered. I am African-American with natural 4C type hair. I normally have to use a shampoo three or four times in one setting to get a good lather and ensure my hair is clean due to my tight coils.&lt;br /&gt;With this shampoo, I only needed to use it once (although I used it twice because I loved the scent). After I rinsed my hair smelled great and was squeaky clean. I followed with the Essential Shea conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and my honest review. I will definitely buy it once my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> I have never used Fekkai until I tried this line. I was immediately impressed with the rich creamy formula and the smell. I have curly long hair and always use shea shampoos/conditioners and this one is great. It left my hair moisturized but not weighed down. It wasn&#x27;t as effective for frizz as I would&#x27;ve liked, but it is still a really nice moisturizing shampoo/conditioner combo. Would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product complimentary from Influenster to test and review</li>
            <li> I received this as complimentary for testing purposes and love it!  The fragrance is very nicer and my hair feels very clean after rinsing the product out.  I would definitely recommend to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this shampoo and conditioner in a free sample box, and let me tell you, the freebie worked, they&#x27;ve got me hooked.  The scent is light and lovely jasmine, and the shampoo itself is so moisturizing I almost felt like I didn&#x27;t need to use the conditioner.  I have curly hair, so of course I still did, but wow. The consistency of the shampoo itself is somewhere between shampoo and conditioner, so its very rich.  Good for combating winter dryness.  Highly recommend for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo and the Shea butter conditioner as a complimentary sample to use and then review.  My hair is very thick and with age (over 40) has gotten very dry.  The shampoo has a nice smell and lathered up nicely. I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in adding any more moisture to it than with other shampoos but I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, very coarse, curly and can be frizzy. I&#x27;ve been using the same shampoo for a while now and am happy with that product. This was a change up for me. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have too strong a smell, nor is it too flowery. It&#x27;s very clean scent, but not really a scent I enjoy for shampoo. It left my hair sort of heavy, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product on a regular basis. I felt like it weighed down my curls instead of helping them stay bouncy. It left my hair feeling nice and silky, which I enjoyed.  All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on a regular basis, and find I went back to my regular shampoo after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I receive this product as part of a sampling program and well because of that I was doubtful. After using the shampoo for a month, I&#x27;m happy to say this is a great shampoo. My hair is left tangle- free and soft. This in itself is a feat as I have naturally curly/coarse hair. I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with the Shea Conditioner from Fekkai.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband to use and he definitely prefers it to the basic shampoos he has been using.  The smell is nice and it rinses out well with our low flow shower head.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the way it makes my hair feel and behave.</li>
            <li> Took way too long to get and it also looks like it been around for awhile.</li>
            <li> Although, the name appears the same, its not the same product as what I was purchasing from Nordstrom&#x27;s. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> The first thing I like about this shampoo is the fragrance. It boasts \\&quot;jasmine and exotic florals.\\&quot; It smells nice without being overpowering and the lovely fragrance stays in my hair after washing, which I prefer. It only takes a little bit to wash my hair. As I am frugal at heart, this should last me quite a while and stretch my pennies. I have used this shampoo and coordinating conditioner exclusively and have noticed my hair looks and feels smooth for at least 3 days and then I wash my hair anyway. I do recommend this product.    **UPDATE: This shampoo lasted me 6 months. I just used the last of it today. I typically wash my hair at least 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I love Fekkai&#x27;s products (or most of them).  This is an amazing shampoo!  I cannot say enough about it.  I used Fekkai for the first time when headed on a trip because they offer their products at the local store in travel sizes.  I fell in love.  First, I was in love with the scent-a true amazing smelling, fresh from the salon scent!  Next, I loved the suds and the way it made my hair feel.  Clean, but not stripped of its natural oils leaving it dry.  Last, it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel brittle or as though it would break in the shower.  I always follow with Fekkai conditioner (so I cannot say how this would act alone).  The price is steep, but you don&#x27;t need much of their product to get the results, a little goes a long way.  Did I mention how amazing this smells?</li>
            <li> It certainly works as a shampoo should but there was nothing outstanding in my opinion to get me wanting to stick with this product.  I will use up what I have but honestly I have Suave natural with shea and I like it just as well if not better.  Obviously a cost savings too.</li>
            <li> I have been using a variety of Fekkai shampoo, conditioner and grooming products for a month now and my hair really does feels different, it&#x27;s smoother after I wash it with a silky freshness to it and this Shea line smells really creamy and decadent. If you are a big jasmine lover then this is the item for you. Scent wise, this is Jasmine in a bottle with a touch of creamy shea which is nutty and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea line is my favorite, paired with the conditioner and the cream in the pot that you leave in, it&#x27;s the ultimate for glossy, ultra smooth hair. The shampoo itself is creamy and thick in color and it looks like pale banana pudding. My hair grew a lot this summer and this shampoo let it stay tangle free and moisturized even though I braid it a lot and often twist it in a bun at work, very nice indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this with matching conditioner which does a great job of making the hair manageable and silky.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple of months.  The bottle is smaller than other shampoos I have used in the past, but it is highly concentrated and you only need to use a little.  It has a nice smell and  it rinses easily.  I have definitely noticed a difference in the appearance and texture of my hair since I began using Fekkai Essential Shea Shampoo.  It is smoother, less frizzy and has more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do like the shampoo, I would find it difficult to pay $15 for an 8 oz bottle.  I would consider purchasing this shampoo if the price was lower.</li>
            <li> This product is so effective and efficient. I&#x27;ve used it for the first time today, and i already see amazing results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as it makes my hair feel so soft. My hair dress he asked what I was using told him this product, with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> An excellent shampoo that makes your hair clean and healthy and smells great too. It cleans deeply without damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, it&#x27;s cleansing yet non-stripping. I have super curly,dense,dry type 3b/c curls. My hair felt moisturized which is usually hard for a shampoo to do on it&#x27;s own. Impressed.</li>
