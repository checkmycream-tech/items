            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>

            <li>i used the crece pelo rinse after just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair has never come out better at a salon.</li>
            <li>I bought Silicon Max along with this conditioner to use in conjunction and it has just as many fillers in it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li>love love love. .</li>
            <li>If you have any kind of thermal keratin treatment, you should certainly stay away from this</li>
            <li>This product made my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Parabens have been linked to cancer, this is precisely why they are banned in Europe.</li>
            <li>If this is not a problem for you, then you will definitely enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I tried it 1-month ago and its fantastic.</li>
            <li>my hair was silky and tangled free.</li>
            <li>Kanechom chocolate really transformed my hair into sexy healthy hair.</li>
            <li>its worth the price!</li>
            <li>smells good and has a semi or medium consistency its a lot in the container I will be using regular</li>
            <li>I decided to use this straighten my 3 C, 4 a natural coily curly hair so that I could give my hair a nice trim.</li>
            <li>Plus, when I touched it I had to do a double take in the mirror to make sure I was touching my hair and not something else.</li>
            <li>By far this is the only conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever used where I was able to notice really good results after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair loves this conditioner, it leaves my hair shiny, soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, it left my hair so soft and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>you can feel the difference right away</li>
            <li>And Olson come right on time.</li>
            <li>My hair was sooo soft, yet strong.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soooo very silky, strong, bouncy, shiny, and easy to style and no hair fell out.</li>
            <li>,it was so easy with barely any breakage...like five strands!!</li>
            <li>first time i used it, I did my shampoo and then put this product in.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I used, along with silicone mix, that helped my hair untangle</li>
            <li>I relaxed my hair and used the Joico K-Pak Protein Reconstructor first (not that it matters).</li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING THESE FROM ME, all I ask is for $25 via paypal.</li>
            <li>My name is Summer, email me at indiansummer121@cox.net if you are interested.</li>
            <li>Softens new growth and keeps my ends super moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I pretty much despise the product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft full of body</li>
            <li>Only way I could get a comb easily through my hair</li>
            <li>Conditioning was great but for the few extra bucks I rather stick with Kanechom Karite&#x27;&#x27; butter.</li>
            <li>and it really mosturises my hair</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m relaxed hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t really tangle).</li>
            <li>and my hair was very shiny too.</li>
            <li>I want to use the whole line now.</li>
            <li>I heard so much about this line (used w/ Silicon Mix) on YouTube, so I had to try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I will be using a Keratin Treatment on my hair very soon.</li>
            <li>Overall, Kanechom Chocolate is good product, just be careful with the temperature that you use to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>I have blonde, naturally wavy hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>I used it as a prepoo with natural hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair felt strong yet it was breaking and was very dry.</li>
            <li>I attached three pictures before I straightened it, Straight with the Kanechom and Now; with my new curl pattern.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I typically try to stay away from products that have so many fillers in it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this last week and it arrived in the mail very fast!</li>
            <li>Although my hair feels soft, it felt just as softer before WITH my curls and with other and much more simpler products.  </li>
            <li>Immediately my fingers slipped through my new grow like butter with no tangling.</li>
            <li>now have a virtually new 32 oz Kanechom chocolate treatment and 16oz silicon mix treatment that I have no use for.</li>
            <li>My hair felt VERY soft after I rinsed this stuff out.</li>
            <li>I still tried it, and yes it makes your hair very soft, manageable and</li>
            <li>But my hair shedding and breakage was way more than usual.</li>
            <li>The container doesn&#x27;t even give you enough information to purchase it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>It is now a 4 C/3 C/B, it is still curly and pretty, but it is so fragile.</li>
            <li>I used it on some really old wigs and it made them soft and new looking again</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and silky...</li>
            <li>My Aunt used this product on my 4a/b natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I would not reccomend this to anyone who is natural.  </li>
            <li>Probably really for only relaxed users.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair is now completely altered.</li>
            <li>wow. ..</li>
            <li>Only complaint is the jar is kind of flimsy</li>
            <li>I can blow dry my hair and be just fine with a blow dry ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to my curls being pretty defined even without any product and this almost made my hair straight as it it had been blow dried except it had tons of frizz.</li>
            <li>I am so distracted I can barely work!</li>
            <li>A few more down its has methylparaben/proplyparaben; meaning it just has fillers in it along with the silicones.</li>
            <li>I have short soft natural curls,  It dried out my hair and curls was very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I used a flat iron afterwards and my hair looked professionally done.</li>
            <li>My hair dried so well and fast!</li>
            <li>When I am in between relaxers I add in a little silicon mix for extra slip and it softens my new growth like no other.  </li>

            <li> However, when i flat ironed my hair, it was silky.</li>
            <li> I flat ironed and wrapped it for the night.</li>
            <li> I did not put the flat iron on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;d have to be pretty incompetent to not know how to use conditioner.</li>
            <li> i detangled my dry hair, and put this product on my hair.</li>
            <li> since the product does have hydrolyzed wheat protein in it (maybe thats what made my hair dry?)</li>
            <li> So I used this product on my hair transitioning from relaxed to natural hair which is very long and thick.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave this product only 4 stars and not five is because it was a little difficult to wash out, I had straight hair for weeks.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> , I use it before conditioner in the morning, comb my hair and in the afternoon wash my hair, dry it and iron it, and u can&#x27;t believe how shinny and silky it is!!!</li>
            <li> The only annoying thing is that it is so light and bouncy that it blows at any gust of wind</li>
            <li> I understand that it is hard to get way from ingredients such as these but taking small steps to decrease your usage is key.</li>
            <li> so it was crushed a little on the side.</li>
            <li> This morning I took it down and my jaw dropped.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to comb it down - it just fell.</li>
            <li> After a few days of massaging my hair with oils my hair got straighter on</li>
            <li> Its thick yet a little soupy.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell that causes me to have headaches and while I heard it&#x27;s suppose to bring out your curls, it totally frizzed mine and made my head just look like a bush.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little weird, it&#x27;s almost sour..</li>
            <li> The reason why I&#x27;m now writing this review is due to my terrible first experience with it:&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> Seriously I will never apply relaxer to my hair again...</li>
            <li> but it has VERY dangerous ingredients if used long term.</li>
            <li> Products that contain mineral oils/petroleum and parabens are NOT GOOD FOR THIS!</li>
            <li> Sorry, did not work for me</li>
            <li> When you wash your hair it will wash the Keratin out as well thus making the treatment useless.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t terribly impress until I went to blew it dry.</li>
            <li> So now I have hair fall like crazy</li>
            <li> so I have to kept shaking it (and end up being THAT annoying girl).</li>
            <li> I hate throwing things out when I know someone could get some use out of them.</li>
            <li> I bought it just to try and it didn&#x27;t fail the test!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is insane.</li>

            <li> This works great you can feel the difference right away I used it on some really old wigs and it made them soft and new looking again</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly well on my relaxed hair!!! Softens new growth and keeps my ends super moisturized.  I always sit under heat for 15 mins or longer, and use it mixed with coconut oil.  When I am in between relaxers I add in a little silicon mix for extra slip and it softens my new growth like no other.  Only way I could get a comb easily through my hair 10 weeks post relaxer.  Get it...you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this product. Super Moisturizing for my 4B relaxed hair, melts away tangles, smells delish!!  Also to mention speedy delivery (ordered 15 May 2010 arrived 17 May 2010)</li>
            <li> I bought it just to try and it didn&#x27;t fail the test!!! the smell is amazing!!! and it really mosturises my hair, I use it before conditioner in the morning, comb my hair and in the afternoon wash my hair, dry it and iron it, and u can&#x27;t believe how shinny and silky it is!!! next day at job every body ask me if I had keratin in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far the Best conditioner I&#x27;ve Ever tried for my hair. I have 4a long thick fine somewhat dry hair. My hair loves this conditioner, it leaves my hair shiny, soft and healthy looking. The smell is sweet, the texture is smooth and I want to order More but its unavailable !! Please bring this product back!!! It&#x27;s costly but you pay for what you get!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I like the slip that allows easier detangling but I&#x27;s put off a bit by the smell.</li>
            <li> smells good and has a semi or medium consistency its a lot in the container I will be using regular</li>
            <li> Great quantity for the price! I love the way it conditions my hair! Only complaint is the jar is kind of flimsy so it was crushed a little on the side. Other than that its worth the price!</li>
            <li> I ordered this conditioner from Amazon on a whim. I&#x27;m glad I did! This is perfect for my extensions which I dye a lot so I need to replenish the moisture with conditioner. By far this is the only conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever used where I was able to notice really good results after the first treatment. This brand has a customer for life. The only downside is the instructions are in a different language but you&#x27;d have to be pretty incompetent to not know how to use conditioner. I approve of this product.</li>
            <li> okay... so i ordered this product about 4-5 months ago. The reason why I&#x27;m now writing this review is due to my terrible first experience with it:&lt;br /&gt;the first time i used it, I did my shampoo and then put this product in. i put a conditioning cap on and left it on my hair for 45 minutes. When i went to rinse it out, my hair was so tangled! (I&#x27;m relaxed hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t really tangle). My hair felt strong yet it was breaking and was very dry. However, when i flat ironed my hair, it was silky. But my hair shedding and breakage was way more than usual. i was debating whether or not to throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, 4 months later, i decided to give it a try again and i LOVEDDDD IT. i detangled my dry hair, and put this product on my hair. i put my plastic cap on and sat under the dryer for 30 minutes. My hair was sooo soft, yet strong. since the product does have hydrolyzed wheat protein in it (maybe thats what made my hair dry?) i used the crece pelo rinse after just to be sure. my hair came out beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i definately recommend this product. test it out and see what works for you.</li>
            <li> Excelente product.I love it. And Olson come right on time. Definitely I recommend this product. C</li>
            <li> This product made my hair silky smooth. I have blonde, naturally wavy hair that tangles easily. This is the first product I used, along with silicone mix, that helped my hair untangle and my hair was very shiny too.</li>
            <li> I have short soft natural curls,  It dried out my hair and curls was very frizzy.  Sorry, did not work for me</li>
            <li> Very nice smell but don&#x27;t t think it works best on ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> My sister tried it on her hair and it looked great! I had to try it on mine. I love it. Both my daughters are using it now.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, it moisturizes my hair, it helps to bring my curl pattern out.. I have like a 4c texture, and I&#x27;m transitioning, it helps with the detangling... The smell is a little weird, it&#x27;s almost sour..</li>
            <li> So I used this product on my hair transitioning from relaxed to natural hair which is very long and thick. I washed my hair and mixed a portion of this product with silicon mix then applied it to my hair and left it on for 30 minutes. Immediately my fingers slipped through my new grow like butter with no tangling. I washed and styled my hair ,it was so easy with barely any breakage...like five strands!! Seriously I will never apply relaxer to my hair again...you couldn&#x27;t pay me. If your hair is damaged or your trying to transition this is the product to use. My hair is so soft and silky...I want to use the whole line now. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this line (used w/ Silicon Mix) on YouTube, so I had to try it. I relaxed my hair and used the Joico K-Pak Protein Reconstructor first (not that it matters). So, after protein you have to balance with moisture (enter Kanechom). I mixed 2 parts Kanechom Chocolate Conditioning Cream with 1 part Silicon Mix and let it sit while my protein was setting in. My hair felt VERY soft after I rinsed this stuff out. I wasn&#x27;t terribly impress until I went to blew it dry. OMG! My hair dried so well and fast! Plus, when I touched it I had to do a double take in the mirror to make sure I was touching my hair and not something else. I flat ironed and wrapped it for the night. This morning I took it down and my jaw dropped. Salon results. I didn&#x27;t even have to comb it down - it just fell. My hair has never come out better at a salon. I am so distracted I can barely work! lol. I feels amazing. The only annoying thing is that it is so light and bouncy that it blows at any gust of wind so I have to kept shaking it (and end up being THAT annoying girl). lol</li>
            <li> I prefer the Karite&#x27; Butter over the chocolate. Conditioning was great but for the few extra bucks I rather stick with Kanechom Karite&#x27;&#x27; butter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last week and it arrived in the mail very fast! I am happy with the seller, great service! When I opened the product and saw the consistency...I was a bit disheartened. Its thick yet a little soupy. I dabbed my finger and rubbed the product in my hand. A bit waxy! I then looked at the ingredient list and the second ingredient is Mineral oil. A few more down its has methylparaben/proplyparaben; meaning it just has fillers in it along with the silicones. Dammit! I bought Silicon Max along with this conditioner to use in conjunction and it has just as many fillers in it. I still tried it, and yes it makes your hair very soft, manageable and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I will be using a Keratin Treatment on my hair very soon. Products that contain mineral oils/petroleum and parabens are NOT GOOD FOR THIS! The mineral oils/petroleum coats the hair shaft causing build up. When you wash your hair it will wash the Keratin out as well thus making the treatment useless. Secondly, I typically try to stay away from products that have so many fillers in it. Parabens have been linked to cancer, this is precisely why they are banned in Europe. I understand that it is hard to get way from ingredients such as these but taking small steps to decrease your usage is key. If this is not a problem for you, then you will definitely enjoy this product. If you have any kind of thermal keratin treatment, you should certainly stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a virtually new 32 oz Kanechom chocolate treatment and 16oz silicon mix treatment that I have no use for. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING THESE FROM ME, all I ask is for $25 via paypal. That includes USPS shipping with order confirmation. My name is Summer, email me at indiansummer121@cox.net if you are interested. I can send pics if need be. I hate throwing things out when I know someone could get some use out of them. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, it left my hair so soft and it smells nice. I mixed with the silicone mix as recommended by another consumer and it made my hair look amazing. I used a flat iron afterwards and my hair looked professionally done. I was amazed with the results. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Even though its unavailable on AMAZON SINCE FOREVER. I tried it 1-month ago and its fantastic. The smell is insane. I really enjoyed the smell. It left my hair soooo very silky, strong, bouncy, shiny, and easy to style and no hair fell out. My hair is in the best condition ever. Kanechom is  the best Brazilian hair care product ever made. Please AMAZON, please stock this item back up. I know I&#x27;m not the only fan of this product. Kanechom chocolate really transformed my hair into sexy healthy hair. I wish i can order it now on AMAZON&gt;</li>
            <li> My Aunt used this product on my 4a/b natural hair.  I pretty much despise the product.  It has a weird smell that causes me to have headaches and while I heard it&#x27;s suppose to bring out your curls, it totally frizzed mine and made my head just look like a bush.  I&#x27;m used to my curls being pretty defined even without any product and this almost made my hair straight as it it had been blow dried except it had tons of frizz. Although my hair feels soft, it felt just as softer before WITH my curls and with other and much more simpler products.  The container doesn&#x27;t even give you enough information to purchase it in the first place.  I would not reccomend this to anyone who is natural.  Probably really for only relaxed users.  Never again.</li>
            <li> I do like Kanechom Chocolate. I decided to use this straighten my 3 C, 4 a natural coily curly hair so that I could give my hair a nice trim. I wanted to use a product with cones; including silicon mix to give my curls protection I did not put the flat iron on the highest setting. It gave my hair a shake, you know that gorgeous shake. I don&#x27;t think I ever had that before so it was kind of awesome. After a few days of massaging my hair with oils my hair got straighter on it&#x27;s own. The reason why I gave this product only 4 stars and not five is because it was a little difficult to wash out, I had straight hair for weeks. After, several washes and a apple cider vinegar rinse my hair finally curled again. However, my hair is now completely altered. It is now a 4 C/3 C/B, it is still curly and pretty, but it is so fragile.So now I have hair fall like crazy and I think I comprised the strength and thickness, by straightening it. I attached three pictures before I straightened it, Straight with the Kanechom and Now; with my new curl pattern. It&#x27;s been a hair adventure but I not giving up. Overall, Kanechom Chocolate is good product, just be careful with the temperature that you use to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> Works great but it has VERY dangerous ingredients if used long term. I stopped using for that reason but if it was safer I would have stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the life this conditioner has given my hair!😍😊 it&#x27;s so soft full of body I don&#x27;t have to put a lot of heat in my hair.. I can blow dry my hair and be just fine with a blow dry ..wow. ..love love love. .</li>
            <li> I heard of this conditioner on U Tube, I was looking for videos on Dominican hair products. A user suggest using it with silcon mix. I used it as a prepoo with natural hot oil treatment. I loved the end results my hair was silky and tangled free. Will purchase again.</li>
