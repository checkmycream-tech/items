            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing tinted sunscreen for your face that just makes it glow!  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin with blonde/grey hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned: NW20.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I ran out, this one is even better.</li>
            <li>The color is great, if you are more fair just use a very sm amount and the color will be perfect.</li>
            <li>Super good, just great</li>
            <li>this product is amazing protection and coverage in one.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just perfect for my complexion, not to mention that it really protects it from the sun.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice tint/glow</li>
            <li>it gives you a youthful and healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Now they have thickened it to be more like a foundation</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is a 50 proof and tinted.  </li>
            <li>Along with retina a, healthy diet, and exercise, these sunscreens are truly the beauty fountain of youth.  </li>
            <li>A perfect &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; for me, though I wish I&#x27;d starting using this in my 20s!</li>
            <li>It makes skin feel very hydrated with a great coverage to provide evening skin tone.</li>
            <li>what-so-ever on my face I gave Bioderma a try &amp; couldn&#x27;t be more happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, but the &amp;#34;Light Tint&amp;#34; made me look like a ghost; the &amp;#34;dark tint&amp;#34; was just right.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin with pink undertones and this provides the perfect balance</li>
            <li>and it is easy to re-apply without messing up my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I freckle easily and use anti-acne products</li>
            <li>The combination of a matte light foundation and this give my skin a smooth healthy and glowy look.</li>
            <li>The shade is perfect, not too dark, and I can wear it instead of foundation.</li>
            <li>It is way darker than the Brazilian one, but I mix it with another 50 SPF light cream</li>
            <li>so I blend it with a light foundation and voila:</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I found a tinted day cream that works for me &amp; hope you have the same success!</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference in the texture  of my skin within the first week!!  </li>
            <li>This particular version is tinted, but I mix this with the non-tinted white version for the perfect colored blend.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always want to take the time to blend them together, though, so be advised that if you have very fair skin, this product may be too dark for you and is a suntan color.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of European sunscreens, as they provide vastly superior UVA (the aging rays) protection to anything readily available in the U.S.  </li>
            <li>On my body, including hands, I have used this in a pinch, but have found the European sunscreen sprays &amp; body lotions to be more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>It gives your skin a nice healthy glow with out clogging your pores or leaving your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I have light colored skin in the winter &amp; light-to-medium in the summer (right now in March</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;) &amp; this product blends in perfectly fine</li>
            <li>so even, it looks like you are wearing a mild coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>Very light, gives you a really pretty glow, and my skin which normally breaks out from anything, has not had a breakout since I started using it!</li>
            <li>- it looks dark before you put it on your face, but it ends up giving just a very nice golden glow.  </li>
            <li>I tried La Rouche-Posay&#x27;s brand of the same stuff, but the tint isn&#x27;t as nice.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use any powder with this.</li>
            <li>in winter I use the untinted cream with a light powder finish, as I am older and have graduated to mineral powders rather than liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I got the spf 100 version last year and the tint was much more friendly to lighter skin tones (the people most likely to need photoderm products).  </li>
            <li>As usual with Photoderm, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I have tried many European sunscreens through the years, &amp; this one stands out as the winner for my face &amp; neck.  </li>
            <li>To take off: double cleanse to make sure all the product is off.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other tinted sunscreens and this one had the nicest consistency and gave the best coverage.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product before and liked it alot, but it was a little thin/runny.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price to keep my face &amp; neck looking young.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>It really protects.</li>
            <li>I have brown spots I fade, you really can&#x27;t see them anymore.</li>
            <li>the seller is overseas, I found the shipping time to be quite reasonable, and will continue to buy from them</li>
            <li>It gives a tan glow, which for my fair with pink undertone skin, it looks really obvious.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Protects well (I live in the hot, sunny southwest US)  </li>
            <li>I guess I need to find someone who tans and wants this high of SPF to give it to.</li>
            <li>so I can simply apply a translutent powder over it or apply my Jane Iredale pressed powder if I feel the need for a little more coverage if I have a special event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just add a little more blush</li>
            <li>I use this year round as my foundation and get so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years instead of foundation,  The colour is just right for me and goes on</li>
            <li>Once an issue was corrected with 1st order and received this new product, everything great.&lt;br /&gt;Really like this product and the way it covers skin.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of my fav sunscreen and had to try a new one as I found out they didn&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
            <li>I usually do not like any tinted moisturizer or any type of foundation.</li>
            <li>Even on my medium, light skin tone this is too dark.  </li>
            <li>I should have gotten the clear.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne &amp; this</li>
            <li>I would suggest the company actually does a few shades- fair, medium &amp; dark, so that they can serve everyone.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that this &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; would be heavy &amp; greasy, but am pleased that this applies like a regular lotion vs the usual shiny, greasy mess of so many other sunscreen products.</li>

            <li> The sunscreen I had kept my face protected no matter how long I was in the sun.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to let any brand of sun block get in your eyes as it stings,  When this happens, blot with a kleenex and beware next time,&lt;br /&gt;Though</li>
            <li> I can usually get a shade I can live with.  </li>
            <li> I personally use this product everyday</li>
            <li> and because it was not cheap, I&#x27;m trying to use it by blending it with a sunblock lotion that I found was too white when used alone on my face.  </li>
            <li> The tint is too dark for me.</li>
            <li> This is too dark for me</li>
            <li> and they always looked ridiculous &amp; white.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a little thicker than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> It took few days to recover and heal the skin on face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a huge tube, I travel a lot</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product but very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I being using this product for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> It is however, really thick.  </li>
            <li> On protecting your face against women&#x27;s worst enemy, the sun, but also work as a very natural foundation.</li>
            <li> Not worth it :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the cream caused irritation and the skin felt like burnt after 2 days use.</li>
            <li> I Just Wish It Wasn&#x27;t So Expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, but why would I want a sunblock that has dye in it that stains...?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> but you will probably get your t-shirt dirty, in case of a skin contact with the clothes.</li>
            <li> Very Very disappointed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought the cream after the dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation. Unfortunately the cream caused irritation and the skin felt like burnt after 2 days use. Would not recommend to those with sensitive skin. It took few days to recover and heal the skin on face.</li>
            <li> I being using this product for the past 4 years. This is the best thing for those women that  don&#x27;t like  to wear makeup. Which is my case. On protecting your face against women&#x27;s worst enemy, the sun, but also work as a very natural foundation. DO NOT get their tinted ultra-fluid, is so oily.</li>
            <li> I usually do not like any tinted moisturizer or any type of foundation. Not only is this product that, but also an SPF 50.  Very light, gives you a really pretty glow, and my skin which normally breaks out from anything, has not had a breakout since I started using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin specialist and I recommend this product to all my clients.  Ditch the foundation this product is amazing protection and coverage in one.  I personally use this product everyday and I noticed a difference in the texture  of my skin within the first week!!  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I had been using Bioderma Photoderm tinted SPF 100 for years. Now, I tried SPF50 and it feels and looks the same. One friend told me how well hydrated my face was.  Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Great product.  odorless, and not at all greasy.  it gives you a youthful and healthy glow. I Just Wish It Wasn&#x27;t So Expensive.</li>
            <li> I do tan so I&#x27;m not a fitzpatrick.  Even on my medium, light skin tone this is too dark.  I got the spf 100 version last year and the tint was much more friendly to lighter skin tones (the people most likely to need photoderm products).  I should&#x27;ve gotten the one without tint, however it provides excellent protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before and liked it alot, but it was a little thin/runny.  Now they have thickened it to be more like a foundation and I love it.  The tint is the perfect color and I use it as my foundation, after applying a moisturizing lotion. Great sun protection and it is easy to re-apply without messing up my makeup.  Just add a little more blush and I&#x27;m off and running!</li>
            <li> As usual with Photoderm, this is a great product. It has a very good coverage and the tint makes your skin look so even, it looks like you are wearing a mild coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin with pink undertones and this provides the perfect balance - it looks dark before you put it on your face, but it ends up giving just a very nice golden glow.  I don&#x27;t have to wear anything else when I have this sunscreen on, and I can go for a run and come back sweaty, yet it hasn&#x27;t rubbed off at all.  I tried La Rouche-Posay&#x27;s brand of the same stuff, but the tint isn&#x27;t as nice.  I&#x27;ll be stocking up on this for a long while to come.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, but why would I want a sunblock that has dye in it that stains...?  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nice but you will probably get your t-shirt dirty, in case of a skin contact with the clothes.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with blonde/grey hair. The tint is too dark for me. It gives a tan glow, which for my fair with pink undertone skin, it looks really obvious.  I do like the consistency of the lotion and because it was not cheap, I&#x27;m trying to use it by blending it with a sunblock lotion that I found was too white when used alone on my face.  By blending them together I can usually get a shade I can live with.  I don&#x27;t always want to take the time to blend them together, though, so be advised that if you have very fair skin, this product may be too dark for you and is a suntan color.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is a 50 proof and tinted.  It is however, really thick.  I cannot use ut every day.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other tinted sunscreens and this one had the nicest consistency and gave the best coverage. The shade is perfect, not too dark, and I can wear it instead of foundation. I also didn&#x27;t find it quite as oily as others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of European sunscreens, as they provide vastly superior UVA (the aging rays) protection to anything readily available in the U.S.  Along with retina a, healthy diet, and exercise, these sunscreens are truly the beauty fountain of youth.  I have tried many European sunscreens through the years, &amp; this one stands out as the winner for my face &amp; neck.  I was concerned that this &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; would be heavy &amp; greasy, but am pleased that this applies like a regular lotion vs the usual shiny, greasy mess of so many other sunscreen products. I also appreciate how the thicker texture prevents the sunscreen from migrating into my eyes.  This particular version is tinted, but I mix this with the non-tinted white version for the perfect colored blend.  Definitely worth the price to keep my face &amp; neck looking young.  On my body, including hands, I have used this in a pinch, but have found the European sunscreen sprays &amp; body lotions to be more cost effective.  A perfect &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; for me, though I wish I&#x27;d starting using this in my 20s!</li>
            <li> Once an issue was corrected with 1st order and received this new product, everything great.&lt;br /&gt;Really like this product and the way it covers skin.  It makes skin feel very hydrated with a great coverage to provide evening skin tone.</li>
            <li> I bought two Bioderma Tinted Creams before but they were made in Brazil; one of each color. I have fair skin, but the &amp;#34;Light Tint&amp;#34; made me look like a ghost; the &amp;#34;dark tint&amp;#34; was just right. When I ran out of both, I decided to buy this one, made in France. It is way darker than the Brazilian one, but I mix it with another 50 SPF light cream and it&#x27;s just perfect for my complexion, not to mention that it really protects it from the sun. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and have no allergies issues. I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a little thicker than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product but very disappointed. I&#x27;m very fair skin and you would think that an SPF of 50 and tinted would be made for someone with fairer skin. Not the case. This made me look like an opa loumpa. I&#x27;m sad I really wanted it to work. I should have gotten the clear. I guess I need to find someone who tans and wants this high of SPF to give it to. Not worth it :(</li>
            <li> Very Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have been using spf 50+ products for the last few years (Irish blue skin ) and they always looked ridiculous &amp; white. This product works like a foundation &amp; covers flaws. I have given this out to about 10 friends because of the compliments on my skin. I would suggest the company actually does a few shades- fair, medium &amp; dark, so that they can serve everyone.</li>
            <li> La prefiero sin tinte.</li>
            <li> This tinted moisturizer cream is a wonderful product and the &amp;#34;SPF&amp;#34; 50+ is just what I needed while being outdoors.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tinted sunscreen for your face that just makes it glow!  I use this year round as my foundation and get so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my fav sunscreen and had to try a new one as I found out they didn&#x27;t make it anymore. I am so happy I ran out, this one is even better. The color is great, if you are more fair just use a very sm amount and the color will be perfect. It really protects. I have brown spots I fade, you really can&#x27;t see them anymore. The sunscreen I had kept my face protected no matter how long I was in the sun. At night when I washed my face still no sign of the brown spots. It gives your skin a nice healthy glow with out clogging your pores or leaving your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned: NW20. This is too dark for me so I blend it with a light foundation and voila: perfect results. I can&#x27;t do without this product. I freckle easily and use anti-acne products so I have to protect my skin daily. The combination of a matte light foundation and this give my skin a smooth healthy and glowy look. 4 stars because they could come up with a tinted formula for lighter skin tones. Even with this color issue I won&#x27;t give it up. When I don&#x27;t use it I get red and blotchy even if I use &amp;#34;high end, targeted&amp;#34; sun protection. Also notice that this is for reactive skin, if that&#x27;s you: this is a great product. To take off: double cleanse to make sure all the product is off.</li>
            <li> These products should not be sold UNSEALED.</li>
            <li> Great product - Good protection from sun and great color</li>
            <li> Perfect for summer when you want to look tan. I rarely use any powder with this. in winter I use the untinted cream with a light powder finish, as I am older and have graduated to mineral powders rather than liquid foundation. The cream is not greasy at all, unlike the milk.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I have bought 3 tubes already and I will keep buying it, it does feel and look beautiful.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this product but it took a lot to arrive, also I think 30$ it&#x27;s a lot for just 40ml</li>
            <li> After trying another &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; cream (Neocutis Lumiere Bio-restorative Eye Cream with PSP, Anti-aging) that left no color what-so-ever on my face I gave Bioderma a try &amp; couldn&#x27;t be more happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have light colored skin in the winter &amp; light-to-medium in the summer (right now in March it&#x27;s &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;) &amp; this product blends in perfectly fine &amp; I believe it should still work colorwise for me come summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I have adult acne &amp; this hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts in the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It gives a nice tint/glow so I can simply apply a translutent powder over it or apply my Jane Iredale pressed powder if I feel the need for a little more coverage if I have a special event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It has SPF &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell like sunblock or clog my pores like sunblock does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I like that it&#x27;s not a huge tube, I travel a lot so this meets airline restrictions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I found a tinted day cream that works for me &amp; hope you have the same success!</li>
            <li> Very good!! Exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> Super good, just great</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years instead of foundation,  The colour is just right for me and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Protects well (I live in the hot, sunny southwest US)  Be careful not to let any brand of sun block get in your eyes as it stings,  When this happens, blot with a kleenex and beware next time,&lt;br /&gt;Though the seller is overseas, I found the shipping time to be quite reasonable, and will continue to buy from them</li>
