            <li>Seems to record the BP well, easy to use.</li>
            <li>so this is an easy blood pressure machine to take for trips.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it is wonderful, well accepted by my clients and easy to use,  </li>
            <li>Been comparing this to another blood pressure monitor and it seems to stay accurate.</li>
            <li>And yes, this was with the &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; positioning and all of the tips that they emailed regarding accurate reading.</li>
            <li>comfort fit on wrist.</li>
            <li>Fit the wrist with now problem.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I purchased this monitor based off of other reviews, I am happy with it, I believe it is fairly accurate.</li>
            <li>I just love this modern wrist blood pressure device.</li>
            <li>Small and very easy to use, easy to read as well,  this is such a great gadget</li>
            <li>The display is easy to read, but it is not intuitive as far as operation.</li>
            <li>Once you get use to the Record First Reading you will find Peace in knowing now you can formulate a plan to lower the First Reading (with or without meds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My doctor told me that the only BP monitor that is most acrate is the cuff.</li>
            <li>After first battery change, stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Well, one of the first readings we took on this had his BP as 220/130.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simple and easy for them to use.</li>
            <li>Fits my really large wrist without a problem.</li>
            <li>Too cheap to work properly.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t trust it</li>
            <li>The first one I got did not work at all with new batteries (would not turn on).  </li>
            <li>Nice small size</li>
            <li>I got this for my father, after his other wrist monitor finally kicked the bucket (better it than him!).</li>
            <li>I would then  use the same machine on someone else and sure enough their blood pressure was normal.</li>
            <li>As far as how acurate it is not so much but close.  </li>
            <li>How I know this is after taking my blood pressure which would not be normal,  </li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;m going to have to get a new one for them.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t place it a certain way on the wrist it will not read properly.</li>
            <li>other thing is become a believer in RECORD FIRST READING, IE if you bp is high at the first reading record that reading don&#x27;t take multiple readings to find a lower score.</li>
            <li>keep it in my pocket on medication rounds, to update vital signs.  </li>
            <li>This cuff either give very hight reading or very low rieading or else</li>
            <li>The way its placed on the left wrist is different from the way its placed on the right wrist.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s small size makes it easily portable.</li>
            <li>This is especially so because I received emails from the manufacturer after receiving the product about how to put it on correctly to ensure an &amp;#34;accurate&amp;#34; reading: above the wrist bone, higher than you would wear a watch.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that the reading were wrong.</li>
            <li>not sure if accurate.  </li>
            <li>It is also a bit difficult to switch from user 1 to user two, but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>The second one they sent is an average of 20 to 25 mm too high for both diastolic and systolic readings as compared to doctors office</li>

            <li> It is so easy to to use and only takes mere seconds to run!</li>
            <li> When I tried it, it gave me a reading of 180/120, so at least it was lower, but high for me is 120/90, so</li>
            <li> not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Works as expected..  </li>
            <li> So that is pretty uncomfortable because of the size of the cuff.</li>
            <li> The cuff for the wrist is uncomfortably small, and I am an average size female, so I think any larger women and almost any men will find the cuff to be too small.</li>
            <li> The question was, was he REALLY going to have a stroke, or were those numbers wrong?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one.  </li>
            <li> After less than 2 months, this monitor does not work!</li>
            <li> Not very accurate and failed often , could not depend on it</li>
            <li> This is not a good cuff.</li>
            <li> And always have the option to check manually any questionable results.</li>
            <li> Too complicated.</li>
            <li> A real waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> This is worst bp wrist cuff!</li>

            <li> Easy to use. Only problem was the pump hung up. Had to tap on the unit to get it started.</li>
            <li> After less than 2 months, this monitor does not work! And the readings were quite different back-to-back.  A real waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> not sure if accurate.  ok. not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Anytime I visit any blood pressure place they always have to take my reading more than once. So I wanted to experiment and see if I had blood pressure issues.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly: I purchased this monitor based off of other reviews, I am happy with it, I believe it is fairly accurate. How I know this is after taking my blood pressure which would not be normal,  I would then  use the same machine on someone else and sure enough their blood pressure was normal. Therefore I am satisfied with its accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;I am kind of glad I have this; download a blood pressure tracking app and you can chart your readings.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is become a believer in RECORD FIRST READING, IE if you bp is high at the first reading record that reading don&#x27;t take multiple readings to find a lower score. Once you get use to the Record First Reading you will find Peace in knowing now you can formulate a plan to lower the First Reading (with or without meds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps</li>
            <li> this item arrived in good condition.  As far as how acurate it is not so much but close.  My doctor told me that the only BP monitor that is most acrate is the cuff.</li>
            <li> Batteries were always the problem</li>
            <li> Looking so forward to it but did not work... Simply that!</li>
            <li> Sometimes difficult to position it on your wrist to get an accurate reading but as long as you are careful to place it correctly, it works as advertised. very good for the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my husband&#x27;s big wrists.  Okay for me.  The case is cheapo.</li>
            <li> works great, large display for easy viewing, easy to use. nice carrying case makes it easy to carry with you. big buttons. easy battery access. comfort fit on wrist.</li>

            <li> This is worst bp wrist cuff! I work as RN and have used 3 different product. This cuff either give very hight reading or very low rieading or else gives you error.  After first battery change, stopped working.  Never buy this product!</li>
            <li> This item is very toy like and small.  The first one I got did not work at all with new batteries (would not turn on).  The second one they sent is an average of 20 to 25 mm too high for both diastolic and systolic readings as compared to doctors office I took it with me.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this one.  Too cheap to work properly.</li>
            <li> Got this for my parents because they need to keep track of their blood pressure. It&#x27;s very simple and easy for them to use.</li>

            <li> So far so good. No problems with putting it on the correct place on the wrist</li>
            <li> Most times its correct.</li>
            <li> Not very accurate and failed often , could not depend on it</li>
            <li> Great service, great product, easy instructions.</li>
            <li> Good design,price and functionality.  Concerned about the reliability of the device to replicate readings..</li>
            <li> Very convenient. Been comparing this to another blood pressure monitor and it seems to stay accurate. Fit the wrist with now problem. Light weight. Great for anyone trying to keep an eye on the BP</li>
            <li> This is not a good cuff. If you don&#x27;t place it a certain way on the wrist it will not read properly. The way its placed on the left wrist is different from the way its placed on the right wrist. Too complicated.</li>

I got this for my father, after his other wrist monitor finally kicked the bucket (better it than him!). Well, one of the first readings we took on this had his BP as 220/130. True, my father is being watched for hypertension, but he was about to have a stroke when he saw that number! The question was, was he REALLY going to have a stroke, or were those numbers wrong? When I tried it, it gave me a reading of 180/120, so at least it was lower, but high for me is 120/90, so I am pretty sure that the reading were wrong. We tried it on him again and it read around 150/110. And yes, this was with the &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; positioning and all of the tips that they emailed regarding accurate reading. I really don&#x27;t trust it and I think I&#x27;m going to have to get a new one for them. But it was delivered in a timely fashion...</li>
