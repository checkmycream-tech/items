            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>I recommended it to friends who love it too!</li>
            <li>and.....I Love it!  </li>

            <li>The amount of volume I have is amazing.</li>
            <li>The stuff in This bottle is amazing.</li>
            <li>IT IS REALLY AN AMAZING PRODUCT....</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it was hopeless...</li>
            <li>She tried it on me and when I saw that it worked I needed to buy my own.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is a really good one and the price was better.</li>
            <li>YOUR OWN CONDITIONER ALSO.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Nexxus&#x27; original emergencee but a good substitute.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>my wife say that&#x60;s the best product money can buy she I highly recommend this stuff to anyone who needs a reconstructing treatment.</li>
            <li>did notice that my roots were very healthy after a couple of uses, but the ends were not as healthy as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very big bottle for a good price which is great!</li>
            <li>and you should not use it every week because it is very strong.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews but because I am so thrilled with this product, I could not wait to share my experience!!!</li>
            <li>great choice, worth the price</li>
            <li>The first two times it worked great</li>
            <li>It should be used 3 to 5 times per month at home if you have fine or damaged hair WITH HEAT!</li>
            <li>i reall love this .</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have tried every conditioner, oil, treatment on the market but nothing seemed to give me the healthy looking hair I used to have.  </li>
            <li>All my friends love this products though...</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because i use the nexxus hummectress conditioner and love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and this is definately a staple product for me.</li>
            <li>just be sure to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>and my hair is soo shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the smell, so I decided to buy some shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not asleep yet, keep reading to learn about the steps I take every week to acheive really healthy</li>
            <li>You will see breakage mostly at the roots (as this is the healthiest hair on your head since its the newest).  </li>
            <li>When all of my friends noticed the difference I started to feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Humectress as a conditioner, but saw that Keratin (the ingredient I care most about) dropped from a top ingredient to Number 24.  </li>
            <li>The top ingredient in this product also changed to water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO glad that I bought two bottles of this while it was on sale.</li>
            <li>More affordable too.</li>
            <li>I WAS ABLE TO BRUSH AND SYTLE</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair so healthy.</li>
            <li>Really in love with the way it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>this product is one of the best for hair damage restored back to give it strength  between perms and colors.</li>
            <li>well on your way to restoring damaged hair, or just maintaining healthy hair.</li>
            <li>ALSO LOVE THE LATHER EFFECT</li>
            <li>love emergency</li>
            <li>My sides around my hairline has more breakage.</li>
            <li>I just love the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I have found that it works best when its left on under a cap and being under a dryer applying heat.</li>
            <li>IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>you can tell if your hair can handle more.</li>
            <li>safe my hair&lt;br /&gt;Thanks nexxus</li>
            <li>The more you use it...</li>
            <li>It has made an improvement in my hair, but I&#x27;m not seeing the drastic changes most people are speaking of in their reviews.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li>im jus in love with my results</li>
            <li>I purchased this to help to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>but I love the fact that my curls come out more defined when I use it.</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>Better to use this than having to cut off hair.</li>
            <li>vo-5 or olive oil does more for my hair than this product.  </li>
            <li>I need to see how it will do through time to see if my hair gets more thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li>This reconstructor does more for my chemically damaged hair than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>sure its detangled&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way works in my hair .</li>
            <li>love it .</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>Specially when you warm it up its even better</li>
            <li>Pretty good in quality.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is more strong.</li>
            <li>My hair was strong healthy</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair from being completely damaged after straightening it so many times and it&#x27;s great for when I want to leave my hair curly</li>
            <li>use of this conditioner and my hair came back more beautiful that it had ever been.  </li>
            <li>in this case too much will not be a good thing.  </li>
            <li>i apply this product and my hair comes out, soft, silky and healthy!!</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>That is how strong this is.  </li>
            <li>This is a good repair product I highly recommended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve realized that although my hair appeared very healthy, it was suffering from too much protein.  </li>
            <li>(yup, I even bought a grandma-like bonnet to make sure I got the full effect).</li>
            <li>but it is more than worth it, as you will have shiny, soft, and healthy hair!!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that I color often.  </li>
            <li>so I roller set it and sit under the dryer after using the emergency recontructor which works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Really works too, love it!</li>
            <li>A huge difference in your hair.  </li>
            <li>You will notice a huge difference in the condition of your damaged hair after 2-3 treatments depending on how often you use it.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a huge difference since I was introduced at the hair salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this once a week and have seen a huge change in my hair texture.</li>
            <li>Which is why its important to condition afterwards...</li>
            <li>It is powerful so be sure to follow the directions and not overuse....</li>
            <li>i dont see the big deal with this product, i bought it just because of the reviews and it wasn&#x27;t anything great</li>
            <li>The effect on my hair was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Keep hydrating your hair and will recover the shine and smooth because of exceed of chemical treatments.</li>
            <li>My hair was very damaged from bleaching it and with this product it leaves your hair nice and silk from the 1st time you use it.</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s is still available</li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI, original Emergencee ingredients:  Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid , Water (Aqua) , Collagen Amino Acids , Hydrolyzed Elastin , Propylene Glycol , Hydrolyzed Collagen , Methylchloroisothiazolinone , Methylisothiazolinone , DMDM Hydantoin , Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate , Methylparaben</li>
            <li>- Having used Nexxus Emergencee reconstructor I am familiar with Protein Treatments and the effects on my hair.  </li>
            <li>All in all, as long as you dont overdo it you will see great results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but aren&#x27;t you worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Original product, Im a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li>I bought this, thinking it might be the salon version,  and I&#x27;m pretty sure it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about the results.</li>
            <li>additional alternative available is Keracare&#x27;s Super Reconstructor as an alternative to Nexxus products.  </li>
            <li>Cover with a shower cap for about an hour (while I clean my bathroom or do laundry or something</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I purchased a large bottle, because it&#x27;s a keeper for me.</li>
            <li>Great product,came sealed and tightly closed.</li>
            <li>It has been falling out by the comb full for weeks.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got too much protein be sure to clarify your hair and give it some time to recover from the protein treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still untangles, but wonder if I&#x27;m using really good conditioners, can I get by with cheaper product for the final rinse.  </li>
            <li>One thing u will definitely need a leave in conditioner after using this and i would recommend using once a week if u dye ur hair followed by a good moisturizing leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Like silky soft and nice.</li>
            <li>and it really worked,  better than Paul Mitchell Super Strength treatment,  and even Aphogee.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use every other week or monthly.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels soft smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keracare Super Reconstructor: Aqua, Collagen Amino Acids, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium PCA, Methlyparaben, and Imidazolidinyl Urea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a total Nexxus junkie, they really do make great products.</li>
            <li>Glad to read the comments about Nexxus Aloxxi Keramix Protein Reconstructor which puts Keratin back in the top 7.  </li>
            <li>I bought $300 dollars worth on the spot and have never looked back (except to look at my gorgeous hair in the mirror).  </li>
            <li>If your hair hates protein this isn&#x27;t for you but the high porosity heads will love it.</li>
            <li>After using this I could see the results the very first time .</li>
            <li>With the Nexxus Reconsructer, you can use whatever brand of shampoo and conditioner you want afteryou use it as long as it&#x27;s a good moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>As a black woman it feels great when non-black people compliment me on my hair.  </li>
            <li>so far its the first day i tried it and my friend told me my hair looks nice and shiney.</li>
            <li>I just ran my comb through my hair for the first time without ANY HAIR coming out!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for damaged hair!!!  </li>
            <li>It grows your hair, makes it healthy and strong if you use it regularly</li>
            <li>My hair, literally, came back to life and looked amazing.</li>
            <li>I consider this to be a success.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and healthy, you could run your fingers through it and not hit a snag at all.  </li>
            <li>Before I felt it was worth the money, now I question continuing to purchase.</li>
            <li>I honestly believed all I needed was a moisturizing deep treatment.</li>
            <li>BRILLIAANT DELIVERY ALSO AND WORTH THE PRICE TOO</li>
            <li>From the bottom of my heart, this conditioner is worth every penny you&#x27;ll spend on it.</li>
            <li>and WOW I have healthy hair....</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Secret to healthy hair &#x3D; being happy +</li>
            <li>;  FOLLOWING  INSTRUCTIONS AND BE KIND TO YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li>It was soft, very easy to manage and didn&#x27;t even had to use my ironing tool to set my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>Right now my hair needs moisture and the protein did not help the situation.</li>
            <li>you can see the results right away.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to restore what I could for the last year and take good care of the new growth....</li>
            <li>I believe it fused most of my split ends together as it appears today that they are more or less gone.</li>
            <li>Your roots are already strong and dont really need that much protein.  </li>
            <li>and it is great for before you color your hair, leave in small amount before coloring.</li>
            <li>Now it has 37, with water being first and collagen being number 23, if I counted right.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and so easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t overly thrilled with this product, my hair doesn&#x27;t really feel any different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant reduction in the amount of hair I normally lose from brushing or in the shower, my hair just feels thicker in</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just what my hair needs, very reasonably priced and the delivery was also very fast</li>
            <li>and then I apply the most mosturizing deep conditioner I have.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m sitting here after using the Polymedic Emergency Conditioner for the first time,and I had to pry myself from the mirror.</li>
            <li>I should say first that I am a Nexxus junkie.  </li>
            <li>At first this seemed like the answer to my split-end prayers.  </li>
            <li>I am an African American woman who has relaxed her hair for many years (probably too many).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first product review.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I love it and am so grateful I finally found something to help my hair![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The first three were:  Herbal Extract, Grapefruit Juice and protein.  </li>
            <li>minimized(my ends were visibly frayed and damaged before using this product), hair looks smooth and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I will give more feedback after multiple uses</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I could finally find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Having said all of that, my hair will not absorb conditioners without using this first.</li>
            <li>I do make sure I follow up with a deep conditioner</li>
            <li>I used this product the first time and my hair was reborn again.</li>
            <li>I received exactly that I was purchased</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the type that expects to see results the first time I use a product; I know these things take time, but you don&#x27;t need to wait with this product.</li>
            <li>(Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better).</li>
            <li>and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs.</li>
            <li>Dare I say, a stellar job?</li>
            <li>This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>You CAN use too many protein treatments in too short a period,  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend neglected his hair for years and it was pretty damaged.</li>
            <li>WELL, I DID THE NEXXUS PROTEIN TREATMENT FIRST</li>
            <li>Results were great, my hair look full yet still thin.</li>
            <li>and when you do - wow!!!!  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have known about this before losing so much of my hair, but I&#x27;m confident this product will help get my hair back on track!</li>
            <li>You just have to be careful when it comes to any protein based strengthener and make sure your hair is healthy enough to use the product.  </li>
            <li>After just one use I noticed less split ends and thats what every one pretty much looks for a quick result:)</li>
            <li>I noticed less shedding and the end results were amazing.</li>
            <li>Another HUGE reason I first tried this product is because you dont have to worry about buying extra shampoo and conditioner from Biolustre,(that</li>
            <li>THE NEXXUS PROTEIN TREATMENT MADE IT EXTREMELY STRONG INSTANTLY</li>
            <li>Really helped to strength it.</li>
            <li>I carefully wash it out making sure not to disturb the hardened hair until it is rinsed out fully</li>
            <li>This products really works.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product after I colored my daughter&#x27;s hair, it really help, stopped the breakage.</li>
            <li>I find that trio works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Here is my process: I washed it once with Bigon shampoo (just because it is gentle on my colored hair), than I applied the conditioner as outlined in the instructions and placed a shower cap on my hair and let it sit for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I really have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>However, it took my curly/wavy hair (think Halle Berry in Their Eyes Were Watching God movie) to BONE STRAIGHT hair.  </li>
            <li>this may very well change your hair&#x27;s structure.  </li>
            <li>curly/wavy at the roots and straight on the ends.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned what the warning signs are for too much protein</li>
            <li>No matter how much conditioner, moisturizer, or oil you put on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using since 6month ago, it&#x27;s really works for me.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t really notice</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference like the reviews posted.</li>
            <li>I COULD FEEL A DIFFERENCE STRAIGHT AWAY!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price was a real bargin.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Because this is a protein treatment and too much protein can also harm your hair.</li>
            <li>After each use, my hair do not break as much.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this Emergency treatment would work so fast, but I&#x27;m a believer now.</li>
            <li>I really recommend for anyone that has damaged hair</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, but I don&#x27;t have much breakagejust tons of split ends.</li>
            <li>I am a hair stylist who tends to like very blond hair.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t seem to around as much as it used to be.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS VERY POROUS.</li>
            <li>but WOW!!!</li>
            <li>When I recommended this product, my hair was really in distress, was excited because I thought it would apply to the results, I have used it several times and have not seen any noticeable results.</li>
            <li>My curls have been so much more springy and well defined since the first use, I cant wait to see how  much healthier my hair will be with the second and third.</li>
            <li>It is a hair Reconstructor and not a deep moisture product so you will need to use a rich moisturizing conditioner after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put it on when I first get in the shower and was it off last, then shampoo and conditioner after, so I don&#x27;t even leave it on for the full recommended time, and it still has saved my hair to almost normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill come back in a month and update this review if anything significantly changes</li>
            <li>And I must say that it certainly does live up to its expectations.  </li>
            <li>Remember to wash it out using shampoo and cool water followed by a moisturizing deep conditioner to soften the hair because this product hardens the longer you leave it on.</li>
            <li>After my stylist colored my hair following a perm, my hair broke off by the hands full.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a super moisturizing conditioner with this product or it will leave your hair feeling stiffer than usual!  </li>
            <li>I learned the hard way that too much protein (as this product is super strength and can easily deliver)</li>
            <li>The consistancy is almost like glue, and it doesn&#x27;t have a particular smell, and I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I have relaxed and color treated hair and live in a very humid country (in a Caribbean Island),  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;m a Black woman with type 3b/</li>
            <li>Eventually I discovered Nexxus Emergencee Restorative Strength Conditioning Treatment and was using it for about 2 years with what I thought were decent results.</li>
            <li>;o)  I will definitely be purchasing more in the future as I work to grow my hair to waist lengths.</li>
            <li>I plan to stock up before hair&#x27;s best kept secret is made unavailable to the general public!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this stuff to anyone who needs a reconstructing treatment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>but I can get away with it because I put it in a high pony and it looks like my hair is gelled.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years now and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I discovered this little gem.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>The more I use it,the more my hair improves and I can see a dramatic difference!</li>
            <li>My hair feels so incredibly soft and looks much fuller.  </li>
            <li>I have developed a system and I truly believe that this Reconstructor is the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your hair is still soft, WHILE THIS PRODUCT IS ON YOUR HAIR, after a reasonable amount of time, it&#x27;s not binding -</li>
            <li>As of right now, I definitely recommend this product for those that have chemically treated hair like myself.</li>
            <li>My Mom has fine relaxed African American hair</li>
            <li>If you have been as pissed-off as I have about the new crappy formula for Emergencee, then give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I lost my beautiful, dark, medium-coarse, long hair due to prolonged relaxer overprocessing.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally porous despite literature stating high porosity is caused by chemicals and or heat.</li>
            <li>I had my hair colored to a pretty golden blond from jet black and</li>
            <li>I have super curly 4a African American hair and after just 4 treatments my hair is less frizzy,  more manageable, stronger, and has almost completely stopped breaking and shedding.</li>
            <li>My favorite had always been Nexxus Emergencee, but it appears not to work as well as it did in the past.  </li>
            <li>I should mention also, that during my first 2 applications of this product I left it on for 30 minutes at a time, once a week.  </li>
            <li>All this time, I&#x27;d been paying $15 per 3.3 oz bottle of Emergencee and here on Amazon the 500 ml bottle of the same formula(professional strength) was $33 for 5 times as much!  </li>
            <li>The texture of this is not creamy like most conditioners, it is a bit different almost oily in a way but not exactly so don&#x27;t let that throw you off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li>It did not feel harsh as it can with some protein treatments ( of course as with all strong protein conditioners you should follow with a mositurising conditioner ).</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s a good protein conditioner, but I don&#x27;t know if you want to let it dry on your hair until it&#x27;s rock hard the way some people recommend.</li>
            <li>Emergencee current black top ingredients: Water (Aqua, Eau), Collagen Amino Acids, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Gelatin, Methylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone</li>
            <li>As anyone knows, Black hair is the most fragile of all hair types.  </li>
            <li>This product has large amounts of protein and although that&#x27;s great for your hair, too much is obviously a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>used it on clean, slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li>You get 5x the product for only twice as much money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard some people say that this is the professional formulation.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft and bouncy</li>
            <li>that\\&quot;  I get, \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li>If you see breakage at your roots or very close to your scalp - That&#x27;s enough protein!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all in a few years and the most recent time I went blonde, about a month ago, really did a lot of damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>I am trilled with this product, my hair has NEVER felt this soft.</li>
            <li>After applying the deep mask and washing your hair the texture of your hair will be much improved.</li>
            <li>awsome, its like steroids for your hair, and a use of it at least twice a month will keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I consider my hair to be protein sensitive</li>
            <li>You will need to use once a week and you will notice how soft and shiny your hair is.</li>
            <li>My hair was completely fried from the damage of bleaching it and dying it.</li>
            <li>Lately after shampooing I would notice more hair breakage and thinning.</li>
            <li>my hair was still soft.</li>
            <li>I  wonder why after fifteen mins under hair dryer, my hair was still soft?</li>
            <li>But WITH the Humectress, it really feels like silk, it feels really similar to when I do a brazilian keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then it will be soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>’s definitely not a waste, as it’s a product that works and makes you want to keep using/buying it.</li>
            <li>It also add lots natural shine to the hair.  </li>
            <li>it leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW EXTREMELY SOFT AND</li>
            <li>I would of gave this product a higher rating, however because I am an African American woman with transitioning hair, when I used the product for the third time, it really dried out my hair and caused more breakage.  </li>
            <li>but i did loose a few strands, specially since it knots right after combing.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product that will work to remedy the 40 volume, high lift blonde, hair color damage on my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone with over processed, damaged and fragile hair.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical, but this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ensure used to have 8 ingredients, not including food coloring.</li>
            <li>use this product in conjuction with so many other Nexxus products and I&#x27;ll give you a run down of everything I do below.  </li>
            <li>those reading these reviews please be advised that you  must use a deep mask after using this product or a very rich conditioner as your hair becomes very stiff and matted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with natural 4a/4b highly porous hair.</li>
            <li>no other product comes close to what this product delivers.</li>
            <li>This product is a must for fine hair, damaged hair, over-processed and dull hair.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell if this is having a major impact on my hair.</li>
            <li>The variety of application methods other users recommend is pretty varied, from sleep in it to use as directed in the shower.</li>
            <li>is that it can do wonders for your hair, but only if you use it properly and have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li>It has repaired my hair by at least 75% the very first use!</li>
            <li>It is suppose to be for professional and the instructions are a bit different as oppose to Emergencee.  </li>
            <li>Not any of those well-meaning, yet, condesceding remarks such as, \\&quot;Your hair is so cool\\&quot; or \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>Now I know I&#x27;ve only used this once so far</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple conditioners after and I really find that Nexxus Humectress Deep Hydrating Conditioner definitely makes this stuff work.</li>
            <li>I am a aa female with natural hair.  </li>
            <li>i am of african american decent with permed hair that breaks in the middle.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it is very similar to the Nexxus Emergencee, only this is the professional formula.</li>
            <li>My hair is not hair-commercial-worthy, but it IS nearly waist-length, formerly bleached (about the last 12&amp;#34; of it), and I can run a brush through it because of this and Infusium&#x27;s leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>nothing even helped a little, then I came across the nexxus polymedic reconstructor and after the first use I noticed a little difference, but after the second use a few days later..thats when the magic happened.</li>
            <li>I havent used any other Nexxus Shampoo, so I dont have much to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment</li>
            <li>Additionally my hair required less styling time and was very bouncy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s about half the thickness, from losing so much.</li>
            <li>I used this on my hair for about 4-5 months every 2 weeks and my hair is now down my back about 16 inches, thick, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I bought it and used the whole bottle, tried other products,  and realized that I will never switch again as long as this stuff is around.</li>

            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> The amount of volume I have is amazing.</li>
            <li> The stuff in This bottle is amazing.</li>
            <li> IT IS REALLY AN AMAZING PRODUCT....</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it was hopeless...</li>
            <li> She tried it on me and when I saw that it worked I needed to buy my own.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a really good one and the price was better.</li>
            <li> YOUR OWN CONDITIONER ALSO.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Nexxus&#x27; original emergencee but a good substitute.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> my wife say that&#x60;s the best product money can buy she I highly recommend this stuff to anyone who needs a reconstructing treatment.</li>
            <li> did notice that my roots were very healthy after a couple of uses, but the ends were not as healthy as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very big bottle for a good price which is great!</li>
            <li> and you should not use it every week because it is very strong.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews but because I am so thrilled with this product, I could not wait to share my experience!!!</li>
            <li> great choice, worth the price</li>
            <li> The first two times it worked great</li>
            <li> It should be used 3 to 5 times per month at home if you have fine or damaged hair WITH HEAT!</li>
            <li> i reall love this .</li>
            <li> It is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have tried every conditioner, oil, treatment on the market but nothing seemed to give me the healthy looking hair I used to have.  </li>
            <li> All my friends love this products though...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because i use the nexxus hummectress conditioner and love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and this is definately a staple product for me.</li>
            <li> just be sure to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> and my hair is soo shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> and I fell in love with the smell, so I decided to buy some shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not asleep yet, keep reading to learn about the steps I take every week to acheive really healthy</li>
            <li> You will see breakage mostly at the roots (as this is the healthiest hair on your head since its the newest).  </li>
            <li> When all of my friends noticed the difference I started to feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Humectress as a conditioner, but saw that Keratin (the ingredient I care most about) dropped from a top ingredient to Number 24.  </li>
            <li> The top ingredient in this product also changed to water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO glad that I bought two bottles of this while it was on sale.</li>
            <li> More affordable too.</li>
            <li> I WAS ABLE TO BRUSH AND SYTLE</li>

            <li> I just love the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I have found that it works best when its left on under a cap and being under a dryer applying heat.</li>
            <li> IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> you can tell if your hair can handle more.</li>
            <li> safe my hair&lt;br /&gt;Thanks nexxus</li>
            <li> The more you use it...</li>
            <li> It has made an improvement in my hair, but I&#x27;m not seeing the drastic changes most people are speaking of in their reviews.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> im jus in love with my results</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> but I love the fact that my curls come out more defined when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> Better to use this than having to cut off hair.</li>
            <li> vo-5 or olive oil does more for my hair than this product.  </li>
            <li> I need to see how it will do through time to see if my hair gets more thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li> This reconstructor does more for my chemically damaged hair than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> sure its detangled&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way works in my hair .</li>
            <li> love it .</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> Specially when you warm it up its even better</li>
            <li> Pretty good in quality.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is more strong.</li>
            <li> My hair was strong healthy</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair from being completely damaged after straightening it so many times and it&#x27;s great for when I want to leave my hair curly</li>
            <li> use of this conditioner and my hair came back more beautiful that it had ever been.  </li>
            <li> in this case too much will not be a good thing.  </li>
            <li> i apply this product and my hair comes out, soft, silky and healthy!!</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> That is how strong this is.  </li>
            <li> This is a good repair product I highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve realized that although my hair appeared very healthy, it was suffering from too much protein.  </li>
            <li> (yup, I even bought a grandma-like bonnet to make sure I got the full effect).</li>
            <li> but it is more than worth it, as you will have shiny, soft, and healthy hair!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that I color often.  </li>
            <li> so I roller set it and sit under the dryer after using the emergency recontructor which works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Really works too, love it!</li>
            <li> A huge difference in your hair.  </li>
            <li> You will notice a huge difference in the condition of your damaged hair after 2-3 treatments depending on how often you use it.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a huge difference since I was introduced at the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once a week and have seen a huge change in my hair texture.</li>
            <li> Which is why its important to condition afterwards...</li>
            <li> It is powerful so be sure to follow the directions and not overuse....</li>
            <li> i dont see the big deal with this product, i bought it just because of the reviews and it wasn&#x27;t anything great</li>
            <li> The effect on my hair was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Keep hydrating your hair and will recover the shine and smooth because of exceed of chemical treatments.</li>
            <li> My hair was very damaged from bleaching it and with this product it leaves your hair nice and silk from the 1st time you use it.</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s is still available</li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI, original Emergencee ingredients:  Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid , Water (Aqua) , Collagen Amino Acids , Hydrolyzed Elastin , Propylene Glycol , Hydrolyzed Collagen , Methylchloroisothiazolinone , Methylisothiazolinone , DMDM Hydantoin , Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate , Methylparaben</li>
            <li> - Having used Nexxus Emergencee reconstructor I am familiar with Protein Treatments and the effects on my hair.  </li>
            <li> All in all, as long as you dont overdo it you will see great results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but aren&#x27;t you worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Original product, Im a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> I bought this, thinking it might be the salon version,  and I&#x27;m pretty sure it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about the results.</li>
            <li> additional alternative available is Keracare&#x27;s Super Reconstructor as an alternative to Nexxus products.  </li>
            <li> Cover with a shower cap for about an hour (while I clean my bathroom or do laundry or something</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I purchased a large bottle, because it&#x27;s a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Great product,came sealed and tightly closed.</li>
            <li> It has been falling out by the comb full for weeks.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got too much protein be sure to clarify your hair and give it some time to recover from the protein treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still untangles, but wonder if I&#x27;m using really good conditioners, can I get by with cheaper product for the final rinse.  </li>
            <li> One thing u will definitely need a leave in conditioner after using this and i would recommend using once a week if u dye ur hair followed by a good moisturizing leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Like silky soft and nice.</li>
            <li> and it really worked,  better than Paul Mitchell Super Strength treatment,  and even Aphogee.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use every other week or monthly.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels soft smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keracare Super Reconstructor: Aqua, Collagen Amino Acids, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium PCA, Methlyparaben, and Imidazolidinyl Urea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a total Nexxus junkie, they really do make great products.</li>
            <li> Glad to read the comments about Nexxus Aloxxi Keramix Protein Reconstructor which puts Keratin back in the top 7.  </li>
            <li> I bought $300 dollars worth on the spot and have never looked back (except to look at my gorgeous hair in the mirror).  </li>
            <li> If your hair hates protein this isn&#x27;t for you but the high porosity heads will love it.</li>
            <li> After using this I could see the results the very first time .</li>
            <li> With the Nexxus Reconsructer, you can use whatever brand of shampoo and conditioner you want afteryou use it as long as it&#x27;s a good moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> As a black woman it feels great when non-black people compliment me on my hair.  </li>
            <li> so far its the first day i tried it and my friend told me my hair looks nice and shiney.</li>
            <li> I just ran my comb through my hair for the first time without ANY HAIR coming out!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for damaged hair!!!  </li>
            <li> It grows your hair, makes it healthy and strong if you use it regularly</li>
            <li> My hair, literally, came back to life and looked amazing.</li>
            <li> I consider this to be a success.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and healthy, you could run your fingers through it and not hit a snag at all.  </li>
            <li> Before I felt it was worth the money, now I question continuing to purchase.</li>
            <li> I honestly believed all I needed was a moisturizing deep treatment.</li>
            <li> BRILLIAANT DELIVERY ALSO AND WORTH THE PRICE TOO</li>
            <li> From the bottom of my heart, this conditioner is worth every penny you&#x27;ll spend on it.</li>
            <li> and WOW I have healthy hair....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Secret to healthy hair &#x3D; being happy +</li>
            <li> ;  FOLLOWING  INSTRUCTIONS AND BE KIND TO YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> It was soft, very easy to manage and didn&#x27;t even had to use my ironing tool to set my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> Right now my hair needs moisture and the protein did not help the situation.</li>
            <li> you can see the results right away.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to restore what I could for the last year and take good care of the new growth....</li>
            <li> I believe it fused most of my split ends together as it appears today that they are more or less gone.</li>
            <li> Your roots are already strong and dont really need that much protein.  </li>
            <li> and it is great for before you color your hair, leave in small amount before coloring.</li>
            <li> Now it has 37, with water being first and collagen being number 23, if I counted right.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft and so easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t overly thrilled with this product, my hair doesn&#x27;t really feel any different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant reduction in the amount of hair I normally lose from brushing or in the shower, my hair just feels thicker in</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just what my hair needs, very reasonably priced and the delivery was also very fast</li>
            <li> and then I apply the most mosturizing deep conditioner I have.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m sitting here after using the Polymedic Emergency Conditioner for the first time,and I had to pry myself from the mirror.</li>
            <li> I should say first that I am a Nexxus junkie.  </li>
            <li> At first this seemed like the answer to my split-end prayers.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American woman who has relaxed her hair for many years (probably too many).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first product review.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I love it and am so grateful I finally found something to help my hair![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The first three were:  Herbal Extract, Grapefruit Juice and protein.  </li>
            <li> minimized(my ends were visibly frayed and damaged before using this product), hair looks smooth and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I will give more feedback after multiple uses</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I could finally find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Having said all of that, my hair will not absorb conditioners without using this first.</li>
            <li> I do make sure I follow up with a deep conditioner</li>
            <li> I used this product the first time and my hair was reborn again.</li>
            <li> I received exactly that I was purchased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type that expects to see results the first time I use a product; I know these things take time, but you don&#x27;t need to wait with this product.</li>
            <li> (Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better).</li>
            <li> and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs.</li>
            <li> Dare I say, a stellar job?</li>
            <li> This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> You CAN use too many protein treatments in too short a period,  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend neglected his hair for years and it was pretty damaged.</li>
            <li> WELL, I DID THE NEXXUS PROTEIN TREATMENT FIRST</li>
            <li> Results were great, my hair look full yet still thin.</li>
            <li> and when you do - wow!!!!  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have known about this before losing so much of my hair, but I&#x27;m confident this product will help get my hair back on track!</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful when it comes to any protein based strengthener and make sure your hair is healthy enough to use the product.  </li>
            <li> After just one use I noticed less split ends and thats what every one pretty much looks for a quick result:)</li>
            <li> I noticed less shedding and the end results were amazing.</li>
            <li> Another HUGE reason I first tried this product is because you dont have to worry about buying extra shampoo and conditioner from Biolustre,(that</li>
            <li> THE NEXXUS PROTEIN TREATMENT MADE IT EXTREMELY STRONG INSTANTLY</li>
            <li> Really helped to strength it.</li>
            <li> I carefully wash it out making sure not to disturb the hardened hair until it is rinsed out fully</li>
            <li> This products really works.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after I colored my daughter&#x27;s hair, it really help, stopped the breakage.</li>
            <li> I find that trio works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Here is my process: I washed it once with Bigon shampoo (just because it is gentle on my colored hair), than I applied the conditioner as outlined in the instructions and placed a shower cap on my hair and let it sit for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I really have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> However, it took my curly/wavy hair (think Halle Berry in Their Eyes Were Watching God movie) to BONE STRAIGHT hair.  </li>
            <li> this may very well change your hair&#x27;s structure.  </li>
            <li> curly/wavy at the roots and straight on the ends.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned what the warning signs are for too much protein</li>
            <li> No matter how much conditioner, moisturizer, or oil you put on your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using since 6month ago, it&#x27;s really works for me.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t really notice</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference like the reviews posted.</li>
            <li> I COULD FEEL A DIFFERENCE STRAIGHT AWAY!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price was a real bargin.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Because this is a protein treatment and too much protein can also harm your hair.</li>
            <li> After each use, my hair do not break as much.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this Emergency treatment would work so fast, but I&#x27;m a believer now.</li>
            <li> I really recommend for anyone that has damaged hair</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, but I don&#x27;t have much breakagejust tons of split ends.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist who tends to like very blond hair.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t seem to around as much as it used to be.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS VERY POROUS.</li>
            <li> but WOW!!!</li>
            <li> When I recommended this product, my hair was really in distress, was excited because I thought it would apply to the results, I have used it several times and have not seen any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> My curls have been so much more springy and well defined since the first use, I cant wait to see how  much healthier my hair will be with the second and third.</li>
            <li> It is a hair Reconstructor and not a deep moisture product so you will need to use a rich moisturizing conditioner after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put it on when I first get in the shower and was it off last, then shampoo and conditioner after, so I don&#x27;t even leave it on for the full recommended time, and it still has saved my hair to almost normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill come back in a month and update this review if anything significantly changes</li>
            <li> And I must say that it certainly does live up to its expectations.  </li>
            <li> Remember to wash it out using shampoo and cool water followed by a moisturizing deep conditioner to soften the hair because this product hardens the longer you leave it on.</li>
            <li> After my stylist colored my hair following a perm, my hair broke off by the hands full.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a super moisturizing conditioner with this product or it will leave your hair feeling stiffer than usual!  </li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that too much protein (as this product is super strength and can easily deliver)</li>
            <li> The consistancy is almost like glue, and it doesn&#x27;t have a particular smell, and I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have relaxed and color treated hair and live in a very humid country (in a Caribbean Island),  </li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m a Black woman with type 3b/</li>
            <li> Eventually I discovered Nexxus Emergencee Restorative Strength Conditioning Treatment and was using it for about 2 years with what I thought were decent results.</li>
            <li> ;o)  I will definitely be purchasing more in the future as I work to grow my hair to waist lengths.</li>
            <li> I plan to stock up before hair&#x27;s best kept secret is made unavailable to the general public!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this stuff to anyone who needs a reconstructing treatment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> but I can get away with it because I put it in a high pony and it looks like my hair is gelled.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years now and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I discovered this little gem.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> The more I use it,the more my hair improves and I can see a dramatic difference!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so incredibly soft and looks much fuller.  </li>
            <li> I have developed a system and I truly believe that this Reconstructor is the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your hair is still soft, WHILE THIS PRODUCT IS ON YOUR HAIR, after a reasonable amount of time, it&#x27;s not binding -</li>
            <li> As of right now, I definitely recommend this product for those that have chemically treated hair like myself.</li>
            <li> My Mom has fine relaxed African American hair</li>
            <li> If you have been as pissed-off as I have about the new crappy formula for Emergencee, then give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I lost my beautiful, dark, medium-coarse, long hair due to prolonged relaxer overprocessing.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally porous despite literature stating high porosity is caused by chemicals and or heat.</li>
            <li> I had my hair colored to a pretty golden blond from jet black and</li>
            <li> I have super curly 4a African American hair and after just 4 treatments my hair is less frizzy,  more manageable, stronger, and has almost completely stopped breaking and shedding.</li>
            <li> My favorite had always been Nexxus Emergencee, but it appears not to work as well as it did in the past.  </li>
            <li> I should mention also, that during my first 2 applications of this product I left it on for 30 minutes at a time, once a week.  </li>
            <li> All this time, I&#x27;d been paying $15 per 3.3 oz bottle of Emergencee and here on Amazon the 500 ml bottle of the same formula(professional strength) was $33 for 5 times as much!  </li>
            <li> The texture of this is not creamy like most conditioners, it is a bit different almost oily in a way but not exactly so don&#x27;t let that throw you off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li> It did not feel harsh as it can with some protein treatments ( of course as with all strong protein conditioners you should follow with a mositurising conditioner ).</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s a good protein conditioner, but I don&#x27;t know if you want to let it dry on your hair until it&#x27;s rock hard the way some people recommend.</li>
            <li> Emergencee current black top ingredients: Water (Aqua, Eau), Collagen Amino Acids, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Gelatin, Methylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone</li>
            <li> As anyone knows, Black hair is the most fragile of all hair types.  </li>
            <li> This product has large amounts of protein and although that&#x27;s great for your hair, too much is obviously a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> used it on clean, slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> You get 5x the product for only twice as much money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some people say that this is the professional formulation.  </li>
            <li> It is so soft and bouncy</li>
            <li> that\\&quot;  I get, \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li> If you see breakage at your roots or very close to your scalp - That&#x27;s enough protein!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all in a few years and the most recent time I went blonde, about a month ago, really did a lot of damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> I am trilled with this product, my hair has NEVER felt this soft.</li>
            <li> After applying the deep mask and washing your hair the texture of your hair will be much improved.</li>
            <li> awsome, its like steroids for your hair, and a use of it at least twice a month will keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I consider my hair to be protein sensitive</li>
            <li> You will need to use once a week and you will notice how soft and shiny your hair is.</li>
            <li> My hair was completely fried from the damage of bleaching it and dying it.</li>
            <li> Lately after shampooing I would notice more hair breakage and thinning.</li>
            <li> my hair was still soft.</li>
            <li> I  wonder why after fifteen mins under hair dryer, my hair was still soft?</li>
            <li> But WITH the Humectress, it really feels like silk, it feels really similar to when I do a brazilian keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then it will be soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> ’s definitely not a waste, as it’s a product that works and makes you want to keep using/buying it.</li>
            <li> It also add lots natural shine to the hair.  </li>
            <li> it leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW EXTREMELY SOFT AND</li>
            <li> I would of gave this product a higher rating, however because I am an African American woman with transitioning hair, when I used the product for the third time, it really dried out my hair and caused more breakage.  </li>
            <li> but i did loose a few strands, specially since it knots right after combing.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that will work to remedy the 40 volume, high lift blonde, hair color damage on my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone with over processed, damaged and fragile hair.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ensure used to have 8 ingredients, not including food coloring.</li>
            <li> use this product in conjuction with so many other Nexxus products and I&#x27;ll give you a run down of everything I do below.  </li>
            <li> those reading these reviews please be advised that you  must use a deep mask after using this product or a very rich conditioner as your hair becomes very stiff and matted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural 4a/4b highly porous hair.</li>
            <li> no other product comes close to what this product delivers.</li>
            <li> This product is a must for fine hair, damaged hair, over-processed and dull hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell if this is having a major impact on my hair.</li>
            <li> The variety of application methods other users recommend is pretty varied, from sleep in it to use as directed in the shower.</li>
            <li> is that it can do wonders for your hair, but only if you use it properly and have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> It has repaired my hair by at least 75% the very first use!</li>
            <li> It is suppose to be for professional and the instructions are a bit different as oppose to Emergencee.  </li>
            <li> Not any of those well-meaning, yet, condesceding remarks such as, \\&quot;Your hair is so cool\\&quot; or \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> Now I know I&#x27;ve only used this once so far</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple conditioners after and I really find that Nexxus Humectress Deep Hydrating Conditioner definitely makes this stuff work.</li>
            <li> I am a aa female with natural hair.  </li>
            <li> i am of african american decent with permed hair that breaks in the middle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it is very similar to the Nexxus Emergencee, only this is the professional formula.</li>
            <li> My hair is not hair-commercial-worthy, but it IS nearly waist-length, formerly bleached (about the last 12&amp;#34; of it), and I can run a brush through it because of this and Infusium&#x27;s leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> nothing even helped a little, then I came across the nexxus polymedic reconstructor and after the first use I noticed a little difference, but after the second use a few days later..thats when the magic happened.</li>
            <li> I havent used any other Nexxus Shampoo, so I dont have much to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment</li>
            <li> Additionally my hair required less styling time and was very bouncy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s about half the thickness, from losing so much.</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair for about 4-5 months every 2 weeks and my hair is now down my back about 16 inches, thick, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I bought it and used the whole bottle, tried other products,  and realized that I will never switch again as long as this stuff is around.</li>
            <li> Let me be frank, this blows other Reconstructors clear out of the water.  </li>
            <li> Since I only use this product every 6-8 weeks it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> this product is too strong and damaged my skin, it was red all around finally it went away but it was scary.</li>
            <li> conditioner saved my hair after a very horrible experience with aphogee two step protein treatment which broke off my hair and cause a massive shedding, this was the only thing that stopped the shedding, it is wonderful, but follow the instructions carefully and do not overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (no sure how often you&#x27;re really supposed to use it..</li>
            <li> My hair has been dyed and bleached for the past 2 years, so this stuff really helped.</li>
            <li> I press myroots and flat iron my hair for work anyway</li>
            <li> :  Press the roots and edges and use an electric flat iron to straighen</li>
            <li> Over the past ten years, I have literally spent hundreds of dollars on hair products trying to get my healthy thick long hair back!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not the product to use if you only have extremely dry hair, this is a repair treatment for chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li> and I have thick coarse natural African American hair (type 4C for reference), this product works wonders for both of our hair textures.</li>
            <li> I tried both and found that it does work a bit better if left in longer, BUT, it does strip color out like mad.</li>
            <li> Too much protein causes your hair to become hard and brittle.  </li>
            <li> It repairs past and present damage and makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Be prepared; this is a long review, but informative.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw a dramatic difference from the very first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed it every colour imaginable, including going from bleach blonde to black and back again a number of times.  </li>
            <li> I had gone from black to blonde and back again</li>
            <li> i really hope i find a product that works for me, because ive spent hundreds of dollars on conditioners to help my hair, because it hasnt grown for over 6 years, and its extremley dry, to the point where if i bend it with shampoo in my hair, itll stay bent; and i mean my ENTIRE head of hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Nexxus conditioners (Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner, Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner, and Nexxus Hyrda Sleek Silken Smoothing Conditioner)</li>
            <li> I have very long, relaxed hair which is prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> Note that a protien treatment can leave your hair feeling somewhat dry as it does</li>
            <li> However, if you have both damage, and dry hair, like I had, I would recommnend using Therappe Shampoo, and Humectress Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Rinse out the conditioner and allow my hair to air dry naturally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry and damaged (I have relaxed hair).</li>
            <li> repairs it when it is dry.</li>
            <li> My hair gets dry, that&#x27;s why.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the instructions, I put it in and blow dry it until it&#x27;s completely dry, as heat is what&#x27;s needed to bind protein to the hair, or I leave it in all day and wash it out...</li>
            <li> and it was really dry.</li>
            <li> for it to dry on my hair (</li>
            <li> I get a single product but they made me the duplicate charge on my card.</li>
            <li> Allow my hair to air dry until it is only slightly damp and apply Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Cr&amp;egrave;me and leave it in overnight.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> It will just about be back to its previous condition before the damage occured.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After one treatment, I noticed less breakage, but after the second treatment, almost all of the breakage stopped.  </li>
            <li> Wash out the reconstructor and apply Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment to slightly damp hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After doing some extensive research, brought on from reading The Science of Black Hair by Audrey Davis-Sivasothy.  </li>
            <li> you have to use another conditioner after using it because it leaves your hair very dry</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> At one time my hair was long , healthy and thick now  my hair is very thin, especially the front , my sides are indeed very short and thin where u could see my scalp,  especially on one side I assume from the perms and dyes.</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong, but if you dont spend the $50.00 for the bottle of shampoo and conditioner to use daily as a sealant, it looses the whole purpose of using the product.</li>
            <li> I have not really seen any difference.  </li>
            <li> As I aged I thought because of the weaves and coloring, that I would never have the hair of my youth again.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for 20 minutes, and than washed it out, and blow dried it on low heat.  </li>
            <li> it is expensive but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The loss and breakage that I saw was minimal.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s still hard or crunchy or breaks when you barely touch it while dry -</li>
            <li> using the Nexxus reconstructor products my previously over bleached, weak tangling hair has returned to its normal curly self and I will never be without this product again!</li>
            <li> I bought because my hairdresser recommended it as I am loosing my hair due to health problems.  </li>
            <li> Even though my dark roots look very healthy, my ends are terrible with the constant splitting.  </li>
            <li> (I use it every other week).</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t use it again until my transitioning hair grows out and extreme dryness is not a factor.  </li>
            <li> UNLIKE OTHER PRODUCTS.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it with other conditioners and my hair</li>
            <li> I went to salons and had it \\&quot;steamed\\&quot; and processed and all kinds of other things you can imagine.  </li>
            <li> I use this every other week.</li>
            <li> My hair started falling out due to stress.</li>
            <li> usually buy this at my local beauty supply store,</li>
            <li> and my hair was looking very rough around my edges.  </li>
            <li> This is a real beauty secret!</li>
            <li> IT ALL CAME TUMBLING DOWN.</li>
            <li> , it just feels plain, and a little dry.</li>
            <li> My bangs are badly damaged at the ends due to the perm and the fact that I hit this part of my hair hardest with the flat iron, but I just can&#x27;t go much shorter.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and is shiny, plus there is a DRAMATIC reduction in the appearance of split ends.</li>
            <li> Like I said previously, I had been using Emergencee for 2 years and had never had any breakage, but just 2 applications of this stuff</li>
            <li> /&gt;The results:&lt;br /&gt;After a day and a half (</li>
            <li> I saturate my hair, although I avoid the roots, put on a shower cap and leave it on for about half hour.</li>
            <li> I went in skeptical, but with high hopes because of all the rave reviews I read online...  </li>
            <li> It is very thin and fragile from years of braids, weaves, and finally wigs.</li>
            <li> My hair was a mess.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry, brittle and just dull looking this stuff works miracles.</li>
            <li> THE MINUTE RECIEVED IT AND LIKE A MIRACLE, THE LITTLE BIT OF HAIR</li>
            <li> THE LITTLE BIT OF HAIR</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it helps my strands glide past each other without snagging.</li>
            <li> I sometimes also use it to make my hair curly (although you are not really supposed to leave it in as it becomes hard).  </li>
            <li> Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor can really save your hair if you&#x27;re desperately in need of a protein/reconstructing treatment.</li>
            <li> i have chemically processed hair and when i leave it wet for more then a week it looks horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fusion extensions a few times.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a week on towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> I will update this after using this product a few times.</li>
            <li> bought him this 2 years ago, and he used it every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Other reviews that got bad results have left it on for too long or was not use as directed.</li>
            <li> This really helps with my badly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> (I usually leave it on my hair uncovered, until it dries).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, you cannot find half a curl in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I rinse, shampoo and use a moisturizing conditioner (usually the tube that comes with my haircolor).</li>
            <li> that comes about 5-6 inches past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has split ends or excessive breakage.</li>
            <li> my hair was breaking terribly and since I started using this product it stop the breakage instantly and its finally growing back...</li>
            <li> Remember it says to leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes no more.</li>
            <li> I permed my hair in August 2011 thinking I might go for that look rather than messing with my hair each day, but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t stand the look, so I reverted back to heat styling.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair has taken a beating for the past several months.</li>
            <li> Well,  it is expensive in such a small amount and I can&#x27;t even find it in stores now.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this is helping</li>
            <li> It was a whole lot of nothing :(</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34; when dull.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that was a hard protein to use on my hair every 6 weeks</li>
            <li> , I can hardly keep my hands out of it.</li>
            <li> While you are using this treatment this should make your hair hard (with or without heat).  </li>
            <li> I then took off shower cap and stayed another three mins under dryer, my hair was then hard.</li>
            <li> Your hair will get hard and it WILL feel like straw with the product in,  so be patient.  </li>
            <li> im honestly not seeing the hype about this product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it was fried and breaking off, and mushy when wet.</li>
            <li> My hair was really thick</li>
            <li> Saved some seriously damaged hair from the scissors.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I have shared my procedure with all my friends and family.  </li>
            <li> Until I started using this product I had bad hairline breakage, especially where I part my hair, and at the neckline.</li>
            <li> but my third time had bad results</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair and bleach it twice which was not a good decision, but thankfully i heard of this</li>
            <li> it made it greasy and that is not a good look.</li>
            <li> I think his hair started looking shinier, and it helped the small thin “broken” hairs grow out a</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe it!</li>
            <li> no, it just somehow was so weak it was damaged for</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair getting weak</li>
            <li> An insider&#x27;s secret.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and anytime it starts to break, or thin out</li>
            <li> Either my hair is in worse condition than I thought--maybe--or it&#x27;s not the holy grail that some people claim.</li>
            <li> MY BRITTLE, BROKEN AND BEATDOWN HAIR WAS.</li>
            <li> Have been very disappointed with older reformulated products, but decided to try the Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor based on the comments.  </li>
            <li> After three treatments of Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic Reconstuctor, I have seen a dramatic difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> However, the results were not as dramatic as with the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor.</li>
            <li> It provided a dramatic reduction in breakage.</li>
            <li> This drys in my hair rock hard!!</li>
            <li> After you use the product and shampoo, its a bit unsettling because your hair does feel \\&quot;odd\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> so I am always wary of protein treatments.</li>
            <li> is so expensive</li>
            <li> Was expensive stuff too.</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My ends were very weak and jelly feeling and now they don&#x27;t feel as bad.</li>
            <li> Before the treatments, my hair was breaking like crazy.  </li>
            <li> This product have an awful smell and it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS VERY SCARY.  </li>
            <li> Just to keep the results going you have to buy the seperate very expensive bottles..</li>
            <li> I read an Amazon review on how to use Nexus Emergencee to repay badly damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was falling out so bad; if I touched it would just break off in my hands.</li>
            <li> I needed something bad.</li>
            <li> I hate the process to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair has been through  A LOT!!!  </li>
            <li> Also, as a maintenance product you can&#x27;t go wrong!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product for hair care</li>
            <li> I love this!  I am Dominican and every Dominican stylist will recommend this, especially after you have dyed or put highlights on your hair.  A huge difference in your hair.  You can feel and see the change.  Your hair will feel stronger and softer.  I sometimes also use it to make my hair curly (although you are not really supposed to leave it in as it becomes hard).  Def. recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This helped a lot after an all-to-arrogant stylist damaged my hair.  After three uses my hair stopped breaking off.</li>
            <li> This is a great treatment for severely damaged hair.  I have fine hair that I color often.  Really helped to strength it.</li>
            <li> I swear by this products. It gives my hair a &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34; when dull. I use it once every 4-6 weeks, especially after using heating tools. My hair is shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> i reall love this . protein reconstructor and it is great for before you color your hair, leave in small amount before coloring. also, it is a filler, which i found out you are supposed to use before you color or recolor your hair and this bottle will last forever...</li>
            <li> Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor can really save your hair if you&#x27;re desperately in need of a protein/reconstructing treatment. It is fantastic! I purchased this because it is very similar to the Nexxus Emergencee, only this is the professional formula. It works just like Emergencee but I like that its a much bigger bottle for the price. You get 5x the product for only twice as much money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Nexxus reconstructor products my previously over bleached, weak tangling hair has returned to its normal curly self and I will never be without this product again! I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant reduction in the amount of hair I normally lose from brushing or in the shower, my hair just feels thicker in general!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I must say about this product is that it can do wonders for your hair, but only if you use it properly and have realistic expectations. It is a hair Reconstructor and not a deep moisture product so you will need to use a rich moisturizing conditioner after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on clean, slightly damp hair. After fully saturating my hair with the product, I apply low to medium heat for 20 to 30 minutes. This drys in my hair rock hard!! Thats good because it means it has allowed all the protein ingredients to bond correctly to my hair. When its dryed into my hair I carefully wash it out making sure not to disturb the hardened hair until it is rinsed out fully and then I apply the most mosturizing deep conditioner I have. I let that sit in my hair for 30 mins to an hour then rinse and my hair comes out amazing!!! You will notice a huge difference in the condition of your damaged hair after 2-3 treatments depending on how often you use it.  It will just about be back to its previous condition before the damage occured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this stuff to anyone who needs a reconstructing treatment.</li>
            <li> This product it&#x27;s the best, I&#x27;ve been use it for a long time. You woudnt be desagree.</li>
            <li> Saved some seriously damaged hair from the scissors. My hair is not hair-commercial-worthy, but it IS nearly waist-length, formerly bleached (about the last 12&amp;#34; of it), and I can run a brush through it because of this and Infusium&#x27;s leave-in conditioner. I consider this to be a success.</li>
            <li> I am at a loss for words...  I have over-processed hair.  I&#x27;ve dyed it every colour imaginable, including going from bleach blonde to black and back again a number of times.  I&#x27;ve had fusion extensions a few times.  The list goes on... Needless to say, my hair has been through  A LOT!!!  I have tried every conditioner, oil, treatment on the market but nothing seemed to give me the healthy looking hair I used to have.  I honestly thought it was hopeless... until I discovered this MIRACLE product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I&#x27;ve used it twice - two days in a row.  My hair feels so incredibly soft and looks much fuller.  After you use the product and shampoo, its a bit unsettling because your hair does feel \\&quot;odd\\&quot;.  Which is why its important to condition afterwards... and when you do - wow!!!!  I went in skeptical, but with high hopes because of all the rave reviews I read online...  And I must say that it certainly does live up to its expectations.  Anyone with problem, damaged, overprocessed hair - THIS IS A MUST HAVE PRODUCT. 5+++ stars.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! I use this product once every 2 weeks as directed on the bottle and the results are obvious. My hair looks and feels soft smooth and healthy. Remember to wash it out using shampoo and cool water followed by a moisturizing deep conditioner to soften the hair because this product hardens the longer you leave it on.</li>
            <li> The Holy Grail of products for damaged hair as well as ensuring optimum healthy hair!!  This protien treatment is good if you have chemically processed or colored hair. It is powerful so be sure to follow the directions and not overuse....in this case too much will not be a good thing.  Note that a protien treatment can leave your hair feeling somewhat dry as it does it&#x27;s job on your hair.  I found that applying a deep conditioner and semi di Lino moisture treatment afterwards works.  Use with a heating cap for maximum impact. This takes time but it is more than worth it, as you will have shiny, soft, and healthy hair!!</li>
            <li> I have used Nexxus products off and on over the years.  My favorite had always been Nexxus Emergencee, but it appears not to work as well as it did in the past.  I&#x27;ve heard several comments that Nexxus chnaged their formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After damaging my hair with hair color, I decided to try the Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor.  I&#x27;ve heard some people say that this is the professional formulation.  I also used the Humectress Moisturizer and Leave-In Volumizer. I must say that after two applications, my hair has recovered.  Before the treatments, my hair was breaking like crazy.  After one treatment, I noticed less breakage, but after the second treatment, almost all of the breakage stopped.  I&#x27;m glad that I purchased a large bottle, because it&#x27;s a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> This products really works. It made my hair totally different</li>
            <li> If you have been as pissed-off as I have about the new crappy formula for Emergencee, then give this product a try. It is suppose to be for professional and the instructions are a bit different as oppose to Emergencee.  With this treatment, I believe you leave in on for 10mins (I usually leave it on my hair uncovered, until it dries).&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Aloxxi line Emergency: : AQUA, POLYACRYLAMIDOMETHYLPROPANE SULFONIC ACID, GOLLAGEN AMINO ACIDS, HYDROLYZED ELASTIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, METHYLPARABEN, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLARBAMATE, DMDM HYDANTOIN. SIZE : 500 ml&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is you can get 16.9oz for about $30 as oppose to Emergencee&#x27;s 3oz for $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An additional alternative available is Keracare&#x27;s Super Reconstructor as an alternative to Nexxus products.  I prefer the Aloxxi Emergency though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keracare Super Reconstructor: Aqua, Collagen Amino Acids, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium PCA, Methlyparaben, and Imidazolidinyl Urea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, original Emergencee ingredients:  Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid , Water (Aqua) , Collagen Amino Acids , Hydrolyzed Elastin , Propylene Glycol , Hydrolyzed Collagen , Methylchloroisothiazolinone , Methylisothiazolinone , DMDM Hydantoin , Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate , Methylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI Emergencee current black top ingredients: Water (Aqua, Eau), Collagen Amino Acids, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Gelatin, Methylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three months now...I have not really seen any difference.  I bought because my hairdresser recommended it as I am loosing my hair due to health problems.  All my friends love this products though...I will keep on using it for another three months to see what happends....</li>
            <li> ive used this product for about 3 months. im honestly not seeing the hype about this product. i still have to use my products, because this only works for like a day. i leave it in for over 3 hours. then i condition for over 3 hours. im probably going to try the macadamia nut product line next. i really hope i find a product that works for me, because ive spent hundreds of dollars on conditioners to help my hair, because it hasnt grown for over 6 years, and its extremley dry, to the point where if i bend it with shampoo in my hair, itll stay bent; and i mean my ENTIRE head of hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because i use the nexxus hummectress conditioner and love it. I was looking for a product that was a hard protein to use on my hair every 6 weeks and this product is the truth. I love it and this is definately a staple product for me. just be sure to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Very good product, and priced very good thank you</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after I colored my daughter&#x27;s hair, it really help, stopped the breakage. I would recommend this product for anyone who has breakage.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me retain lenght!  I use it every two weeks and my hair is soo shiny and healthy looking.  I will continue to purchase this!  Very happy with the ease of application and the results!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that will work to remedy the 40 volume, high lift blonde, hair color damage on my shoulder length hair. Until I started using this product I had bad hairline breakage, especially where I part my hair, and at the neckline. Now that hair is growing in and I don&#x27;t find all my hair in my brush instead of on my head. It has helped reduce the frizzies from split ends as well, and my hair holds its style longer. If you color, perm or relax your hair, using this product before the chemical service helps reduce porosity and improves the results of the service. Afterwards, it helps to repair the damage that will result from any chemical service, no matter how well executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the product to use if you only have extremely dry hair, this is a repair treatment for chemically damaged hair. You will still need to use your regular conditioner after shampooing. However, if you have both damage, and dry hair, like I had, I would recommnend using Therappe Shampoo, and Humectress Conditioner. I find that trio works very well for me. I am a total Nexxus junkie, they really do make great products.</li>
            <li> I used Nexxus products for years in my youth. My hair was always beautiful. As I aged I thought because of the weaves and coloring, that I would never have the hair of my youth again. Well, I&#x27;m sitting here after using the Polymedic Emergency Conditioner for the first time,and I had to pry myself from the mirror. My hair is gorgeous! I can hardly believe it! It is very thin and fragile from years of braids, weaves, and finally wigs. It has been falling out by the comb full for weeks. I resorted to wearing my hair in ponytails to reduce the stress. I just ran my comb through my hair for the first time without ANY HAIR coming out! Here is my process: I washed it once with Bigon shampoo (just because it is gentle on my colored hair), than I applied the conditioner as outlined in the instructions and placed a shower cap on my hair and let it sit for 20 minutes. I than washed it out with Nexxus Therapee shampoo and conditioned it with Humectress Ultimate Moisture conditioner. I let it sit for 20 minutes, and than washed it out, and blow dried it on low heat.  The amount of volume I have is amazing. It is so soft and bouncy, I can hardly keep my hands out of it. I am so very pleased!!! I will definitely continue to use this product. It stopped the breakage in its tracks!</li>
            <li> I should say first that I am a Nexxus junkie.  About 3 years ago my hairdresser (whom I used to see infrequently) washed my hair with Nexxus once and I fell in love with the smell, so I decided to buy some shampoo and conditioner.  Eventually I discovered Nexxus Emergencee Restorative Strength Conditioning Treatment and was using it for about 2 years with what I thought were decent results. (until I found this!) I have developed a system and I truly believe that this Reconstructor is the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in conjuction with so many other Nexxus products and I&#x27;ll give you a run down of everything I do below.  I will warn all you readers, though about each product.  Be prepared; this is a long review, but informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Therappe Shampoo - It smells great and I really have no complaints.  I havent used any other Nexxus Shampoo, so I dont have much to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment - This is awesome!  I have tried other Nexxus conditioners (Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner, Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner, and Nexxus Hyrda Sleek Silken Smoothing Conditioner) But none compare to the moisturizing power this stuff has.&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Cr&amp;egrave;me - At first this seemed like the answer to my split-end prayers.  It truly, truly does repair split ends.  However, it took my curly/wavy hair (think Halle Berry in Their Eyes Were Watching God movie) to BONE STRAIGHT hair.  Seriously, you cannot find half a curl in my hair.  Obviously, it changes the structure of your hair when it binds the split ends, so be warned if you have curly hair this may very well change your hair&#x27;s structure.  Since it worked so well for me, I continue to use it only on my ends while I allow my curls to grow back.  For my African American readers: It looks like a perm is growing out of my head; curly/wavy at the roots and straight on the ends.  I press myroots and flat iron my hair for work anyway so I dont look too funny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the reason why you are here: Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor - Having used Nexxus Emergencee reconstructor I am familiar with Protein Treatments and the effects on my hair.  Let me be frank, this blows other Reconstructors clear out of the water.  I&#x27;ve used (stinky) Aphogee Keratin Reconstructor and it doesnt even compare.  I learned the hard way that too much protein (as this product is super strength and can easily deliver) will cause your hair to break.  After just 2 applications of this product on my entire head - it caused my edges to break off!  That is how strong this is.  Like I said previously, I had been using Emergencee for 2 years and had never had any breakage, but just 2 applications of this stuff and my hair was looking very rough around my edges.  I should mention also, that during my first 2 applications of this product I left it on for 30 minutes at a time, once a week.  The directions recommend just 10 minutes every 2 weeks.  I stopped applying it to my edges and they recovered in just 2 weeks or so.  All in all, as long as you dont overdo it you will see great results.  If you&#x27;re not asleep yet, keep reading to learn about the steps I take every week to acheive really healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Wash my hair with Nexxus Therappe Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;2.  Allow my hair to air dry until it is only slightly damp and apply Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Cr&amp;egrave;me and leave it in overnight.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Wash out the Promend and apply Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor on my entire head (except my edges).  Cover with a shower cap and leave on for 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Wash out the reconstructor and apply Nexxus Humectress Conditioner, Deep, Hydrating Treatment to slightly damp hair.  Cover with a shower cap for about an hour (while I clean my bathroom or do laundry or something domestic)&lt;br /&gt;5.  Rinse out the conditioner and allow my hair to air dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Heat Style my hair:  Press the roots and edges and use an electric flat iron to straighen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The results:&lt;br /&gt;After a day and a half (EVERY WEEKEND!!!) of repeating this process, my hair is probably the shiniest and bounciest hair you will ever see. It is so soft and healthy, you could run your fingers through it and not hit a snag at all.  As a black woman it feels great when non-black people compliment me on my hair.  Not any of those well-meaning, yet, condesceding remarks such as, \\&quot;Your hair is so cool\\&quot; or \\&quot;Wow, I wish my hair could be like that\\&quot;  I get, \\&quot;Wow, your hair is so pretty\\&quot; and \\&quot;How do you get your hair so soft?\\&quot;  Seriously, I have shared my procedure with all my friends and family.  Although they dont have the dedication or income to buy all the above mentioned products, they have seen some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 9/6/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some extensive research, brought on from reading The Science of Black Hair by Audrey Davis-Sivasothy.  I&#x27;ve realized that although my hair appeared very healthy, it was suffering from too much protein.  This product has large amounts of protein and although that&#x27;s great for your hair, too much is obviously a bad thing.  I&#x27;ve learned what the warning signs are for too much protein and I had to come back and share this with you readers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Protein is supposed to bond with your hair.  While you are using this treatment this should make your hair hard (with or without heat).  If your hair is still soft, WHILE THIS PRODUCT IS ON YOUR HAIR, after a reasonable amount of time, it&#x27;s not binding - That&#x27;s enough protein!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Too much protein causes your hair to become hard and brittle.  No matter how much conditioner, moisturizer, or oil you put on your hair.  If it&#x27;s still hard or crunchy or breaks when you barely touch it while dry - That&#x27;s enough protein!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  When you start to see breakage, that&#x27;s the final straw!  You will see breakage mostly at the roots (as this is the healthiest hair on your head since its the newest).  Your roots are already strong and dont really need that much protein.  If you see breakage at your roots or very close to your scalp - That&#x27;s enough protein!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got too much protein be sure to clarify your hair and give it some time to recover from the protein treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for damaged hair. Mine is literally fried and, before this, it was constantly breaking.  I saw a dramatic difference from the very first use. My hair looked healthier, thicker, bouncier and shinier. And it stopped breaking!!  I use it once a week on towel dried hair. I saturate my hair, although I avoid the roots, put on a shower cap and leave it on for about half hour. I rinse, shampoo and use a moisturizing conditioner (usually the tube that comes with my haircolor). It has literally saved my hair and I will continue using it forever. Highly recommend to anyone with over processed, damaged and fragile hair.</li>
            <li> Over the past ten years, I have literally spent hundreds of dollars on hair products trying to get my healthy thick long hair back! I am an African American woman who has relaxed her hair for many years (probably too many). After three treatments of Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic Reconstuctor, I have seen a dramatic difference in my hair. It is thicker, shinier, more managable and it feels beautiful.  In addition, I have seen a 95% reduction in hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first product review. I usually do not write reviews but because I am so thrilled with this product, I could not wait to share my experience!!! This is the real deal! I would not lie. Women of color (all women), if you had hair like mine and want it back- try Nexxus&#x27; Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor!  It&#x27;s pricey but aren&#x27;t you worth every penny! I plan to stock up before hair&#x27;s best kept secret is made unavailable to the general public!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using since 6month ago, it&#x27;s really works for me. Now my hair is more strong. I can complain about it</li>
            <li> I had ravaged my hair with 40 volume (3 times!). Needless to say it was fried and breaking off, and mushy when wet. After the 1st treatment with nexus, my hair was immediately improved. I put it on when I first get in the shower and was it off last, then shampoo and conditioner after, so I don&#x27;t even leave it on for the full recommended time, and it still has saved my hair to almost normal. The consistancy is almost like glue, and it doesn&#x27;t have a particular smell, and I can&#x27;t live without it! I will buy nexus even after all the damage grows out</li>
            <li> Hair looks beautiful and it&#x27;s not breaking anymore.</li>
            <li> I had gone from black to blonde and back again all in a few years and the most recent time I went blonde, about a month ago, really did a lot of damage to my hair. It didnt even look or feel like hair, it was like straw and I was so desprite for something that would help. I literally tried every leave in conditioner and deep conditioning treatment and nothing even helped a little, then I came across the nexxus polymedic reconstructor and after the first use I noticed a little difference, but after the second use a few days later..thats when the magic happened. My hair, literally, came back to life and looked amazing. This stuff is worth every penny!!! I love it and am so grateful I finally found something to help my hair![[ASIN:B000THCTOO Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor 500ml Big Sale!!]]</li>
            <li> i dont see the big deal with this product, i bought it just because of the reviews and it wasn&#x27;t anything great, it didn&#x27;t improve my hair.</li>
            <li> I will keep reordering this product when needed. I feel like it strengthens my hair.</li>
            <li> My cousin was using this product. She tried it on me and when I saw that it worked I needed to buy my own. After 2 weeks of using the product I immediately started to feel the difference in my hair. When all of my friends noticed the difference I started to feel better about myself. I recommend the product to my sister who is now hooked on it like I am.</li>
            <li> Have been very disappointed with older reformulated products, but decided to try the Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor based on the comments.  I am trilled with this product, my hair has NEVER felt this soft. I use it all the time.  I was very skeptical, but this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ensure used to have 8 ingredients, not including food coloring. The first three were:  Herbal Extract, Grapefruit Juice and protein.  Now it has 37, with water being first and collagen being number 23, if I counted right.  Before I felt it was worth the money, now I question continuing to purchase. It still untangles, but wonder if I&#x27;m using really good conditioners, can I get by with cheaper product for the final rinse.  (The grapefruit smell used to be so pronounced.  Loved it.  Now I don&#x27;t really notice it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Humectress as a conditioner, but saw that Keratin (the ingredient I care most about) dropped from a top ingredient to Number 24.  Glad to read the comments about Nexxus Aloxxi Keramix Protein Reconstructor which puts Keratin back in the top 7.  Will try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of my concerns with Humectress, I was supplementing with Emergencee.  The top ingredient in this product also changed to water.  The product was helpful, and actually the reformulation makes it easier to apply.  However, the results were not as dramatic as with the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor.</li>
            <li> No matter how well I care for my hair I always seem to possess split ends. It is noteworthy that my hair was texturised and is now relaxed. Every time I went to a hairdresser they said I had split ends. I used this product and it improved the texture and thickness of my hair. Additionally my hair required less styling time and was very bouncy. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those reading these reviews please be advised that you  must use a deep mask after using this product or a very rich conditioner as your hair becomes very stiff and matted. After applying the deep mask and washing your hair the texture of your hair will be much improved.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m a Black woman with type 3b/c hair(very wavy, curly ringlets of coarse hair) that comes about 5-6 inches past my shoulders.  I do not use chemical relaxers on my hair, but I do have peroxide coloring to make my hair auburn.  As anyone knows, Black hair is the most fragile of all hair types.  Even though my dark roots look very healthy, my ends are terrible with the constant splitting.  I had been looking for Nexxus Emergencee in every pharmacy around the city, but they were all sold out.  Then someone on Amazon alerted me to the fact that \\&quot;Nexxus Emergencee\\&quot; and \\&quot;Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor\\&quot; contain the same ingredients.  All this time, I&#x27;d been paying $15 per 3.3 oz bottle of Emergencee and here on Amazon the 500 ml bottle of the same formula(professional strength) was $33 for 5 times as much!  The only difference is that the Nexxus Emergencee is left on the hair for 3 minutes, while the Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic is left on the hair for up to 30 minutes.  Be sure to use a super moisturizing conditioner with this product or it will leave your hair feeling stiffer than usual!  Otherwise, my results were beautiful, hair feeling stronger, split ends minimized(my ends were visibly frayed and damaged before using this product), hair looks smooth and soft to the touch.  I&#x27;m SO glad that I bought two bottles of this while it was on sale. ;o)  I will definitely be purchasing more in the future as I work to grow my hair to waist lengths.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It stops breakage &amp; shedding in its tracks. This is a keeper in my product stash. Shipping was quick and price is great!!</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry and damaged (I have relaxed hair). I honestly believed all I needed was a moisturizing deep treatment. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of the emergency protein treatment. 2 Months of constant moisturizing and still no improvement. I&#x27;d tried the aphogee protein treatment as well. I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement still and I decided why not try emergency by nexxus again (haven&#x27;t used it in years)? One use and I noticed an immediate change! My hair was soft and so easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> Its just what you need when you think your hair is damaged beyond repair.&lt;br /&gt;Its awsome, its like steroids for your hair, and a use of it at least twice a month will keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> My sister has been using this product for years and she loves it. She says that it leaves her hair shiny and soft.&lt;br /&gt;It repairs it when it is dry. She has curly hair.</li>
            <li> Now I know I&#x27;ve only used this once so far but WOW!!! I consider my hair to be protein sensitive so I am always wary of protein treatments. The texture of this is not creamy like most conditioners, it is a bit different almost oily in a way but not exactly so don&#x27;t let that throw you off. The effect on my hair was fantastic. It did not feel harsh as it can with some protein treatments ( of course as with all strong protein conditioners you should follow with a mositurising conditioner ). My hair when rinsed looked so shiny. I was quite impressed. I will give more feedback after multiple uses but I think this is a keeper!!!</li>
            <li> My Mom and I have been using this product for years. My Mom has fine relaxed African American hair and I have thick coarse natural African American hair (type 4C for reference), this product works wonders for both of our hair textures. It grows your hair, makes it healthy and strong if you use it regularly (I use it every other week). If you have chemically damaged hair or processed hair, this stuff will bring your strands back to life! Give it a try! I can never find Emergency in stores so I&#x27;m glad I could finally find it here on Amazon. Fast shipping. Reasonable price. No complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural 4a/4b highly porous hair. My hair is naturally porous despite literature stating high porosity is caused by chemicals and or heat. I never put heat to my hair nor do I have any chemicals in my hair. Having said all of that, my hair will not absorb conditioners without using this first. Because of this, I get away with using this stuff every week despite the instructions stating to use every 2 weeks. I&#x27;m glad I discovered this little gem. I do make sure I follow up with a deep conditioner so keep that in mind. If your hair hates protein this isn&#x27;t for you but the high porosity heads will love it.</li>
            <li> After just one use I noticed less split ends and thats what every one pretty much looks for a quick result:)</li>
            <li> I would of gave this product a higher rating, however because I am an African American woman with transitioning hair, when I used the product for the third time, it really dried out my hair and caused more breakage.  You just have to be careful when it comes to any protein based strengthener and make sure your hair is healthy enough to use the product.  The first two times it worked great but my third time had bad results so I won&#x27;t use it again until my transitioning hair grows out and extreme dryness is not a factor.  Right now my hair needs moisture and the protein did not help the situation.</li>
            <li> Makes hair stronger. My hair stylist uses it once a month &amp; my hair loves it. I would def roccomend this to any one whom has chemicals in there hair.</li>
            <li> Great for damaged and over processed hair. Not as good as Nexxus&#x27; original emergencee but a good substitute. More affordable too.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the weapon you need when your hair is in emergency. i have chemically processed hair and when i leave it wet for more then a week it looks horrible. i apply this product and my hair comes out, soft, silky and healthy!! no other product comes close to what this product delivers. WOW!!</li>
            <li> You MUST FOLLOW the directions to get the actual results.  If you do not - your hair will not be silky.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the salon and have been since the 80s. This product is a must for fine hair, damaged hair, over-processed and dull hair. It coats the hair in a polymer of hardness and a reflective surface. This product can be used before coloring and perming. It should be used 3 to 5 times per month at home if you have fine or damaged hair WITH HEAT! I apply it with an iron. Yes, and IRON! You can Google &amp;#34;Mafia Hairdresser&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Emergencee&amp;#34; to find out more ; if you&#x27;re a stylist.&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus is not the best marketer of this product. An insider&#x27;s secret.</li>
            <li> The best reconstructor I&#x27;ve ever used hair is thicker and stronger after first use. I think I&#x27;ll buy the shampoo and conditioner recommended for use with it.</li>
            <li> I was gonna get this product for twice the price at a hair salon. Really works too, love it!</li>
            <li> this is really good for any hair type who has split end issues. It was recommended to me by a coworker 3 years ago and i still use it this day. I would recommend this to anyone who has split ends or excessive breakage. One thing u will definitely need a leave in conditioner after using this and i would recommend using once a week if u dye ur hair followed by a good moisturizing leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> One of the market leaders &amp;iacute;n the field of automated lighting fixtures. They also carry architectural devices and control systems.</li>
            <li> my wife say that&#x60;s the best product money can buy she I highly recommend this stuff to anyone who needs a reconstructing treatment.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT, I HAD A SLEEVE BIATRIC SURGERY FOR WEIGHT LOSS AND LOST 85% OF MY HAIR.  I USED THIS PRODUCT THE MINUTE RECIEVED IT AND LIKE A MIRACLE, THE LITTLE BIT OF HAIR I HAD LEFT STAYED ON MY HEAD.  I HAD BEEN LOOSING MY HAIR IN CLUMPS IT WAS VERY SCARY.  I HAD NOT BRUSHED MY HAIR IN 3 DAYS, AND CONTINUED TO GO TO WORK WITHOUT BRUSHING MY HAIR.  AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT I WAS ABLE TO BRUSH AND SYTLE THE LITTLE BIT OF HAIR THAT I HAD..........THANK GOD FOR THIS PRODUCT.!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Keep hydrating your hair and will recover the shine and smooth because of exceed of chemical treatments.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It makes your hair so healthy. I also will be reordering it from Amazon again. I gone to several stores and could not believe the price they were selling it for.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a really good one and the price was better. Really in love with the way it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> buy an article of Nexxus Emergency Polymedic Recontructor. I get a single product but they made me the duplicate charge on my card. Please review and make the return of the money.</li>
            <li> Since I purchased this product I used it only twice. After using it I really couldn&#x27;t tell any difference like the reviews posted. After  I relaxed my hair I noticed less shedding and the end results were amazing. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> this product is one of the best for hair damage restored back to give it strength  between perms and colors.</li>
            <li> I choose five stars because the product was great prices and it works well.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product smooths my hair, which is prone to frizz, like no body&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: it took me a while to figure out that it was trashing my nails, so wear gloves.</li>
            <li> One of the best out there</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry, brittle and just dull looking this stuff works miracles. You will need to use once a week and you will notice how soft and shiny your hair is.</li>
            <li> This really helps with my badly damaged hair. After my stylist colored my hair following a perm, my hair broke off by the hands full.</li>
            <li> My hair was completely fried from the damage of bleaching it and dying it.I seen an advertisement for Biolustre&#x27;s Hair Repair Treatment. It cost around $50.00 to $60.00 dollars for the kit and the actual repairing treatment only comes in a tiny 4 oz tiny bottle. Biolustre works great dont get me wrong, but if you dont spend the $50.00 for the bottle of shampoo and conditioner to use daily as a sealant, it looses the whole purpose of using the product. The Nexxus Aloxxi Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor is awesome! It repairs past and present damage and makes my hair soft and silky. Another HUGE reason I first tried this product is because you dont have to worry about buying extra shampoo and conditioner from Biolustre,(that is so expensive, it runs around $50-60 bucks for an 8 oz bottle of the combo and does NOT come with the kit that you buy to repair your hair.Just to keep the results going you have to buy the seperate very expensive bottles.. With the Nexxus Reconsructer, you can use whatever brand of shampoo and conditioner you want afteryou use it as long as it&#x27;s a good moisturizing conditioner. My hair still looks gorgeous! I LOVE this stuff! It has repaired my hair by at least 75% the very first use! It&#x27;s a very big bottle for a good price which is great! The more I use it,the more my hair improves and I can see a dramatic difference! This stuff is AWESOME! I&#x27;m HOOKED!</li>
            <li> Different than I thought.  It&#x27;s a gel.  You leave in hair with a cap for 10 minutes with or without heat.  Then use your conditioner.  My hair gets dry, that&#x27;s why. Nice product to seal my split ends! Recommended.</li>
            <li> Using this along with Phyto Organics Theratin Shampoo &amp; Humectin Conditioner will definitely help restore a person&#x27;s hair, especially if you&#x27;re use to using chemicals in your hair. Follow the directions and you should be good to go and well on your way to restoring damaged hair, or just maintaining healthy hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  If you&#x27;re experiencing any hair breakage -- use this product.  Also, as a maintenance product you can&#x27;t go wrong!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good in quality.</li>
            <li> BRILLIANT. I COULD FEEL A DIFFERENCE STRAIGHT AWAY!&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO LOVE THE LATHER EFFECT IT GIVES ON HAIR UNLIKE OTHER PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL DEFINATELY BE BACK FOR MORE&lt;br /&gt;AND BRILLIAANT DELIVERY ALSO AND WORTH THE PRICE TOO</li>
            <li> this product is too strong and damaged my skin, it was red all around finally it went away but it was scary.</li>
            <li> Original product, Im a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product on and off for 4 years now...I have relaxed hair and anytime it starts to break, or thin out I use this for around 4 weeks and instantly I see results. you have to use another conditioner after using it because it leaves your hair very dry and you should not use it every week because it is very strong. it is expensive but it is worth it. my bottle lasts around 6 months because I use it every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> my hair was breaking terribly and since I started using this product it stop the breakage instantly and its finally growing back...love emergency</li>
            <li> When I recommended this product, my hair was really in distress, was excited because I thought it would apply to the results, I have used it several times and have not seen any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> work great, my wife love it.</li>
            <li> Great product,came sealed and tightly closed. No problems at all. ..</li>
            <li> This product was reccomended by my hair salon it is very good for damaged, color treated or over processed hair.The price was a real bargin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 years now and I really like it. It keeps my hair from being completely damaged after straightening it so many times and it&#x27;s great for when I want to leave my hair curly</li>
            <li> After all of the great reviews, I decided to give this product a try. At one time my hair was long , healthy and thick now  my hair is very thin, especially the front , my sides are indeed very short and thin where u could see my scalp,  especially on one side I assume from the perms and dyes. Lately after shampooing I would notice more hair breakage and thinning. I have tried everything nothing seems to work. So I have decided to use this product. I follow all instructions while using Nexxus Polymedic Reconstructor Conditioner, after fifteen mins while under  hair dryer with shower cap my hair was still soft. I then took off shower cap and stayed another three mins under dryer, my hair was then hard. I then deep condition, rinse and set my hair. Results were great, my hair look full yet still thin. My sides around my hairline has more breakage. I  wonder why after fifteen mins under hair dryer, my hair was still soft? and why do I continue to have breakage to my sides that is receding. PLEASE HELP. I will continue to use to see results.</li>
            <li> My hair was a mess. I used this product the first time and my hair was reborn again. The loss and breakage that I saw was minimal. I&#x27;m delighted with what I saw.  It was soft, very easy to manage and didn&#x27;t even had to use my ironing tool to set my hair straight.  I just love the product.  I have relaxed and color treated hair and live in a very humid country (in a Caribbean Island),  where the temperatures are always between 85 and 100 degrees.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I received exactly that I was purchased</li>
            <li> I am seriously impressed. I&#x27;m not the type that expects to see results the first time I use a product; I know these things take time, but you don&#x27;t need to wait with this product. As soon as i put it on my hair, i could see it working. My curls have been so much more springy and well defined since the first use, I cant wait to see how  much healthier my hair will be with the second and third.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several ways. Simply leaving it in for 30 minutes. Leaving in it with a plastic cap. And leaving it in with a plastic cap and applying heat (under a dryer or dryer cap etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have found that it works best when its left on under a cap and being under a dryer applying heat. When I do this, it WORKS. It makes my hair feel like silicon.. Like silky soft and nice. I use it every week (no sure how often you&#x27;re really supposed to use it..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t WASH it out, I use a conditioner to rinse after. I have tried multiple conditioners after and I really find that Nexxus Humectress Deep Hydrating Conditioner definitely makes this stuff work. It maximizes the results. I used it with other conditioners and my hair felt as though I just used the conditioner and nothing else, it just feels plain, and a little dry. But WITH the Humectress, it really feels like silk, it feels really similar to when I do a brazilian keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT. But I do recommend using a plastic cap and heat and rinsing it with Nexxus Humectress.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t overly thrilled with this product, my hair doesn&#x27;t really feel any different. Was expensive stuff too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, TO STRENGTHEN hair, I use it before undergo any chemical process and my hair is always shiny and very bright and strength.</li>
            <li> My hair was strong healthy but i did loose a few strands, specially since it knots right after combing.  I have dyed my hair and bleach it twice which was not a good decision, but thankfully i heard of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I used it just as directed and have had great results. Remember it says to leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes no more. Because this is a protein treatment and too much protein can also harm your hair. Other reviews that got bad results have left it on for too long or was not use as directed. Remember when trying hair products you have to follow directions always later on you can tell if your hair can handle more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on recommendation by a colleague. I use it 2-3 times each month, once a week. After each use, my hair do not break as much.</li>
            <li> My hair is different because I use the product. My hair is lace and Shine.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price; if price was lower it be a great price since I use this all the time for process hair.</li>
            <li> I lost my beautiful, dark, medium-coarse, long hair due to prolonged relaxer overprocessing.  For three years I tried every deep conditioner in and on the market.  I went to salons and had it \\&quot;steamed\\&quot; and processed and all kinds of other things you can imagine.  ONE (I repeat ONE) use of this conditioner and my hair came back more beautiful that it had ever been.  I bought $300 dollars worth on the spot and have never looked back (except to look at my gorgeous hair in the mirror).  From the bottom of my heart, this conditioner is worth every penny you&#x27;ll spend on it. I promise you.</li>
            <li> great choice, worth the price, my hair loves it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this product&lt;br /&gt;This safe my hair&lt;br /&gt;Thanks nexxus</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me and I used it regularly</li>
            <li> I am a aa female with natural hair.  I swear by this product to reverse damage...I&#x27;ve used this when I had color as well as an relaxer....and it repaired damage each time....I recommended it to friends who love it too! The more you use it...the better it works!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this twice since I purchased it.  I apply it every two weeks for 10 minutes and I must say my hair feels silky when i&#x27;m done.  As of right now, I definitely recommend this product for those that have chemically treated hair like myself.</li>
            <li> This is a good repair product I highly recommended</li>
            <li> Its the best product ever, my hair feels stronger and longer since I started to use this product I recommended</li>
            <li> I use this every other week. Works great!</li>
            <li> The reviews made this sound like the greatest thing since sliced bread. I put it on my damaged hair for 20 minutes under a hair bonnet (yup, I even bought a grandma-like bonnet to make sure I got the full effect). It was a whole lot of nothing :(</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for. Since I only use this product every 6-8 weeks it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Nexxus Emergencee Restorative Strength Conditioning Treatment 3.3 Ounce.</li>
            <li> Excellent, good results</li>
            <li> My hair was fried...it was a disaster to me...I have been trying to restore what I could for the last year and take good care of the new growth....I use coconut and argan oils, deep condition with a heat cap for an hour each week and do Redkin CAT protein treatment every two weeks followed by a Redkin deep conditioner....and it&#x27;s coming along.  Then I used this, twice, a week apart and WOW I have healthy hair....thicker, pretty..hair,  not the semi-straw-haylike substance I had grown to accept.  I&#x27;m blown away..... I don&#x27;t think my hair looked this good before it got damaged..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/2013:  I have been using this twice a month for awhile now and.....I Love it!  I will never be without it!  Don&#x27;t forget to wash your hair after using and use a deep conditioner after for an hour....</li>
            <li> I permed my hair in August 2011 thinking I might go for that look rather than messing with my hair each day, but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t stand the look, so I reverted back to heat styling. Needless to say, my hair has taken a beating for the past several months. I tried to preserve it, but I just didn&#x27;t have any luck. I checked out Nexxus&#x27;s Pro-Mend line a while back when I saw it at Costco. The Pro-Mend line did not appear to do anything for my hair except make it sticky. It appears that this is how Pro-Mend works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical. My bangs are badly damaged at the ends due to the perm and the fact that I hit this part of my hair hardest with the flat iron, but I just can&#x27;t go much shorter. If you are looking for something that reduces the appearance of split ends, you might try Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor (Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better). I used it just last night and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs. Dare I say, a stellar job? I believe it fused most of my split ends together as it appears today that they are more or less gone. I know they are still there, but I can&#x27;t see them. It is awesome. This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky. My hair feels soft and is shiny, plus there is a DRAMATIC reduction in the appearance of split ends. I believe continued use of this every two weeks as recommended will prevent further damage to my hair, plus keep those unsightly damaged ends fused together until they can be trimmed. I will update this after using this product a few times.</li>
            <li> Very good help my hair to be health and shine. Also i use it when i want curly hair which keep curl longer</li>
            <li> I read an Amazon review on how to use Nexus Emergencee to repay badly damaged hair.  I bought it and it really worked,  better than Paul Mitchell Super Strength treatment,  and even Aphogee. Well,  it is expensive in such a small amount and I can&#x27;t even find it in stores now. I bought this, thinking it might be the salon version,  and I&#x27;m pretty sure it is. I have super curly 4a African American hair and after just 4 treatments my hair is less frizzy,  more manageable, stronger, and has almost completely stopped breaking and shedding. You CAN use too many protein treatments in too short a period,  so when you see your hair improving use it only every 2-4 weeks for optimal maintenance. Regardless of the instructions, I put it in and blow dry it until it&#x27;s completely dry, as heat is what&#x27;s needed to bind protein to the hair, or I leave it in all day and wash it out... but I can get away with it because I put it in a high pony and it looks like my hair is gelled. Of course, it&#x27;s sticky and will cause your hair to tangle,  so detanged beforehand and don&#x27;t try to come or brush your hair with any type of tools or even fingers.  Just wash it out and deep condition and then it will be soft and manageable. Your hair will get hard and it WILL feel like straw with the product in,  so be patient.  You may need to condition 2 or 3 time but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I bought it and used the whole bottle, tried other products,  and realized that I will never switch again as long as this stuff is around.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. It has made an improvement in my hair, but I&#x27;m not seeing the drastic changes most people are speaking of in their reviews.</li>
            <li> i am of african american decent with permed hair that breaks in the middle. every time i comb out my hair i see alot of strands on the comb. i kid you not, after i use this product, if i see five strands on the comb, thats alot. this product is awesome. please follow directions and if you have alot of damage, use this every two weeks and follow with the macademia oil deep repair mask.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,for treatment of damage hair</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars. I had my hair colored to a pretty golden blond from jet black and about a month later got a relaxer......big no, no! My hair was falling out so bad; if I touched it would just break off in my hands. I went to a Sallys and the manager there told me to try to find this product and that it would be my best friend. She wasn&#x27;t kidding. My hair was really thick and it&#x27;s about half the thickness, from losing so much. I didn&#x27;t think this Emergency treatment would work so fast, but I&#x27;m a believer now. Everyday, I would comb my hair and so much would come out. Well this morning, the day after doing the treatment I had 3 strands of hair in the comb (yes I counted them) LOL. I wish I would have known about this before losing so much of my hair, but I&#x27;m confident this product will help get my hair back on track! I&#x27;m so excited about the results.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! this is a very good product!! My hair was very damaged from bleaching it and with this product it leaves your hair nice and silk from the 1st time you use it.</li>
            <li> this is the best product anyone can use on thier damaged hair and even healthy hair, to use as a gel.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a while and it gives my hair the strength it needs. Great product! I will purchase definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help frizzy hair it made it greasy and that is not a good look. Hair looked like I didn&#x27;t wash it for a week.</li>
            <li> it brought back my hair in one use.. i had hair damage from dying my hair to much.and now im jus in love with my results</li>
            <li> My boyfriend neglected his hair for years and it was pretty damaged. Hair dressers said it looks like breakage and asked if he wore hats a lot etc... no, it just somehow was so weak it was damaged for no physical reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought him this 2 years ago, and he used it every few weeks. We saw an improvement. I think his hair started looking shinier, and it helped the small thin “broken” hairs grow out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i believe he keeps buying it himself now and using it every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;It’s definitely not a waste, as it’s a product that works and makes you want to keep using/buying it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! If used correctly it strengthens your hair amazingly and without compromise of its softness! I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again. It&#x27;s great to use every other week or monthly.</li>
            <li> I have used This produt before and i like because it helps to have a healty hair...</li>
            <li> This is a real beauty secret! My hair started falling out due to stress. I used this on my hair for about 4-5 months every 2 weeks and my hair is now down my back about 16 inches, thick, shiny and healthy. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier!! I have relaxed hair so I roller set it and sit under the dryer after using the emergency recontructor which works just fine for me. Secret to healthy hair &#x3D; being happy + polymedic emergency reconstructor lol :)</li>
            <li> I cannot tell if this is having a major impact on my hair. My hair is all-natural and it does not have any damage as it is. I purchased this to help to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for your hair</li>
            <li> Very good product. It have my hair volume and it stopped it from falling like 80% . I really recommend for anyone that has damaged hair</li>
            <li> The stuff in This bottle is amazing. I have seen a huge difference since I was introduced at the hair salon. My hair was relaxed, dyed and bleached all within 8 weeks. I needed something bad. I&#x27;ve been using this once a week and have seen a huge change in my hair texture.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this is helping but I love the fact that my curls come out more defined when I use it. Is it making my hair stronger? IDK Ive only used it three times. I dont like washing with shampoo after, instead I cowash (for my naturalistas)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill come back in a month and update this review if anything significantly changes</li>
            <li> IF YOUR HAIR IS BREAKING YOU MUST BUY &amp;#34;EMERGENCY&amp;#34;  FOLLOWING  INSTRUCTIONS AND BE KIND TO YOUR HAIR THE RESULT ARE AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I love the product it&#x27;s just what my hair needs, very reasonably priced and the delivery was also very fast</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product it gives my hair strength. I noticed my hair getting weak that is why i bought it. I have been using it for years now and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got in  the shower and left it on for about 10 minutes, and washed it off, and I could already feel that my hair felt a lot stronger. My hair has been dyed and bleached for the past 2 years, so this stuff really helped. My ends were very weak and jelly feeling and now they don&#x27;t feel as bad. Highly recommend this for damaged hair!!!  Even though it is on the pricey side, it works! Better to use this than having to cut off hair. (:</li>
            <li> The variety of application methods other users recommend is pretty varied, from sleep in it to use as directed in the shower. I tried both and found that it does work a bit better if left in longer, BUT, it does strip color out like mad. So, use it only before you&#x27;re going to color or you will look like a troll doll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that my roots were very healthy after a couple of uses, but the ends were not as healthy as I had hoped. Either my hair is in worse condition than I thought--maybe--or it&#x27;s not the holy grail that some people claim. I think the truth is somewhere in the middle--it&#x27;s a good protein conditioner, but I don&#x27;t know if you want to let it dry on your hair until it&#x27;s rock hard the way some people recommend.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and get a bleach/weave every 8 weeks.  My hair is very dry. This product didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, but I don&#x27;t have much breakagejust tons of split ends. vo-5 or olive oil does more for my hair than this product.  I gave it to my daughter and it does help her hair so I have given it 3 stars.  I tried Wen shampoo it works wonders on my split ends.</li>
            <li> I died my hair blond and it was really dry. After using this I could see the results the very first time . Specially when you warm it up its even better</li>
            <li> so far its the first day i tried it and my friend told me my hair looks nice and shiney. I need to see how it will do through time to see if my hair gets more thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner saved my hair after a very horrible experience with aphogee two step protein treatment which broke off my hair and cause a massive shedding, this was the only thing that stopped the shedding, it is wonderful, but follow the instructions carefully and do not overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy this at my local beauty supply store,</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product.  This product have an awful smell and it was a waste of money.  Please verify the product before sending it to the customer.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist who tends to like very blond hair. This product keeps it from breaking off. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Help the hair and stop it from breaking.  I used it for a while now. It also add lots natural shine to the hair.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This reconstructor does more for my chemically damaged hair than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I hope it&#x27;s is still available, it doesn&#x27;t seem to around as much as it used to be.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product notice a difference after 3 uses</li>
            <li> I love this product&lt;br /&gt;but I hate the process to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair,&lt;br /&gt;make sure its detangled&lt;br /&gt;Add said product&lt;br /&gt;wait for it to dry on my hair (15 mins)&lt;br /&gt;then rinse it off&lt;br /&gt;it helps my strands glide past each other without snagging.</li>
            <li> it leaves your hair soft. you can see the results right away.  see shine to your hair.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way works in my hair . love it .</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF HAS CHANGED MY HAIR&#x27;S FUTURE FORREAL!!!!... - I AM AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WITH RELAXED HAIR. WELL, AFTER A PERM MISHAP AND LACK OF PROTEIN N MY HAIR REGIMEN. YO GUESSED IT.... IT ALL CAME TUMBLING DOWN. MY HAIR WAS &amp;#34;BSL&amp;#34; AND I ENDED UP HAVING TO CUT IT TO NECK LENGTH &amp;#34;nl&amp;#34;. I FOUND THIS PRODUCT ON YOUTUBE AND DID THE POROSITY TEST ON MY HAIR AND IT IS VERY POROUS. THEN I ORDERED TWO PRODUCTS.. NEXXUS EMERGENCEE FOR IMMEDIATE PROTEIN RECONSTRUCTION AND ROUX POROSITY CORRECTOR TO CONTROL THE POROSITY. WELL, I DID THE NEXXUS PROTEIN TREATMENT FIRST AND THEN APPLIED THE ROUX POROSITY CORRECTOR. .... DRUMROLL PLEASE...I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW EXTREMELY SOFT AND WELL MOISTURIZED MY BRITTLE, BROKEN AND BEATDOWN HAIR WAS. THE NEXXUS PROTEIN TREATMENT MADE IT EXTREMELY STRONG INSTANTLY AND THE ROUX POROSITY CORRECTOR MADE THE CONDITIONING DIFFERENCE... I WILL ALWAYS RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE RELAXED POROUS HAIR. I LOVE IT... ALSO IT WORKS WONDERS WITH YOUR OWN CONDITIONER ALSO. IT IS REALLY AN AMAZING PRODUCT....

            <li> It worked instantly on my hair. The breakage stopped</li>
            <li> My #1 go to for shedding &amp; breakage</li>
            <li> I saw immediate improvement in the amount of shedding my hair was doing. I have very long, relaxed hair which is prone to breakage. I&#x27;ll likely target using this monthly. It provided a dramatic reduction in breakage. Hair feels a lot stronger.</li>
