    <ol>
            <li>This is a GORGEOUS color!!!  </li>
            <li>THIS IS PERFECT FOR ME.</li>
            <li>Absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li>Great product!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Opi is the best of the best in nail colors</li>
            <li>Perfect bling for the Holidays.</li>
            <li>That being said, this looks great with an under color and a 2-3 glitter layers (and topcoat...) or applying about 6 layers of the glitter.</li>
            <li>Looks great over another contrasting color.</li>
            <li>I have gotten SO many compliments on this polish!!  </li>
            <li>The glitter is a beautiful, bright purple with silver flecks as well.  </li>
            <li>Allow a good amount of drying time between applications.</li>
            <li>this became bullet proof, staying in good condition for about 7 days.</li>
            <li>I love the OPI Muppets Collection &amp; this is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>I still love it!  </li>
            <li>and she liked it.</li>
            <li>With one coat it looks lighter and its nice, but you can also apply 2 coats if desired.</li>
            <li>Not one of OPI&#x27;s best by far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lovely pink and the perfect multi-sized glitter.</li>
            <li>I so love the color of the nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish</li>
            <li>but when most of the polish chips away, it&#x27;s time to start over.  </li>
            <li>If you get it knowing that, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>If you love glitter on the nails, this is on the chunky side.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Polish and it is really cute.</li>
            <li>sure glad I did because I found it.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I gave it 4/5 stars because I wish it was easier to apply the glitter pieces more uniformly...</li>
            <li>AND love the name ^_^</li>
            <li>I love this polish, divine swine.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and so sparkle</li>
            <li>in all I am happy with it and will continue to use it, just need better polish remover for this particular polish.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!!</li>
            <li>My nails looked gorgeous for exactly one day, then it started chipping off.  </li>
            <li>Polish is very bright and shiny, but only the sparkles stay.  </li>
            <li>It is a very pretty purple looks better on then in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Beautiful over purple or pink polishes.</li>
            <li>It looks amazing and like most glitters, it lasts a super long time and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.  </li>
            <li>It takes a good 15 minutes with multiple applications of remover.</li>
            <li>There are different sizes of glitter to give it dimension and for good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I was using a store brand remover, but this one works fine for other polishes I have, not as good as cutex though...</li>
            <li>Awesome color and long lasting too!</li>
            <li>AM A MUPPETS FAN &amp; WANTED TO TRY THIS BRIGHT PINK SPARKLE POLISH.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you know that this is a clear polish with silver and purple flakes in it.</li>
            <li>The color is so pretty a fine purple glitter with sliver large glitter</li>
            <li>Fab color for glittery fun  Best to wear a solid color under to really look like it does in the bottle so buy a similiar solid to wear as first coat....</li>
            <li>You have to have time to do this to get it right.</li>
            <li>This color is super pretty when paired with a similar color and used as a top coat.</li>
            <li>I have had strangers compliment my nails with the latter method, which is fun, and it does look very cool.</li>
            <li>I will probably order some more in the future..  </li>
            <li>The glittery nails are pretty</li>
            <li>The glitter of Devine Swine is pretty</li>
            <li>Very sparkly!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!  </li>
            <li>This polish is really pretty.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I put about 5 coats on</li>
            <li>I used an opaque, light base color (also from OPI) and sealed with Seche Vite (best top coat by far, ever).  </li>
            <li>It is an awesome top coat, I used OPI Plugged in Plum as the base coat.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping OPI glitter polishes like Divine Swine would offer more pigment on a single application, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Because of the large glitter in it, I had to soak my nails in the remover for awhile</li>
            <li>I really like glitter polish.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be doing this very often...</li>
            <li>I scrubbed so much that it torn up the foam spongy thing in my remover bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about 9 hours from where they ship it from solo fast</li>
            <li>Thanks so much...</li>
            <li>I love the glitter, but it does require 4-5 cots to cover nails with-out other color underneath.</li>
            <li>but you have to apply like 3-4 coats to get it to really show up, and it goes on mostly clear rather</li>
            <li>Easy off too, as long as you only put one or 2 coats on.</li>
            <li>Even pure acetone took about 15 minutes to remove from all ten fingers.</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the color doesn&#x27;t chip it comes off as a whole piece.</li>
            <li>It has a nice thin speckled purplish color with the thicker silverish shiny confetti.</li>
            <li>Awesome, but needs a base.</li>
            <li>Stays on the nails long, too; it&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li>The bad thing is after a week, when it started to chip (that is a lonnnngg time as per my standards, great polish)</li>
            <li>With a base coat it was beautiful.  </li>
            <li>it was soo pretty!!) , and it was very hard to get off, so use sparingly.</li>

            <li> Color is GREAT over a raspberry pink polish (this needs a base as it is just clear with pink glitter).</li>
            <li> If possible a clear coat should be put on everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put this over red, pink, even silver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small purple glitter with large round silver glitter.</li>
            <li> I do recommend starting with a base coat similar to the glitter color, as it&#x27;s easy to build on the solid color and takes way less polish.  </li>
            <li> Does need to be put on carefully so that the glitter can be seen on every nail.</li>
            <li> I use it over a pink.</li>
            <li> The product came as expected but took a while to ship.</li>
            <li> i WEAR A LOT OF PINK &amp; OTHER</li>
            <li> Goes so well with my other color collection.   </li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> (though I think that&#x27;s largely due to the Seche Vite).  </li>
            <li> The color is pretty, but the coverage is really mediocre.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic, but as a stand alone shade it was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this shade a few weeks ago and couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this hang-up with other glitter polishes even ones suspended in a clear base.  </li>
            <li> One issue, its hard to get the glitter off.</li>
            <li> You need a base color for there to be much impact.  </li>
            <li> so once every other day I will add a coat so that they don&#x27;t look so bad</li>
            <li> It was also very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Base coat/6 layers/top coat and</li>

            <li> I really like glitter polish. I was hoping OPI glitter polishes like Divine Swine would offer more pigment on a single application, but it doesn&#x27;t. That being said, this looks great with an under color and a 2-3 glitter layers (and topcoat...) or applying about 6 layers of the glitter. I have had strangers compliment my nails with the latter method, which is fun, and it does look very cool. You have to have time to do this to get it right. Allow a good amount of drying time between applications. Base coat/6 layers/top coat and this became bullet proof, staying in good condition for about 7 days. You also have to have time to remove it. It takes a good 15 minutes with multiple applications of remover. I won&#x27;t be doing this very often...</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish and I have a rather extensive collection.  I bought this shade a few weeks ago and couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on.  My nails looked gorgeous for exactly one day, then it started chipping off.  I understand that polish chips so once every other day I will add a coat so that they don&#x27;t look so bad but when most of the polish chips away, it&#x27;s time to start over.  With this polish it literally took me an entire afternoon to get off.  Because of the large glitter in it, I had to soak my nails in the remover for awhile and then I had to start scrubbing! I scrubbed so much that it torn up the foam spongy thing in my remover bottle.  Even my husband noticed the effort I was putting into getting this stuff off and that is saying something.  The glittery nails are pretty but I will think twice before I paint my nails with these types of colors again. Going to stick with regular solid polish colors from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a GORGEOUS color!!!  The glitter is a beautiful, bright purple with silver flecks as well.  There are different sizes of glitter to give it dimension and for good coverage.  I do recommend starting with a base coat similar to the glitter color, as it&#x27;s easy to build on the solid color and takes way less polish.  I recommend this 100%!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this polish was clear and needed multiple coats or a color base coat to look bright.  With a base coat it was beautiful.  It was also very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I love the OPI Muppets Collection &amp; this is one of my favorites! It&#x27;s small purple glitter with large round silver glitter. Beautiful over purple or pink polishes. One issue, its hard to get the glitter off. To remove, I suggest the jar removers with the foam inside that you place your finger in &amp; twist. Otherwise you&#x27;ll go thru 20 cotton pads.</li>
            <li> It is a very pretty purple looks better on then in the bottle.Lots and lots of sparkles,my daugher loves how the color looks on her toes.Does need to be put on carefully so that the glitter can be seen on every nail.Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the color doesn&#x27;t chip it comes off as a whole piece. If possible a clear coat should be put on everyday.</li>
            <li> Color is GREAT over a raspberry pink polish (this needs a base as it is just clear with pink glitter). Getting it OFF your nails is something else altogether. Even pure acetone took about 15 minutes to remove from all ten fingers.</li>
            <li> AM A MUPPETS FAN &amp; WANTED TO TRY THIS BRIGHT PINK SPARKLE POLISH.  i WEAR A LOT OF PINK &amp; OTHER PASTELS SO THIS IS PERFECT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> This color is super pretty when paired with a similar color and used as a top coat. The glitter of Devine Swine is pretty but you have to apply like 3-4 coats to get it to really show up, and it goes on mostly clear rather the the purple that I thought it was going to be. Like I said, use a basecoat of silver, purple, or another color that is in Devine Swine and it&#x27;s fantastic, but as a stand alone shade it was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> Sent it to a girlfriend, she painted her toes and fingers and sent me pics. I like the color and she liked it.</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty a fine purple glitter with sliver large glitter I ordered it on the 6th and it got delivered to me today on the 8th at 11 am I&#x27;m about 9 hours from where they ship it from solo fast I will be ordering from them again</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend after reading other reviews. Make sure you know that this is a clear polish with silver and purple flakes in it. If you get it knowing that, you&#x27;ll love it. Looks great over another contrasting color. Stays on the nails long, too; it&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li> If you love glitter on the nails, this is on the chunky side.  This looks great over a base color.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Polish and it is really cute. It has a nice thin speckled purplish color with the thicker silverish shiny confetti. Absolutely beautiful! With one coat it looks lighter and its nice, but you can also apply 2 coats if desired. Very sparkly! The bad thing is after a week, when it started to chip (that is a lonnnngg time as per my standards, great polish) I tried to get it off with the nail polish remover and the smaller speckles came off easier, but the larger ones wouldn&#x27;t. I had to soak the nails in polish in order to get it off. I was using a store brand remover, but this one works fine for other polishes I have, not as good as cutex though... I recommend using a stronger nail polish remover if using this product.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am happy with it and will continue to use it, just need better polish remover for this particular polish.</li>
            <li> Polish is very bright and shiny, but only the sparkles stay.  You need a base color for there to be much impact.  I use it over a pink.</li>
            <li> Awesome, but needs a base. I&#x27;ve put this over red, pink, even silver.  It looks amazing and like most glitters, it lasts a super long time and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.  It&#x27;s a very lovely pink and the perfect multi-sized glitter.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this nail polish anywhere so I decided to get on line and look up&lt;br /&gt;OPI sure glad I did because I found it.  Love it and I wear it all the time even&lt;br /&gt;on my toes.  Everyone is always asking me where they can buy it.  Now that I found it on line I will spread the word. Fast delivery too!  Thanks so much...</li>
            <li> Fab color for glittery fun  Best to wear a solid color under to really look like it does in the bottle so buy a similiar solid to wear as first coat....</li>
            <li> I have gotten SO many compliments on this polish!!  I used an opaque, light base color (also from OPI) and sealed with Seche Vite (best top coat by far, ever).  It didn&#x27;t chip (though I think that&#x27;s largely due to the Seche Vite).  I gave it 4/5 stars because I wish it was easier to apply the glitter pieces more uniformly...I don&#x27;t have this hang-up with other glitter polishes even ones suspended in a clear base.  I still love it!  AND love the name ^_^</li>
            <li> The color is pretty, but the coverage is really mediocre. Not one of OPI&#x27;s best by far. I&#x27;d keep shopping.</li>
            <li> I love this polish, divine swine.  It is an awesome top coat, I used OPI Plugged in Plum as the base coat.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  I love the color and so sparkle and so 2013.&lt;br /&gt;Opi is the best of the best in nail colors</li>
            <li> This polish is really pretty. There&#x27;s flecks of all different colors of glitter. Easy off too, as long as you only put one or 2 coats on. The first time I used it, I put about 5 coats on (I couldn&#x27;t help it- it was soo pretty!!) , and it was very hard to get off, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Perfect bling for the Holidays. I love the glitter, but it does require 4-5 cots to cover nails with-out other color underneath. The product came as expected but took a while to ship.</li>
