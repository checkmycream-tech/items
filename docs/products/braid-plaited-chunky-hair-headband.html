            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>But it nonetheless matches my hair very nicely.  </li>
            <li>and I own all kinds of gair pieces!</li>
            <li>Seriously, a good buy.  </li>
            <li>matched my hair,  also good quality</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look great with my hair and you can kind of tell it&#x27;s synthetic.</li>
            <li>Pros:  + Quality of \\&quot;hair\\&quot; is nice.  </li>
            <li>+ Looks nice once installed    </li>
            <li>Braid is nice but the making is not.</li>
            <li>It is excellent quality &amp; very well priced .</li>
            <li>Really nice.  </li>
            <li>I thought this is the most amazing  plated braid that I have ever had .</li>
            <li>I really liked it, had I gotten the right color I would have loved it.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought more.</li>
            <li>It looks stunning on.</li>
            <li>It was a perfect braid and the color was truly as described, Just wish I could have ordered the same shade as my braided buns Thank you</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>mix of blonde and brown looked the best for my hair.</li>
            <li>While the braid is nice, the glue and tape used to attach the braid to the elastic band is cheap and is coming off already ...</li>
            <li>Love it; get all kinds of compliments.</li>
            <li>I really like my new headband, it is a perfect match to my haircolor and the quality is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The product is better than I expected, and fits perfectly with my hair color!</li>
            <li>(But once covered it is fine --&gt;</li>
            <li>It took a long time to get to me, but then I realized it was coming from Great Britain.  </li>
            <li>But the effect looks nice, yes, once properly done...</li>
            <li>Only problem I had with it is that the elastic band comes all the way up to my ears, so I can&#x27;t hide the band and make it look like it&#x27;s braided from my own hair.</li>
            <li>It was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>I decided to keep this though, because the quality is so nice even though it&#x27;s not real hair, in case I decide to change my hair color.</li>
            <li>The quality of braid is excellent but color was wrong ;-(</li>
            <li>it has the spears of blond as indicated which matches light brown hair better sometimes than just a plain solid color ....and makes it look more natural............</li>
            <li>but you still worry, what if I move by hair too much</li>
            <li>It looks like real hair and doesn&#x27;t have the overly shiny look like alot of hairpieces do.  </li>
            <li>looks real</li>
            <li>It would have five stars, but the color was too dark for me, so I ordered the blonde mix braid form Vanessa Grey and it was a perfect match.</li>
            <li>It is a quality product with reasonable price for item and shipping.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Feels real.</li>
            <li>Looks real</li>
            <li>- Won&#x27;t look nice if you don&#x27;t have a lot or thick hair: to cover the extremities of the braid.  </li>
            <li>Shockingly surprised at how it blended with my dark blonde and my 5 year olds golden light brown hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute but 6 months later the hair is starting to have little strands pop out of the braiding.</li>
            <li>If only the hair part were a couple inches longer, it would be more easily hidden.</li>
            <li>- Band is rather large, you can always tighten it, but requires some extra work    </li>
            <li>I attached mine to an actual hard headband to keep it from slipping off of my head when I move around and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I gave it to my 13 yr old neice</li>
            <li>: I have several  natural shades: dark blond, light brown, cinnamon, and some strawberry / honey blond.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll watch for Vanessa grey from now on.  </li>
            <li> I ordered to be delivered in Brazil and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> This braided band is thick &amp; very well made .</li>
            <li> Once again if you have long thick hair, then it may not bother you and you can easily hide the thick extremeties.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if the extremities were nicer and the braid longer (so at least these extremeties could be really hidden under the hair), it would worth it.  </li>
            <li> This is dark blonde, can be used with brown hair.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too wide and it doesn&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> Handle carefully.</li>
            <li> These are greenish colors, different shades of bullfrog green to a rock toad color.</li>

            <li> I finally found a thick braid</li>

            <li> but I still was not able to figure it out.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to tell from online photos which hair color will match.</li>
            <li> They are not nicely done and they are glued with some tape around.</li>
            <li> apologize  for any negative feedback it was intended to be towards another store.</li>
            <li> The braid is thick, and if the colors were that that looked human-I would recommend.</li>
            <li> and they are very thick and very hard to hide / cover.</li>
            <li> - the extremities look UGLY</li>
            <li> and it uncovers the ugly sides!?)  </li>

            <li> Shockingly surprised at how it blended with my dark blonde and my 5 year olds golden light brown hair.  She wore it on picture day, nobody knew until she whipped it off afterwards!  Seriously, a good buy.  I&#x27;ll watch for Vanessa grey from now on.  Awesome blend technique, I&#x27;ve seen nothing like it... and I own all kinds of gair pieces!</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought more. It looks stunning on. I gave it to my 13 yr old neice and she loves it. I am 53 and also want one as well. It is beautiful quality and is a perfect addition to make your hair look fab.!!!</li>
            <li> Pros:  + Quality of \\&quot;hair\\&quot; is nice.  + Color was matching my hair: I have several  natural shades: dark blond, light brown, cinnamon, and some strawberry / honey blond. The one I ordered has almost all of them except the redish tones. But it nonetheless matches my hair very nicely.  + Looks nice once installed    Cons:  - Won&#x27;t look nice if you don&#x27;t have a lot or thick hair: to cover the extremities of the braid.  - the extremities look UGLY (photo attached) and they are very thick and very hard to hide / cover. Maybe there is a technique but I still was not able to figure it out. They are not nicely done and they are glued with some tape around. (But once covered it is fine --&gt; but you still worry, what if I move by hair too much and it uncovers the ugly sides!?)  - Band is rather large, you can always tighten it, but requires some extra work    For the price ($18), to me, the quality has not been met fully. Braid is nice but the making is not. Maybe if the extremities were nicer and the braid longer (so at least these extremeties could be really hidden under the hair), it would worth it.  Once again if you have long thick hair, then it may not bother you and you can easily hide the thick extremeties.  But the effect looks nice, yes, once properly done...</li>
            <li> It was a perfect braid and the color was truly as described, Just wish I could have ordered the same shade as my braided buns Thank you</li>
            <li> i like the headband, but i thought it would be larger than it is.</li>
            <li> I really liked it, had I gotten the right color I would have loved it. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> just beautiful...It took a while to get here, but I like it! it has the spears of blond as indicated which matches light brown hair better sometimes than just a plain solid color ....and makes it look more natural............love it!&lt;br /&gt;jean selman&lt;br /&gt;Idaho-USA</li>
            <li> This is dark blonde, can be used with brown hair. Only problem I had with it is that the elastic band comes all the way up to my ears, so I can&#x27;t hide the band and make it look like it&#x27;s braided from my own hair. If only the hair part were a couple inches longer, it would be more easily hidden.</li>
            <li> I really like my new headband, it is a perfect match to my haircolor and the quality is amazing.  It looks like real hair and doesn&#x27;t have the overly shiny look like alot of hairpieces do.  The braid itself is substantial and not one of those skinny braids that you see in the discount stores.  I attached mine to an actual hard headband to keep it from slipping off of my head when I move around and it works great.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I like it. looks real</li>
            <li> It would have five stars, but the color was too dark for me, so I ordered the blonde mix braid form Vanessa Grey and it was a perfect match. It can be hard to tell from online photos which hair color will match. I decided to keep this though, because the quality is so nice even though it&#x27;s not real hair, in case I decide to change my hair color.</li>
            <li> This braided band is thick &amp; very well made . It is excellent quality &amp; very well priced . Very good customer service.</li>
            <li> I like that I finally found a thick braid but it is a bit too big for my head.  Will have to cut a piece of the elastic in back and then sew it together again.&lt;br /&gt;The mix of blonde and brown looked the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> The quality of braid is excellent but color was wrong ;-(</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters Anna Haloween Costume.  My other daughters have even worn it to school &amp; received compliments.  It&#x27;s very cute but 6 months later the hair is starting to have little strands pop out of the braiding.</li>
            <li> I loved it! The product is better than I expected, and fits perfectly with my hair color! I ordered to be delivered in Brazil and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get to me, but then I realized it was coming from Great Britain.  It was worth the wait.  It is a quality product with reasonable price for item and shipping.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> While the braid is nice, the glue and tape used to attach the braid to the elastic band is cheap and is coming off already ... I don&#x27;t like the way it feels when I have it on, it&#x27;s too wide and it doesn&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> matched my hair,  also good quality</li>
            <li> Really nice.  Quality materials.  Handle carefully.</li>
            <li> Love it; get all kinds of compliments.</li>
            <li> A little to dark but not ad. Thank you, granrad77</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look great with my hair and you can kind of tell it&#x27;s synthetic.</li>
            <li> I thought this is the most amazing  plated braid that I have ever had . I bought 2 of them excellent  est&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exstrstroidinary  pieces.&lt;br /&gt;I apologize  for any negative feedback it was intended to be towards another store.</li>
            <li> Feels real. Looks real</li>
            <li> I have no idea what colors these are suppose to be, I can tell you which colors are NOT in this braid. The braid is thick, and if the colors were that that looked human-I would recommend. These are greenish colors, different shades of bullfrog green to a rock toad color.</li>
