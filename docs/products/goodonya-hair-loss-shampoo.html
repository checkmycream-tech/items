            <li>Great shampoo for my short graying hair.</li>
            <li>I was offered this Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo with Manuka Honey from GoodOnYa for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, and I couldn&#x27;t order it fast enough.</li>
            <li>What I got was beautifully clean</li>
            <li>Received at discount for review, makes my hair so soft and full of body and smells good, makes my hair not frizzy and at the same time its giving me healthy hair love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using only Good</li>
            <li>I love a personal care product that is fragrance free, sulfate free, paraben free.</li>
            <li>I felt my hair was truly clean for the first time!</li>
            <li>Love this made my hair do soft no more split ends wonderful flag I found it don&#x27;t stop selling it</li>
            <li>( Overall, I am really enjoying this brand and will probably buy again. :-)</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo from GoodOnYa for anyone who wants a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to find out if it will help grow my hair, but I can say that it does a nice job and leaves my hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li>GoodOnYa has such great Manuka Honey products that leave your hair feeling salon soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>i love that it is made of natural ingredients but has no funky smell as i was expecting.  </li>
            <li>This is really more designed for seriously damaged hair or at best to use as a monthly deep cleaning/conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s exactly what I did.  </li>
            <li>it does leave my hair soft, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say there is anything interesting or different about this from off-the-shelf stuff.</li>
            <li>Amazing shampoo that doesn&#x27;t way your hair down.</li>
            <li>As a highly sensitive person that is very important to me with personal care products.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much heathlier than before.</li>
            <li>I am no longer loosing as much hair as before.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer now and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have been loosing a lot of hair prior to this shampoo, but now, it has subsided quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After the very first day, I noticed that when I was getting dressed after my shower, I bent over to pull on my boots, which is when I would normally brace for the burning, cracking, itching of the skin on my back, and it didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it cleans my hair without any harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>I met the folks behind Good</li>
            <li>BUT I figured I would follow through and see just how my hair reacted to this new product.</li>
            <li>Love how it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals and is all natural..</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair very soft and silky feeling</li>
            <li>I used this for 4 shampoos and this just made my hair feel coarse,not clean like other non sulfate shampoo,s</li>
            <li>I expected more suds and a less positive effect.....................</li>
            <li>so I imagine it will last a long time, making it a very economical choice.</li>
            <li>My expectations were pretty low, as over the years I had been less than thrilled with other products.  </li>
            <li>Have to use too much for only shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>It has completely solved my itchy, flaky scalp problem.  </li>
            <li>Soft &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li>its feels so soft and silky</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>Made my hair look good, I have thick wavey dark brown hair</li>
            <li>I wanted to slow down that process and treat my hair to good products.</li>
            <li>It rinses out well, leaves my hair feeling clean and not over stripped, and my hair is shinier, healthier, softer, less frizzy, but still losing hair at same rate.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>come out at a time, but it hasn&#x27;t been nearly the same amount.</li>
            <li>many other low lathering protective shampoos and conditioners out there for the cost of this small bottle.</li>
            <li>Before it was hard due to the fact that its been colored many times but with this conditioner it makes wonders.</li>

            <li> and I hated when I used to get those fly aways and dry spots.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference from other shampoos, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have dry, brittle, coarse, frizzy hair that&#x27;s falling out due to age?</li>

            <li> I have been using this hair loss prevention shampoo for the last week and have noticed a significantly less amount of hair in my shower drain and in my hair brush.</li>
            <li> They say you only need a little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely never again will I buy this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the 99 cent brands and getting no good results on my newly permed hair.</li>
            <li> It is concentrated so a little shampoo goes a long way!</li>
            <li> only need a small amount of this product</li>
            <li> an active blogger and product reviewer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an odd name, but don&#x27;t let that stop you.</li>
            <li> Here we are in the dead of winter and my &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34; seemed to have healed.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why they&#x27;re not posted here</li>
            <li> so i am not sure of the results.  </li>
            <li> use very small amount.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the fact it didn&#x27;t suds up like the generic brand</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> very thin liquid, so I needed to use a lot to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> To the point  of making putting your fingers through it impossible.  </li>
            <li> (I hate that!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent shampoo! It has improved the condition of my hair. I&#x27;ve used it for several years now, and plan to continue.</li>
            <li> I still had oily hair and dandruff after using this.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not do what it promised.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a set w/the conditioner. I have dry, brittle, coarse, frizzy hair that&#x27;s falling out due to age? I wanted to slow down that process and treat my hair to good products. I read the reviews and bought this set. They say you only need a little so I use a quarter sized amount and work it through and rinse. It rinses out well, leaves my hair feeling clean and not over stripped, and my hair is shinier, healthier, softer, less frizzy, but still losing hair at same rate. I guess that&#x27;s age.:-( Overall, I am really enjoying this brand and will probably buy again. :-)</li>
            <li> Made my hair look good, I have thick wavey dark brown hair and I hated when I used to get those fly aways and dry spots. This shampoo helped and my hair is filling in.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Have to use too much for only shoulder length hair. Wasteful!!</li>
            <li> very thin liquid, so I needed to use a lot to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference from other shampoos, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> No noticeable improvement in my hair at all.  Can&#x27;t really say there is anything interesting or different about this from off-the-shelf stuff.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for my short graying hair. It is concentrated so a little shampoo goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I met the folks behind Good On Ya at a home show here in Dulles, Virginia.  My expectations were pretty low, as over the years I had been less than thrilled with other products.  However, THIS product has been wonderful.  The hardest part was getting over the self-imposed need to use the 7 different things kept in my shower.  The daughter of the owner explained to me to just take everything else out and give Good On Ya a chance.  So that&#x27;s exactly what I did.  My skin, especially in the winter gets dry, cracked, itchy, it even bleeds from being dry.  After the very first day, I noticed that when I was getting dressed after my shower, I bent over to pull on my boots, which is when I would normally brace for the burning, cracking, itching of the skin on my back, and it didn&#x27;t happen.  It was like a miracle.  Here we are in the dead of winter and my &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34; seemed to have healed.  I&#x27;ve been using only Good On Ya Body Wash, Microdermabrasion wash, shampoo, and conditioner for about 4 weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I also use the Skin Treat. It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it.  Oh, by the way, my skin reacts to just about all products and I have had NO reactions to anything from Good On Ya!</li>
            <li> Jury is still out on this one.</li>
            <li> Love this made my hair do soft no more split ends wonderful flag I found it don&#x27;t stop selling it please</li>
            <li> I expected more suds and a less positive effect.....................What I got was beautifully clean hair!&lt;br /&gt;The 1st time I used this shampoo I was disappointed in the fact it didn&#x27;t suds up like the generic brand&lt;br /&gt;I had been using BUT I figured I would follow through and see just how my hair reacted to this new product. I was&lt;br /&gt;glad I did! This shampoo is SO different! I felt my hair was truly clean for the first time! I had been using&lt;br /&gt;the 99 cent brands and getting no good results on my newly permed hair. I am delighted to report that&lt;br /&gt;now I&#x27;m a believer in this shampoo and so glad to have discovered it!</li>
            <li> This is actually a fantastic product!  It did leave my hair very soft and silky feeling and I loved the scent as well. I personally won&#x27;t purchase it again though... This is really more designed for seriously damaged hair or at best to use as a monthly deep cleaning/conditioning treatment. I used both the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long and chemically processed (color/highlights) but not damaged. In the future I plan to use this after visits to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount of this product so I imagine it will last a long time, making it a very economical choice. It works better than most &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair softer and more manageable.  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a year.  It has completely solved my itchy, flaky scalp problem.  I had tried the different types of dandruff shampoo, even mixing them, but could never solve the problem. I highly recommend this shampoo.  wm</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a shampoo that does what it says--and this one actually does!!! My hair seems fuller, and I&#x27;m delighted with this product. It&#x27;s an odd name, but don&#x27;t let that stop you.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Just have to get use to no suds and bubbles. use very small amount. dime size, works great!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! If you have sensitivities to fragrances and other ingredients this is an excellent alternative.</li>
            <li> very nice, hair looked great</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. My hair feels great.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  My wife recommended it instead of the regular commercial brand I&#x27;d been using for years.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels. Soft &amp; manageable. Before it was hard due to the fact that its been colored many times but with this conditioner it makes wonders. Love it.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they&#x27;re not posted here (I hate that!), so I looked up the ingredients elsewhere. I find it strange that this shampoo contains mica and titanium dioxide, as well as iron oxide. I don&#x27;t recall ever noticing those on shampoo ingredients lists before. Anyways, according to the goodonya website, the ingredients are: Organic Aloe Barbadensis Gel, Cocamidalpropyl Betaine, Lepospermum Scoparium (Manuka) Mel Honey, Centipeda Cunninghamii (Cehami), Minihot Esculenta (Tapioca) Starch, Cellulose Gum, Xanthan Gum Polysorbate 80, Organic Citrus Sinensis (Orange Peel Oil), Propanediol, Mica &amp; Titanium Dioxide &amp; Iron Oxide Phenoxyethanol.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. No perfumes to irritate my skin. Left my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> A really nice shampoo.  Trying to stay away from lots of chemicals because of thinning hair.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to find out if it will help grow my hair, but I can say that it does a nice job and leaves my hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Received at discount for review, makes my hair so soft and full of body and smells good, makes my hair not frizzy and at the same time its giving me healthy hair love it. Ty</li>
            <li> Love how it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals and is all natural..It scent is nice and the way it leaves my hair is so nice..its feels so soft and silky will order again..Great product..</li>
            <li> If you have never tried any GoodOnYa hair products, you definitely should. I was offered this Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo with Manuka Honey from GoodOnYa for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, and I couldn&#x27;t order it fast enough. GoodOnYa has such great Manuka Honey products that leave your hair feeling salon soft and fresh. I have been using this hair loss prevention shampoo for the last week and have noticed a significantly less amount of hair in my shower drain and in my hair brush. I have a lot of hair and am used to seeing lots of it come out at a time, but it hasn&#x27;t been nearly the same amount. I definitely recommend this Hair Loss Prevention Shampoo from GoodOnYa for anyone who wants a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels great in my hair while washing. It also leaves my hair looking very nice. I am impressed with many of the ingredients. I&#x27;m sure this product is far superior to most mainstream shampoos. I love a personal care product that is fragrance free, sulfate free, paraben free. As a highly sensitive person that is very important to me with personal care products. I love the honey and aloe as ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated this 5 stars except I&#x27;m worried about polysorbate80 as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an active blogger and product reviewer I received this shampoo at a promotional price in exchange for my promise to write an honest review.</li>
            <li> i have only this shampoo three times so i am not sure of the results.  i purchased this product at a fraction of the cost to try and give an honest and unbiased opinion.  i got this to try to see if it will help me with my thinning hair. i love that it is made of natural ingredients but has no funky smell as i was expecting.  it does leave my hair soft, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo that doesn&#x27;t way your hair down. It&#x27;s soft I guarantee you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Hair loss prevention shampoo with manuka honey is perfect for hair loss! It&#x27;s nourishing ingredients penetrate deep into the scalp to help hair loss. My hair is so much heathlier than before. I have been loosing a lot of hair prior to this shampoo, but now, it has subsided quickly. I am no longer loosing as much hair as before. My hair is so much softer now and manageable. I have always struggled with dry, damaged hair. Now with this shampoo, my hair has changed dramatically. I&#x27;m loving this shampoo and recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time now.  I love the way it cleans my hair without any harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo after trying and loving the conditioner.  If you have colored treated hair don&#x27;t even think about spending a cent on this.  When you put this product on your hair, your hair  literally becomes a hardwired fence.  To the point  of making putting your fingers through it impossible.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely never again will I buy this.I used this for 4 shampoos and this just made my hair feel coarse,not clean like other non sulfate shampoo,s..do not buy this junk..many other low lathering protective shampoos and conditioners out there for the cost of this small bottle.I did not use this once to make my determination..I do have medium length hair</li>
