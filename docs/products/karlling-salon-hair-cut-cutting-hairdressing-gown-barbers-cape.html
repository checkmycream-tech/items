            <li>The cape itself is a great size and quality.</li>
            <li>Best deal, I have...very comfortable</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, however the neck opening is very large and doesn&#x27;t seal well for my kids neck with the Velcro</li>
            <li>Love the item and should have purchased it sooner.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted:) durable reusable and good size</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair at home and wanted a cape to get the hair off, works for anyone who is looking to cut your own or somebody else&#x27;s hair, very functional and lightweight.</li>
            <li>Good thing I did, because I was happily surprised with the material, the way it fit, and the thought placed own its design.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine for the job intended.</li>
            <li>It had two velcro sections, making it a close fit for anyone.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic choice he said</li>
            <li>Nice cape, easy to wash and no need to dry.</li>
            <li>Too large for small kids to use but perfect for adults</li>
            <li>Hair slides right off it</li>
            <li>That has got to cost more than a USPS Standard or Priority Envelope.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed when I cut family members hair.</li>
            <li>I always make sure to tryout and inspect carefully items prior to reviewing.  </li>
            <li>My wife cuts my hair and I wanted something comfortable and big enough for me (6&#x27; tall).  </li>
            <li>Those that had a neck problem, must have been either much too fat or just the opposite.  </li>
            <li>I really will keep this as my go to cape only for when I have to cut hair...</li>
            <li>Before we bought this, my husband would literally sit bare butted on a kitchen chair while I buzzed his head.</li>
            <li>Works great for our home hair cutting salon!</li>
            <li>Only complaint was with the shipping, but since it was free, I can only give advice.  </li>

            <li> It is very professional looking and not cheap at all...</li>
            <li> Seems like it will last for a long time as long as we make even a little effort to take care of it.</li>
            <li> Why ship such a small item by truck from LA, CA on Interstates 10 &amp; 20 to Dallas, TX, then I-45  to Houston, TX then back on I-10  to the San Antonio, TX area.  </li>
            <li> It works but is a little big in the neck.</li>
            <li> I put a clip on it to keep it closed.</li>

            <li> So inexpensive its hard to complain at all.  </li>
            <li> Not what it looks like the Velcro around the neck is coming off very disappointed</li>

            <li> I cut my own hair at home and wanted a cape to get the hair off, works for anyone who is looking to cut your own or somebody else&#x27;s hair, very functional and lightweight.</li>
            <li> It was like in the picture</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do. Before we bought this, my husband would literally sit bare butted on a kitchen chair while I buzzed his head. Then he would go take a shower. Now...we can just use this and not have to worry about freeballin on the kitchen chair.</li>
