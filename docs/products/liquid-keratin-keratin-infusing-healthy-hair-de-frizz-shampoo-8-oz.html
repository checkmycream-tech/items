    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>And I have excellent eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I could not ask for anything more!</li>
            <li>My hair is amazing now.</li>
            <li>well in humid warm climates like Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Excellent shampoo for smoothing hair and keeping it soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>but I really love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Seems to be making my hair grow faster, and that may be because it is so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff......</li>
            <li>Love the way all of this product line makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I do really feel like it is cleaning my hair and helping to make it strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>but it dries out my hair a lot and makes it super frizzy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it some extra time and see if my hair is better.</li>
            <li>After searching for a product that works with my hair for years, I finally found Liquid Keratin and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, but doesn&#x27;t last 60 days for me.</li>
            <li>My hair have not improved much.  </li>
            <li>Silky and straight.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and its sister conditioner.</li>
            <li>Straighter makes it bone straight which ive never been able to do with other products.</li>
            <li>Well im revising this because tho the bottle was open when i received it, which sucks, the actual shampoo is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft too!</li>
            <li>I hope the radiance skin care line I am in the process of creating for my company will work just as well if not better.  :)</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and I love how soft my hair feels when Im washing it.</li>
            <li>The pre treatment shampoo has a tear on the plastic container that spilt everywhere inside the normal plastic bag its packaged in.&lt;br /&gt;Could only salvage enough for one application, not two as instructed</li>

            <li> only criticism, and it is a big one, is that the packaging uses gold lettering on a brown bottle and it is impossible to read when one is in the showerl  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why, I played around with quantities</li>
            <li> It is actually very difficult to read when one is in broad daylight.</li>
            <li> the bottle is tiny and so expensive :(</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, but sticky :-(     </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Takes out some of the curl but did not keep my hair from being frizzy</li>
            <li> It does the opposite of de-frizzing. I am not sure why, I played around with quantities but it dries out my hair a lot and makes it super frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair have not improved much.  I&#x27;ll give it some extra time and see if my hair is better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner yet but I really love this shampoo. A little goes a long way and I love how soft my hair feels when Im washing it. I do really feel like it is cleaning my hair and helping to make it strong and healthy. My hair feels so soft too! This is my second bottle and I forsee buying it again!</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo, but it came in an envelope and had leaked all over the place.  Only abut 1/2 the shampoo was left.</li>
            <li> After searching for a product that works with my hair for years, I finally found Liquid Keratin and it is fantastic! Seems to be making my hair grow faster, and that may be because it is so healthy.  The product does what it claims to do and I could not ask for anything more!</li>
            <li> Item was shipped to me with the bottle open, so it spilled all over the package it was shipped in. Arrived on time, but sticky :-(     Well im revising this because tho the bottle was open when i received it, which sucks, the actual shampoo is the absolute best! My hair is amazing now. Silky and straight. Straighter makes it bone straight which ive never been able to do with other products. Just my 2 cents. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> it does de-frizz my hair, but it did not give my hair enough shine</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but doesn&#x27;t last 60 days for me. I still recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff......the bottle is tiny and so expensive :( my hair is really long so I use a lot of it</li>
            <li> The pre treatment shampoo has a tear on the plastic container that spilt everywhere inside the normal plastic bag its packaged in.&lt;br /&gt;Could only salvage enough for one application, not two as instructed</li>

            <li> I really like this shampoo and its sister conditioner. Some of the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism, and it is a big one, is that the packaging uses gold lettering on a brown bottle and it is impossible to read when one is in the showerl  The conditioner has the exact same bottle so they are hard to tell apart.
