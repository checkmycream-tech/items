            <li>works great</li>
            <li>This is an excellent easy to use product.</li>
            <li>and it cut it perfectly without crushing the tablet.</li>
            <li>found this one on Amazon for a good price and ordered it.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have at home</li>
            <li>Good price since shipping was included.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do, the price is unbeatable and everyone I&#x27;ve given one to is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it came before the date that was given to me!</li>
            <li>Also liked the neutral color.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a better pill splitter has even been invented, so I rated this a 4 - it was as described and it worked.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I have 2 different sized pills to cut and it works great on both.</li>
            <li>The vitamin fit in this pill splitter</li>
            <li>Works without crushing the pill to bits about 60%-70%</li>
            <li>When it arrived I saw that it was pretty much what I&#x27;ve bought before, but then how many ways are there to make a pill cutter.</li>
            <li>Now I can do a week&#x27;s worth of pills at a time, put them in the pill reminder box (also from Amazon)</li>
            <li>i love this one, its easy to use when youre cutting many at once, or just one at a time.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for my wife who has been crushing large pills such as vitamins, etc.</li>
            <li>If you push it close with care it will cut a straight line every time.  </li>
            <li>Its the third different kind i&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>Good customer service (at least).</li>
            <li>Ordered this after trying several other more expensive pill splitters with more elaborate features; this basic model works the best out of all I have tried, even though it cost less than the others.  </li>
            <li>ANY BETTER THAN THE OTHER.</li>
            <li>Simple device that does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>this one was initially purchased for large pills for a dog.</li>
            <li>At such a low cost, I&#x27;m still happy with the use I got out of it, and I am ordering the same one again to replace the broken one.</li>
            <li>between me, my elderly father, and my sick dog, this really comes in handy!</li>
            <li>This pill splitter is a little better than the other i just purchased.  </li>
            <li>At the time I purchased it, I didn&#x27;t think it would get much use due to its lack to cut the larger pills.</li>
            <li>I filed a complaint and received a full refund.</li>
            <li>The pills are tiny, and this splitter does an amazing job at cutting them evenly.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have perfectly flat pills.</li>
            <li> I have cut small and large pills and it keeps on cutting without crushing the pills.</li>

            <li> It works well, and as long as I put the pill snugly in position under the blade it cuts them in half.</li>
            <li> Works well even with small pills or pills that don&#x27;t have a perforation in the middle.</li>

            <li> This pill splitter does the job, but it is a bit difficult to keep a larger tablet in place while you close it to split the pill with the razor blade.  </li>

            <li> Difficult to find item, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Atleast this one has a metal, razor blade like cutting tool inside.  </li>

            <li> This pill splitter does the job, but it is a bit difficult to keep a larger tablet in place while you close it to split the pill with the razor blade.  I don&#x27;t think a better pill splitter has even been invented, so I rated this a 4 - it was as described and it worked.</li>
            <li> This pill cutter works great. Its the third different kind i&#x27;ve bought. Its the only one that doesn&#x27;t smash the pill when it cuts. I have 2 different sized pills to cut and it works great on both.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife who has been crushing large pills such as vitamins, etc. for years. This splitter works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought some Nature Made vitamins and my regular pill cutter didn&#x27;t work.  The vitamin fit in this pill splitter and it cut it perfectly without crushing the tablet.</li>
            <li> Simple device that does exactly what it is supposed to do. Very easy to use, and at a great price. After nine months of use every other day, one of the little plastic tabs that holds the pill in place broke. It still works, but makes it harder to position the pill.  At such a low cost, I&#x27;m still happy with the use I got out of it, and I am ordering the same one again to replace the broken one.</li>
            <li> My dog started on small thyroid pills and I have to halve them. Even though the pills are scored, they never broke evenly, which annoyed me.  I&#x27;ve had pill cutters in the past but misplaced them and of course, couldn&#x27;t find one in the store when I wanted to buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this one on Amazon for a good price and ordered it. When it arrived I saw that it was pretty much what I&#x27;ve bought before, but then how many ways are there to make a pill cutter. It works well, and as long as I put the pill snugly in position under the blade it cuts them in half. Now I can do a week&#x27;s worth of pills at a time, put them in the pill reminder box (also from Amazon) and I&#x27;m set for a week.</li>
            <li> Work surface is hard glossy plastic. Pills slip, do not hold place. I don&#x27;t have perfectly flat pills. Not worth effort to return. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This works for me perfectly. I have cut small and large pills and it keeps on cutting without crushing the pills. If you push it close with care it will cut a straight line every time.  I&#x27;m ordering another one for backup in the event I can&#x27;t find this one again. The price is excellent, can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do, the price is unbeatable and everyone I&#x27;ve given one to is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I just chop some of my every day pills and a few &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; vitamins. It seems like the blade is going to fall out of the holder, but I paid 2 bucks for it...so oh well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent easy to use product. It arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle. It&#x27;s good to have at home</li>
            <li> Ordered this after trying several other more expensive pill splitters with more elaborate features; this basic model works the best out of all I have tried, even though it cost less than the others.  Also liked the neutral color.  Good price since shipping was included.  Arrived in a short amount of time.  Will order another when needed and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> PILL CUTTERS ARE PILL CUTTERS. I NEVER HAD ONE THAT MADE ONE ANY BETTER THAN THE OTHER. THEY ALL DO THE JOB, NOT...</li>
            <li> Great splitter! I bought this and one other at the same time. this one was initially purchased for large pills for a dog. It didn&#x27;t work well for them, but even had it worked, the dog wouldn&#x27;t take them unless crushed. Picky little booger. This thing looks just like one I have had for years, so I was a bit skeptical. At the time I purchased it, I didn&#x27;t think it would get much use due to its lack to cut the larger pills. However, another dog was recently dually diagnosed with two diseases and needs a few meds split. The pills are tiny, and this splitter does an amazing job at cutting them evenly.</li>
            <li> i had one of these for a couple years, and used it so often the blade eventually dulled and i needed to replace the unit.  i love this one, its easy to use when youre cutting many at once, or just one at a time.  between me, my elderly father, and my sick dog, this really comes in handy!</li>
            <li> This pill splitter is a little better than the other i just purchased.  Atleast this one has a metal, razor blade like cutting tool inside.  Works without crushing the pill to bits about 60%-70%</li>
            <li> Difficult to find item, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The pills I wanted to split were shaped as an ellipse, and couldn&#x27;t be split well with this item.  Would work with circular tablets</li>
            <li> Works well even with small pills or pills that don&#x27;t have a perforation in the middle.</li>
            <li> The blade was offset so that it cut the pill in 3/4 and 1/4 pieces. I filed a complaint and received a full refund. Good customer service (at least).</li>
            <li> Great pill cutter.  Best price.</li>
            <li> works great and I love the fact that it came before the date that was given to me!</li>
