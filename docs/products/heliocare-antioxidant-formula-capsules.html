            <li>I don&#x27;t know if a fair person would probably also need to apply sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This review is for Price Fair.  </li>
            <li>Good product at good price.</li>
            <li>I am very fair and burn easily....</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff dermatologist recommended it!</li>
            <li>will make it even better!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>amazing.  </li>
            <li>My daughter works in the beauty and aesthetic field and had heard many good things about Heliocare</li>
            <li>but honestly, I don&#x27;t see it when I look in the mirror</li>
            <li>My skin does look and feel better.</li>
            <li>I also used sunscreen and it was much more controlled and tolerable.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty amazing!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy any more.  </li>
            <li>ok  </li>
            <li>I think the thing that helped the most though was that I took Benadryl at night &amp; used cortisone cream at bedtime.  </li>
            <li>Sun protective clothing also worked better than any sunscreen -</li>
            <li>Love this for photosensitivity.</li>
            <li>Since using Heliocare, my tan looks much more even, the tan itself deeper so that the freckles blend in better.  </li>
            <li>Worked better for my kids</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just got some more because I am taking my kids to AZ for Spring Break and wanted to give them every sunburn protection opportunity.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this as an alternative to sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product for me and I love it.  </li>
            <li>When used with sunscreen this product works fabulously!  </li>
            <li>My husband had a severe allergy to the sun, itch and hives being the most prevalent effects.  </li>
            <li>Love It</li>
            <li>improved texture of skin and no breakouts but the claim to make skin more tolerant of sun  </li>
            <li>Great news when you live in the Sunshine State.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t available locally so ordering it was the best option.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most sunscreens, so it is really important that I do not get sunburned and Heliocare eliminates that worry.</li>
            <li>been using for over a year and really think its a good product</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that I haven&#x27;t burned as easily</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying it if you blister easily.</li>
            <li>After a skin analysis and peel to remove sun damage he told me to use strong sunscreen and try this product.  </li>
            <li>I took the two pills as directed and used light sunscreen - spf 4 &amp; 8.  </li>
            <li>I have PMLE ( polymorphous light eruption).  </li>
            <li>Suggested by my fabulous dermatologist.</li>
            <li>it contains Polypodium leucotomos and that is the primary ingredient to search for when looking for  alternatives.  </li>
            <li>This has been shown in clinical studies to reduce reactions to sun exposure for those with lupus and polymorphous light eruption.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled with polymorphic light eruption for 20 years.</li>
            <li>The doctors were surprised to see that as I am fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>These were recommended by my Dermatoligist, I&#x27;m fair skinned blue eyes and burn easily...</li>
            <li>and I have seen a significant difference for both of us.</li>
            <li>He has seen a significant reduction.</li>
            <li>I can tell you first hand most of our patients over the age of 60 had pre-cancers all over their body.</li>
            <li>This information might come in more handy for next summer as we are heading into the winter months.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and have blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, it has been effective.</li>
            <li>I received the order within a short time and the price was good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product overall.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and have been suffering from sun spots the last couple of years.</li>
            <li>I did not burn  after a full day in the sun</li>
            <li>The true test will be when the weather gets warmer .  </li>
            <li>did not prove true for me.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions - this is a great solution for active outdoors people who forget to apply sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It seemed safe and natural which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>Being a fair-skinned brunette who burns easily, I am convinced the Helioare was a large part of both mine and my red-headed husband&#x27;s not getting sunburned.</li>
            <li>but so far I am satisfied</li>
            <li>I heard that this can act as a natural sunscreen to help protect you more from rays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to the sun, breaking out with heat rashes on my body,  but since using Heliocare I am able to tolerate the sun and the heat without any breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I still use sunscreen for my face and ears, but I rarely have to use sunscreen anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Heliocare for 4 years now and have not burned, which is rare for a redhead.  </li>
            <li>With sun block and Heleocare capsules I don&#x27;t get near as many bumps from the sun.  </li>
            <li>I dont normally burn easily while in the sun</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde with a fair complexion.</li>
            <li>Sure, I slather myself with sunscreen whenever I go outside, even in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Purchased these because I read they help for people with PMLE (polymorphous light eruption); so far, along with 24-hour OTC allergy medicine &amp; sunblock, no breakouts - including the week i was in the Florida Keys -</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>You have to be consistent.  </li>
            <li>Yes exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency like many to get a bumpy itchy rash when exposed to the sun for longer periods, especially when I was in the tropics.</li>
            <li>I am taking it now as I prepare for my next trip- and will purchase more.</li>
            <li>update later if there are more results to comment on.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li>Before, just 30 mins after sun exposure i would get a rash on my arms and legs, it sucked because i would have to always avoid going out during summer, now i feel normal and can have fun outside :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking right not at four large age spots and one has noticeably gotten much smaller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My review of Heliocare, however, is 100% positive.  </li>
            <li>I did not get sun burnt at all this summer which is the first time probably in my whole life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard really good things about it, just haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t had much time to test it</li>
            <li>real test will be at the end of the summer season.  </li>
            <li>product isn&#x27;t a substitute for sunscreen or for being careful in the sun, but it does help protect you even more against the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.</li>
            <li>This product is only available online.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this product after much research</li>
            <li>I will say that one day I did not use sunscreen as much as I should have</li>
            <li>does this product really tan u</li>
            <li>Anything is worth a try to keep from getting skin cancer if you find you just can&#x27;t stay out of the sun completely.</li>
            <li>All my vitamins came together in a box, very helpful.</li>
            <li>These pills really do work.</li>
            <li>I am not one to &amp;#34;lay out&amp;#34; in the sun, but enjoy being outside.  </li>
            <li>These are very helpful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update on 6/25&lt;br /&gt;I always get a bumpy,itchy rash when I&#x27;ve had too much sun exposure.</li>
            <li>and I still don&#x27;t believe it, but they really are disappearing.  </li>
            <li>how much sun block I used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I really feel that this product helped protect me from the relentless sun during the Machu Picchu trek.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so I have only been able to try Heliocare a couple weekends so far, but it has worked both times.</li>
            <li>, I should have payed more attention to the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>But, I love to be active outdoors.  </li>
            <li>It was not all red and scaly- just smooth new skin under the blistering.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I have been on high alert</li>
            <li>But, I would highly recommend this product for anyone that has a problem with melisma or sun damage.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely prevent a sunburn on unprotected skin, but it certainly reduced the severity I use to experience.</li>
            <li>but so far I am ecstatic!!  </li>
            <li>I experienced a bit of an uncomfortable state;  nervousness, some itching and arrythmia.  </li>
            <li>Bought to improve my skin and was pleasantly surprised when I went to Hawaii how much it helped in sunburn prevention.  </li>
            <li>I am very sun sensitive and this was recommended by my doctor.  </li>
            <li>I have had one of the two (not sure which) on my neck for many years and it has really bothered me.  </li>
            <li>I live in MN</li>
            <li>I live in Texas</li>
            <li>Seems to work for me as I live in Florida.</li>
            <li>I live in south Florida</li>
            <li>I have discoid lupus and am very sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li>This is the first year that my problem on my neck area is not apparent.  </li>
            <li>On previous vacations, no matter how many times I reapplied sunscreen it always seemed that I would be red on my chest and shoulders.</li>
            <li>even if I just used it for the worst few hours of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the Neutrogena Helioplex sunscreen best too.  </li>
            <li>I take one every day from May to October and two on the days that I&#x27;m going to be directly out in the sun for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>this capsules are efective to protect your skin of uv and uvb rays, providing complete protection</li>
            <li>I use natural sun screen sparingly.  </li>
            <li>So far it has worked well for me.</li>
            <li>I took a picture of my forearm (52 years old), with age spots</li>
            <li>So far, my sun rash has cleared.</li>
            <li>So far the seem to be making a difference...</li>
            <li>I bought these on the recommendation of a friend who takes them because her skin is sensitive to sun screen.</li>
            <li>Neither of us got burnt at all, though that might also be a result of frequent reapplication of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Recommend by my doctor for my sun sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>post pictures later when they really do clear, if they do.</li>
            <li>The Doctor who developed it is the son of &amp;#34;the Father of Dermatology.&amp;#34;  I take one capsule daily during Fall-Winter (October-March) and two capsules during Spring-Summer (April-September).  </li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve had a lesion removed from my face so naturally</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen anything spectacular yet in a difference but probably have to use it longer - think it&#x27;s a bit over expensive for the amount you get</li>
            <li>I have probably been taking for 2 months so far, and averaged maybe 1 or 2 20-minute sun exposures a week with the exception of last week in key west</li>
            <li>Walgreen&#x27;s for a whole lot LESS.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;So far, it has been effective.</li>
            <li> I received the order within a short time and the price was good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product overall.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and have been suffering from sun spots the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> I did not burn  after a full day in the sun</li>
            <li> The true test will be when the weather gets warmer .  </li>
            <li> did not prove true for me.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions - this is a great solution for active outdoors people who forget to apply sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It seemed safe and natural which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> Being a fair-skinned brunette who burns easily, I am convinced the Helioare was a large part of both mine and my red-headed husband&#x27;s not getting sunburned.</li>
            <li> but so far I am satisfied</li>
            <li> I heard that this can act as a natural sunscreen to help protect you more from rays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to the sun, breaking out with heat rashes on my body,  but since using Heliocare I am able to tolerate the sun and the heat without any breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I still use sunscreen for my face and ears, but I rarely have to use sunscreen anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Heliocare for 4 years now and have not burned, which is rare for a redhead.  </li>
            <li> With sun block and Heleocare capsules I don&#x27;t get near as many bumps from the sun.  </li>
            <li> I dont normally burn easily while in the sun</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde with a fair complexion.</li>
            <li> Sure, I slather myself with sunscreen whenever I go outside, even in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Purchased these because I read they help for people with PMLE (polymorphous light eruption); so far, along with 24-hour OTC allergy medicine &amp; sunblock, no breakouts - including the week i was in the Florida Keys -</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> You have to be consistent.  </li>
            <li> Yes exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency like many to get a bumpy itchy rash when exposed to the sun for longer periods, especially when I was in the tropics.</li>
            <li> I am taking it now as I prepare for my next trip- and will purchase more.</li>
            <li> update later if there are more results to comment on.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li> Before, just 30 mins after sun exposure i would get a rash on my arms and legs, it sucked because i would have to always avoid going out during summer, now i feel normal and can have fun outside :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking right not at four large age spots and one has noticeably gotten much smaller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My review of Heliocare, however, is 100% positive.  </li>
            <li> I did not get sun burnt at all this summer which is the first time probably in my whole life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard really good things about it, just haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t had much time to test it</li>
            <li> real test will be at the end of the summer season.  </li>
            <li> product isn&#x27;t a substitute for sunscreen or for being careful in the sun, but it does help protect you even more against the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.</li>
            <li> This product is only available online.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this product after much research</li>
            <li> I will say that one day I did not use sunscreen as much as I should have</li>
            <li> does this product really tan u</li>
            <li> Anything is worth a try to keep from getting skin cancer if you find you just can&#x27;t stay out of the sun completely.</li>
            <li> All my vitamins came together in a box, very helpful.</li>
            <li> These pills really do work.</li>
            <li> I am not one to &amp;#34;lay out&amp;#34; in the sun, but enjoy being outside.  </li>
            <li> These are very helpful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update on 6/25&lt;br /&gt;I always get a bumpy,itchy rash when I&#x27;ve had too much sun exposure.</li>
            <li> and I still don&#x27;t believe it, but they really are disappearing.  </li>
            <li> how much sun block I used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I really feel that this product helped protect me from the relentless sun during the Machu Picchu trek.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so I have only been able to try Heliocare a couple weekends so far, but it has worked both times.</li>
            <li> , I should have payed more attention to the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> But, I love to be active outdoors.  </li>
            <li> It was not all red and scaly- just smooth new skin under the blistering.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I have been on high alert</li>
            <li> But, I would highly recommend this product for anyone that has a problem with melisma or sun damage.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely prevent a sunburn on unprotected skin, but it certainly reduced the severity I use to experience.</li>
            <li> but so far I am ecstatic!!  </li>
            <li> I experienced a bit of an uncomfortable state;  nervousness, some itching and arrythmia.  </li>
            <li> Bought to improve my skin and was pleasantly surprised when I went to Hawaii how much it helped in sunburn prevention.  </li>
            <li> I am very sun sensitive and this was recommended by my doctor.  </li>
            <li> I have had one of the two (not sure which) on my neck for many years and it has really bothered me.  </li>
            <li> I live in MN</li>
            <li> I live in Texas</li>
            <li> Seems to work for me as I live in Florida.</li>
            <li> I live in south Florida</li>
            <li> I have discoid lupus and am very sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li> This is the first year that my problem on my neck area is not apparent.  </li>
            <li> On previous vacations, no matter how many times I reapplied sunscreen it always seemed that I would be red on my chest and shoulders.</li>
            <li> even if I just used it for the worst few hours of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the Neutrogena Helioplex sunscreen best too.  </li>
            <li> I take one every day from May to October and two on the days that I&#x27;m going to be directly out in the sun for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> this capsules are efective to protect your skin of uv and uvb rays, providing complete protection</li>
            <li> I use natural sun screen sparingly.  </li>
            <li> So far it has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I took a picture of my forearm (52 years old), with age spots</li>
            <li> So far, my sun rash has cleared.</li>
            <li> So far the seem to be making a difference...</li>
            <li> I bought these on the recommendation of a friend who takes them because her skin is sensitive to sun screen.</li>
            <li> Neither of us got burnt at all, though that might also be a result of frequent reapplication of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Recommend by my doctor for my sun sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> post pictures later when they really do clear, if they do.</li>
            <li> The Doctor who developed it is the son of &amp;#34;the Father of Dermatology.&amp;#34;  I take one capsule daily during Fall-Winter (October-March) and two capsules during Spring-Summer (April-September).  </li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve had a lesion removed from my face so naturally</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen anything spectacular yet in a difference but probably have to use it longer - think it&#x27;s a bit over expensive for the amount you get</li>
            <li> I have probably been taking for 2 months so far, and averaged maybe 1 or 2 20-minute sun exposures a week with the exception of last week in key west</li>
            <li> Walgreen&#x27;s for a whole lot LESS.</li>
            <li> helps to clear dark marks in your face</li>
            <li> *, if you&#x27;ll excuse my french.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I was hoping this would help with are my white spots - I read studies that this helped repigment white spots which are a form of age related sun damage related to vitiligo.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use this long enough before my vacation trip to sunny Lake Havasu, but these didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This year I did a few new things to fight it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for almost a year and so far no sunburn even though I&#x27;m in the sun daily.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little too early to tell if it will help.  </li>
            <li> I have the classic scottish skin, which is pale and freckled and takes a lot of days of sun and careful exposure to eventually tan.  </li>
            <li> We even spent several days at waterparks and amusement parks without any issue.</li>
            <li> I have had melanoma and have to be extra careful now.  </li>
            <li> Following a trip to sunny Italy and yes, I was careful about the sun, I did not burn.</li>
            <li> I took one capsule a day starting a few days before I left and used sunscreen, but still got a sunburn.</li>
            <li> Previously even with sunscreen, could not be outside long without getting burned.  </li>
            <li> We were recently in Mexico where the sun is extreme, but my husband brought the Heliocare, and was not itchy at all, with minimal hives that he could tolerate.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is helping since I only started taking it recently.</li>
            <li> It seemed to provide just a little extra</li>
            <li> I have only had the product a few weeks</li>
            <li> I also spent my youth baking in the sun</li>
            <li> and I am suppose to be careful in the sun.  </li>
            <li> For me a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> All items I declare on other meds</li>
            <li> I have extreme sensitivity to sunlight (Uv &amp; UVB rays and fluorescent lights).  </li>
            <li> I take these everyday and never burn when I am in the sun for long period of times.</li>
            <li> The other never received and I am asking for refund.  </li>
            <li> did have a small white scar on my leg from a dog bite, and that HAS repigmented by about 50%, so it is working in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I would usually burn just being outside mowing or gardening, but noticed I haven&#x27;t since being on this pill for two months.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this due to a sun sensitivity rash on my arms.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter and I both took these when we went to Jamaica in late June of this year.</li>
            <li> but it was less severe &amp; seemed to heal substantially overnight.</li>
            <li> can buy these capsules here for 30% less than in the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Be ready to burp garlic-ish the entire day :(</li>
            <li> In the past when I&#x27;ve tanned I&#x27;ve had an extremely mottled freckle and tan look.  </li>
            <li> I have melanoma skin cancer and wanted a little added protection along with my sun protection clothing and sun screen.</li>
            <li> I have very dark, sun resilient skin, though, so</li>
            <li> I will update my review in a few months to give my</li>
            <li> I think it is a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It contains antioxidants, green tree extract and an ingredient from a tropical tree.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I take these nearly everyday.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this product is the unnecessary use of food coloring (FDC Yellow 7).  </li>
            <li> I took Heliocare a few days before our vacation and then took 2 on the morning</li>
            <li> I will give a follow up review in a few months.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years when I am going to be in the sun for a few hours (golf, beach trip, etc).</li>
            <li> Take everyday , the price was a deal 😄</li>
            <li> I am hoping that they will be pale.  </li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and approximately 2 years ago for some unknown reason I developed PMLE - a horrible, red, itchy rash whenever I was out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Unable to report on further issues.</li>
            <li> My husband usually gets bumps on his forearms and neck when has out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Im finally able to take a vactation at the beach without getting that nasty sun allergy.</li>
            <li> Not sure, but hope so for added sun protection.</li>
            <li> Difficult to tell if the product actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is helping me or not</li>
            <li> All the small ones are gone.  </li>
            <li> and I only developed a few spots on my feet where the rash was always the worst.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find this brand in stores, so will continue to order on line.</li>
            <li> I also use a sunscreen, but I&#x27;m not good about reapplying and usually end up with a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> so I basically bought this product with the hope that it would fade my brown spots or atleast slow their appearance while I continued to bleach them.  </li>
            <li> My arms used to have a faint tan, even though I protected them.  </li>
            <li> Every year we would go to the beach, even with hiding under an umbrella, I would break out with those horrible red itchy blotches.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended them, but unfortunately they did not prevent the reaction.</li>
            <li> The freight was very expensive</li>
            <li> My husband gets sun poisoning that burns and itches really bad, and sunscreen is often not sufficient.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I would hate to have to give up my kayaking or my hiking in order to stay out of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It used to be horrible no matter</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The freight was very expensive</li>
            <li> How do I know if they work or not?</li>
            <li> I experienced a bit of an uncomfortable state;  nervousness, some itching and arrythmia.  All items I declare on other meds, so it is that I only injested ONE tablet.  Unable to report on further issues.</li>
            <li> My husband has a sun allergy and I have very fair skin. Our dermatologist recommended we take a heliocare before going out in the sun. We run outside a lot and I have seen a significant difference for both of us. I did not get sun burnt at all this summer which is the first time probably in my whole life. My husband usually gets bumps on his forearms and neck when has out in the sun. He has seen a significant reduction. We even spent several days at waterparks and amusement parks without any issue. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> arrived as promised, quite happy with the delivery.</li>
            <li> I have only had the product a few weeks so I haven&#x27;t had much time to test it but so far I am ecstatic!!  I bought it in hopes of finding relief from PMLE - sun allergies.  I believe I have found it and can go out in the sun again.  I am 55 years old and approximately 2 years ago for some unknown reason I developed PMLE - a horrible, red, itchy rash whenever I was out in the sun.  Sunscreen didn&#x27;t prevent it and I tried combinations of beta carotene, niacin, allergy meds, vitamin E oil, etc.  I live in MN so I have only been able to try Heliocare a couple weekends so far, but it has worked both times. My skin hasn&#x27;t seen the sun since October and I only developed a few spots on my feet where the rash was always the worst.  I started taking a pill daily and the days I went out in the sun I took the two pills as directed and used light sunscreen - spf 4 &amp; 8.  If this product keeps working I will definitely buy it again and take it every May - Oct.  I am SO grateful to the creator of this - THANK YOU!  I no longer feel like a vampire.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I can already see a reduction in the amount and darkness of the pigmentation issues on my face.  I dont normally burn easily while in the sun so I basically bought this product with the hope that it would fade my brown spots or atleast slow their appearance while I continued to bleach them.  I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and have blue eyes.  I also spent my youth baking in the sun and I am now paying the price for that.  I have had melanoma and have to be extra careful now.  Sure, I slather myself with sunscreen whenever I go outside, even in the winter.  I wear long-sleeved shirts, hats and sunglasses.  But, I love to be active outdoors.  I would hate to have to give up my kayaking or my hiking in order to stay out of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to have learned of this product from a dermatologist.  I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.  It contains polypodium leucotomos extract, which is supposed to reduce ultra-violet induced damage of human skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it has been effective. My face isn&#x27;t red after spending the day kayaking, nor are my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test will be at the end of the summer season.  My arms used to have a faint tan, even though I protected them.  I am hoping that they will be pale.  I will update my review in a few months to give my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take one capsule about 30 minutes before I go outside for the day.  If I&#x27;m going to be out kayaking or hiking all day, I take another capsule two to three hours after my initial sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t a substitute for sunscreen or for being careful in the sun, but it does help protect you even more against the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff dermatologist recommended it!</li>
            <li> Purchased these because I read they help for people with PMLE (polymorphous light eruption); so far, along with 24-hour OTC allergy medicine &amp; sunblock, no breakouts - including the week i was in the Florida Keys - so I&amp;#34;m definitely a fan!</li>
            <li> My brother lives in Thailand and cannot buy it there, so I send it to him.  He golfs a lot and has been using Heliocare for eight years.  He would not  want to be without it .</li>
            <li> Have only used it two weeks but so far I am satisfied</li>
            <li> I am fairly fair skin toned and spend a lot of time in the sun. I heard that this can act as a natural sunscreen to help protect you more from rays. I used it and did not see any difference. I think it is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May want to wait until for research is done on these types of products to see if they actually work.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  I&#x27;ve always been sensitive to the sun, breaking out with heat rashes on my body,  but since using Heliocare I am able to tolerate the sun and the heat without any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have taken these before my Amazon order.  I received the order within a short time and the price was good.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed this supplement for me.  It contains antioxidants, green tree extract and an ingredient from a tropical tree.  A lot research has been done to prove that it does work. The Doctor who developed it is the son of &amp;#34;the Father of Dermatology.&amp;#34;  I take one capsule daily during Fall-Winter (October-March) and two capsules during Spring-Summer (April-September).  I have PMLE ( polymorphous light eruption).  I have extreme sensitivity to sunlight (Uv &amp; UVB rays and fluorescent lights).  You have to be consistent.  This product is only available online.</li>
            <li> Yes exactly what I wanted. Suggested by my fabulous dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me, I take one capsule a day.  I have very sun-sensitive skin, and I do believe that after taking one Heliocare capsule a day for a few weeks, it has helped to keep me from getting sunburned.  I also use a sunscreen, but I&#x27;m not good about reapplying and usually end up with a sunburn.  If I am planning to be out in the sun for extended periods of time, I take two pills.  I&#x27;m very happy with the sun protection I&#x27;m getting with this product.  It works.</li>
            <li> Omg!! It works. Im finally able to take a vactation at the beach without getting that nasty sun allergy. Before, just 30 mins after sun exposure i would get a rash on my arms and legs, it sucked because i would have to always avoid going out during summer, now i feel normal and can have fun outside :)</li>
            <li> My skin doctor recommended I try this.  I had skin cancer and I am suppose to be careful in the sun.  My skin does look and feel better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is total bulls***, if you&#x27;ll excuse my french.  Does nothing.  Just an antioxidant.  Wear sunscreen!!!</li>
            <li> Great pills! I take these everyday and never burn when I am in the sun for long period of times.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency like many to get a bumpy itchy rash when exposed to the sun for longer periods, especially when I was in the tropics. So I purchased this product after much research and I started taking it daily about 1 week prior to my trip.  I also used sunscreen and it was much more controlled and tolerable.  I will say that one day I did not use sunscreen as much as I should have and I got a sunburn, when the skin peeled off it was beautiful underneath it.  It was not all red and scaly- just smooth new skin under the blistering.  It was pretty amazing!  I am taking it now as I prepare for my next trip- and will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Not FDA approved? NOPE!</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on an article I read in a magazine.  I use sunscreen daily but I don&#x27;t feel like I always get the required coverage.  I feel that this helps me to achieve that.  I take it in the morning and I have spent a couple of days in direct sunlight for extended periods of time and I have noticed that I haven&#x27;t burned as easily (I am very fair).  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVE AND USE IT.  Thank you. The other never received and I am asking for refund.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I used to work for a dermatologists. The drug reps were always carrying on about this product. I can tell you first hand most of our patients over the age of 60 had pre-cancers all over their body. There is no way to tell if this is working immediately but since there are no side effects i will keep taking it just in case.</li>
            <li> no change, in skin....I didn&#x27;t buy any more.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> Using this for a relative that is having basal cell skin cancer issues.  Will update after next check up.</li>
            <li> ok  so do yall see a difference in skin color does this product really tan u</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and play lots of golf. Despite sunscreen, I&#x27;ve had several basal cell skin cancers removed and need skin peels every year on my arms and legs. I grew up in the era of baby oil and iodine. Boy were we nuts. My dermatologist recently recommended this to me and I can tell a difference in my skin after about a 6 weeks use. It didn&#x27;t completely prevent a sunburn on unprotected skin, but it certainly reduced the severity I use to experience. Anything is worth a try to keep from getting skin cancer if you find you just can&#x27;t stay out of the sun completely. I also started using a &amp;#34;parasol.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This is a good product overall.  Just the same as what I bought @ Walgreen&#x27;s for a whole lot LESS.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by a local doctor so wanted to try it.  It wasn&#x27;t available locally so ordering it was the best option.</li>
            <li> As part of my sun care regimen.  I take 2 capsules a day along with applying sunscreen.  Not sure if this is helping since I only started taking it recently.</li>
            <li> I always get sun poisoning rash when I go on vacation to the Caribbean in the Spring. This year I did a few new things to fight it.  Not the best scientific method.  I took these capsules as part of my regimen.  I did get a rash but it was less severe &amp; seemed to heal substantially overnight. I think the thing that helped the most though was that I took Benadryl at night &amp; used cortisone cream at bedtime.  Sun protective clothing also worked better than any sunscreen - even if I just used it for the worst few hours of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the Neutrogena Helioplex sunscreen best too.  I was there for 2 weeks so I gave it a good test.</li>
            <li> Love this for photosensitivity. Ordered on line, and arrived as scheduled, very happy with product. Hard to find this brand in stores, so will continue to order on line. All my vitamins came together in a box, very helpful.</li>
            <li> Use these all the time.</li>
            <li> I feel after using this product that it actually works with a protective cream it would protect as well as possible.  I just finished 7 weeks of radiation and I had no blistering at all.  The doctors were surprised to see that as I am fair skinned.  I would recommend trying it if you blister easily.</li>
            <li> I take these nearly everyday. I ride horseback 4-5 days a week for 3-4 hours at a time. I live in Texas and I&#x27;m very fair skinned. I also wear sun protective clothing and sunscreen. My skin looks great; no sun damage.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter and I both took these when we went to Jamaica in late June of this year. A couple of years ago she suffered sun poisoning in Jamaica and I have been on high alert ever since.&lt;br /&gt;We used Heliocare in addition to sunscreen,and noticed that we had no sunburn, no redness at all! On previous vacations, no matter how many times I reapplied sunscreen it always seemed that I would be red on my chest and shoulders. Not this trip. It seemed to provide just a little extra and I thought it was well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I have the classic scottish skin, which is pale and freckled and takes a lot of days of sun and careful exposure to eventually tan.  In the past when I&#x27;ve tanned I&#x27;ve had an extremely mottled freckle and tan look.  Since using Heliocare, my tan looks much more even, the tan itself deeper so that the freckles blend in better.  The other thing I was hoping this would help with are my white spots - I read studies that this helped repigment white spots which are a form of age related sun damage related to vitiligo. The studies were for taking this 3 times a day spaced out, for 12 weeks, and getting 20 minute sun exposure three times a week or so.  I have probably been taking for 2 months so far, and averaged maybe 1 or 2 20-minute sun exposures a week with the exception of last week in key west I got sun almost every day, and I can&#x27;t say that my white spots have repignmented at all yet, but I&#x27;m going to keep taking it and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;I did have a small white scar on my leg from a dog bite, and that HAS repigmented by about 50%, so it is working in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;Will update later if there are more results to comment on.</li>
            <li> Great product for additional skin protection</li>
            <li> Seems as though I don&#x27;t burn as much on a daily basis.  Great news when you live in the Sunshine State.</li>
            <li> This heliocare it dosent protect me from sun, i have aczima from sun and dosent work, so any one like to buy this product save your mony and dont buy it.</li>
            <li> I like that it contains Polypodium leucotomos and that is the primary ingredient to search for when looking for  alternatives.  What I don&#x27;t like about this product is the unnecessary use of food coloring (FDC Yellow 7).  My error, I should have payed more attention to the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have melanoma skin cancer and wanted a little added protection along with my sun protection clothing and sun screen. I also used my 14 teen daughter as a guinea pig. She has marching band camp during the day, she never once burned after using this product. I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> These pills really do work. I took them when I was on a cruise and I didn&#x27;t burn. I have very dark, sun resilient skin, though, so I don&#x27;t know if a fair person would probably also need to apply sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist swears by this product. Following a trip to sunny Italy and yes, I was careful about the sun, I did not burn. Being a fair-skinned brunette who burns easily, I am convinced the Helioare was a large part of both mine and my red-headed husband&#x27;s not getting sunburned.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy for the money</li>
            <li> This review is for Price Fair.  Box was scotch taped shut and bottle had been opened.  I&#x27;m not taking something orally that is not sealed by the manufacturer.  My review of Heliocare, however, is 100% positive.  I have had the best skin after 4 months on this product.  I will find another distributor.</li>
            <li> Have used  this product for years on recommendation from my dermatologist. Seems to work for me as I live in Florida.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it going to do .o mi</li>
            <li> I think I like them...I noticed that I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; when out in the sun.  I have continued to use SPF in my facial moisturizers, but have not used sunscreen or lotions.  I am not one to &amp;#34;lay out&amp;#34; in the sun, but enjoy being outside.  I would usually burn just being outside mowing or gardening, but noticed I haven&#x27;t since being on this pill for two months.  I didn&#x27;t have any noticeable improvement to skin tone, but I am going to not take this product for a month and see if there is any differences.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my Dermatologist and is a product I use regularly.  I buy it from whichever company has the best price when I need to restock.</li>
            <li> This information might come in more handy for next summer as we are heading into the winter months.  But, I would highly recommend this product for anyone that has a problem with melisma or sun damage.  I have had one of the two (not sure which) on my neck for many years and it has really bothered me.  My daughter works in the beauty and aesthetic field and had heard many good things about Heliocare so I gave it a try.  I take one every day from May to October and two on the days that I&#x27;m going to be directly out in the sun for an extended period of time.  This is the first year that my problem on my neck area is not apparent.  I can&#x27;t say that is 100% gone but honestly, I don&#x27;t see it when I look in the mirror so I doubt anyone else does either.  Even if you don&#x27;t have sun damage, I think protecting yourself from the sun&#x27;s UVA and UVB rays has to be a plus for you.</li>
            <li> After years of suffering through PLE, I thought I wouild give this a try.  Every year we would go to the beach, even with hiding under an umbrella, I would break out with those horrible red itchy blotches.  I took Heliocare a few days before our vacation and then took 2 on the morning we were heading to the beach.  Happy to say that it worked wonderful!  So happy and I am glad I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this whenever we&#x27;re planning to be out in the sun and it works great.  I still use sunscreen for my face and ears, but I rarely have to use sunscreen anywhere else.  We&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions - this is a great solution for active outdoors people who forget to apply sunscreen.</li>
            <li> For me a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This has been shown in clinical studies to reduce reactions to sun exposure for those with lupus and polymorphous light eruption.  It is also being used in conjunction with sunscreen and skin bleachers, to treat melasma.  I recommend it to my patients to use in addition to sun protective clothing and sunscreen to reduce the adverse effects from solar radiation.  It does seem to help prevent sunburns, and I use it myself whenever I will be in the sun for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> These are very helpful.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  I have just started taking it but I believe it is beneficial.  I live in south Florida so any sun protection is welcomed.  I will continue taking this and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I purchased these based on a Dermatologist who appeared on Dr. Oz.  Recently, I&#x27;ve had a lesion removed from my face so naturally I want to protect my skin as much as possible.  Winter has just ended (hopefully) here.  My daughter was the test.  I had her start taking these 1 week prior to her Spring Break trip to FL and while she was there.  Of course, I loaded her up with sunscreen too.  Well, she was the only one who didn&#x27;t burn in her group of six friends- so I&#x27;m impressed.  My son works as a camp counselor during the summer and I&#x27;m going to order these for him as well.  I&#x27;m going to start taking these soon and will report my findings later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on 6/25&lt;br /&gt;I always get a bumpy,itchy rash when I&#x27;ve had too much sun exposure. Well, I went to Florida for a week and I still got the rash so it did not work for me.  I will say I was only taking one of these a day, others took two.  Of course, I use a ton of sunscreen so I&#x27;m disappointed.  Worked better for my kids so it must be different depending on the level of sun sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Have been using this on recent trips to places where I was exposed to lots of sun.  Still use sunscreen.  Does this work?  Not sure, but hope so for added sun protection.</li>
            <li> I ordered these pills at the recommendation of my Dermatologist.  He sell these on the side at his office.  I got them on Amazon as they were cheaper than his price,  I help teach swimming lessons outside in the summer, and hoped that these would help protect my skin.  Only problem is there is no way to tell if they worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard really good things about it, just haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see</li>
            <li> helps to clear dark marks in your face</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, met my expectations. this capsules are efective to protect your skin of uv and uvb rays, providing complete protection</li>
            <li> I have been using Heliocare for 4 years now and have not burned, which is rare for a redhead.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Product was recommended by my dermatologist.  Difficult to tell if the product actually works.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use this long enough before my vacation trip to sunny Lake Havasu, but these didn&#x27;t work. I took one capsule a day starting a few days before I left and used sunscreen, but still got a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and burn easily....these are my survival kit for the summer sun...I still wear sunblock...but these help.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen anything spectacular yet in a difference but probably have to use it longer - think it&#x27;s a bit over expensive for the amount you get</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I am not an advocate of commercial sun screen.  I use natural sun screen sparingly.  I went to Honduras in April and never burned.  My dermatologist recommended it (she also recommended sunscreen).  Used this all summer....amazing.  Previously even with sunscreen, could not be outside long without getting burned.  I am a natural blonde with a fair complexion. Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is helping me or not but I will continue to take it. My dermatologist recommended this due to a sun sensitivity rash on my arms.</li>
            <li> been using for over a year and really think its a good product</li>
            <li> Seems to stop the itching I used to get when out in the sun</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product by a well known plastic surgeon in Fort Lauderdale. After a skin analysis and peel to remove sun damage he told me to use strong sunscreen and try this product.  It seemed safe and natural which is important to me.  I ordered two bottles, one to share with a friend who always forgets his sunscreen.  So far it has worked well for me. I take one on days when I am only driving around town or outside for short periods of time.  I take two on days I go to the beach or ride my bike in the afternoon.  I have not had any sunburn at all since starting this product. I still use sunscreen but can&#x27;t reach everywhere so this helps me to feel I won&#x27;t be exposed to skin cancer in areas I may have missed. Oh, and no side effects from taking it whatsoever. I like this product well enough to reorder and the coupons they sent will make it even better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for 2-3 weeks and while I have never had an OTC herbal or dietary product work, I literally cannot believe it.  All the small ones are gone.  I took a picture of my forearm (52 years old), with age spots and I still don&#x27;t believe it, but they really are disappearing.  Takes time and I&#x27;ll need to wait another month or two, but it&#x27;s like this product attacks one age spot at a time as it gets smaller, then turns red and then disappears.  I don&#x27;t believe in this stuff, so I&#x27;m amazed at this point.  I&#x27;m looking right not at four large age spots and one has noticeably gotten much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will post pictures later when they really do clear, if they do.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and have been suffering from sun spots the last couple of years. Its July and I have just a couple of spots!!!! This seems to be working! I will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> Bought to improve my skin and was pleasantly surprised when I went to Hawaii how much it helped in sunburn prevention.  I just got some more because I am taking my kids to AZ for Spring Break and wanted to give them every sunburn protection opportunity.  I will let you know how well it works on them.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this as an alternative to sunscreen. I have been using it everyday for almost a year and so far no sunburn even though I&#x27;m in the sun daily.</li>
            <li> I am very sun sensitive and this was recommended by my doctor.  With sun block and Heleocare capsules I don&#x27;t get near as many bumps from the sun.  It used to be horrible no matter how much sun block I used.&lt;br /&gt;I can buy these capsules here for 30% less than in the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I did not burn  after a full day in the sun</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I believe it does work quite well.</li>
            <li> I chose this product to see if it would help with my skin&#x27;s sensitivity to the sun. So far, my sun rash has cleared. The true test will be when the weather gets warmer .  I will give a follow up review in a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a year now, after having a melanoma removed from my forearm. I spend 2 months every year in Mexico and I do a lot of hiking in the summer. It seems to help protect my skin from the sun along with sunscreen and arm sleeves.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years when I am going to be in the sun for a few hours (golf, beach trip, etc). Helps supplement the sunscreen. I have not used it without sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Take everyday , the price was a deal 😄</li>
            <li> Suggested by dermatologist.  I trust her that it does whatever an antioxidant does......</li>
            <li> These were recommended by my Dermatoligist, I&#x27;m fair skinned blue eyes and burn easily... So far the seem to be making a difference... Keep in mind you still need to wear sunblock, this is just added protection for your skin</li>
            <li> Good product at good price.</li>
            <li> I took these to Florida on vacation to help prevent a sun allergy (itching, redness).  My dermatologist recommended them, but unfortunately they did not prevent the reaction.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product for me and I love it.  Yes, I did use some great sunscreen but I really feel that this product helped protect me from the relentless sun during the Machu Picchu trek. Big fan</li>
            <li> I bought these on the recommendation of a friend who takes them because her skin is sensitive to sun screen. My husband gets sun poisoning that burns and itches really bad, and sunscreen is often not sufficient. We took one pill daily on our 7-day cruise at the end of May where we were outside in the sun for hours on end around the Western Caribbean. Neither of us got burnt at all, though that might also be a result of frequent reapplication of sunscreen. Based on confirmation bias, I can say this product doesn&#x27;t NOT work.</li>
            <li> When used with sunscreen this product works fabulously!  We have used it for years, every trip to Cancun, or the beaches in Hawaii,  outdoors or around a pool for the day... It works, an no side effects..</li>
            <li> I just started taking this last month, and it&#x27;s still winter so it&#x27;s a little too early to tell if it will help.  I have discoid lupus and am very sensitive to the sun.  I&#x27;m hoping this will help with that.  We&#x27;ll have to wait and see.  Will update later.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders for me. I have struggled with polymorphic light eruption for 20 years. Went in the sun for the fist time with not break out.&lt;br /&gt;Was a dream for me! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this!  I think it is helping my vitiligo.</li>
            <li> Be ready to burp garlic-ish the entire day :(</li>
            <li> Great for the fair skinned</li>
            <li> My husband had a severe allergy to the sun, itch and hives being the most prevalent effects.  We were recently in Mexico where the sun is extreme, but my husband brought the Heliocare, and was not itchy at all, with minimal hives that he could tolerate.  I only wish we had heard about this product sooner.</li>
            <li> Since I began using Heliocare, I have not gotten a sunburn.  I am allergic to most sunscreens, so it is really important that I do not get sunburned and Heliocare eliminates that worry.</li>
            <li> Recommend by my doctor for my sun sensitive skin.  Love It</li>
            <li> Definitely protects from harmful rays of sun and lets us stay out a bit longer without burning.  Also seems to have some effect on lightening brown spots.</li>
            <li> Necessary if you burn</li>
            <li> improved texture of skin and no breakouts but the claim to make skin more tolerant of sun  did not prove true for me.  I am taking twice per day for protection from  extra sun exposure.</li>
    </ol>
