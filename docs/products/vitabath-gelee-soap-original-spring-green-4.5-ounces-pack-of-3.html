            <li>my mind an ideal bar of soap will get you clean, not overdry your skin, smell nice, and last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers have noted this bar does not smell as strongly as the original liquid body wash</li>

            <li>Lovely fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely bath soap with a fresh scent, the aroma awakens and soothes your senses.  </li>
            <li>Great for starting the day or relaxing before bedtime.  </li>
            <li>While the Gellee soap does not fill the room with the incredibly fresh scent left by the shower glee, I feel just great after my soak or shower with this soap.  </li>
            <li>just fresh and clean</li>
            <li>When compared to our older vitabath gelee, this smelled more like the new scent, with more lemon to it than pine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Vitabath as soap, lotion, and especially bubble bath off and on for more than 50 years when I can find it!</li>
            <li>Original Spring Green smells as clean as it used to and the 3-pack is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>It is fresh, a delight for anyone to use.  </li>
            <li>fresh fresh ....</li>
            <li>Love it, but my favorite was the pink vitabath...</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful, and the bar lasts a reasonable amount of time when kept dry in a proper soap dish between uses.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the strong odor from this bar of soap.</li>
            <li>It produces a great amount of rich lather in the ridiculously hard water where I live.</li>
            <li>The wonderfully fresh and green fragrance of this soap is an ideal match to the bath/shower gelee&#x60; made by the same company.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found my favorite soap of all time.  </li>
            <li>I first came across this soap in Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift to go with the gelee set, it was very well received!</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR MALE AND FEMALE ALIKE AND MAKE SKIN FEEL VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li>so much* colorant in it.</li>
            <li>The soap is very emollient and lathers well on a nylon-mesh scrubby.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and trouble-free.  </li>
            <li>I love the fresh fragrance (original green) for anyone, but especially for a guy.  </li>
            <li>I love Vitabath products, altho most of the time I won&#x27;t buy them because they&#x27;re too expensive.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>As this soap contains a fair amount glycerin, it can use up quickly if not kept dry between uses.</li>
            <li>The soap is now hard to find in stores and am I thrilled to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>My mother first bought Vitabath in the sixties - the scent takes me back.</li>
            <li>and when I got married a 1/2 million years ago my husband starting using it.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent and lathers like crazy.  </li>
            <li>It still smells nice, but it&#x27;s not the original spring green scent, at least not to our noses.</li>
            <li>FRAGRANCE&lt;br /&gt;Those already familiar with the classic Spring Green Vitabath Fragrance will need no introduction.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll either think the scent is much too much, or feel enough is never enough.</li>
            <li>so soft my skin is after using it ...</li>

            <li>Gentle enough for my young children and just enough oil for softening of the skin without leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Hard to find this soap locally and was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a very nice hard milled soap.</li>
            <li> There are other fragrances that I don&#x27;t like nearly as well, and I also prefer the soap to the gelee because it doesn&#x27;t seem to smell or lather as well.  </li>
            <li> For those new to the line, brace yourself for a blast of in-your-face green freshness.</li>
            <li> - especially during dry skin season.</li>
            <li> If you like Pine, moisturing and lasts a long time.  </li>

            <li> scent is very much &#x27;love it or hate it&#x27;.</li>
            <li> GREEN (Than the Liquid Bodywash/Gelee)&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I love about this bar as compared to the liquid version is that it doesn&#x27;t contain the mind bogglingly insane amounts of green and yellow dyes found in the liquid gelee.</li>
            <li> If you like &#x27;green&#x27; scents, give it a try.</li>
            <li> you try VITA (spring green)</li>
            <li> but it was hard to find.</li>
            <li> But if you are expecting the same burst of aroma as the gel Vitabath you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the fragrance and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for over fifty years, turned my husband onto it.  so refreshing, great smell - fregrance</li>
            <li> Wonderful pine scent. If you like Pine, moisturing and lasts a long time.  I have been using Vitabath products for a zillion years.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t seen Vitabath in stores in a long time.  Great soap.  I love the fresh fragrance (original green) for anyone, but especially for a guy.  Also makes the bathroom smell great after a shower.  Will definitely stock up on this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;cannot find anything like it....</li>
            <li> This is the US version of the European Badedas.  It is fresh, a delight for anyone to use.  The bubble bath is heavenly, too,</li>
            <li> The wonderfully fresh and green fragrance of this soap is an ideal match to the bath/shower gelee&#x60; made by the same company.

            <li> I love the fresh fragrance of Vitabath bath and shower gel.  I was glad to find the soap and body lotion.  I love the invigorating aroma and fragrant aroma and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Though the product is good it fails to note these are BARS of soap. As I was previously only accustom to the body wash gel I was thrown off by the \\&quot;Gelee\\&quot; description.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found my favorite soap of all time.  Vitabath Gelee smells wonderful and makes the entire bathroom smelljust as good.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have used Vitabath gelee for 40 years.  Love the bar also.  Same fragrance and my husband says it&#x27;s easier to lather.</li>
            <li> Convinced my wife to shower with this soap. Now she&#x27;ll not use any other soap</li>
            <li> I love Vitabath products, altho most of the time I won&#x27;t buy them because they&#x27;re too expensive.  While the Gellee soap does not fill the room with the incredibly fresh scent left by the shower glee, I feel just great after my soak or shower with this soap.  No scummy buildup, no drying of the skin ... just fresh and clean and it smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> Vitabath! I have loved this scent forever and it hasn&#x27;t changed in decades, thank god. The soap is more convenient than the gelee, which I also still love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Vitabath as soap, lotion, and especially bubble bath off and on for more than 50 years when I can find it!</li>
            <li> FRAGRANCE&lt;br /&gt;Those already familiar with the classic Spring Green Vitabath Fragrance will need no introduction. This is the smell you know and love, in bar form. For those new to the line, brace yourself for a blast of in-your-face green freshness. Elements of pine, rosewood, and patchouli dominate but there are also some grassy and citrusy elements. Some reviewers have noted this bar does not smell as strongly as the original liquid body wash and I agree, however by any measure this is a very strongly scented bar soap. Just having the bar sitting in your shower fragrances your entire bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very much &#x27;love it or hate it&#x27;. If you like &#x27;green&#x27; scents, give it a try. You&#x27;ll either think the scent is much too much, or feel enough is never enough. (People feel strongly about their Vitabath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFICACY&lt;br /&gt;To my mind an ideal bar of soap will get you clean, not overdry your skin, smell nice, and last a reasonable amount of time. This soap does not disappoint on any of those fronts. It produces a great amount of rich lather in the ridiculously hard water where I live. Glycerin, Corn, and Sunflower seed Oils as well as some Vitamin goodies keep it from being too drying. The scent is wonderful, and the bar lasts a reasonable amount of time when kept dry in a proper soap dish between uses. As this soap contains a fair amount glycerin, it can use up quickly if not kept dry between uses. Glycerin soaps especially don&#x27;t like to be left in standing water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LESS GREEN (Than the Liquid Bodywash/Gelee)&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I love about this bar as compared to the liquid version is that it doesn&#x27;t contain the mind bogglingly insane amounts of green and yellow dyes found in the liquid gelee. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the liquid version, but I have never used a personal care product with *so much* colorant in it. I&#x27;m not afraid of it from a health/safety standpoint, but it has in the past left marks on my white shower curtains, andit&#x27;s a little odd seeing green/yellow suds as you wash. No such issues with the bar version. The bar of soap is obviously tinted green, but it&#x27;s not the technicolor explosion that is the liquid/gelee body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for purchase: Yes. The bold green unisex scent is a classic that everyone should try at least once.</li>
            <li> The soap is very emollient and lathers well on a nylon-mesh scrubby. My mother first bought Vitabath in the sixties - the scent takes me back.</li>
            <li> Terrific bath soap.  Feels great and smells so fresh.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Vitabath is a great soap for fragrance and skin care, I wash my face with it, too.  Original Spring Green smells as clean as it used to and the 3-pack is a good deal.  Hard to find this soap locally and was glad to find it on Amazon.  Shipping was fast and trouble-free.  [[ASIN:B000SZNY0K Vitabath Gelee Soap, Original Spring Green, 4.5-Ounces (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> When compared to our older vitabath gelee, this smelled more like the new scent, with more lemon to it than pine.  It still smells nice, but it&#x27;s not the original spring green scent, at least not to our noses.</li>
            <li> what more to you need to know? Nothing on earth smells better and it&#x27;s excellent soap. And buying it as a subscription? Hell yeah.</li>
            <li> Love this smell.  Have used this product while in Germany (but was called Badedas in Europe) and use it here in United States.  Used it since returning to US since 1985.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a very nice hard milled soap. But if you are expecting the same burst of aroma as the gel Vitabath you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I first came across this soap in Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best smelling soap I have ever used but it was hard to find. I could not find it in local Dept. stores or in big pharmacys. I only found it at amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you try VITA (spring green) there&#x27;s no turning back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E.A.V.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite ...clean ...unisex ....fresh fresh ....so soft my skin is after using it ...I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Got hooked on this soap when we were in Germany and am glad&lt;br /&gt;to be able to buy it here. Lovely fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> Luxury I have treated myself to now and then for over thirty years!! - especially during dry skin season.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely bath soap with a fresh scent, the aroma awakens and soothes your senses.  Great for starting the day or relaxing before bedtime.  Gentle enough for my young children and just enough oil for softening of the skin without leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to go with the gelee set, it was very well received! She just loves it as I do. It&#x27;s always been my favorite bath gel.</li>
            <li> Love it, but my favorite was the pink vitabath...whatever happened to it? Spring something????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a million years and when I got married a 1/2 million years ago my husband starting using it.  It has a nice clean scent and lathers like crazy.  There are other fragrances that I don&#x27;t like nearly as well, and I also prefer the soap to the gelee because it doesn&#x27;t seem to smell or lather as well.  I&#x27;m true green!</li>
