            <li>Cheers and good luck!</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is the best Detox I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This stuff works good every time</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Was able to get a great job because of that detox.</li>
            <li>This product, however, is an effective way to dilute your urine for a set amount of time to pass a urine test.</li>
            <li>thought this would have worked because of good reviews mostly...  </li>
            <li>drank 30 Oz of water, the solution, then 30 more Oz of water.</li>
            <li>Ok so everyone that is buying this product needs to pass a drug test.</li>
            <li>Because most people I&#x27;ve seen have passed with it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off just keeping your money in your pocket</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best on the market and has never let me down.</li>
            <li>This colors the urine a bright yellow</li>
            <li>It kicks in almost right away.</li>
            <li>First of all, the term \\&quot;detox\\&quot; is something of a misnomer.</li>
            <li>I smoked like a week before the drug test and that day I drank some of this stuff and a gallon of water mixed with Certo :)</li>
            <li>After 1 1/2 hours I tested myself and it was positive for THC.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than many other similar products on the market.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an amazing FAIL SAFE solution to passing any drug test and it doesn&#x27;t cost a dime.  </li>
            <li>Straight out does not work.</li>
            <li>I am posting this because of all of the anxiety I&#x27;d experienced thanks to all of the fake posters with agendas, and of course, the obnoxious trolls with nothing useful to say.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the aformentioned trolls and</li>
            <li>60 fluid ounces of water with this product, so it effectively dilutes your urine to the point of it being water and not much else.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this if you are in a bind.</li>

            <li>times times a day, with my usage pretty constant for close to a year.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has a drug screen approaching fast.</li>
            <li>I tested positive for thc (at home), naturally freaked out and bought this as a last ditch effort.</li>
            <li>I simply don&#x27;t agree with the antiquated laws which pertain to certain organic substances, and the consumption thereof.</li>
            <li>I am a real person, who actually used this.</li>
            <li>The next test I took was 2 hours later to see if it worked, and the test came up positive.</li>
            <li>I choose to live my private life my way, and I don&#x27;t hurt anyone.</li>
            <li>Remember to use the middle of the stream when you test and you should be in the clear.</li>

            <li> I followed the directions to the T and failed! This product is absoluely No Good!</li>
            <li> This stuff works good every time</li>
            <li> Straight out does not work. Followed the directions carefully. Even used 2 bottles. 1 bottle two days in a row. Save your $$.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anybody who needs to cleanse their body of any toxins in a hurry!!! It&#x27;s the best on the market and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than many other similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> First of all, the term \\&quot;detox\\&quot; is something of a misnomer. This product does not clear out unwanted toxins from your body permanently, nor does it purify your urine or blood as an actual detox would. This product, however, is an effective way to dilute your urine for a set amount of time to pass a urine test. You&#x27;re required to drink approx. 60 fluid ounces of water with this product, so it effectively dilutes your urine to the point of it being water and not much else. What is actually in the detox bottle is carbohydrates, vitamin B1, B2, B12, Burdock root (which is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its diuretic properties) and a few other things. This colors the urine a bright yellow so it looks like a proper specimen and won&#x27;t alert your tester to your method of dilution.  That being said, there is a method to taking this product. Three hours before your test, drink 30 oz. of water (or two 16 ounces water bottles if you don&#x27;t have a measuring cup). 1 hour after that, you are required to drink down the 4 oz. bottle of \\&quot;detox\\&quot; and then another 30 ounces of water. At this time, you are to urinate two times before you take the drug test (FULLY empty your bladder each time). By the time you need to urinate a third time, you should be set to take your drug test. Remember to use the middle of the stream when you test and you should be in the clear. Just to quantify how well this works, here&#x27;s some numbers. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2, about 300 pounds and 30-35% body fat. I stopped smoking marijuana 11 days before the test. I would smoke 5-10 times times a day, with my usage pretty constant for close to a year.  My test results were negative for marijuana and all other drugs as well. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has a drug screen approaching fast. Cheers and good luck!</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff to get weed out of my system for a job, it did not work. I also didn&#x27;t quit smoking until the night before the test.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T.. . drank 30 Oz of water, the solution, then 30 more Oz of water. While my results came back negative I am having to take a retest because it was &amp;#34;inconclusive&amp;#34; and my creatine levels were too low. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> To pass you cannot smoke up until the day of the test.also no dairy product or bad eating.thats why most people fail.junk food. It works you have to remember you want less fat as possible.</li>
            <li> Ok so everyone that is buying this product needs to pass a drug test. I smoked like a week before the drug test and that day I drank some of this stuff and a gallon of water mixed with Certo :) So there you go folks</li>
            <li> Wow I just failed a UA. All bad</li>
            <li> Expiration Date?  Does anyone know if leaving it in the fridge for a year will ruin the product. I have used it twice for a lab urinalysis and passed both times. My problem is a have a test in two days and I have a 32 oz bottle but It has been in the fridge for a year. Does it have any live ingredient that may not survive long term refrigeration?</li>
            <li> FAILED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so I am a heavy or smoker. For problems from ulcers to mental issues. Pot is a gift from the earth. It has helped me and everyone in know in ways that 300000 man made pills wouldn&#x27;t cure.&lt;br /&gt;So I recently was getting a job in warehouse for a while I&#x27;ll my welding job picks back up. Had to submit a test the next day. I went to the might quin and got a bottle of the most expensive stuff they had. Studied the directions. Fallowed them precicely, and woke up this morning to a phone call saying I have failed the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 50 something bucks I spent on this at the store is irritating enough, but to have this NOT WORK AT ALL!?? You bet you I&#x27;m getting my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say this stuff doesn&#x27;t work. Because most people I&#x27;ve seen have passed with it. Bit I am going to say if your a heavy pot smoker. This is no for you. It doesn&#x27;t mask,cover up, hide, or anything. It just wasted my money and made me look like a fool.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the best Detox I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not temporary, it actually works if you follow the directions. I&#x27;ve passed countless UA&#x27;s. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It worked for me! Urinate twice before test and collected specimen from the middle of 3 urination. Will use again!</li>
            <li> The drink works! I had doubts because I smoke on a everyday basis.Like blunt after blunt, bowls, bong rips for days. Saturday I smoked over a quad. Smoked on Sunday and Monday. I had a interview Tuesday around 3pm, I found out later that day I got the position. I was also told that I had to take a drug test on Thursday.Started freakin out, knew there was NO chance in hell I would ever pass a test. I started drinking tons of  water that Wednesday and skating just to help out. I bought the detox drink, it was 40 bucks. That Thursday morning after reading the instructions I drank the detox. then the 30oz of water. It kicks in almost right away. I peed three times before i left my crib. Then went to the clinic and took my urine test. Got a call later that day saying I passed. Was able to get a great job because of that detox. recommend it to any heavy smoker like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I used -&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B002A54ZY0</li>
            <li> thought this would have worked because of good reviews mostly...  but yeah, definitely did not work.  don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months or so, i have passed 6 UAs with it and smoked until the day before each time</li>
            <li> Stay away! I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, i bought it at a local headshop and it doesn&#x27;t work. Here&#x27;s the scoop:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions just like that other guy said. Drank 30 oz water, one hour later drank the drink, and then 16 oz water. I had bought a bunch of test strips from Amazon. After 1 1/2 hours I tested myself and it was positive for THC. The next test I took was 2 hours later to see if it worked, and the test came up positive. One last time I checked after a total of 5 hours and it still came up dirty. I suggest you save your money. Go with dilution or synthetic or substitute. Good luck</li>
            <li> follow directions- works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This works. Period. I tested positive for thc (at home), naturally freaked out and bought this as a last ditch effort. Took as directed and three hours later passed with flying colors. Highly recommend this if you are in a bind.</li>
            <li> I stopped smoking for 27 days, took this expensive product , and it came back positive,followed directions exactly,i would not recommend product</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an amazing FAIL SAFE solution to passing any drug test and it doesn&#x27;t cost a dime.  It&#x27;s called \\&quot;don&#x27;t do drugs, loser\\&quot;.  Try it.  It works EVERY TIME.</li>
            <li> I am posting this because of all of the anxiety I&#x27;d experienced thanks to all of the fake posters with agendas, and of course, the obnoxious trolls with nothing useful to say. I used this product earlier this week. I followed the directions, to the letter. I took a DOT pre-employment test. Thanks to the aformentioned trolls and the like, I was nervous every second thereafter. The end result... I resume my career with a new company Monday. I am a real person, who actually used this. I don&#x27;t work for the manufacturer, or any related entity. I didn&#x27;t even purchase it through Amazon. I choose to live my private life my way, and I don&#x27;t hurt anyone. I simply don&#x27;t agree with the antiquated laws which pertain to certain organic substances, and the consumption thereof. I simply don&#x27;t agree with verifiably harmful substances such as pharmaceuticals and alcohol. Anyway, I digress. To whom it may concern: As long as you abstain for a few days prior, drink lots of water prior, and FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS... it works. Best of luck, and God bless.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money did not work at all. I would not recommend this to anyone. You&#x27;re better off just keeping your money in your pocket</li>
