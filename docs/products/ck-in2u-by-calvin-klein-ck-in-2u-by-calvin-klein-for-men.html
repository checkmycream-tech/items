            <li>I do tend to use a bit more of this at a time because the scent isn&#x27;t as strong (pungent?)</li>
            <li>the most important - on the bottle</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available here .</li>
            <li>It has a smooth sexy smell and is great for a younger guy (he is 26).  </li>
            <li>Very good perfume to buy it for the day and is excellent is Adacta body very well and last long.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is cheap, the bottle has a two-three time alluring look which makes you want to hold it and spray but trust me on this one, this is not where it&#x27;s it just because it&#x27;s ck</li>

            <li>Almost addictive â€” refreshing and light, but not too light.</li>
            <li>It is a clean and crisp fragrance and it long-lasting.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a great everyday cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but not nearly as nasty as some others for the same price on the market.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne but just not too sure if the bottle is somewhat thinner inside hiding the expected volume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my constant companion, but it does go everywhere with me, and what better recommendation can you get than that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CK never fails.  </li>

            <li>colognes that I strongly suggest to be tried out at your local store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tells me that if I want to order a perfume for a gift I certainly should not order it from Amazon, since you don&#x27;t know what you are going to receive.... and you can&#x27;t return them.</li>

            <li>Good product but expensive as heck.</li>
            <li>I was initially looking for a Tommy Bahama type cologne and just wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>This is a new perfume that was not open before I received it, unlike the CK One I ordered at the same time.</li>
            <li>its stay long and very masculine.</li>
            <li>As opposed to the Boss or some other CK colognes, this is cheap enough to use for your everyday needs.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband got this cologne two years ago and I can&#x27;t get enough of him when he wears it.  It has a smooth sexy smell and is great for a younger guy (he is 26).  It lasted him two years so I have to admit it is a great deal.  Mind you he would use it everyday as well.  He just ran out sadly and asked if I wanted to go cologne shopping, I asked him, \\&quot;Why?  I wouldn&#x27;t want you to wear anything else.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Good product but expensive as heck.</li>
            <li> I wished to return this item but have no time to do it and i just keep it but otherwise wouldnt hasitate a minute. Of course the company offered money return for it and the shipping but they know they are selling the thing different from the description - pic doesn&#x27;t show the real product either. 1) the box wasn&#x27;t original but grey one. 2) there is no cap to cover the bottle 3) the most important - on the bottle there is inprinted \\&quot;for her\\&quot; that this is scent for her but was covered by white sticker (like nobody could notice) so I was confused is it the one i ordered or no. After i contacted the seller they assure me that the scent is for man not women. To sum up I am not happy at all with this purchase. Otherwise maybe that is what you get for this price.</li>
            <li> El perfume es muy economico y huele muy bien, estoy muy contenta de haberlo comprado y llego a tiempo. Es una buena opcion para un regalo :)</li>
            <li> Trust me, this is a very nice fragrance for men.  I already have it for women, so I suggested that my boyfriend try it while walking through a department store.  He fell in love with this cologne!!  I had to force him to put it down, because he tried to bathe in it!!  It is a clean and crisp fragrance and it long-lasting. This is definitely for the grown and sexy!!</li>
            <li> Been looking for this cologne all over the place , went to Macy&#x27;s and was told it was discontinue . Now I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available here . I am sure that I&#x27;m gonna get compliments by beautiful women .</li>
            <li> Love this scent and get lot&#x27;s of compliments!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! As opposed to the Boss or some other CK colognes, this is cheap enough to use for your everyday needs. I do tend to use a bit more of this at a time because the scent isn&#x27;t as strong (pungent?) as the aforementioned HB, but at the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought a smaller bottle of it that can fit in your jean pocket (apparently), but I&#x27;ve since gone &amp; bought the larger 100ml bottle. It&#x27;s not my constant companion, but it does go everywhere with me, and what better recommendation can you get than that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It&#x27;s cheap, but not nearly as nasty as some others for the same price on the market. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I received this perfume in a nice ,bubble wrapped packing ,my husband liked it as a fathers day present ,perfect fragrance for summer not too strong but leaves its pleasant scent impression ,even after few hours ,ideal for teen-agers and adults ,the most impressive thing about this product is the expedite shipping ,cant believe it that I received it before estimated delivery date :)</li>

            <li> Cheap, great smell! Awesome I would recommend to enayone who is in a need of the basic all in one perfume.</li>
            <li> Good conditional and quality. It looks good and I believe it smells good too. It&#x27;s gift and my friend loves it.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t go wrong with Calvin Klein colognes.  I bought this for my 36 year old son and he wears it almost every day.  I think I did good!!!</li>
            <li> This product is ideal for shoppers who want a great product at a low price. Smells great.....and at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Perfumes all over the world are suffering and these deplorable times, here is another deplorable effort made by CK. Yes, it is cheap, the bottle has a two-three time alluring look which makes you want to hold it and spray but trust me on this one, this is not where it&#x27;s it just because it&#x27;s ck and it&#x27;s value for money. Yes, if you are looking for value for money, this may be a 3 star pefume for you but if you are looking to have a summer of smell and wonder, this may not be the best way to look back at your 2014. My father gifted this to me since he said he doesn&#x27;t need it, that should have been a sign of worry in itself :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CK, you can do a lot better, buddies.</li>
            <li> First off, I have not purchased this product, yet.  I received a small 0.5 oz sample size from some promotion a while back and have just recently been using the product.  Just the other night, a bunch of friends and I were hangin&#x27; around.  By the end of the evening, hugs and goodbyes were given and received.  Afterwards, I was told by a couple of the girls that I smelled really nice tonight.  This along with how good this stuff smells makes me want to purchase a 5 oz bottle as soon as I can.  Pretty good stuff if you get compliments...</li>
            <li> Excellent, very good product.</li>
            <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li> My order was in my home in 24 hours. Perfect!</li>
            <li> excellent very goog, thank you</li>
            <li> This is a new perfume that was not open before I received it, unlike the CK One I ordered at the same time. The box was still in its plastic wrap. I was shocked to receive this one in such perfect condition while in the same order the other perfume was a used or at least opened product. This tells me that if I want to order a perfume for a gift I certainly should not order it from Amazon, since you don&#x27;t know what you are going to receive.... and you can&#x27;t return them.</li>

I actually loved the smell. Almost addictive â€” refreshing and light, but not too light. For the price, this is a great everyday cologne.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. It is best bang for the buck and with a great scent it can&#x27;t be left out of anyone&#x27;s collection.</li>

            <li> This box arrived in &amp;#34;gift perfect&amp;#34; condition.  Box was in perfect condition and has plastic shrink wrap - just as if purchased in store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparatively, the price on Amazon was cheaper for this same size bottle, even compared to a discount department store.</li>
            <li> This cologne is one my favorites.  I visited a department store to look for a replacement after running out, with none available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After testing a few, lo and behold, I found out that CK Euphoria has an identical smell! (IMO)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in case this cologne is no longer found, CK EUPHORIA is the replacement, *in my opinion*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Euphoria-Calvin-Klein-Toilette-Spray/dp/B000JL5V0E/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371786500&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;ck+euphoria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other colognes that I strongly suggest to be tried out at your local store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-CK OBSESSION&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Obsession-Calvin-Klein-Toilette-Spray/dp/B000E7YJR4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371786410&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;ck+obsession&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-CK OBSESSION NIGHT&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Obsession-Night-Calvin-Klein-Toilette/dp/B000C21096/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371786430&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;ck+obsession+night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-DOLCE &amp; GABBANA [ORIGINAL]&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Dolce-Gabbana-Toilette-Spray-Ounce/dp/B0009OAHIM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_9?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371786319&amp;sr&#x3D;8-9&amp;keywords&#x3D;dolce+%26+gabbana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-FCUK [ORIGINAL] (aka French Connection UK)&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/French-Connection-Toilette-Spray-Ounces/dp/B000C1UEWG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371786297&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;FCUK</li>
