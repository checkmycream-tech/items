            <li>The wand application is convenient and seemed like a good idea</li>

            <li>I own a skincare spa.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe anyone has anything to say about it.</li>
            <li>It goes on the eyelashes so nicely.</li>
            <li>Honestly this did not make my eyelashes any longer or any darker.</li>
            <li>and this is with any kind of eye product including contacts.</li>
            <li>I have had many people come up to me and tell me what beautiful full eye lashes I have.  </li>
            <li>Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about purchasing this product</li>
            <li>a happy person right now</li>
            <li>Overall great product and great price.</li>
            <li>I thought it was too good to be true</li>
            <li>This is ok...</li>
            <li>If I had maybe it would have worked better for me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I love this Diva Stuff product.</li>
            <li>I love the eyelash conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more and giving as gifts to my friends.</li>
            <li>Will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>This product worked ok for making my lashes longer.</li>
            <li>Will buy again from this seller!!! :)</li>
            <li>They already seem to be holding up to my eyelash curler better - probably because they are getting stronger and since the look nicer</li>
            <li>:) They are already looking shinier and thicker, so they stand out more.  </li>
            <li>Healthy, longer, thicker.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I absolutely love the results.</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>I love them both.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and really works.  </li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>and I love the hydrating lip balm and the coconut hand cream gift</li>
            <li>I love this...</li>
            <li>/&gt;works more like an eye lash conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love Diva Stuff products.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again when I run out :)</li>
            <li>I love the product,  I have been using it for about three weeks now</li>
            <li>more for pverall lash health.</li>
            <li>After using this eye lash conditioner product, my lashes feel thicker and look better when I apply my mascara.</li>
            <li>so if I&#x27;m going to put something on my lashes all night I want to make sure it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love Diva Stuff.  </li>
            <li>I may try it again after a couple more weeks to see if I can give this product a chance.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell if it helps my lashes to be more healthy.  </li>
            <li>and i can tell my lashes feel more conditioned ,this has not caused my eyes to sting or water</li>
            <li>sure if my Lashes have grown but</li>
            <li>so when you close the top it wont squish out.</li>
            <li>The Seller, Diva Stuff are really top notch.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended to many friends and family.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love all DIVA Stuff products.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying a second tube as my daughter has already pilfered it, lol!</li>
            <li>Just got this product recently and it is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and easy to carry around in your makeup bag :)</li>
            <li>I am just so happy that a friend encouraged me to try this conditioner not only because of how effective it has been on my eyelashes ......</li>
            <li>, I was so happy because all of their products are natural...</li>
            <li>It smells great, is all natural, and gives my lashes a lustrous sheen.</li>
            <li>Really its so good and now I have a good results on fast time</li>
            <li>but yes it&#x27;s true !</li>
            <li>I ordered the product hoping to get some of the wonderful results that other users are getting.</li>
            <li>Easy to use...put it on after I brush for bed...</li>
            <li>So easy, so affordable.  </li>
            <li>and they are not falling off as easily.</li>
            <li>I also notice that my lashes don&#x27;t break off as easily as they used to.</li>
            <li>goes on easy  </li>
            <li>It goes on so easy</li>
            <li>This is just an easy way to apply a product you can find elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>At this rate am pretty sure I could go mascara free very soon ;) :D</li>
            <li>A bonus of the oil is it seems to be softening the fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>otherwise, amazing natural way to improve eyelash length :)</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of Diva Stuff</li>
            <li>It is a nice buy for the price, and it really conditions your lashes.</li>
            <li>The free samples were Fountain of Youth Face Cream and Charcoal and Bamboo face scrubbies.</li>
            <li>I have yet to use the free samples yet.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The package is really cheap.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but it seems like the natural ingredients are good for your lashes.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;ll need to use something else on days I wear my contacts, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>and they also became much stronger!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Diva Stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>but they are also significantly fuller now as well.</li>
            <li>that kind of making you not be able to open your eyes!!</li>
            <li>The best part about this product is that it contains only natural products so doesn&#x27;t cause any harm.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>But overall good product.</li>
            <li>and I saw how full her lashes were</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for something to nourish your lashes so they hold up to your abuse better, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I tell them to buy this product and the ones who have, love it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>This did make my eye lashes nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no bad reactions to this at all.  </li>
            <li>No bad odors.</li>
            <li>very very effective, but be careful not to get this product in your</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lucky girl)</li>
            <li>Thank you, Diva Stuff, for sending your eyelash conditioner to me so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product as a quick substitute.</li>
            <li>I have tried other lash lengthening product and this is by far the best one!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever gotten such good service from anything I have bought on amazon.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>Very oily!!</li>
            <li>Even after the first night of using this I felt like they became stronger!</li>
            <li>I love how all the ingredients are all natural, too!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it thickens or lengthens lashes on its own since I use it in combination with another such product (Hydroxatone).</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Obviously, everyone&#x27;s different so if you try this you should take your time and make sure that if&#x27;s good for you too.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice much change in length, but I will continue to use this product for some more time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct difference in my lashes while using this product - they seem to be longer and more lush.</li>
            <li>When I received this product it came with two free samples and a cute letter with a 15%off coupon for my next purchase!</li>
            <li>I love Diva Stuff products and all of the natural ingredients used.</li>
            <li>guess for the price it might be worth a try for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love the feel of the texture of conditioner as well as the fact that it is made from natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t wait to see what next month will be like.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any growth or thickness in my eyelashes though, but  my eyelashes are really moisturized, strong, and they feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I would put it on right before going to bed its the easiest time to have the formula sit on your lashes.</li>
            <li>and I swear I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>i use right before bed every night .Not</li>
            <li>Love to conditioning benefit and have noticed less lash fallout, plus, my mascara goes on better.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using the product long, just waiting to see some amazing result.</li>
            <li>Also, in the past, I&#x27;ve tried extensions, which have been great a number of times but horrid once or twice.  </li>
            <li>I think it would definitely be effective in the long term.</li>
            <li>This lovely little jelly works wonders, and my lashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li>In three days I noticed a large difference!</li>
            <li>All those good and natural ingredients mixed together.</li>
            <li>The shopping was very fast on this</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t stick the stuff directly INTO your eye and you&#x27;ll be fine ;)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I will keep my fingers cross :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used facial scrubs before, but this one keeps your face a more hydrating feeling.  </li>
            <li>I am using it more regularly as time goes by, because it&#x27;s easier to remember to do something once you see results, yet I still have a lot</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve only been using this for 5 days or so, but I already love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I chose this one and not one of the $50+ similar products.</li>
            <li>I didnt believe that something so inexpensive could actually make my eyelashes look better but based on the item&#x27;s reviews and the price I felt I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing please save your money!</li>
            <li>My lashes (upper and lower) are getting longer and are curving more.</li>
            <li>for the first week, i used it morning and night...</li>
            <li>but I can vouch that this one really does work!</li>
            <li>I was really really happy to find that this product was made with all natural ingredients too, I did some research before I bought any lash conditioners because personally I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Jen Aniston uses a different brand, but she shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Even if to use it consistently.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I am really starting to love Diva Stuff products.</li>
            <li>I have always had shorter top lashes than on the bottom and Diva Stuff&#x27;s Eyelash Conditioner has definitely helped to improve them!</li>
            <li>Since I had a good base to workw ith, I wanted a natural solution instead of a chemical one, and this stuff is perfect!  </li>
            <li>Other than that it does smell nice but kinda makes your eyes itch and water</li>
            <li>I am too much of a scaredy cat to try some of those Rx lash growth products and not wealthy enough to keep up with extensions, and this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Also did not notice any positive results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some growth, but nothing similar to what the other reviews have experienced.</li>
            <li>Used consistently with out much change.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to claim &amp;#34;bait and switch&amp;#34; because I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same company and product, but I think they gave me an older formula in a plastic squeeze tube.</li>
            <li>Only reason this gets a star is for the conditioning effect, which pretty much any single good quality oil can give you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for 2.5 months and it has not had any effect on the length and thickness of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I have extremely short, fine, and sparse lashes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it during the day because it clouds my vision and irritates my eyes so much.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference...</li>
            <li>Thanks Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how much longer and fuller my lashes are.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the difference</li>
            <li>Yep, it really does work.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much healthier and have grown since using this product along with Speed Lash.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the reviews but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>I really like the product and the shipping</li>
            <li>was very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>My lashes look much healthier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use it as much,</li>
            <li>This will make your lashes so much stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>Use it every night and it really helps keep lashes from clumping and they do look longer.</li>
            <li>with the product i was very eagerly to try the product</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see results.</li>
            <li>thank you so much ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
            <li>My lashes ere much longer than they were before I used this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>absolutely encouraged growth in places that have always been bald.  </li>
            <li>did help my lashes or brows grow any or get thicker just was very greasy on my eyes</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve not seen much of anything else.</li>
            <li>that way it wont get too much in your eyes.</li>
            <li>This stuff by Diva Stuff, no pun intended, really does work.</li>
            <li>Thanks Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li>Is it real??</li>
            <li>and it really does burn my eyes</li>
            <li>Very oily ladies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my lashes are darker longer and much softer.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of the Diva Stuff Eyelash Conditioner in the near future.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>Wow, who knew this could bring such fun to life!!</li>
            <li>So much better than other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and will last a long time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I wear contacts, have lots of allergies, and am generally pretty sensitive all around.  </li>
            <li>first thing first seller is very good,fast shipping and send some extra stuff</li>
            <li>I was hoping to lengthen and make my lashes more voluminous (mine are already dark), but it didn&#x27;t work on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more expensive products that worked faster and produced better results.</li>
            <li>I have a good number of lashes, but they fell out too easily and were thin and dry.  </li>
            <li>I received the package quickly, but the packaging is completely different from what is shown.</li>
            <li>then as we got older his grew and my shrank.</li>
            <li>As I get older my eye lashes are thinning.</li>
            <li>To give you an idea of how fantastic this product is, my husband, who didn&#x27;t realize I had gotten new glasses for over a month, asked me after two weeks, &amp;#34; Your lashes are so long!</li>
            <li>I had almost no bottom lashes and suddenly for the first time in my life they are there!</li>
            <li>Im glad I got this little tube.</li>
            <li>Since switching from the previous eyelash growth product I was using to this, all the length I experienced with that previous product is gone.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind too much because it does keep my eyelashes conditioned and soft.</li>
            <li>Every Diva Stuff product I&#x27;ve tried so far has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>Sent a free sample and wrap everything carefully for ship.  </li>
            <li>but i think it is worth it and will probably last another month or so, hopefully continuing to increase my eyelash growth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally give lengthy reviews.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product, I really didn&#x27;t have a lot of confidence in it despite the solid ratings.</li>
            <li>I think it really is a great conditioner but can be a little on the greasy side which is why I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I honestly was a little unsure if this would work for me, since I was thinking that it would only work to condition my lashes and that&#x27;s not the problem</li>
            <li>And all the ingredients are natural, which is a must for me!  </li>
            <li>Quite frankly, I was willing to gamble basically ten dollars in hopes it would work.</li>
            <li>Definitely plan to place an order on this soon , once my first one is finished and I would deff.</li>
            <li>so I just apply mascara and it curls up naturally!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that this would be effective on my sparse brows and lashes, but I have always loved Diva Stuff products and they always deliver what they promise, so I figured I might at least get an improvement.</li>
            <li>within just a few uses it made my eyebrows look beautiful n thick.</li>
            <li>I found that I could only wear this at night before bed because it will make any eye make-up run and look a mess even after wiping most of it off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only natural, but it really works.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and that might be be because it stings them.  </li>
            <li>but I have not been using it frequently.</li>
            <li>I do like that the product is all natural.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 3 stars because it is really just a conditioner</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on reviews, price and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>20&lt;br /&gt;Almost finished and any result so far</li>
            <li>Since starting to use it my lashes are much longer and stronger.  </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>I use it before bed with Speedlash eyelash growth and although I&#x27;ve only been using them for about a month if seems that my lashes are getting longer and thicker and not falling out as much.</li>
            <li>so its not fake eyelashes long</li>
            <li>This product actually works and works fast.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this directly from the Diva website.  </li>
            <li>I try to stick to products with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This is very inexpensive too for a bottle that&#x27;ll definitely last....</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes and eyebrows soft</li>
            <li>So naturally, I decided to do this too.</li>
            <li>This product makes my eyelids burn - so I must be sensitive to something in the mixture.  </li>
            <li>and I see a marked difference in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>This conditioner has helped keep my aging eyelashes full and dark.</li>
            <li>It will be a good gift to help someone kick the fake lashes.</li>
            <li>so my own are thin</li>
            <li>--I pretty much never wear mascara because it only emphasizes the fact that I have almost no lashes at all, so the problem&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re dry and breaking off short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have always been lacking - they&#x27;re not thick, they&#x27;re not dark, they&#x27;re not long.</li>
            <li>I dont see much of a difference in length because my eyelashes are already long</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much more natural than always gluing fake eyelashes on and so much cheaper than doing eyelash extensions...  </li>
            <li>It really didnt make my lashes super long, but they did grow a little</li>
            <li>It had a large applicator brush so it made a big line of oil above my eyelid.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin eyelashes, so I thought it might help.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using it every night (mostly), I definitely noticed that the bald spots had filled in, my lashes look thicker, and they&#x27;re longer and darker.  </li>
            <li>I put several coats on for the 3 days, and I have RED RASHES around my whole eye</li>
            <li>It had an unexpected side effect the very small fine creases in my eyelids (the ones that come with age) are GONE.</li>
            <li>For that, I love this product because all women who use mascara know how weak your lashes can get and keep falling out.</li>
            <li>I put it on pratically every night before bed and there is still alot of product left, I wasn&#x27;t sure about sending $12 on such a small product</li>
            <li>I store it standing up and away from other things because it will ooze out of the top a little.  </li>
            <li>I normally and naturally have short lashes and shoot straight down.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and I noticed a difference after only a couple of times using it.  </li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t what i expected didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to the generic Latisse and my eyes would get swollen and the skin underneath would peel.</li>
            <li>Personally my eyelashes are short to normal length</li>
            <li>The eyelash Conditioner helps promote long, thick, healthy lashes</li>
            <li>I can see new brow hairs coming through where there was a definite bald space in my eyebrow, and my left eyelashes are actually noticibly longer and slightly darker than the right, untreated side.</li>
            <li>My lashes are already healthy &amp; long, but this takes them to ridiculous lengths.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps out my thin lashes :)  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pale and very, very sparse.  </li>
            <li>To provide full disclosure, I was blessed to be born with long lashes; however, I learned the hard way that if lashes are not conditioned they can become brittle and break off.  </li>

            <li> The wand application is convenient and seemed like a good idea</li>

            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe anyone has anything to say about it.</li>
            <li> It goes on the eyelashes so nicely.</li>
            <li> Honestly this did not make my eyelashes any longer or any darker.</li>
            <li> and this is with any kind of eye product including contacts.</li>
            <li> I have had many people come up to me and tell me what beautiful full eye lashes I have.  </li>
            <li> Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about purchasing this product</li>
            <li> a happy person right now</li>

            <li> I love the eyelash conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more and giving as gifts to my friends.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> This product worked ok for making my lashes longer.</li>
            <li> Will buy again from this seller!!! :)</li>
            <li> They already seem to be holding up to my eyelash curler better - probably because they are getting stronger and since the look nicer</li>
            <li> :) They are already looking shinier and thicker, so they stand out more.  </li>
            <li> Healthy, longer, thicker.  </li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I absolutely love the results.</li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> I love them both.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and really works.  </li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> and I love the hydrating lip balm and the coconut hand cream gift</li>
            <li> I love this...</li>
            <li> /&gt;works more like an eye lash conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love Diva Stuff products.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again when I run out :)</li>
            <li> I love the product,  I have been using it for about three weeks now</li>
            <li> more for pverall lash health.</li>
            <li> After using this eye lash conditioner product, my lashes feel thicker and look better when I apply my mascara.</li>
            <li> so if I&#x27;m going to put something on my lashes all night I want to make sure it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Diva Stuff.  </li>
            <li> I may try it again after a couple more weeks to see if I can give this product a chance.  </li>
            <li> I cannot tell if it helps my lashes to be more healthy.  </li>
            <li> and i can tell my lashes feel more conditioned ,this has not caused my eyes to sting or water</li>
            <li> sure if my Lashes have grown but</li>
            <li> so when you close the top it wont squish out.</li>
            <li> The Seller, Diva Stuff are really top notch.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended to many friends and family.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love all DIVA Stuff products.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying a second tube as my daughter has already pilfered it, lol!</li>
            <li> Just got this product recently and it is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and easy to carry around in your makeup bag :)</li>
            <li> I am just so happy that a friend encouraged me to try this conditioner not only because of how effective it has been on my eyelashes ......</li>
            <li> , I was so happy because all of their products are natural...</li>
            <li> It smells great, is all natural, and gives my lashes a lustrous sheen.</li>
            <li> Really its so good and now I have a good results on fast time</li>
            <li> but yes it&#x27;s true !</li>
            <li> I ordered the product hoping to get some of the wonderful results that other users are getting.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...put it on after I brush for bed...</li>
            <li> So easy, so affordable.  </li>
            <li> and they are not falling off as easily.</li>
            <li> I also notice that my lashes don&#x27;t break off as easily as they used to.</li>
            <li> goes on easy  </li>
            <li> It goes on so easy</li>
            <li> This is just an easy way to apply a product you can find elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> At this rate am pretty sure I could go mascara free very soon ;) :D</li>
            <li> A bonus of the oil is it seems to be softening the fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> otherwise, amazing natural way to improve eyelash length :)</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of Diva Stuff</li>
            <li> It is a nice buy for the price, and it really conditions your lashes.</li>
            <li> The free samples were Fountain of Youth Face Cream and Charcoal and Bamboo face scrubbies.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use the free samples yet.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The package is really cheap.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but it seems like the natural ingredients are good for your lashes.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;ll need to use something else on days I wear my contacts, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> and they also became much stronger!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Diva Stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> but they are also significantly fuller now as well.</li>
            <li> that kind of making you not be able to open your eyes!!</li>
            <li> The best part about this product is that it contains only natural products so doesn&#x27;t cause any harm.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> But overall good product.</li>
            <li> and I saw how full her lashes were</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for something to nourish your lashes so they hold up to your abuse better, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I tell them to buy this product and the ones who have, love it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> This did make my eye lashes nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no bad reactions to this at all.  </li>
            <li> No bad odors.</li>
            <li> very very effective, but be careful not to get this product in your</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lucky girl)</li>
            <li> Thank you, Diva Stuff, for sending your eyelash conditioner to me so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a quick substitute.</li>
            <li> I have tried other lash lengthening product and this is by far the best one!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever gotten such good service from anything I have bought on amazon.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> Very oily!!</li>
            <li> Even after the first night of using this I felt like they became stronger!</li>
            <li> I love how all the ingredients are all natural, too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it thickens or lengthens lashes on its own since I use it in combination with another such product (Hydroxatone).</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Obviously, everyone&#x27;s different so if you try this you should take your time and make sure that if&#x27;s good for you too.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice much change in length, but I will continue to use this product for some more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct difference in my lashes while using this product - they seem to be longer and more lush.</li>
            <li> When I received this product it came with two free samples and a cute letter with a 15%off coupon for my next purchase!</li>
            <li> I love Diva Stuff products and all of the natural ingredients used.</li>
            <li> guess for the price it might be worth a try for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just love the feel of the texture of conditioner as well as the fact that it is made from natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t wait to see what next month will be like.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any growth or thickness in my eyelashes though, but  my eyelashes are really moisturized, strong, and they feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I would put it on right before going to bed its the easiest time to have the formula sit on your lashes.</li>
            <li> and I swear I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> i use right before bed every night .Not</li>
            <li> Love to conditioning benefit and have noticed less lash fallout, plus, my mascara goes on better.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using the product long, just waiting to see some amazing result.</li>
            <li> Also, in the past, I&#x27;ve tried extensions, which have been great a number of times but horrid once or twice.  </li>
            <li> I think it would definitely be effective in the long term.</li>
            <li> This lovely little jelly works wonders, and my lashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li> In three days I noticed a large difference!</li>
            <li> All those good and natural ingredients mixed together.</li>
            <li> The shopping was very fast on this</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t stick the stuff directly INTO your eye and you&#x27;ll be fine ;)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I will keep my fingers cross :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used facial scrubs before, but this one keeps your face a more hydrating feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am using it more regularly as time goes by, because it&#x27;s easier to remember to do something once you see results, yet I still have a lot</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only been using this for 5 days or so, but I already love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I chose this one and not one of the $50+ similar products.</li>
            <li> I didnt believe that something so inexpensive could actually make my eyelashes look better but based on the item&#x27;s reviews and the price I felt I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing please save your money!</li>
            <li> My lashes (upper and lower) are getting longer and are curving more.</li>
            <li> for the first week, i used it morning and night...</li>
            <li> but I can vouch that this one really does work!</li>
            <li> I was really really happy to find that this product was made with all natural ingredients too, I did some research before I bought any lash conditioners because personally I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Jen Aniston uses a different brand, but she shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Even if to use it consistently.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I am really starting to love Diva Stuff products.</li>
            <li> I have always had shorter top lashes than on the bottom and Diva Stuff&#x27;s Eyelash Conditioner has definitely helped to improve them!</li>
            <li> Since I had a good base to workw ith, I wanted a natural solution instead of a chemical one, and this stuff is perfect!  </li>
            <li> Other than that it does smell nice but kinda makes your eyes itch and water</li>
            <li> I am too much of a scaredy cat to try some of those Rx lash growth products and not wealthy enough to keep up with extensions, and this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Also did not notice any positive results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some growth, but nothing similar to what the other reviews have experienced.</li>
            <li> Used consistently with out much change.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to claim &amp;#34;bait and switch&amp;#34; because I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same company and product, but I think they gave me an older formula in a plastic squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> Only reason this gets a star is for the conditioning effect, which pretty much any single good quality oil can give you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for 2.5 months and it has not had any effect on the length and thickness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have extremely short, fine, and sparse lashes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it during the day because it clouds my vision and irritates my eyes so much.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference...</li>
            <li> Thanks Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how much longer and fuller my lashes are.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the difference</li>
            <li> Yep, it really does work.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much healthier and have grown since using this product along with Speed Lash.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> I really like the product and the shipping</li>
            <li> was very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look much healthier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use it as much,</li>
            <li> This will make your lashes so much stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> Use it every night and it really helps keep lashes from clumping and they do look longer.</li>
            <li> with the product i was very eagerly to try the product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see results.</li>
            <li> thank you so much ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
            <li> My lashes ere much longer than they were before I used this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> absolutely encouraged growth in places that have always been bald.  </li>
            <li> did help my lashes or brows grow any or get thicker just was very greasy on my eyes</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve not seen much of anything else.</li>
            <li> that way it wont get too much in your eyes.</li>
            <li> This stuff by Diva Stuff, no pun intended, really does work.</li>
            <li> Thanks Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li> Is it real??</li>
            <li> and it really does burn my eyes</li>
            <li> Very oily ladies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my lashes are darker longer and much softer.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of the Diva Stuff Eyelash Conditioner in the near future.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Wow, who knew this could bring such fun to life!!</li>
            <li> So much better than other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and will last a long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I wear contacts, have lots of allergies, and am generally pretty sensitive all around.  </li>
            <li> first thing first seller is very good,fast shipping and send some extra stuff</li>
            <li> I was hoping to lengthen and make my lashes more voluminous (mine are already dark), but it didn&#x27;t work on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive products that worked faster and produced better results.</li>
            <li> I have a good number of lashes, but they fell out too easily and were thin and dry.  </li>
            <li> I received the package quickly, but the packaging is completely different from what is shown.</li>
            <li> then as we got older his grew and my shrank.</li>
            <li> As I get older my eye lashes are thinning.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of how fantastic this product is, my husband, who didn&#x27;t realize I had gotten new glasses for over a month, asked me after two weeks, &amp;#34; Your lashes are so long!</li>
            <li> I had almost no bottom lashes and suddenly for the first time in my life they are there!</li>
            <li> Im glad I got this little tube.</li>
            <li> Since switching from the previous eyelash growth product I was using to this, all the length I experienced with that previous product is gone.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind too much because it does keep my eyelashes conditioned and soft.</li>
            <li> Every Diva Stuff product I&#x27;ve tried so far has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> Sent a free sample and wrap everything carefully for ship.  </li>
            <li> but i think it is worth it and will probably last another month or so, hopefully continuing to increase my eyelash growth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally give lengthy reviews.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I really didn&#x27;t have a lot of confidence in it despite the solid ratings.</li>
            <li> I think it really is a great conditioner but can be a little on the greasy side which is why I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I honestly was a little unsure if this would work for me, since I was thinking that it would only work to condition my lashes and that&#x27;s not the problem</li>
            <li> And all the ingredients are natural, which is a must for me!  </li>
            <li> Quite frankly, I was willing to gamble basically ten dollars in hopes it would work.</li>
            <li> Definitely plan to place an order on this soon , once my first one is finished and I would deff.</li>
            <li> so I just apply mascara and it curls up naturally!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would be effective on my sparse brows and lashes, but I have always loved Diva Stuff products and they always deliver what they promise, so I figured I might at least get an improvement.</li>
            <li> within just a few uses it made my eyebrows look beautiful n thick.</li>
            <li> I found that I could only wear this at night before bed because it will make any eye make-up run and look a mess even after wiping most of it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only natural, but it really works.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and that might be be because it stings them.  </li>
            <li> but I have not been using it frequently.</li>
            <li> I do like that the product is all natural.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 3 stars because it is really just a conditioner</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews, price and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> 20&lt;br /&gt;Almost finished and any result so far</li>
            <li> Since starting to use it my lashes are much longer and stronger.  </li>
            <li> All natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I use it before bed with Speedlash eyelash growth and although I&#x27;ve only been using them for about a month if seems that my lashes are getting longer and thicker and not falling out as much.</li>
            <li> so its not fake eyelashes long</li>
            <li> This product actually works and works fast.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this directly from the Diva website.  </li>
            <li> I try to stick to products with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This is very inexpensive too for a bottle that&#x27;ll definitely last....</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes and eyebrows soft</li>
            <li> So naturally, I decided to do this too.</li>
            <li> This product makes my eyelids burn - so I must be sensitive to something in the mixture.  </li>
            <li> and I see a marked difference in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> This conditioner has helped keep my aging eyelashes full and dark.</li>
            <li> It will be a good gift to help someone kick the fake lashes.</li>
            <li> so my own are thin</li>
            <li> --I pretty much never wear mascara because it only emphasizes the fact that I have almost no lashes at all, so the problem&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re dry and breaking off short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have always been lacking - they&#x27;re not thick, they&#x27;re not dark, they&#x27;re not long.</li>
            <li> I dont see much of a difference in length because my eyelashes are already long</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much more natural than always gluing fake eyelashes on and so much cheaper than doing eyelash extensions...  </li>
            <li> It really didnt make my lashes super long, but they did grow a little</li>
            <li> It had a large applicator brush so it made a big line of oil above my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin eyelashes, so I thought it might help.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it every night (mostly), I definitely noticed that the bald spots had filled in, my lashes look thicker, and they&#x27;re longer and darker.  </li>
            <li> I put several coats on for the 3 days, and I have RED RASHES around my whole eye</li>
            <li> It had an unexpected side effect the very small fine creases in my eyelids (the ones that come with age) are GONE.</li>
            <li> For that, I love this product because all women who use mascara know how weak your lashes can get and keep falling out.</li>
            <li> I put it on pratically every night before bed and there is still alot of product left, I wasn&#x27;t sure about sending $12 on such a small product</li>
            <li> I store it standing up and away from other things because it will ooze out of the top a little.  </li>
            <li> I normally and naturally have short lashes and shoot straight down.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and I noticed a difference after only a couple of times using it.  </li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t what i expected didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to the generic Latisse and my eyes would get swollen and the skin underneath would peel.</li>
            <li> Personally my eyelashes are short to normal length</li>
            <li> The eyelash Conditioner helps promote long, thick, healthy lashes</li>
            <li> I can see new brow hairs coming through where there was a definite bald space in my eyebrow, and my left eyelashes are actually noticibly longer and slightly darker than the right, untreated side.</li>
            <li> My lashes are already healthy &amp; long, but this takes them to ridiculous lengths.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps out my thin lashes :)  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pale and very, very sparse.  </li>
            <li> To provide full disclosure, I was blessed to be born with long lashes; however, I learned the hard way that if lashes are not conditioned they can become brittle and break off.  </li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way !</li>
            <li> Not sure why or how that happens as I&#x27;m very care when pulling out and inserting the wand applicator.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to test its efficacy</li>
            <li> only saving grace of this product is that it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The applicator is messy so one should shake the tube first to make the product go back down to the bottom</li>
            <li> I have to wipe down the outside of the tube with a tissue every time I use it only to find the oily conditioner on the outside of the tube the next night.  </li>
            <li> I read the review of the woman whose lashes grew so long that her husband said she would have to trim them.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful to check often, especially in the morning after applying to avoid looking like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> Noticed that my eyelashes have gotten long.  </li>
            <li> I already do ha e long eyelashes</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t seem to use this every day for a long period of time, because  it irritates my eyes</li>
            <li> It is priced well and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> When I was younger I had beautiful eyelashes while my brother&#x27;s looked terrible (as they should&#x27;ve) but</li>
            <li> So hopefully within a month they will be really long!</li>
            <li> So I tried a little experiment, and only applied it to my left eyebrow and lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complete strangers stop to complement me on my long lashes, thinking that that I am either using Lastisse (which I never would) or that they are false and have been applied professionally.  </li>
            <li> Wearing mascara all the time causes my eyelashes to dry out.  </li>
            <li> It really works, i&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and my lashes are a little darker and alot longer and thicker!</li>
            <li> After a little over a week of using this every night I can definitely see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Ok so I received this today, it&#x27;s not the same bottle, small tube, and not sealed, was leaking a bit, I&#x27;m afraid to use it, the words on the label are a bit smudged off due to leaking</li>
            <li> But I really wanted to give it a try because I really wanted the results and have been somewhat disappointed in other similar products.</li>
            <li> Also, it works if you use a little dab and rub gently on the base of your eye lid and then lightly smooth over your lashes with for finger and not the applicator.</li>
            <li> I had badly damashed lashes  from using the cheap individual ones.</li>
            <li> That makes it harder to spread.</li>
            <li> People have been complimenting me on my lashes on how dark, and long they look without me even saying anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day for about 5 weeks and have seen absolutely no growth or thickness in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with sparse eyelashes and had to use Latisse, which is extremely expensive, but at the time, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds to put on.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> it is start slowly see result it fuller, havent see the extensive long growth.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all like other products have.</li>
            <li> but I gave it a shot due to the reviews.</li>
            <li> With Diva, my lashes are definitely longer, and I think they are fuller, too, although I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I must confess though that I also used the L&#x27;Oreal product on the other eye to compare.  </li>
            <li> Then after a few weeks my eyelashes were long and luxurious.</li>
            <li> all the other products I have purchased from Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I have tried everything and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I feel that it really moisturizes my eyelashes, but it is annoying if I put on too much because it then gets in my eyes and annoys them because of the oil in the product.</li>
            <li> I really was skeptical but after a friend recommended it</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for a little bit and so far my lashes are thick and silky!</li>
            <li> Such a valuable small product!</li>
            <li> I use mascara every single day and because of this my eyelashes were brittle and starting to become thin.</li>
            <li> This is very oily and very irritating to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it stung like crazy the first time I used it because I got it in my eye (not the fault of the product....</li>
            <li> I typically use Lastique Conditioner and ran out while traveling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for less than a week</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and a half now, and I&#x27;ve noticed my eyelashes seem to be getting fuller</li>
            <li> It has a slightly oily consistency, but has not irritated my eyes or skin.</li>
            <li> However I did notice less fallout</li>
            <li> However I did not get irritation and my lashes did feel softer than they previously did.</li>
            <li> The long, thick claim never happened for me.</li>
            <li> Im not expecting my lashes to be long by now but at least a little fuller..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe anyone could be disappointed in these products and if you are, feel free to send them my way!</li>
            <li> I just used that little Indian Face scrub sample.  </li>
            <li> It sometimes irritates me a little because I use a pencil eye liner and the conditioner makes the color run.</li>
            <li> my eyes burn a little be too.</li>
            <li> I put a little on and dab excess off before I put mascara on</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a little over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I can finally have thick eyebrows!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t put it on very heavy, it leaches into your eyes, but no irritation which other lash products have caused.  </li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> i did a few times and woke up with irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> Messy and didn&#x27;t make lashes look longer.</li>
            <li> But you have to stay devoted to it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t go wrong with the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any changes in the length or thickness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> (I have Blepharitis), I do use it for 4 or 5 days then take a few days off.</li>
            <li> It does make your eye lid feels heavy one place on your lash.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are slowly growing long and thick.</li>
            <li> If you have the same problems (though I hate to use that word because it seems pretty shallow to call sparse lashes</li>
            <li> but it does not help either.the bad thing is i cant really find out if the product works</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not sure how this works</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping my lashes grow</li>
            <li> After using it for just a week or two, my eyelashes are noticeably thicker (not sure about longer, hard to say).</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would thicken and grow my lashes, but I found it 100% ineffective.  : (</li>
            <li> and now I hardly lose any lashes when removing makeup.</li>
            <li> I think a product that works for one should work for all, at least to some degree.  </li>
            <li> I bought this stuff on a whim because I&#x27;m a sucker for anything that promises me thicker, longer lashes.</li>
            <li> They are shocked when they learn that they are natural.  </li>
            <li> It didnt make them as thick as I would have hoped but they do seem healthier.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it has been little time and my eyes are getting irritated by it.eyes</li>
            <li> Mascara dries out your lashes and makes them brittle and weak.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am crazy but I felt like I need less mascara in the mornings now.</li>
            <li> my eye brows are a bit thin and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately a month.  </li>
            <li> I wear false eyelashes</li>
            <li> Extremely useless.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, she took mine</li>
            <li> I see no change in my lashes by using this product unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this product i&#x27;ve been using it for couple of days</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re VERY thin</li>
            <li> God I hope these lash growth products don&#x27;t have some crazy negative effects on our vision :(</li>
            <li> crazy huh?</li>
            <li> Horrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyelashes and have been loading on mascara that has been making my eyelashes fall out, so I gave this eyelash conditioner a try!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple months, don&#x27;t see any difference in my lashes... :(</li>
            <li> I hate wearing mascara, and I read somewhere that Jen Aniston does too, and tints her lashes and just wears an eyelash conditioner and uses a heated eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> I put it on every night before bed, give it a try, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> My lashes were awful!  </li>
            <li> Also have really nasty greasy feel in an eye when you put it on.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it on my pathetic eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Burned eyes terribly and made my vision blurry.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Gross! I was prepared this thing was gonna be greasy but didn&#x27;t expect it would irritate my eyes and bothers my sleep all night. I used it 3 times and finally tossed it away... HELL no way I will recommend this to any of my friends</li>
            <li> soo sticky,when you wake up in the morning,it feels like you have millions of gooey stuff  that kind of making you not be able to open your eyes!!</li>
            <li> good moisturiser for eyelashes</li>
            <li> This is very oily and very irritating to my eyes.  I can&#x27;t use it during the day because it clouds my vision and irritates my eyes so much.  Nighttime use is the only way I can use it.  Since switching from the previous eyelash growth product I was using to this, all the length I experienced with that previous product is gone.  I have not seen any growth with this product yet even though I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for a couple weeks.  If anything changes I&#x27;ll post an update, but I will go back to using the eyelash product I was using before this.</li>
            <li> Love it! Easy to use...put it on after I brush for bed...lashes look great!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work on me. Very disappointed! I used it nightly and never saw an improvement in my lash growth. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while. It is nice. I feel that it really moisturizes my eyelashes, but it is annoying if I put on too much because it then gets in my eyes and annoys them because of the oil in the product. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any growth or thickness in my eyelashes though, but  my eyelashes are really moisturized, strong, and they feel soft and healthy. I like the product.</li>
            <li> This was a good product. I was expecting a mascara brush, but it was just a sponge brush inside. That makes it harder to spread. But overall good product. Fast shipping! Thank you</li>
            <li> Been using since October. Extremely useless. Also the cap broke just after a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple days &amp; my eyelashes are growing &amp; my eyebrows are growing as well! I can finally have thick eyebrows!</li>
            <li> This is ok...I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff works to well yet I did not use it religiously. If I had maybe it would have worked better for me.</li>
            <li> I read the review of the woman whose lashes grew so long that her husband said she would have to trim them.  P-a-l-e-e-z-e.... sometimes I wonder if some of these 5 star reviews are purchased by the manufacturer (not accusing anyone of anything).  I think a product that works for one should work for all, at least to some degree.  I used the whole bottle and absolutely no results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> aghhh. i regret using this product for all the burning, and itching it has caused. all for nothing!!!!!!. it also leaked !!! can you believe that. waste of money.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using the product long, just waiting to see some amazing result. I will keep my fingers cross :)</li>
            <li> OMG...I just used that little Indian Face scrub sample.  IT IS AMAZING.  I&#x27;ve used facial scrubs before, but this one keeps your face a more hydrating feeling.  I LOVE IT.  I am about to blog on my site about it...BTW, after only 2 days on the Eyelash conditioner, my eyelashes are already starting to pop. GREAT PRODUCTS DIVA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2, and wonder if I will need both. It will be a good gift to help someone kick the fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this Diva Stuff product. The eyelash Conditioner helps promote long, thick, healthy lashes and I can see it working. I use it every night before bed, waking up in the morning cleaning my face and there they are longer and fuller than before. Yea! Thanks Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the eyelash conditioner.  Finally a product I trust putting on my lashes!  The ingredients are all natural and I noticed a difference after only a couple of times using it.  I apply it at night to my lashes and in the morning when I apply my mascarra I am amazed at how much longer and fuller my lashes are.  Oh did I mention totally affordable.  Im a Diva for life</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and that might be be because it stings them.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to test its efficacy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I don&#x27;t really see the difference but I have not been using it frequently. Other than that it does smell nice but kinda makes your eyes itch and water so do not put it on unless you go to bed.</li>
            <li> I really was skeptical but after a friend recommended it and I saw how full her lashes were, I had to try it.  I am a believer!!  Will be buying more and giving as gifts to my friends.</li>
            <li> Yep, it really does work.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. It is a nice buy for the price, and it really conditions your lashes. I don&#x27;t know if it thickens or lengthens lashes on its own since I use it in combination with another such product (Hydroxatone). However, my lashes are thicker and longer, so my combination works.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! I have been using it for a couple of weeks and have definitely noticed a difference. I love that it is all natural. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all like other products have. My daughter who is blessed with naturally gorgeous eyelashes commented on how great my eyelashes looked and wanted to know what mascara I used. I told her it wasn&#x27;t mascara and showed her what I was using. Needless to say, she took mine and I will be ordering another!</li>
            <li> very very effective, but be careful not to get this product in your eyes-- i did a few times and woke up with irritated eyes. otherwise, amazing natural way to improve eyelash length :)</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner 1-2 times per week. I think it really is a great conditioner but can be a little on the greasy side which is why I don&#x27;t use it everyday. My lashes are much healthier and have grown since using this product along with Speed Lash. Will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> This product worked ok for making my lashes longer. It didn&#x27;t increase the volume. I&#x27;ve used more expensive products that worked faster and produced better results. I do like that the product is all natural.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of products to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my lashes.  They&#x27;re pale and very, very sparse.  Also, in the past, I&#x27;ve tried extensions, which have been great a number of times but horrid once or twice.  I honestly was a little unsure if this would work for me, since I was thinking that it would only work to condition my lashes and that&#x27;s not the problem--I pretty much never wear mascara because it only emphasizes the fact that I have almost no lashes at all, so the problem&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re dry and breaking off short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have to say that this does work!  After a few weeks of using it every night (mostly), I definitely noticed that the bald spots had filled in, my lashes look thicker, and they&#x27;re longer and darker.  Brilliant!  I am using it more regularly as time goes by, because it&#x27;s easier to remember to do something once you see results, yet I still have a lot left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I wear contacts, have lots of allergies, and am generally pretty sensitive all around.  I&#x27;ve had no bad reactions to this at all.  Obviously, everyone&#x27;s different so if you try this you should take your time and make sure that if&#x27;s good for you too.  But at this price it&#x27;s not too big a risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this never gets discontinued!  I am too much of a scaredy cat to try some of those Rx lash growth products and not wealthy enough to keep up with extensions, and this is perfect for me.  If you have the same problems (though I hate to use that word because it seems pretty shallow to call sparse lashes a &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34;--you know, like if this is the biggest problem I have in life I&#x27;m a lucky girl) I have, please give this a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought it not knowing what to expect. It does not have any color and has not irritated my eyes. It sometimes irritates me a little because I use a pencil eye liner and the conditioner makes the color run. I have to be careful to check often, especially in the morning after applying to avoid looking like a raccoon. I don&#x27;t mind too much because it does keep my eyelashes conditioned and soft.</li>
            <li> It Didn&#x27;t Work At All</li>
            <li> Thank you, Diva Stuff, for sending your eyelash conditioner to me so quickly.  Within a week of using it every night, I noticed my lashes were thicker and longer.  And all the ingredients are natural, which is a must for me!  At last, I&#x27;ve found a product that works!</li>
            <li> I really like the product and the shipping was very satisfactory.  I have encourage several friends to try it!  My lashes look much healthier.</li>
            <li> Messy and didn&#x27;t make lashes look longer. It feels like putting grease on your lashes. I found that I could only wear this at night before bed because it will make any eye make-up run and look a mess even after wiping most of it off. It also gets in your eyes making them blurry and watery. I only gave it 3 stars because it is really just a conditioner and my lashes did feel softer, but that was not the goal I had in mind. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good, made a difference on my lash, happy with it. Will buy again from this seller!!! :)</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only been using this for 5 days or so, but I already love it.  To be upfront, my lashes weren&#x27;t in dire distress to begin with.  I have a good number of lashes, but they fell out too easily and were thin and dry.  Since I had a good base to workw ith, I wanted a natural solution instead of a chemical one, and this stuff is perfect!  They already seem to be holding up to my eyelash curler better - probably because they are getting stronger and since the look nicer I don&#x27;t have to use it as much, bonus!  :) They are already looking shinier and thicker, so they stand out more.  Exactly what I was looking for!  Nourishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problems with low lash count or really short lashes, I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not this will work for you because I didn&#x27;t have those problems.  But if you&#x27;re looking for something to nourish your lashes so they hold up to your abuse better, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My lashes were awful!  After a little over a week of using this every night I can definitely see a difference.  My lashes look great!  Healthy, longer, thicker.  So easy, so affordable.  LOVE.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable! I purchased this product based on reviews, price and natural ingredients. Quite frankly, I was willing to gamble basically ten dollars in hopes it would work. To give you an idea of how fantastic this product is, my husband, who didn&#x27;t realize I had gotten new glasses for over a month, asked me after two weeks, &amp;#34; Your lashes are so long! What are you doing?&amp;#34; I told him I was using Diva&#x27;s eyelash conditioner, and he asked, &amp;#34; Are you going to have to trim them?&amp;#34;  I can&#x27;t think of a better review than that!!! I will be buying this product forever!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has helped keep my aging eyelashes full and dark. I can say it did not promote length as I did not need that spider look which lastice produced. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is great if you want to condition your lashes but it isn&#x27;t going to make them &amp;#34;longer&amp;#34;. I did notice that my eyelashes began to curl and perk up within days of using this and now I hardly lose any lashes when removing makeup. Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. My eyelashes fell out after a week of use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for several weeks now. I have not noticed any difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> This does seem to work, somewhat..guess it depends on your expectations.  I wear false eyelashes so my own are thin and since I started using this, they are not as sparse, which is all I was looking for. You can&#x27;t put it on very heavy, it leaches into your eyes, but no irritation which other lash products have caused.  Overall, I like this product and it has met my expectations.</li>
            <li> it is start slowly see result it fuller, havent see the extensive long growth.  Again i skip some nights apply on.  I only have it&lt;br /&gt;not a month yet.  We&#x27;ll see......</li>
            <li> Not seeing any result yet...I hope at the end I will see..my eyes burn a little be too.I will keep using.&lt;br /&gt;June 20&lt;br /&gt;Almost finished and any result so far</li>
            <li> I received the package quickly, but the packaging is completely different from what is shown. The container is not glass, it&#x27;s a flexible plastic tube with a sticker on the outside. The formula looks the same on the inside, but I don&#x27;t think I received the same formula as advertised. I&#x27;ve noticed some growth, but nothing similar to what the other reviews have experienced. I don&#x27;t want to claim &amp;#34;bait and switch&amp;#34; because I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same company and product, but I think they gave me an older formula in a plastic squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> I purchased this through another website and I love this stuff. Since starting to use it my lashes are much longer and stronger.  My lashes have never looked so good and when I put mascara on my lashes look amazing!!! This will be a must have for me the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> Came in on time! Saw results within 5 days! Keep it everywhere i go ! Such a valuable small product! Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> This is a really good eyelash conditioner. It really didnt make my lashes super long, but they did grow a little and they also became much stronger!!! For that, I love this product because all women who use mascara know how weak your lashes can get and keep falling out. This will make your lashes so much stronger and healthier. It is very easy to apply and easy to carry around in your makeup bag :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant to add any color to your lashes, just to keep them conditioned.</li>
            <li> Noticed that my eyelashes have gotten long.  All natural ingredients.  If you have coconut allergies then don&#x27;t buy it as one of the ingredients is coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff on a whim because I&#x27;m a sucker for anything that promises me thicker, longer lashes. After using it for just a week or two, my eyelashes are noticeably thicker (not sure about longer, hard to say). My only complaint is that it stung like crazy the first time I used it because I got it in my eye (not the fault of the product....total user error). Just don&#x27;t stick the stuff directly INTO your eye and you&#x27;ll be fine ;)</li>
            <li> I typically use Lastique Conditioner and ran out while traveling. I purchased this product as a quick substitute. It left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> So....Its been a month that I have been using. I see no change in my lashes by using this product unfortunately. I REALLY wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for less than a week and I am already seeing results! I had almost no bottom lashes and suddenly for the first time in my life they are there! I&#x27;m really glad that I chose this one and not one of the $50+ similar products.</li>
            <li> It really works, i&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and my lashes are a little darker and alot longer and thicker!</li>
            <li> my eye brows are a bit thin and within just a few uses it made my eyebrows look beautiful n thick. DIVA STUFF your products are amazing thank you!</li>
            <li> Not sure how this works but it does! Use it every night and it really helps keep lashes from clumping and they do look longer. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about purchasing this product but I gave it a shot due to the reviews. Im honestly glad I ordered this ! LOVEE ITT !! It&#x27;s been almost a week I&#x27;ve been using this before I go to bed and I have to say I absolutely love the results. My eyelashes are slowly growing long and thick. I noticed my results only within a week of using this... crazy huh? but yes it&#x27;s true ! The best part about this product is that it contains only natural products so doesn&#x27;t cause any harm. Definitely plan to place an order on this soon , once my first one is finished and I would deff. recommend this to anyone because it actually works !</li>
            <li> I use it before bed with Speedlash eyelash growth and although I&#x27;ve only been using them for about a month if seems that my lashes are getting longer and thicker and not falling out as much.</li>
            <li> I didnt believe that something so inexpensive could actually make my eyelashes look better but based on the item&#x27;s reviews and the price I felt I had nothing to lose. I had badly damashed lashes  from using the cheap individual ones. Im glad I got this little tube. I noticed a difference within one week. My eyelashes appeared to grow back longer. Ok so its not fake eyelashes long but my eyelashes are alot longer than before. I will continue to use and Im hoping they continue to grow and get darker. So far so good.</li>
            <li> first thing first seller is very good,fast shipping and send some extra stuff too.now with the product i was very eagerly to try the product but unfortunately it has been little time and my eyes are getting irritated by it.eyes were red when i woke up,i try to use in morning but it does not help either.the bad thing is i cant really find out if the product works cause i cant use it because of the redness and irritation its causing.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it. It&#x27;s an okay product. Didn&#x27;t really see results. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and a half now, and I&#x27;ve noticed my eyelashes seem to be getting fuller and they are not falling off as easily. I don&#x27;t really notice much change in length, but I will continue to use this product for some more time. Also, it definitely feels like I am conditioning my lashes, and that is a plus.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple months, don&#x27;t see any difference in my lashes... :(</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing please save your money!</li>
            <li> This product actually works and works fast.  Complete strangers stop to complement me on my long lashes, thinking that that I am either using Lastisse (which I never would) or that they are false and have been applied professionally.  They are shocked when they learn that they are natural.  To provide full disclosure, I was blessed to be born with long lashes; however, I learned the hard way that if lashes are not conditioned they can become brittle and break off.  I will definitely order the Diva Stuff Conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it.  It actually works!  I have extremely short, fine, and sparse lashes.  With Diva, my lashes are definitely longer, and I think they are fuller, too, although I&#x27;m not sure.  It could be that because they are longer, I can actually see the ones at the corner of the eyelid.  With mascara, my sister thought I was wearing extensions.  I must confess though that I also used the L&#x27;Oreal product on the other eye to compare.  They both work.  I love them both.</li>
            <li> Have been use this product for a week now. The smell wasn&#x27;t that good but my eyeslash were getting darker. Very oily!! Will continue to use it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct difference in my lashes while using this product - they seem to be longer and more lush. I just love Diva Stuff products!</li>
            <li> I purchased this directly from the Diva website.  I have very fine, thin eyelashes, so I thought it might help.  I try to stick to products with natural ingredients.  I absolutely love this product.  My eyelashes appear thicker and longer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately a month.  I will purchase it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I put several coats on for the 3 days, and I have RED RASHES around my whole eye area.&lt;br /&gt;this product is not for me and I don&#x27;t like the fact it get your eyes red and now I have red bumps everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;not a happy person right now</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I saw that my lashes grew in two weeks! But you have to stay devoted to it and use it everyday. I would put it on right before going to bed its the easiest time to have the formula sit on your lashes.</li>
            <li> Diva stuff eyelash conditioner is just what I have been searching for. I have very thin eyelashes and have been loading on mascara that has been making my eyelashes fall out, so I gave this eyelash conditioner a try! After I&#x27;ve taken off my eye makeup for the night , I apply the eyelash conditioner before I go to sleep. I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in how amazing my mascara goes on after having used the conditioner! I also notice that my eyelashes arent falling out. This product was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 10 days and I already see results! My lashes (upper and lower) are getting longer and are curving more. Every Diva Stuff product I&#x27;ve tried so far has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and really works.  My eyelashes look longer, thicker and darker.  They feel softer and there is no irritation to my eyes.  I like the brush applicator and use it twice a day.  I also use it on my brows.  So much better than other products I have tried.  Fairly priced, all natural and great results!</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t what i expected didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> Excellent I really love it and I love the hydrating lip balm and the coconut hand cream gift thank you so much ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> I love this...I started seeing results in a week or two.</li>
            <li> for the first week, i used it morning and night...&lt;br /&gt;then i used it every night for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the reason why i stopped using it in the morning is because it got into my eyes and stings/blurs your eyes, momentarily.&lt;br /&gt;in the evening, you wipe it on and go to sleep, so you&#x27;re not blinking it into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;results: none.&lt;br /&gt;works more like an eye lash conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used Diva Stuff Eyelash Conditioner every night for 4 weeks now along with Speedlash Eyelash Growth and I don&#x27;t really see any difference - I could be using Vaseline and get the same results.  The wand application is convenient and seemed like a good idea but I have found that the conditioner somehow gets all over the outside of the tube.  Not sure why or how that happens as I&#x27;m very care when pulling out and inserting the wand applicator. I have to wipe down the outside of the tube with a tissue every time I use it only to find the oily conditioner on the outside of the tube the next night.  Not only is this messing but I feel like I&#x27;m losing a good deal of what I paid for.  As I know some of these formulas take a number of weeks of use to kick in, I will continue to use it til it&#x27;s gone as I don&#x27;t want stop just short of possibly seeing results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my lashes.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 weeks and I see NO difference in my lashes! Bumming</li>
            <li> I own a skincare spa.  I use this product myself and offer it to my clients. It is the best product out there for SAFELY conditioning your eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now.  I do see a difference especially when I put mascara on. My lashes are longer and thicker. I also notice that my lashes don&#x27;t break off as easily as they used to. Will purchase again. Love Diva Stuff products.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, and so is everything Diva Stuff! When I received this product it came with two free samples and a cute letter with a 15%off coupon for my next purchase! This is the first time I have ever gotten such good service from anything I have bought on amazon. The free samples were Fountain of Youth Face Cream and Charcoal and Bamboo face scrubbies. I have yet to use the free samples yet.&lt;br /&gt;  The product itself is wonderful, the results are so fast! In three days I noticed a large difference! My lashes ere much longer than they were before I used this product. I am very satisfied with this product and I canâ€™t wait to use it tomorrow! I put a little on and dab excess off before I put mascara on and it helps a lot! Mascara dries out your lashes and makes them brittle and weak. I thought this would make the mascara run, or not work, but Iâ€™m happy to say that this conditioner helped prevent mascara from drying out my lashes! I am very happy with this product and have plans to buy this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! When I was younger I had beautiful eyelashes while my brother&#x27;s looked terrible (as they should&#x27;ve) but then as we got older his grew and my shrank. They even started to fall out! (I was devastated and my brother couldn&#x27;t stop laughing.) So I started looking for a solution and I found this. I started using it and saw results after three nights of using it. I was in heaven! Then after a few weeks my eyelashes were long and luxurious. I was ecstatic! Be sure to use this if you want beautiful eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping my lashes grow but it seems like the natural ingredients are good for your lashes. Only downfall is that it&#x27;s oily and can run into your eyeball. God I hope these lash growth products don&#x27;t have some crazy negative effects on our vision :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product! Seen my lashes gets thinker and longer only within a week of use. Love it!</li>
            <li> The shopping was very fast on this and I was glad because I wanted to try it and see results!! Well I&#x27;ve been using for about a week and I feel that my lashes look a lot longer when I put mascara on, and I haven&#x27;t had nearly as many fall out when I use makeup remover! So hopefully within a month they will be really long! Overall great product and great price. Will purchase again when I run out :)</li>
            <li> I love the product,  I have been using it for about three weeks now and my eyelashes are definitely longer and thicker. I will continue to use this product.  I will be ordering more of the Diva Stuff Eyelash Conditioner in the near future.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love to conditioning benefit and have noticed less lash fallout, plus, my mascara goes on better. No growth benefits...more for pverall lash health. Still a good, inexpensive product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t anything to my lashes, but leaked all over the package and leaking laying in my drawer. Also have really nasty greasy feel in an eye when you put it on. The package is really cheap.</li>
            <li> As I get older my eye lashes are thinning. After using this eye lash conditioner product, my lashes feel thicker and look better when I apply my mascara. I am looking forward to continuing this item&lt;br /&gt;and all the other products I have purchased from Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li> I always wondered if these lash conditioners actually worked and always wanted to try one but I can vouch that this one really does work! Personally my eyelashes are short to normal length but they&#x27;re VERY thin and I always find them falling out. Even after the first night of using this I felt like they became stronger! After some use I&#x27;ve noticed they aren&#x27;t falling out at all like they used to. People have been complimenting me on my lashes on how dark, and long they look without me even saying anything. I absolutely love seeing people notice the difference ! I was really really happy to find that this product was made with all natural ingredients too, I did some research before I bought any lash conditioners because personally I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts so if I&#x27;m going to put something on my lashes all night I want to make sure it&#x27;s safe. I did some research and found this, I was so happy because all of their products are natural... So I decided to get it and figured id try it out. So happy I did too it&#x27;s much more natural than always gluing fake eyelashes on and so much cheaper than doing eyelash extensions...  This is very inexpensive too for a bottle that&#x27;ll definitely last.... A little really does go a long way !</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it on my pathetic eyebrows.  absolutely encouraged growth in places that have always been bald.  i&#x27;m almost to the point where i won&#x27;t need an eyebrow pencil to fill in the ends.</li>
            <li> Nope didn&#x27;t do a think for me and I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 months did help my lashes or brows grow any or get thicker just was very greasy on my eyes so if that is what it was supposed to do as a conditioner then I guess that worked</li>
            <li> Couple things it has done.... on one of my eyes, the outer lashes were thinning, it did help bring them come back a bit, darkened my lashes a tiny bit, thats about it. The long, thick claim never happened for me. Works for some and not for others.</li>
            <li> Really its so good and now I have a good results on fast time</li>
            <li> goes on easy  I just forget to use all the time</li>
            <li> Work really good I love it !&lt;br /&gt;After two week started to see results eye lashes got longer !</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes and eyebrows soft but I&#x27;ve not seen much of anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a bit of an improvement in my eyelash length over the period of about a month using it. I think it would definitely be effective in the long term.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would be effective on my sparse brows and lashes, but I have always loved Diva Stuff products and they always deliver what they promise, so I figured I might at least get an improvement. So I tried a little experiment, and only applied it to my left eyebrow and lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I wish I had taken a before picture. I can see new brow hairs coming through where there was a definite bald space in my eyebrow, and my left eyelashes are actually noticibly longer and slightly darker than the right, untreated side. I especially can tell the difference after applying mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using the Diva Stuff eyelash conditioner on both sides. It has a slightly oily consistency, but has not irritated my eyes or skin. I don&#x27;t notice any scent at all. A bonus of the oil is it seems to be softening the fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I might suggest to Diva Stuff makers would be put a spoolie brush in the tube as opposed to a sponge lip gloss applicator, it would make it easier to coat lashes evenly.</li>
            <li> My lashes are already healthy &amp; long, but this takes them to ridiculous lengths.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Diva Stuff.  It&#x27;s not only natural, but it really works.  I have had many people come up to me and tell me what beautiful full eye lashes I have.  I tell them to buy this product and the ones who have, love it as much as I do.  Thank you Diva Stuff, your amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it just arrived today. I hate wearing mascara, and I read somewhere that Jen Aniston does too, and tints her lashes and just wears an eyelash conditioner and uses a heated eyelash curler.  So naturally, I decided to do this too. I tinted my lashes and got the curler, all I needed was an eyelash conditioner. And this one is AMAZING!! It smells great, is all natural, and gives my lashes a lustrous sheen. I wear glasses so I&#x27;m not too worried about attracting dust on them as the description stated. Perhaps I&#x27;ll need to use something else on days I wear my contacts, but so far so good. I&#x27;m sure Jen Aniston uses a different brand, but she shouldn&#x27;t. For this price and quality you can&#x27;t beat it. Also came with some fab samples I can&#x27;t wait to try out.</li>
            <li> love this stuff conditions lashes so well !</li>
            <li> I ordered the product hoping to get some of the wonderful results that other users are getting. It did nothing for me. When I applied it it burnt and stung my eyes, they became red and watery. I tried applying before bed - same results, I couldn&#x27;t sleep because of the stinging sensation. No change in the eyelashes whatsoever. Eventually I threw what it had left in the tube. For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes have grown!</li>
            <li> I used this product two nights in a row and I swear I noticed a difference right away. Maybe I am crazy but I felt like I need less mascara in the mornings now. I love Diva Stuff products and all of the natural ingredients used. It&#x27;s hard to believe anyone could be disappointed in these products and if you are, feel free to send them my way!</li>
            <li> This product makes my eyelids burn - so I must be sensitive to something in the mixture.  I may try it again after a couple more weeks to see if I can give this product a chance.  I used it for about three weeks with no visible results.  If things improve, I&#x27;ll review it again.</li>
            <li> After months of use, never saw a difference.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes is longer than before very effective.</li>
            <li> Love it! I saw my eyelashes were starting to fall out since I use mascara every day, so I decided to give Diva Stuff a try. I noticed they were darker and longer in just one week. I love how all the ingredients are all natural, too! I put it on every night before bed, give it a try, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day for about 5 weeks and have seen absolutely no growth or thickness in my lashes.  I cannot tell if it helps my lashes to be more healthy.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and i can tell my lashes feel more conditioned ,this has not caused my eyes to sting or water i use right before bed every night .Not sure if my Lashes have grown but regardless they look great and i would buy again.</li>
            <li> After 3 months, nothing!</li>
            <li> Just threw this away yesterday when cleaning out my drawer. It is a pain to use. Makes my eyes all blurry.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> No change at all after 4 weeks of use.  It burned my eyes when it got it.  It had a large applicator brush so it made a big line of oil above my eyelid.  I was really hoping it would thicken and grow my lashes, but I found it 100% ineffective.  : (</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work.  Even if to use it consistently.</li>
            <li> Horrible waste of money. I honestly can&#x27;t believe anyone has anything to say about it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! All those good and natural ingredients mixed together. It goes on the eyelashes so nicely. I&#x27;ve always had problems with sparse eyelashes and had to use Latisse, which is extremely expensive, but at the time, it was worth it. I am in no way saying this is like Latisse, but it is a great product. I wear no mascara at all. I put this on my lashes and curl them. It gives this instant look of fullness and darker from the ingredients. And you can&#x27;t go wrong with the natural ingredients. I developed an allergy to the generic Latisse and my eyes would get swollen and the skin underneath would peel. Well, I had enough of that. I saw this and really love it! I would recommend it to anyone. It only takes a few seconds to put on. No different than putting on mascara if you use it. Love the samples they send in your order too! Gives you a chance to try out stuff before you decide to order. Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was expecting longer thicker eyelashes but I didnt notice much of a big difference. However I did notice less fallout and I did think my eyelashes were healthier. I already do ha e long eyelashes but I wanted them thicker. It didnt make them as thick as I would have hoped but they do seem healthier. I dont see much of a difference in length because my eyelashes are already long but I do like this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any changes in the length or thickness of my lashes. I have long, dark lashes to begin with so I am not complaining. I use this instead of mascara.</li>
            <li> Only reason this gets a star is for the conditioning effect, which pretty much any single good quality oil can give you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for 2.5 months and it has not had any effect on the length and thickness of my lashes. I thought it was too good to be true and it was. I was hoping to lengthen and make my lashes more voluminous (mine are already dark), but it didn&#x27;t work on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess for the price it might be worth a try for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only saving grace of this product is that it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This really works! I have used this product for about a month now and not only have I seen my eyelashes lengthen but they are also significantly fuller now as well. Friends and family have been noticing too saying things like ...&amp;#34;There is something different about you......You look great&amp;#34; Wow, who knew this could bring such fun to life!! I just love the feel of the texture of conditioner as well as the fact that it is made from natural ingredients.  I am just so happy that a friend encouraged me to try this conditioner not only because of how effective it has been on my eyelashes ......but also because I now have a wonderful new product to give family and friends for their birthdays that I know they will really love!! Thank you so much Diva Stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for a little bit and so far my lashes are thick and silky! I will say one thing though. The applicator is messy so one should shake the tube first to make the product go back down to the bottom so when you close the top it wont squish out. Also, it works if you use a little dab and rub gently on the base of your eye lid and then lightly smooth over your lashes with for finger and not the applicator. that way it wont get too much in your eyes. This stuff is amazing and will last a long time!</li>
            <li> It works but you have to be constant</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of Diva Stuff so when I read the reviews on this Eyelash Conditioner I had to have some.  It goes on so easy, I have been using it every night as recommended,</li>
            <li> This stuff by Diva Stuff, no pun intended, really does work. I was skeptical at first because I have tried everything and nothing worked. But this, if you apply it as you are supposed to, will make your eyelashes grow. It did for me. I think its because it conditions the eyelashes. I will continue to purchase it. Thanks Diva Stuff.</li>
            <li> Meh!  Used consistently with out much change.  The Seller, Diva Stuff are really top notch.  Sent a free sample and wrap everything carefully for ship.  I will buy their stuff again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! The application wand like that of a lip gloss. It had an unexpected side effect the very small fine creases in my eyelids (the ones that come with age) are GONE. I will buy this stuff again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now and have noticed that my lashes appear longer. I put it on pratically every night before bed and there is still alot of product left, I wasn&#x27;t sure about sending $12 on such a small product but i think it is worth it and will probably last another month or so, hopefully continuing to increase my eyelash growth.</li>
            <li> Ok so I received this today, it&#x27;s not the same bottle, small tube, and not sealed, was leaking a bit, I&#x27;m afraid to use it, the words on the label are a bit smudged off due to leaking I think.  Is it real??</li>
            <li> Honestly this did not make my eyelashes any longer or any darker. However I did not get irritation and my lashes did feel softer than they previously did. I suppose this product will work for others, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. It is easy to apply as long as you don&#x27;t use too much. The formula didn&#x27;t smell either.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over two weeks now religiously every night and I see a marked difference in the length of my lashes. At this rate am pretty sure I could go mascara free very soon ;) :D</li>
            <li> Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 2 weeks but had to stop. I have sensitive eyes and this is with any kind of eye product including contacts. It is a pain in the butt trust me! I loved this too! This did make my eye lashes nice and soft. It was also something i used instead of mascara incase I just needed to run out somewhere quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it but not daily and see how that works and keep it as my back up mascara for when I dont&#x27; want to put it on.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t seem to use this every day for a long period of time, because  it irritates my eyes (I have Blepharitis), I do use it for 4 or 5 days then take a few days off. My lashes are definitely longer, fuller, and stronger. No odor. I have recommended to many friends and family.  I am really starting to love Diva Stuff products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally give lengthy reviews. When I first bought this product, I really didn&#x27;t have a lot of confidence in it despite the solid ratings. But I really wanted to give it a try because I really wanted the results and have been somewhat disappointed in other similar products. I definitely had my doubts. But every night I put this on and after 1 month my lashes are definitely longer. I honestly can&#x27;t wait to see what next month will be like. I normally and naturally have short lashes and shoot straight down. This conditioner not only lengthens it curls my lashes up! so I just apply mascara and it curls up naturally! I have tried other lash lengthening product and this is by far the best one! It is a truly great find!</li>
            <li> It has helped mine grow, it does work!</li>
            <li> Best Conditioner around.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a little over 2 weeks. Im not expecting my lashes to be long by now but at least a little fuller.. well haven&#x27;t seen any results and it really does burn my eyes so I have to apply it and try not to open my eyes at night..</li>
            <li> Great product! Works when you use it.</li>
            <li> Very oily ladies. Unless you want your eyelids oily don&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> I have always had shorter top lashes than on the bottom and Diva Stuff&#x27;s Eyelash Conditioner has definitely helped to improve them! Great price and quick shipping. I bought another to share with my daughter!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all DIVA Stuff products.  This eyelash conditioner is so luxurious and nourishing.  It definitely helps out my thin lashes :)  I plan on buying a second tube as my daughter has already pilfered it, lol!</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes feel cleansed...kinda oily but thats why put put it on before bed...must wipe off in am</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My eyelashes have always been lacking - they&#x27;re not thick, they&#x27;re not dark, they&#x27;re not long. This lovely little jelly works wonders, and my lashes have never looked better. Love it!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this!  Lashes are growing thicker and are healthier!</li>
            <li> Just got this product recently and it is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My lashes are noticeably longer and thicker. Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  It has made my eyelashes softer than they have ever been.  Wearing mascara all the time causes my eyelashes to dry out.  This product definitely has helped with this problem.  I recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is just an easy way to apply a product you can find elsewhere.  It is priced well and lasts a long time.  I store it standing up and away from other things because it will ooze out of the top a little.  No bad odors.</li>
            <li> Burned eyes terribly and made my vision blurry. Also did not notice any positive results.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this product i&#x27;ve been using it for couple of days and it seems to already started working I&#x27;ve noticed that my lashes are darker longer and much softer. I use mascara every single day and because of this my eyelashes were brittle and starting to become thin. I cannot get enough of this product</li>
            <li> The verdict is still out on this product. It does make your eye lid feels heavy one place on your lash. It would be easier to apply if it came with a lash brush.</li>
