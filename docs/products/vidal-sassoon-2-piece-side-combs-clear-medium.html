    <ol>
            <li>Perfect size.</li>
            <li>Perfect price.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>The comb stayed in my hair beautifully all day (and we even rode to the reception in a convertable, my veil stayed on!).</li>
            <li>Combs are combs - good quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>do it shows nicely in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I used these to make my own wedding veil.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found these.</li>
            <li>I need to buy a couple more of these neutral sets.  </li>
            <li>is that they have a good clear ridge at the top of the comb</li>
            <li>I find these to be strong, flexible, and non-breakable.</li>
            <li>These combs fit snugly and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Nice combs; fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Compared to that brand they are very slightly milky in appearance rather than perfectly transparent but that works well for me since my hair is shades of gray.  </li>
            <li>This work perfectly, and I intend to get some more since real life means that one will go missing sometime.  </li>
            <li>Glad they weren&#x27;t too pricey since, even though they didn&#x27;t work for me/us, they do work nicely in granddaughter&#x27;s big doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Better to be ready with something we know works.</li>
            <li>but these are solid and a good buy.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and these are quality combs.  </li>
            <li>Was glad they were available in clear.</li>
            <li>They hold my fine hair very well and blend into my brown color.  </li>
            <li>Love these clear combs.</li>
            <li>They do a nice job of holding loose ends in place.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about paying almost as much in shipping as the product though.</li>
            <li>The combs that are flat along the top don&#x27;t seem to stay in my hair</li>
            <li>The tips don&#x27;t scratch my scalp but it would be nice if they weren&#x27;t quite so sharp.</li>
            <li>Have since found and ordered some that say they are made especially for fine hair</li>
            <li>These are smaller than the product description but worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I love combs and they are getting harder to find in pairs.</li>
            <li>These combs work very well in my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I can only find the cheap flimsy combs in the stores</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I took a chance on these inexpensive combs because they have yet to fall out of my thin and silky hair.  </li>
            <li>Was glad to find these online as I was not able to find them in any of the retail stores where I shop.</li>
            <li>hard to find - glad I got them.</li>
            <li>Wish they had clear ones and pearl ones.</li>
            <li>We were looking to replace some aging clear side combs for my mom.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t like the clear comb,</li>
            <li>far as quality, I would give it 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, they hold as well as the much more expensive brand despite being a half inch shorter from side to side.  </li>
            <li>My hair is white and the clear combs disappear in my hair.</li>
            <li>Basic size, but no round tips.</li>
            <li>These are just the right size for my medium length hair, which is not very thick or thin, just middle of the road.</li>
            <li>Only suitable for thin hair, won&#x27;t go through or hold my average hair.</li>

            <li> These are just the right size for my medium length hair, which is not very thick or thin, just middle of the road. I have slight body, so I am not sure how they would work in thin hair or hair without body.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Perfect price. These combs fit snugly and comfortably.  I would recommend them to anybody looking for side combs for medium length hair</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that these combs will not stay in my long, fine hair nor do they stay in my daughter&#x27;s shoulder length, relatively thick hair.  Glad they weren&#x27;t too pricey since, even though they didn&#x27;t work for me/us, they do work nicely in granddaughter&#x27;s big doll&#x27;s hair. Have since found and ordered some that say they are made especially for fine hair so hope those will work.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a present for my wife who was having a hard time finding them.  It took some looking for me too.  Arrived quickly and these are quality combs.  She loves them.</li>
            <li> A bit too narrow, would have like wider combs (1/2 - 1&amp;#34; wider).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like is that they have a good clear ridge at the top of the comb do it shows nicely in my hair.  The combs that are flat along the top don&#x27;t seem to stay in my hair so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality, I would give it 3 stars.  It is almost too thin and brittle.  The tips don&#x27;t scratch my scalp but it would be nice if they weren&#x27;t quite so sharp.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a bit larger than I anticipated and i don&#x27;t like the clear comb, should have got a brown for my dark hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some of the other brands of sidecombs cost twice as much as these do.  They&#x27;re all the same.  I find these to be strong, flexible, and non-breakable.</li>

Better yet, they hold as well as the much more expensive brand despite being a half inch shorter from side to side.  Compared to that brand they are very slightly milky in appearance rather than perfectly transparent but that works well for me since my hair is shades of gray.  And their lack of color makes them compatible with everything you might wear.</li>
            <li> Poor product for the name and money. Not worth returning or buying again</li>
            <li> What can I say? Combs are combs - good quality</li>
            <li> Basic size, but no round tips.</li>
            <li> These combs work very well in my wavy hair. My hair is white and the clear combs disappear in my hair. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Was glad to find these online as I was not able to find them in any of the retail stores where I shop. They do a nice job of holding loose ends in place. Was glad they were available in clear.</li>
            <li> hard to find - glad I got them.</li>
            <li> Regular hair combs, that did not stay in my hair. I did not even know when they fell from my hair. Would I buy again? NO! Neither would I recommend them to anyone. They can be bought at the 99c Store.</li>
            <li> Nice combs; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Only suitable for thin hair, won&#x27;t go through or hold my average hair.</li>
            <li> TO COMB OR NOT TO COMB?!&lt;br /&gt;Of course, comb!  Love these clear combs. The medium size is just as stated and should not be punished by a Buyer if  he/she thinks they&#x27;re too small.  They hold my fine hair very well and blend into my brown color.  I need to buy a couple more of these neutral sets.  Great product!  And, yes, to comb!&lt;br /&gt;DMCP</li>
            <li> These are smaller than the product description but worked fine.  I have curly hair and nothing but combs will stay in and hold it the way I want.  I can only find the cheap flimsy combs in the stores but these are solid and a good buy.  Not crazy about paying almost as much in shipping as the product though.</li>
            <li> I used these to make my own wedding veil.  I only used 1, but bought the 2 pack for a backup.  The comb stayed in my hair beautifully all day (and we even rode to the reception in a convertable, my veil stayed on!).</li>
