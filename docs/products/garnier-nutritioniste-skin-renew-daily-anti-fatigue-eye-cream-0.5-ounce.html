            <li> (I am only 52), I am not sure which.  </li>
            <li> I started trying out other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried about 10 different eye creams over the past 2 years including high end expensive creams.  </li>
            <li> I believe it does help with aging, sagging skin around the eye, but don&#x27;t know about helping with dark circles.</li>
            <li> People routinely think I&#x27;m at least 10 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> dark circles (think Uncle Fester)</li>
            <li> So what I do to buy it and any other expensive product, is put all sizes in my Buy Later cart on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad eye bags/eye wrinkles for someone who is 31 (lack of sleep, sun exposure, etc).  </li>
            <li> I use this product every day, but I have seen very little change.</li>
            <li> When I had used up my 1st tube, I had a hard time finding a place that sold it and was out for over a month</li>
            <li> I am also surprised by the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Recommend for that at least.  </li>
            <li> Makeup time is cut in half!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing bad is it stings if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 3 months, I must say that I am not very impressed with its performance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the comment that this is too thin?</li>
            <li> I have dark circles really bad and this product hasn&#x27;t changed anything.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smashbox Primer is expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that Garnier is selling product that are very clearly not suitable for sale.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I was shocked by how well this product reduced puffiness.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am also surprised by the bad reviews. I use this on all the areas of my face that have discoloration caused by sun damage or old age (I am only 52), I am not sure which.  I started seeing definite results after a week or so.  As with any other product, it must be used daily.  When I had used up my 1st tube, I had a hard time finding a place that sold it and was out for over a month and now I realize just how well it was working.  The bonus is the price.  I have used many expensive creams, some worked as well but nothing has worked better.</li>
            <li> My packing for this product was completely smashed, but my product was untouched and unopened. I use this product every day, but I have seen very little change. I have dark circles really bad and this product hasn&#x27;t changed anything.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what Garnier is thinking when they discontinue making a well liked, quality product. Hope they are working on a replacement. I believe it does help with aging, sagging skin around the eye, but don&#x27;t know about helping with dark circles. I like the richness and weight of the cream.    Unfortunately,a tube I ordered Dec.2011 from another Amazon seller was 39 mos. from manufacture when I received it. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, since I am using up an open tube.  To check date codes: [...]  It may be prudent to check with seller before ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I concur with the reader from VA. I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on skin creams since I was 25:  I&#x27;ve found several that work on my face, but NOTHING has worked on my eyes. I&#x27;ve been through a rough past several years, and as a side result, have suffered from sleep deprivation. At 30, it&#x27;s showing. I&#x27;ve been scrambling to find something, anything, that will reduce the deep dark under eye circles without creating puffiness in the morning. This stuff is the trick! There&#x27;s no puffiness &amp; the skin is bright and vibrant!    I don&#x27;t understand the comment that this is too thin? Maybe it was a bad batch? The tube I have is super thick &amp; creamy. It&#x27;s one of the thicker eye creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I must say I am very suprised at the negative reviews.  I have tried about 10 different eye creams over the past 2 years including high end expensive creams.  The only place I have wrinkles on my face is under my eyes.  I have pretty bad eye bags/eye wrinkles for someone who is 31 (lack of sleep, sun exposure, etc).  I have been using this product for 4 weeks and this has literally changed my face.  Yes, I still have some fine lines under my eyes, but the darkness, the puffiness and the deeper wrinkles are vanishing!      I have seen other sites where this product has gotten better reviews.  Just remember to rub lightly, to blend it in all the way, or else it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of months, but I&#x27;m very impressed with it. I&#x27;ve also used Garnier&#x27;s Eyelift cream for several years, but I&#x27;m very pleased with what this product does.....it does immediately relieve any signs of fatigue around my eyes, both for early morning skin &amp; after a long day.</li>
            <li> Very good to be so economical, not recommended for sensitive skin, but if for normal,  the price is very good for the quality offered</li>
            <li> I was shocked by how well this product reduced puffiness.  I am prone to some major puffiness in the mornings, so I just dabbed on a little the night before.  Works super well.  Recommend for that at least.  I wasn&#x27;t looking at lines so much, so I cannot speak to that.</li>
            <li> A nice light moisturizer that your under eye area seems to drink right up! Leaves a light shimmer so the tops of your cheekbones look pearly and polished.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 3 months, I must say that I am not very impressed with its performance. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> It worked great and took away the puffiness quickly, but then it triggered an allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it for a few days just to make sure. I went back to using it and the reaction returned. I was disappointed because I really liked it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ve used it for years and had to order it on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local drugstores any longer!  It&#x27;s got the tiniest little \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it as well, very nice.  I really like all Garnier products I&#x27;ve tried and I have rather sensitive skin, but the Garnier items don&#x27;t tend to cause any skin irritations for me.</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk. The item I received was manufactured in July 2008 and there is only a 36 month shelf life recommended for this product. Meaning, after 3 years the product may not be as effective, which defeats the whole point of buying something like this. I&#x27;m disappointed that Garnier is selling product that are very clearly not suitable for sale.  I was skeptical of the price and should have known better, especially since I went through the same thing with another Garnier product. I already returned that one and now have to go through the same pain in the neck to return this item.  If you are unsure how to check the manufacturing date there are sites online that allow you to enter in the batch code to get all that info.</li>
            <li> I have severe allergies to the point of not being able to wear just any eye makeup.  I tried Garnier Nutritioniste Skin Renew Daily Anti-Fatigue Eye Cream and loved it!  No itching, red, swollen eyes!  I still have all the allergies but now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my eye cream.  It makes my life a bit easier.  Thank you Garnier!!</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream! Never feels drying. The only thing I have noticed is if I put it along the top of my eyelids, I was getting a burning tired feeling by the afternoon. Best if used under eyes only.</li>
            <li> just started using this and hope it works...will have to wait a week or two at least i&#x27;m sure before i see results...</li>
            <li> You must have another Eye Cream. This did not work half as good as the one I tried, but not able to remember the name. Hopefully I&#x27;ll find it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a real change, only that there have been slight changes in the brightness of my under eye circles. Worth the money compared to overpriced eye creams though thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I do have raccoon eyes. Perhaps the long work days, filled with late nights doesn&#x27;t; help. Other products have worked better thought.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. I ran out and need to order more. The price beats your local drug store price. it is a must carry when on my motorcycle. Keeps me from getting sunburn under my eyes from the googles.</li>
            <li> Great product .Really rich and smooth .we really like it a lot .My eyes feel better and I also feel cool !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different eye creams for severe dark circles. This one seems to help minimize the appearance. It has a silky smooth texture, lightweight and is not greasy. The only thing bad is it stings if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> idk if it actually makes your eyes look less tired, but i do love the way this cream feels. its like pearly and pretty, i love rubbing it under my eyes</li>
            <li> The cream is so light doesn&#x27;t feel like I applied anything. I prefer richer creams. Plus I&#x27;m almost done using tube and have not seen results. Does nothing for me. I wasted my money :(</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and product was at described.  I sometimes find that eye creams are at times too light, but this seems to be the right consistency.  I use it before bed and it moisturizes well through the night.  The tube is a good size as well.</li>
            <li> Ordered this back in 2012.  I could not tell any diiference in using this product.  It had the same effects as if I just used regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and it really works. People routinely think I&#x27;m at least 10 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say a big Thank you to Garnier Nutritioniste for their&lt;br /&gt;Skin Renew Anti-Fatigue Eye Cream.  After over 50 years of trying every&lt;br /&gt;known product to man, low end to high end, and not having it get rid of my&lt;br /&gt;under eye grocery bags (heriditary) and dark circles (think Uncle Fester) I finally&lt;br /&gt;found a product that really works!  After a couple days of using SRAEC I could&lt;br /&gt;tell the differnce.  My eyes look brighter and there is a new tightness&lt;br /&gt;around my eyes.  Most eye creams work when you just put them on, when you wash your face the&lt;br /&gt;brightness is gone. This cream actually fixes the problem.  I no longer have to layer on&lt;br /&gt;the corrector and the concealer.  Makeup time is cut in half!!!</li>
            <li> I had been using the Dove Eye Cream as all others irritate by eyelids. Even eye ointments irritate my lids. I have dry eye, use 2 expensive RX drops, and my eye lids can still be irritated very quickly. The Dove Eye Cream has been discontinued. It is still being sold on Amazon and Ebay, but the \\&quot;use \\&quot; dates are expiring. I started trying out other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one by Garnier, has worked the best for 1. not irritating eyelids 2. softens skin around the eye.&lt;br /&gt;When I want to look my best, to go out, I use Smashbox clear photo finish primer over this product, let it set for a few minutes, and then apply foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smashbox Primer is expensive. So what I do to buy it and any other expensive product, is put all sizes in my Buy Later cart on Amazon. Then when Amazon notifies me that  the price dropped, I buy it.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It does a good job of eliminating some of my under eye fatigue but I can&#x27;t seem to find it in the stores anymore so I purchased it on line.</li>
