            <li>I purchased the Moscow palette along with the Cairo palette, and I am SO glad I did!</li>

            <li>Great deal, fantastic colors--would (will) buy again.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and beautiful colours!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have to use much to get a wonderful look.</li>
            <li>what I get, besides great price, worth...</li>
            <li>Nice eyeshadows, colors are great and they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Colors are beautiful and they stay for the whole day or night.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful colors and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I bought this mostly for the greens and copper shades.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and I use like three of four each time, blending well.</li>
            <li>The colors are stunning and are just as metallic as you are told here.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to pack.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to carry everywhere.</li>
            <li>The color goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t create a lot of fall out.</li>
            <li>The pigments are high-quality and stay vibrant all day (they do much better than my Sephora shadows on those half-asleep mornings when I forget to prime!).</li>
            <li>aside from that at 8.95 they are totally worth it!</li>
            <li>With my consistent use, I&#x27;m dreading running out of the lovely golds and rich purples and greens...but for $9 a palette, I think I can manage.</li>
            <li>The colors are great and they looked just as I expected.</li>
            <li>so I can see the full array in front of me.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good picmentation and during all day, but the product is lost when you using sponge or brush and there are there are two colors (blue)</li>
            <li>cool</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten new makeup in about ten years, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I found great reviews here and on youtube there is a video that shows the colours better than they show up here in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The pigment goes on smoothly and seems to last longer than most drug-store brands.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like most of the colors, but I won&#x27;t wear most of them very often.</li>
            <li>It would be fun for traveling and pretty compact</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend!</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>The latch is better than an Elf pallete to open.</li>
            <li>I might buy more colors in the future.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than some other, more sparkly (read: young) palettes I already have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be de-potting all my Go-Palettes into a large Z-palette</li>
            <li>the quality and drop dead sexy results you get with this palette makes up for it all!</li>
            <li>Colors on palette are dime-sized and I would be gentle carrying it around.</li>
            <li>Really powdery product, colors aren&#x27;t really what they look like in the pictures or</li>
            <li>these colors so much that the color much seems clear and distinct....</li>
            <li>I think the colors are nice, but it&#x27;s pretty small.</li>
            <li>It arrived in pretty good condition with nothing broken or popped out.</li>
            <li>Granted, I do tend to wear bolder colors than a lot of women I know, but these can be toned down pretty easily, too--</li>
            <li>None the less, I love this product.</li>
            <li>They are a bit sticky though, which means they didn&#x27;t move or remove easily, but blending was more difficult.</li>
            <li>The shadow isn&#x27;t as strongly pigmented as I thought it would be based on the photos, but it does lend itself well to putting on multiple layers, giving a more dramatic look without caking up or creasing too much.</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute, but the size of the colors was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>There are better palettes out there that are the same price or even less.</li>
            <li>Small and easy to carry and can take this everywhere.</li>
            <li>Yes, the individual portions of each color may seems small, but these colors are richly pigmented and high quality.  </li>
            <li>The palette came in great condition (nothing chipped or broken), but I do wish that it was a little larger, as each color is about the size of a dime.</li>
            <li>It is truly small and does not appear true to size.</li>
            <li>Very pretty small palette.</li>
            <li>The dark colors are highly pigmented, and offers such a wide range of options.  </li>

            <li> but, they fall out of the case, i mean the little metal circle with the shadow in it will actually fall out the plastic black case.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very pretty small palette. Pretty colors.</li>
            <li> I have 4 of these go palettes. colors are great. but, they fall out of the case, i mean the little metal circle with the shadow in it will actually fall out the plastic black case. so be prepared to glue back in. aside from that at 8.95 they are totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I think the colors are nice, but it&#x27;s pretty small. One color is just about the size of a dime. It would be fun for traveling and pretty compact so it&#x27;s easy to pack. The case is quite sturdy so you don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking the eyeshadow. I would try out their other quads.</li>
            <li> Yes, the individual portions of each color may seems small, but these colors are richly pigmented and high quality.  I certainly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly for the greens and copper shades. Pigmented shimmery color. I like it much better than some other, more sparkly (read: young) palettes I already have. The color goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t create a lot of fall out. The latch is better than an Elf pallete to open. Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> ...and I keep ordering them.  Colors are beautiful and they stay for the whole day or night.  I recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and I use like three of four each time, blending well. Colors on palette are dime-sized and I would be gentle carrying it around. I want to collect the rest of the palettes by this brand. I have Cairo as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Moscow palette along with the Cairo palette, and I am SO glad I did! The colors are stunning and are just as metallic as you are told here. The only complaint that I think anyone would have with this palette is that not all the colors collaborate with each other (i.e. no highlight in this palette at all)With the exception being greens going along with greens, or purple contrasting with greens, etc.&lt;br /&gt;But the quality and drop dead sexy results you get with this palette makes up for it all! I don&#x27;t have a thing to say bad about this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to read all that, this is what it was in a nutshell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metallic shades, just as told here.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful colors.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;Great pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Superb product that seems like \\&quot;$$$\\&quot; but is \\&quot;$\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I like this eyeshadow quite a bit. The pigment goes on smoothly and seems to last longer than most drug-store brands. The shadow isn&#x27;t as strongly pigmented as I thought it would be based on the photos, but it does lend itself well to putting on multiple layers, giving a more dramatic look without caking up or creasing too much.</li>
            <li> Should have been a gift with purchase. It is truly small and does not appear true to size.I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is great,the colors last all day and it  came on time .&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to carry everywhere.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this jewel-toned palette!  The dark colors are highly pigmented, and offers such a wide range of options.  They are as creamy as some of my high-end eyeshadows and offer similar pigmentation strength, yet I didn&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for it.  Definitely recommended!  I&#x27;m going to be de-potting all my Go-Palettes into a large Z-palette so I can see the full array in front of me.</li>
            <li> I use this palette just about every day. Granted, I do tend to wear bolder colors than a lot of women I know, but these can be toned down pretty easily, too--it&#x27;s all about the combinations. The pigments are high-quality and stay vibrant all day (they do much better than my Sephora shadows on those half-asleep mornings when I forget to prime!). The palette came in great condition (nothing chipped or broken), but I do wish that it was a little larger, as each color is about the size of a dime. With my consistent use, I&#x27;m dreading running out of the lovely golds and rich purples and greens...but for $9 a palette, I think I can manage. Great deal, fantastic colors--would (will) buy again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten new makeup in about ten years, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I found great reviews here and on youtube there is a video that shows the colours better than they show up here in the picture.  It is great indeed! Very pigmented and beautiful colours! Didn&#x27;t have to use much to get a wonderful look. They are a bit sticky though, which means they didn&#x27;t move or remove easily, but blending was more difficult. None the less, I love this product. I also got the Cairo and love it as well!</li>
            <li> Nice eyeshadows, colors are great and they are very pigmented. I was expecting good quality and that´s what I get, besides great price, worth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindas sombras, colores muy bonitos y son muy pigmentados. Esperara una buena calidad y eso es lo que se obtiene, ademas gran precio, vale la pena</li>
            <li> Love the colors!! Great deals for what I got.will be purchasing more color palettes soon.the colors stay well on my eyes.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are very high quality, no doubt, and the pigmentation is wonderful. However, these colors aren&#x27;t very wearable for everyday, and there isn&#x27;t a GO! palette that satisfies that. The packaging is cute, but the size of the colors was smaller than I expected. Overall, I like most of the colors, but I won&#x27;t wear most of them very often.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and they looked just as I expected. It arrived in pretty good condition with nothing broken or popped out. My only issue is that each individual shadow is very small. Overall a good product. I might buy more colors in the future.</li>
            <li> Really powdery product, colors aren&#x27;t really what they look like in the pictures or what they look like in the palette for that matter. There are better palettes out there that are the same price or even less.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and very pigmented. Great product. Small and easy to carry and can take this everywhere. Just like the name Go Palette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good picmentation and during all day, but the product is lost when you using sponge or brush and there are there are two colors (blue) that pigment totally different.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and attractive love these colors so much that the color much seems clear and distinct....&lt;br /&gt;Very cool&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
