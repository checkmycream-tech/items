    <ol>
            <li> Poor clogging but still trying...</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely AMAZING! Take Before and After pics and you WILL see the difference for sure!&lt;br /&gt;The results I have gotten from this product are unparalleled! With other products, I never noticed ANY significant change in lines, discoloration, or even brown spots- well except Hydroquinone...which is very bad for you and not meant to use long term. It is unsafe.  Nerium does not use Hydroquinone- its claim to fame is the Oleander extract which only this one company uses as they have a patent on it. THIS PRODUCT TOTALLY WORKS!  Even my guy friends love it! It tightens the skin under your chin and makes your face look 10-15 years younger and in one month which is most remarkable! Definitely buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****When you purchase from a Brand Partner of Nerium you get the opportunity to get your products for FREE through their 3 UR Free reward program! If you just buy here you don&#x27;t get any free products no matter how many people you tell about Nerium...and trust me ladies you will be telling your friends! This stuff REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> I like the night cream.  It is easy to use and my skin  looks better-- I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I do not like the moisturizer-- does not seem to hydrating  enough for me.</li>
            <li> No this product did not do a thing for me save your money</li>
            <li> The problem I have is the Nerium night creams didn&#x27;t last long. Don&#x27;t have enough in the battle.</li>
            <li> The Night cream seems much better than the day cream but I use them both!</li>
            <li> This works great, after one month usage I see great improvement in my skin. I&#x27;ve never seen such great results!</li>
            <li> The service and product were amazingly easy and FAST.  I will definitely order again and encourage everyone I know to use them as well.</li>
            <li> love the way it works</li>
            <li> Love the Nerium Night. I have been using this product for over a year and just recently had my make up professionally applied and she commented several times that my skin was really smooth and nice.  I haven&#x27;t tried the day lotion because first I keep forgetting and second it has no sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have been buying both products for a year now. My pores and skin have tightened as well as my neck. I bought the day and night products for my oldest daughter and she has seen a wonderful improvement in her complexion. Worth the price but I use a pea-size amount and apply with a little water to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Está crema es maravillosa</li>
            <li> Too spencive and didn&#x27;t work on my face or neck I took a picture before using it and after 3 weeks and nothing change</li>
            <li> So far I have been very happy with this product and the results I am seeing.</li>
            <li> Great just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I like how quickly it got to me.  I am already out of the night cream, seemed like it ran out too fast, next time I will only order the day cream.  I like the day much better the night is kind of thick, I was happy with this purchase, as far a how it works I am not sure I already have great skin and had no problems I just wanted to if I would see some miraculous difference lol</li>
            <li> Both the Nerium Night and Day Cream are good products and the price was reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> I saw the differents  with in 4 days. I have only used the night cream and its amazing.im never using anything elce but nerium..</li>
            <li> Love it. Thank you. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> i love the product, i&#x27;ve been using it for about a year.</li>
            <li> not sure that it lives up to the hype.  I bought it because I saw pics of someone I knew (family member) and the before and after were believable. I did not see the same difference.  It is a nice moisturizer but not sold on the expected outcomes.</li>
            <li> love the feel of both products.</li>
            <li> Only received the day cream. Have not received the night cream.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 6 months now. I see results as people are telling me also . I love it</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love Nerium. I have used the night cream which is Fabuloso. Even though it&#x27;s pricey. Thought I would try the day cream. Day cream is not that special.</li>
            <li> Saw no difference - smells funny, too.</li>
            <li> I feel like the night cream or I should say Night Paste has to be working but the smell is awful, and it is thick and sticky like paste.  It feels wierd on then it goes away after about 15 minutes but I have to scrub my hands and my husband says my face stinks and hates to kiss me goodnight so I think I may go back the Chanel Night Cream it smells pretty and makes my face so soft.  I really doubt it is doing enough to make me keep this for long but it was an excellent price compared to almost 2xs as much by my Nerium sellers at work.</li>
            <li> They were deliver on time, after a month of using it I can see the results</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to be as good as when I purchased it from consultation</li>
