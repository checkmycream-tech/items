            <li>This is my favorite hair spray.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair more body...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>find great product instead which holds hair very well</li>
            <li>Love this styling spray i can not do without it</li>
            <li>Provides pretty good hold</li>
            <li>Great product for styling natural curl!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t even imagine how many sprays I&#x27;ve tried on my curly fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase for those with fine hair that needs a way to insure</li>
            <li>realize that you don&#x27;t need a large amount with Aerogel for a good hold, so you can say this is quality over quantity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good overall.</li>
            <li>Great for holding your hair with no mess afterward.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and this is a nice somewhat large travel-sized one.</li>
            <li>Brushes out easily.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t expect it to hold quite that strongly.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a super hold in a very fine spray (so that my fine hair doesn&#x27;t get saturated)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sampled everything and aerogel is just hands down the best.</li>
            <li>That fine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and need the styling/holding power without added weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for probably 15 years, and though I do supplement with Elnett (to try not to go through this stuff too quickly!)</li>
            <li>She said it gives her the very best support with so little in her hair.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Best hairspray ever if you want hold but not anything to stiff.  </li>
            <li>Like most hairsprays you have to remove the clogged spray on the nozzle periodically other than that it&#x27;s really a great spray.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hair, but a lot of it!  </li>
            <li>Even after cleaning the nozzle really good it barely comes out.</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair...</li>
            <li>Now I live in Arizona, and it is still amazing, keeps my hair style all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and able to hold which I really like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pretty strong smell (just my opinion) but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>If you have fine thin hair, this is the greatest!</li>
            <li>Best hair spray for my thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>and I get it so quick.</li>
            <li>I would say this is better product compared to what I would normally use (</li>
            <li>It comes in a large can that is easy to use and has no odor.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much success using it as a spray gel as some suggest.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, I think it&#x27;s worth giving this product a try.</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>, also I have a cowlick right in the front, in my bangs.</li>
            <li>This hairspray is great for giving me the hold I really need without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>It is important to note that not only do you need a good hair spray, you need solid styling tools.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine short hair</li>
            <li>I am not sure how amazing this spray would work if I were using a super cheap curling iron.</li>
            <li>I still love it as a hairspray and will continue to use it and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>and when I moved to Arizona, was only able to get it online.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is reasonable!</li>
            <li>You pretty much can&#x27;t have a non-sticky hairspray and this is as close as you&#x27;ll get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, with large amount of hairspray makes your hair a bit shiny, and makes your hair look like a Frisbee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Not fine as &amp;#34;boy that is a fine looking girl&amp;#34; but fine as in my hair strands can probably be used as invisible thread.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for my hair to hold a good curl and keep all day.  </li>
            <li>Product great but cap was off in the packaging and it was broken</li>
            <li>this spray really keeps it up there.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying it in the salon.</li>
            <li>But if you apply too much, the hairspray will harden into dandruff-looking powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for the person who wants to hold their style (even in humidity).</li>
            <li>really well  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely swears by it and loves it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>dries out your hair and makes kit very brittle.</li>
            <li>I Really like this product .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of this to keep hair in place.</li>
            <li>Too much can make it sticky.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray - it&#x27;s the only one that gives my fine hair any volume without weighing it down, but also holds</li>
            <li>It works great but know that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have tested many hair sprays over 20 years, and this one by far is the best bad only one I will ever use.</li>
            <li>Will use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>Use lightly and it will hold all day long.</li>
            <li>Will be re-ordering my new favorites!</li>
            <li>I used it mainly with my bangs.</li>
            <li>It was exactly the same when I first opened it and sprayed it.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and straight and won&#x27;t hold any style without help.  </li>
            <li>When the wind blows your hair up, it goes right back in place</li>
            <li>This hairspray keeps a pretty solid curl or style for hours on end.  </li>
            <li>It is not overly sticky or tacky, and you can easily brush through and keep the majority of the curl (granted a little let out.)  </li>
            <li>Suave comes out very moist and drys slowly, while Tresemme drys very quick.</li>
            <li>Professional quality item.</li>
            <li>but I was completely out and needed the spray.</li>
            <li>I think the bottles that were sent to me were old inventory.</li>
            <li>The sprayer constantly gets clogged and will spray every which direction, I think I&#x27;ve wasted more than I&#x27;ve used on my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have some stiffness but not as much as some other hair-sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>You can hold your hair in place and spray, at it will stay where you&#x27;ve put it all day long, but with the smallest strokes of a comb, all harshness is gone and my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li>exactly how I want it without looking stiff or unnatural.</li>
            <li>Even with little amounts, it holds almost for the whole day depending how windy it is outside.</li>
            <li>I find that spraying a little on your hair and combing through just prior to curling really helps in addition to spraying your final style.  </li>

            <li> I have very fine short hair</li>
            <li> I am not sure how amazing this spray would work if I were using a super cheap curling iron.</li>
            <li> I still love it as a hairspray and will continue to use it and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> and when I moved to Arizona, was only able to get it online.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is reasonable!</li>
            <li> You pretty much can&#x27;t have a non-sticky hairspray and this is as close as you&#x27;ll get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, with large amount of hairspray makes your hair a bit shiny, and makes your hair look like a Frisbee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Not fine as &amp;#34;boy that is a fine looking girl&amp;#34; but fine as in my hair strands can probably be used as invisible thread.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for my hair to hold a good curl and keep all day.  </li>
            <li> Product great but cap was off in the packaging and it was broken</li>
            <li> this spray really keeps it up there.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying it in the salon.</li>
            <li> But if you apply too much, the hairspray will harden into dandruff-looking powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for the person who wants to hold their style (even in humidity).</li>
            <li> really well  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely swears by it and loves it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> dries out your hair and makes kit very brittle.</li>
            <li> I Really like this product .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of this to keep hair in place.</li>
            <li> Too much can make it sticky.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray - it&#x27;s the only one that gives my fine hair any volume without weighing it down, but also holds</li>
            <li> It works great but know that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have tested many hair sprays over 20 years, and this one by far is the best bad only one I will ever use.</li>
            <li> Will use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Use lightly and it will hold all day long.</li>
            <li> Will be re-ordering my new favorites!</li>
            <li> I used it mainly with my bangs.</li>
            <li> It was exactly the same when I first opened it and sprayed it.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and straight and won&#x27;t hold any style without help.  </li>
            <li> When the wind blows your hair up, it goes right back in place</li>
            <li> This hairspray keeps a pretty solid curl or style for hours on end.  </li>
            <li> It is not overly sticky or tacky, and you can easily brush through and keep the majority of the curl (granted a little let out.)  </li>
            <li> Suave comes out very moist and drys slowly, while Tresemme drys very quick.</li>
            <li> Professional quality item.</li>
            <li> but I was completely out and needed the spray.</li>
            <li> I think the bottles that were sent to me were old inventory.</li>
            <li> The sprayer constantly gets clogged and will spray every which direction, I think I&#x27;ve wasted more than I&#x27;ve used on my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have some stiffness but not as much as some other hair-sprays I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> You can hold your hair in place and spray, at it will stay where you&#x27;ve put it all day long, but with the smallest strokes of a comb, all harshness is gone and my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li> exactly how I want it without looking stiff or unnatural.</li>
            <li> Even with little amounts, it holds almost for the whole day depending how windy it is outside.</li>
            <li> I find that spraying a little on your hair and combing through just prior to curling really helps in addition to spraying your final style.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use hairspray it falls flat within minutes of styling.  </li>
            <li> (e.g., keeps my long bangs off my face.)  </li>
            <li> My hair would be almost dry before I could get it styled.</li>
            <li> Everything weighted it down the curls would flatten by mid morning.</li>
            <li> I used this daily when I lived in Alaska, and I have been looking for it ever since I moved down to the Lower 48.  </li>
            <li> And because i only have to use very little, a can last me for months !</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair, so I usually get self-conscious when a hair spray gives me too wet of a look.</li>
            <li> She says it lasts a very long time since she only uses a small amount each day and it keeps her hair in order all day long until its bed time.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little to keep my  hair in place.  </li>
            <li> I use this spray &amp;#34;under my hair&amp;#34; after it is dried, curled, and brushed to keep in the volume.  </li>
            <li> My hair is cut in a long pixie and I like it to stick up a little in places and</li>
            <li> a  little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> However,it makes the hair looks grey and stiff.</li>
            <li> I tried to use the least amount as possible to conserve money because this thing will burn a hole in your pocket.</li>
            <li> I hate the way many hair sprays smell, but this has almost no odor at all.  </li>
            <li> also makes hair look dull and dry</li>
            <li> So my hair is a big fricken unexplainable mess that takes serious witchcraft to tame. ..</li>
            <li> , too - I spray a little on my fingers, then rub into my roots</li>
            <li> After drying, I spray &#x27;a little&#x27; all over hair, then comb into my style.  </li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant to try this, but it was just as reviews stated...</li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky or make me look like a helmet head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a repeat buyer for a few years.</li>
            <li> I waited till I had used this product a few times to review</li>
            <li> but it is not a fine spray.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to its claims, It made my hair sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li> It is a little stiff and leaves scum on all the surfaces in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love or hate it!</li>
            <li> No more fuzzies when I wear a ponytail, no more cowlick.</li>
            <li> But if neither one works it was pointless.</li>
            <li> My origina order was late</li>
            <li> Cap was broken and did not fit the spray can.</li>
            <li> I like it and have bought additional cans as I slowly use it up.  </li>
            <li> This spray leave a thick residual and hair need to be washed to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I still have both bottles and can only use it as a scrunching product in my fingers :(</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> When I received the package the lid was off of the can and broken in the shipping box.  </li>
            <li> It works so well and has ended bad hair days!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received the product very quickly and got a great price on this hairspray.. Best hairspray on the market!</li>
            <li> Product great but cap was off in the packaging and it was broken so will never stay on the can.</li>
            <li> Really great hair spray. I have very fine short hair and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for that perfect product.  Well I think I found the perfect hairspray.  My hair is soft and straight and won&#x27;t hold any style without help.  If I don&#x27;t use hairspray it falls flat within minutes of styling.  This is one of the best hairsprays I have ever used.  It only takes a little to keep my  hair in place.  My hair is cut in a long pixie and I like it to stick up a little in places and this spray really keeps it up there. I didn&#x27;t have much success using it as a spray gel as some suggest.  My hair would be almost dry before I could get it styled. I still love it as a hairspray and will continue to use it and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great Styling Spray!  Much cheaper than buying it in the salon.</li>
            <li> works great on fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good overall. But if you apply too much, the hairspray will harden into dandruff-looking powder.</li>
            <li> I have tested many hair sprays over 20 years, and this one by far is the best bad only one I will ever use. I gave used it for years. It&#x27;s for the person who wants to hold their style (even in humidity).</li>
            <li> I used it mainly with my bangs. It&#x27;s light and able to hold which I really like. However,it makes the hair looks grey and stiff.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair looking good without it getting fuzzy from humidity, but easily brushes out</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray - it&#x27;s the only one that gives my fine hair any volume without weighing it down, but also holds really well  (e.g., keeps my long bangs off my face.)  Great as a root lifter, too - I spray a little on my fingers, then rub into my roots and it amps up my style.  I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky and I can brush through it. I&#x27;ve been using it for probably 15 years, and though I do supplement with Elnett (to try not to go through this stuff too quickly!), this is always my final spray before I head out the door.</li>
            <li> The perfect hairspray for fine hair! Used it for years!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this to be any better than hairspray I can buy for 1/4 the price at the local drug store.  The sprayer constantly gets clogged and will spray every which direction, I think I&#x27;ve wasted more than I&#x27;ve used on my hair.  That being said, I&#x27;m a low maintenance lady and just don&#x27;t see the value in most expensive hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and when I moved to Arizona, was only able to get it online. It&#x27;s better than hairspray and holds up under 30 mph winds!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my sister in-law and she absolutely swears by it and loves it. She said it gives her the very best support with so little in her hair. She wears her hair in a modified spike like short hair and she uses this to keep it styled neatly. She says it lasts a very long time since she only uses a small amount each day and it keeps her hair in order all day long until its bed time.</li>
            <li> It is a little stiff and leaves scum on all the surfaces in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray.  Not sticky or heavy.  Great supplier.  Will by from again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years  and love it ,  it&#x27;s so nice for hair and not sticky but holds hair in place .</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever if you want hold but not anything to stiff.  And because i only have to use very little, a can last me for months !</li>
            <li> Best styling spray ever.  I have been using this for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Works great on wet or dry hair.  Great product.  Will use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Great for holding your hair with no mess afterward.</li>
            <li> Great product !!!  My hair doesn&#x27;t curl and frizz in humid weather !!!  My bangs stay in place and aren&#x27;t up to my hairline 5 minutes after going outside.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and can&#x27;t find anything that compares to the styling and holding capabilities. Easier to purchase on line as a lot of salons do not carry this exclusive product.</li>
            <li> Contrary to its claims, It made my hair sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li> The best holding hair spray in the world!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years.  It is the BEST hair spray that I have every used.  I hate the way many hair sprays smell, but this has almost no odor at all.  It works so well and has ended bad hair days!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - holds your hair the best I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Cap was broken and did not fit the spray can.</li>
            <li> I am on the fence.  Don&#x27;t love or hate it! Was looking for a super hold in a very fine spray (so that my fine hair doesn&#x27;t get saturated)....this is not it!  Provides pretty good hold but it is not a fine spray.  Rec&#x27;d dented on the bottom can so it is driving me nuts that it won&#x27;t stand up in the bathroom closet.  Will use the rest of the can but won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray! Isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky or make me look like a helmet head.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray...I&#x27;ll never buy anything else!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice styling spray. It holds well and does not leave hair &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.  Also, the price is reasonable!</li>
            <li> Professional quality item. Only spray my wife will use</li>
            <li> keeps hair in place without sticky goo</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even imagine how many sprays I&#x27;ve tried on my curly fine hair. Everything weighted it down the curls would flatten by mid morning. Aerogel holds without being crunchy, and holds all day.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with product as it allows me to style hair exactly how I want it without looking stiff or unnatural.</li>
            <li> dries out your hair and makes kit very brittle.</li>
            <li> I used this daily when I lived in Alaska, and I have been looking for it ever since I moved down to the Lower 48.  I went to Omaha to visit my family and went to a beauty shop that recommended Aerogel.  I was amazed! It used to be made by LaLotion, and is now made by Tri.  This is perfect for my baby fine slippery fly away hair.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t give you helmet head! Now I live in Arizona, and it is still amazing, keeps my hair style all day.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and I wear tease in it a lot, also I have a cowlick right in the front, in my bangs. So I need a lot of control when it comes to my hair spray. I&#x27;ve sampled everything and aerogel is just hands down the best. You can hold your hair in place and spray, at it will stay where you&#x27;ve put it all day long, but with the smallest strokes of a comb, all harshness is gone and my hair is still soft. No more fuzzies when I wear a ponytail, no more cowlick. Do yourself a favor and try aerogel. I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever. Been using this forever. Great hold, no buildup.</li>
            <li> Great hair product, used it for years.</li>
            <li> If you have fine thin hair, this is the greatest!</li>
            <li> When I received the package the lid was off of the can and broken in the shipping box.  I would have sent it back but I was completely out and needed the spray.</li>
            <li> Do u guys recomend this hair spray for my type of hair</li>
            <li> I Really like this product . Was introduced by hairdresser . Good hold, no sticky residue in hair. Brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> I have the most baby fine hair of anyone I&#x27;ve ever met! This hairspray is great for giving me the hold I really need without weighing my hair down. Like most hairsprays you have to remove the clogged spray on the nozzle periodically other than that it&#x27;s really a great spray. I like that it is an aerosol  and a  little goes a long way! My hair doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy after applying and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This hairspray works wonders if you want your hair to not move!!! It&#x27;s got a pretty strong smell (just my opinion) but not too overpowering. I just didn&#x27;t expect it to hold quite that strongly.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I would say this is better product compared to what I would normally use (Tresemme or suave maximum hold). Suave and Tresemme are both good in their rights but has some flaws.  Suave comes out very moist and drys slowly, while Tresemme drys very quick. Both needs extra amounts to have it hold all day. However, with large amount of hairspray makes your hair a bit shiny, and makes your hair look like a Frisbee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that you don&#x27;t need a large amount with Aerogel for a good hold, so you can say this is quality over quantity. I tried to use the least amount as possible to conserve money because this thing will burn a hole in your pocket. Even with little amounts, it holds almost for the whole day depending how windy it is outside. I have fine thin hair, so I usually get self-conscious when a hair spray gives me too wet of a look. Aerogel seems to do the trick. Anyways, I think it&#x27;s worth giving this product a try. To me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Great spray! Perfect hold! I&#x27;ve used it for years and I love it!</li>
            <li> A++++++++++ item.so good.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Holds hair all day</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. Great to hold your hair without stickiness.</li>
            <li> Both cans I received from this vendor don&#x27;t spray. My origina order was late so they sent me a complimentary bottle which was very nice. But if neither one works it was pointless. I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years and I know it sprays way better than this. And I&#x27;m not talking about build up that causes it not to spray. Even after cleaning the nozzle really good it barely comes out. It was exactly the same when I first opened it and sprayed it. I think the bottles that were sent to me were old inventory. I&#x27;ll never buy this from this vendor again. I still have both bottles and can only use it as a scrunching product in my fingers :(</li>
            <li> Great product for styling natural curl!</li>
            <li> Best hair spray for my thin, fine hair.  Helps with frizzing.  I&#x27;ve en using it for years.  I&#x27;ve tried others, but I keep going back to Tri Aerogel Apray.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray. EVER.</li>
            <li> You pretty much can&#x27;t have a non-sticky hairspray and this is as close as you&#x27;ll get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have some stiffness but not as much as some other hair-sprays I&#x27;ve tried. It comes in a large can that is easy to use and has no odor.</li>
            <li> Works great for my fine hair. I&#x27;ve been a repeat buyer for a few years. Holds my hair and doesn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and this is a nice somewhat large travel-sized one.</li>
            <li> Finally!  A hairspray that works!  I have pretty fine hair, but a lot of it!  It&#x27;s hard for my hair to hold a good curl and keep all day.  This hairspray keeps a pretty solid curl or style for hours on end.  It is not overly sticky or tacky, and you can easily brush through and keep the majority of the curl (granted a little let out.)  I waited till I had used this product a few times to review so that I could get used to how the product would work best for me.  I find that spraying a little on your hair and combing through just prior to curling really helps in addition to spraying your final style.  It is important to note that not only do you need a good hair spray, you need solid styling tools.  I am not sure how amazing this spray would work if I were using a super cheap curling iron.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this product for me, I love it!! Holds well with no stiffness or stickiness.</li>
            <li> Ok.  Here is the deal.  I have super fine hair... Not fine as &amp;#34;boy that is a fine looking girl&amp;#34; but fine as in my hair strands can probably be used as invisible thread.  That fine.  But that is not the best part of my lovely hair. . I have a ton of it.  So my hair is a big fricken unexplainable mess that takes serious witchcraft to tame. .. Or as an alternative.. Tri Aerogel.  Since I am not doing so well witchcraft wise,  I&#x27;m sticking with this stuff.</li>
            <li> my favorite hairspray around!</li>
            <li> The best hairspray for fine hair.  Use lightly and it will hold all day long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of this to keep hair in place.</li>
            <li> I use this spray &amp;#34;under my hair&amp;#34; after it is dried, curled, and brushed to keep in the volume.  It works great but know that a little goes a long way.  Too much can make it sticky.  I do not use it &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; my hair, only underneath. I like it and have bought additional cans as I slowly use it up.  It&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase for those with fine hair that needs a way to insure the added volume in your hair is maintained after you walk out the door.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray.  The product is good, the price is good and the service was as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest stuff...After drying, I spray &#x27;a little&#x27; all over hair, then comb into my style.  It gives my hair more body...I love it.</li>
            <li> Even when it is windy aerogel holds your hair set.  When the wind blows your hair up, it goes right back in place</li>
            <li> Only hairspray I use. Has a great hold. Been using this for a couple years now and Amazon always has a great price and I get it so quick.</li>
            <li> This spray leave a thick residual and hair need to be washed to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;It also makes hair look dull and dry and it smells toxic.Would never buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I find great product instead which holds hair very well and you can brush through&lt;br /&gt;without &amp;#34;helmet&amp;#34; effect.  It is Aveda Air Control hair spray.</li>
            <li> The Tri Aerogel spray arrived on time,and was thrilled with this product! Also ordered the Tri Covert spray and both items exceeded my expectations!  I have fine hair and need the styling/holding power without added weight.These products deliver! Will be re-ordering my new favorites!</li>
            <li> I absolutely. Love this styling spray i can not do without it</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant to try this, but it was just as reviews stated...great for fine hair. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and tell everyone I can to stop what they&#x27;re using and BUY THIS HAIR PRODUCT!</li>
