            <li>/&gt;This is a really great mascara and is a permanent addition to my make up tote.</li>
            <li>if you do it correctly, I think it has great results.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Thought it was a good find, tryed it out and all the fibers fell off on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought two!</li>
            <li>Love this product works good for the price</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it...</li>
            <li>This product is okay</li>
            <li>Us ladies need to stick together. :)</li>
            <li>the more it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The length that it creates is absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li>Each time you will get better...</li>
            <li>I work out most evenings and sweat well</li>
            <li>Love it will bit leave the house without...</li>
            <li>I love this product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily at the end of the day, with just a moist makeup remover towelette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is pretty amazing .  </li>
            <li>and my eyes are still fine.</li>
            <li>FABULOUS</li>
            <li>I would really suggest if you are looking for a good reputable company and a product that really works you check it out.</li>
            <li>Washed off cleanly like it said it would.</li>
            <li>This 3D lash extender formula is wonderful for creating quick, full, thick lashes...</li>
            <li>I have had fibers get into my eyes during application, but they quickly float away or wipe them away</li>
            <li>Be sure to separate your lashes as you normally do.</li>
            <li>thus has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It was very gentle on the eyes too</li>
            <li>This actually does make my lashes look FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>Although this mascara does exactly as it is supposed to do, it tends to flake off into your eye leaving your eyes very irritated.</li>
            <li>I have hardly ANY flaking and it stays on really good.</li>
            <li>It would be good for a very short time but definitely not for more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I do use a makeup pad remover like Almay to remove gently at night.</li>
            <li>For best results, apply as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Apply a thin coat of your regular mascara (powder too if you tend to have runny mascara during the day).</li>
            <li>Love the product, except the lil flects get in your eye if you put too much so do a little at a time.</li>
            <li>oh, and keep a brush from an old mascara, clean well, and use to help separate/clean up when you accidentally get a big clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am not the type of person that wears full make up every single day, but this mascara is one of my mandatory things to apply.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and received much sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>When I wear it it looks better than any false eyelashes I have ever worn...and so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I am not typically allergic to anything and don&#x27;t feel that this was an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>For example, I am attentive about the outer tops/bottom lashes, and I tend to do a second or third coat just on them to make them fan out...but only the last 1/5 of my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I didnt like was the strong smell of the transplanting gel and my eyes starting getting a little irritated at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>but I have been doing professional makeup for several years</li>
            <li>I work with each eye, first one then the other, as a coat dries on the prior</li>
            <li>it does not affect my sensitive eyes...and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Really it just takes a little patience and practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really it just takes a little patience and practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after the 2nd week it started to dry out.</li>
            <li> When all coats have been applied , I do two  final coats of gel to seal  the fibers, letting each coat dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this fiber mascara does what it says it does...gave me full long, false looking lashes that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I also use my normal mascara to thicken up the base of my lashes, and use this more for the middle and ends.)&lt;br /&gt;Apply lashes.  </li>
            <li> It felt like I had fine little bits of dust in my eyes at all times ane was irritating to my eye but not the eyelid.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do the other eye</li>
            <li> Apply adhesive (this smells like glue, chemical like, and although I have had no problems, I am very careful about not letting the tip have a glob on it that could get into my eye.</li>
            <li> You can apply as few coats as you want for a regular day time lash, or several, for a really dramatic evening makeup look.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this product works</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> I apply a base of the gel, allow it to dry and comb the lashes again, then begin the sequence of using a layer of gel, then the fibers for about three separate coats, letting each coat dry in between and re combing the lashes if needed.</li>
            <li> Ill reorder tho, they are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> so much easier than false eyelashes!!!!  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to use false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Ill be using this as part of my makeup regiment.</li>
            <li> Ill see.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Love, love, love it...so much easier than false eyelashes!!!!  Glad I bought two!</li>
            <li> Too much trouble and it flakes off onto my face.</li>
            <li> Too clumpy. Wasn&#x27;t a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I will definately purchace it again!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 3 different brands of the fiber lash/transplanting gel 3D mascara  thus has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Love this product works good for the price</li>
            <li> This product is okay but I have been doing professional makeup for several years and I use Younique Cosmetics! This product is a knock off of something they are known for (their 3D fiber lash). I would really suggest if you are looking for a good reputable company and a product that really works you check it out. Here is the link to my reps website, take a look I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed. [...]. Good luck on your search! Us ladies need to stick together. :)</li>
            <li> Love the product, except the lil flects get in your eye if you put too much so do a little at a time. FABULOUS so you don&#x27;t have to use false eyelashes.Fast shipping and received much sooner than expected.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This 3D lash extender formula is wonderful for creating quick, full, thick lashes...it does not affect my sensitive eyes...and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Although this mascara does exactly as it is supposed to do, it tends to flake off into your eye leaving your eyes very irritated. It would be good for a very short time but definitely not for more than a few hours.  I wore it for about six hours and it took two days for the irritation in my eyes to go away after removing it..  I am not typically allergic to anything and don&#x27;t feel that this was an allergic reaction.  It felt like I had fine little bits of dust in my eyes at all times ane was irritating to my eye but not the eyelid.</li>
            <li> This actually does make my lashes look FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> Awesome and cost effective!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover like described</li>
            <li> It does what it says!  I loved it.  But after the 2nd week it started to dry out. So it&#x27;s a short lived mascara. It does fall off on to your cheeks the more it&#x27;s life span comes to an end. I wish it lasted longer.  It should for the price.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this mascara. I use it every single day. Applying it took a while to get the knack of but once I got the hang of it, I feel absolutely naked without it. I am not the type of person that wears full make up every single day, but this mascara is one of my mandatory things to apply. It is not something to rush through the application of , though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I take the time to comb out my lashes, curl them and recomb. I apply a base of the gel, allow it to dry and comb the lashes again, then begin the sequence of using a layer of gel, then the fibers for about three separate coats, letting each coat dry in between and re combing the lashes if needed. I work with each eye, first one then the other, as a coat dries on the prior eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When all coats have been applied , I do two  final coats of gel to seal  the fibers, letting each coat dry thoroughly. I have had no issues with the fibers shedding through out the day. I have had fibers get into my eyes during application, but they quickly float away or wipe them away and I have no complications from them. It washes off easily at the end of the day, with just a moist makeup remover towelette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length that it creates is absolutely stunning.You can apply as few coats as you want for a regular day time lash, or several, for a really dramatic evening makeup look. I also use as colored mascara ( blue ) as a final touch on the outside wings , as an extra flare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great mascara and is a permanent addition to my make up tote.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the party brand. For best results, apply as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Apply a thin coat of your regular mascara (powder too if you tend to have runny mascara during the day). Be sure to separate your lashes as you normally do. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;Do only one eye at a time. Apply adhesive (this smells like glue, chemical like, and although I have had no problems, I am very careful about not letting the tip have a glob on it that could get into my eye. I also use my normal mascara to thicken up the base of my lashes, and use this more for the middle and ends.)&lt;br /&gt;Apply lashes.  Then apply adhesive again (seal in the coat of the lashes.)&lt;br /&gt;Do the other eye...check them out...decide if you need/want another coat. Repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do the lower lashes, but I find them too babydoll looking (falsies), which doesn&#x27;t work for the workday.&lt;br /&gt;You can also play.  For example, I am attentive about the outer tops/bottom lashes, and I tend to do a second or third coat just on them to make them fan out...but only the last 1/5 of my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, practice. Each time you will get better...oh, and keep a brush from an old mascara, clean well, and use to help separate/clean up when you accidentally get a big clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried 4 different versions of this by different manufacturers and will be giving the same post/review to all because in my opinion they all do the same job well. Really it just takes a little patience and practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I work out most evenings and sweat well and my eyes are still fine. I do use a makeup pad remover like Almay to remove gently at night.</li>
            <li> When applying it flackes all over your cheek bones.  It irritates the eyes.  Wish I had read reviews before I bought this.  I only used it once.  Will not use it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love it will bit leave the house without...</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my lashes look.  I mean, it&#x27;s a little more work, but if you do it correctly, I think it has great results. I have hardly ANY flaking and it stays on really good. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money... Thought it was a good find, tryed it out and all the fibers fell off on my face. Throw away.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this fiber mascara does what it says it does...gave me full long, false looking lashes that lasted all day. Washed off cleanly like it said it would. You want to pull away from your lashes when you wash your makeup off, this stuff slides off. The only thing I didnt like was the strong smell of the transplanting gel and my eyes starting getting a little irritated at the end of the day. Ill be using this as part of my makeup regiment. Im not sure Ill reorder tho, they are a little pricey. Ill see.</li>
