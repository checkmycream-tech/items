            <li>Lovely smell of pine.  </li>
            <li>Lathers nicely and has a fresh scent- not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about them!</li>
            <li>This used to be a fine product.  </li>
            <li>Very refreshing, high quality product.</li>
            <li>I did not buy this soap for this reason and I bought it for the smell (which is rather strong, but fresh), and my skin has stopped itching after I get out of the shower!  </li>
            <li>This is great English soap.  </li>
            <li>This is the second box of this great soap that I have ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>As a guy I feel strange writing this, but the soap is luxurious and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Great scent &amp; lasts long!</li>
            <li>Feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin with a pleasing scent of pine.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong - just fresh.</li>
            <li>This soap is all you look for in a bar of soap: great lather, great smell, gentle on the skin, desodorates, long lasting, shapes and size makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>but we all love them so much that they will be our year-round soap from now on.</li>
            <li>It can smell a bit sweet at times, not cloyingly so, and I prefer soaps with a spicier smell</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I just do not think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I also like the fresh pine smell.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Really nice gentle soap with a lasting pine smell.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the price just for the pure pine smell.  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap at first because of the name.</li>
            <li>Said it was exactly what he was looking for.  </li>
            <li>this is my first use.</li>
            <li>It really does smell like a pine forest!</li>
            <li>Great long lasting sudsy bar.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been easy to find a bar that isn&#x27;t too mushy, or creamy, or brittle, or cloyingly sweet, or antiseptic, or caustic, or slimy; this soap is an elegant, effective, and highly addictive addition to my shower life.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very convenient to have it delivered right to the door.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying this again.</li>
            <li>Dry off with warm soft towels.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic soap, with a rich, thick lather (thanks to the tallow) and a clean, very Pine-ey scent.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing if you truly want that pine scent.</li>
            <li>I look forward to taking my morning shower as the aroma is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>It leathers very well</li>
            <li>Extra nice, especially for a man.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys fine, English milled soap that smells outdoorsy.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why it is called an athletic soap, but it has a nice aroma and keeps with the British tradition of quality bathing soaps.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, but it&#x27;s hard to find in my area</li>
            <li>But when it arrived and I used it, I was very pleasantly surprised at the soap&#x27;s scent and how it lathered when showering.</li>
            <li>The pine fragrance is natural &amp; does not smell synthetic.</li>
            <li>The bars do last a bit longer than a normal bar, so it has been a bargain for me!</li>
            <li>so you get our $ worth (going on the same bar for 2.5 weeks used twice-a-day religiously and still have enough for another couple weeks).</li>
            <li>Soap lasts a long time and is larger in size than your normal bath-size soap bar!  </li>
            <li>First time I purchased this product was on the weekend Princess Di was killed and have never used anything else.</li>

            <li> These soaps are long lasting and fragrant.</li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> They also last a long time.</li>
            <li> very long lasting soap.  </li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t half-bad for a set of four especially when compared with other pine soaps such as Thymes which will run you about $10 a bar.</li>
            <li> I have spent close to $100 on different soaps and none of them worked.  </li>
            <li> has cleared up skin rash problems I&#x27;ve had for a long time.</li>
            <li> lasts a long a time.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Online price for the 4-bar set was slightly lower than the per-bar price in the one local specialty shop that sometimes has it.</li>
            <li> Get wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be just as inclined to buy the bar if it were white, plus then I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with green soap residue on all my washcloths...</li>
            <li> Lathers so well that you need less in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I currently live in Germany and they have very hard water over here, so it eats my skin up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, as well as hand made soaps.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish they didn&#x27;t color the soap.</li>
            <li> Return to mundane life.</li>
            <li> The soap is also hard milled and each bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave thick residue all over the shower.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a gift pack for my brother&#x27;s birthday, explaining that I can hardly wait to spring from bed so that I can again meet my pine-scented Lightfoot soap.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired   of gooey, slimy store-bought soap in your dish, try this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used to be good soap but the bars come apart into two pieces like they were glued together.  This used to be a fine product.  It was worth the price just for the pure pine smell.  Maybe it&#x27;s made in China now.</li>
            <li> Each bar has lasted well over a month with two users. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave thick residue all over the shower. Smells like trees.</li>
            <li> 4th time I&#x27;ve bought this soap.  Ideal shower soap for men. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap at first because of the name. But when it arrived and I used it, I was very pleasantly surprised at the soap&#x27;s scent and how it lathered when showering. I am not sure why it is called an athletic soap, but it has a nice aroma and keeps with the British tradition of quality bathing soaps.</li>
            <li> Nice but the smell didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years, and it&#x27;s simply the best I&#x27;ve found.  If you don&#x27;t mind the pine scent, I recommend it unconditionally. If you&#x27;re tired   of gooey, slimy store-bought soap in your dish, try this.</li>
            <li> Buy this item in sets or in bulk - priced better.  Soap lasts a long time and is larger in size than your normal bath-size soap bar!  Great scent!  Great to give to your man as a gift!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and I am enjoying it. I would order again from this seller</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap but I would not buy it again.  Refreshing but it does smell a bit like you are showering with Pine Sol cleaner.  And for the money- well- I just do not think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This soap is all you look for in a bar of soap: great lather, great smell, gentle on the skin, desodorates, long lasting, shapes and size makes it easy to hold. Excellent basic bath soap</li>
            <li> The scent is awesome. The lather could be thicker and creamier.</li>
            <li> I currently live in Germany and they have very hard water over here, so it eats my skin up.  I have spent close to $100 on different soaps and none of them worked.  I did not buy this soap for this reason and I bought it for the smell (which is rather strong, but fresh), and my skin has stopped itching after I get out of the shower!  The bars do last a bit longer than a normal bar, so it has been a bargain for me!</li>
            <li> Who raves about soap?  I just ordered a gift pack for my brother&#x27;s birthday, explaining that I can hardly wait to spring from bed so that I can again meet my pine-scented Lightfoot soap.  It hasn&#x27;t been easy to find a bar that isn&#x27;t too mushy, or creamy, or brittle, or cloyingly sweet, or antiseptic, or caustic, or slimy; this soap is an elegant, effective, and highly addictive addition to my shower life.  An individual bar can cost from $6.00 to $8.00, so I buy the 4-bar set and look forward to the transition from one bar to the next.</li>
            <li> love this soap....smells so good</li>
            <li> This is the real thing if you truly want that pine scent. Happy one can get it when wanted. The scent is divine.</li>
            <li> Get naked. Get wet. Apply this soap. Rinse. Dry off with warm soft towels. Smell great. Feel clean and refreshed. Get dressed. Return to mundane life.</li>
            <li> best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. has cleared up skin rash problems I&#x27;ve had for a long time. Dermatologist says it must be the pine! (He didn&#x27;t recommend it -- a friend did) but equally good on face and body and smells divine!</li>
            <li> This is actually might second order of this soap.  i like the pine scent and each bar lasts a long a time.  I will be a repeat buyer of this product for years to come.  Nice package that could be given to a man as a gift.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 86-year-old father who wanted &amp;#34;pine scented&amp;#34; soap.  He loves it.  Said it was exactly what he was looking for.  Smells great, and I&#x27;m not even a pine-scent fan.  :)</li>
            <li> I have always loved the scent of this soap. It is particularly great for men.  I buy them all the time and give it as a gift.</li>
            <li> These soaps are long lasting and fragrant. I look forward to taking my morning shower as the aroma is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I buy myself the gift set every Christmas. I use this in the daily shower and four bars will last almost through the year . . . very long lasting soap.  I also like the fresh pine smell.</li>
            <li> My husband has used Lightfoot&#x27;s forever and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. The scent is wonderful and my husband - without out that scent as my daughter says &amp;#34;Daddy doesn&#x27;t smell like Daddy&amp;#34;. We love it.</li>
            <li> My husband only requests this soap for Christmas.  It&#x27;s the best soap and has such a wonderful manly smell that&#x27;s not cloying or perfumy at all.  It&#x27;s a great gift that I&#x27;ll keep getting for him year after year.  I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys fine, English milled soap that smells outdoorsy.</li>
            <li> First time I purchased this product was on the weekend Princess Di was killed and have never used anything else.</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift and they loved it!</li>
            <li> Great pine smell.  Wonderful lather.  I&#x27;ll buy these again.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap.  Long lasting and it has a lovely pine scent. Not too feminine but good for men and women.</li>
            <li> Great the pine flavor is very clean.jeff</li>
            <li> We LOVE these soaps! I have always looked for things that smelled of pine and these are perfect. Not too strong - just fresh. I was only going to use them in winter but we all love them so much that they will be our year-round soap from now on. They also last a long time. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about them!</li>
            <li> If you enjoy a good shower after a workout or run, this is the bar for you.  Lathers nicely and has a fresh scent- not overpowering.</li>
            <li> LOVE this soap! The pine fragrance is natural &amp; does not smell synthetic. The soap is also hard milled and each bar lasts a long time. I will certainly be buying this again. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, as well as hand made soaps. This is the brand I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great. Lathers so well that you need less in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the best soaps I have purchased and this is my first use.</li>
            <li> Really nice gentle soap with a lasting pine smell.  It can smell a bit sweet at times, not cloyingly so, and I prefer soaps with a spicier smell but the pine is really beautiful. It leathers very well and it&#x27;s super moisturizing. The price isn&#x27;t half-bad for a set of four especially when compared with other pine soaps such as Thymes which will run you about $10 a bar. I&#x27;ve been trying to convince everyone I know to buy this stuff! My only complaint is that I wish they didn&#x27;t color the soap. I&#x27;d be just as inclined to buy the bar if it were white, plus then I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with green soap residue on all my washcloths...</li>
            <li> Very refreshing, high quality product.</li>
            <li> not enough perfume, not enough suds.</li>
            <li> As a guy I feel strange writing this, but the soap is luxurious and smells great.  Makes me want to keep lathering...</li>
            <li> Love this soap, but it&#x27;s hard to find in my area so it&#x27;s very convenient to have it delivered right to the door.  Online price for the 4-bar set was slightly lower than the per-bar price in the one local specialty shop that sometimes has it.</li>
            <li> This is great English soap.  Swank country clubs order this by the case.  Great for dry skin with a pleasing scent of pine.  One bar seems to last longer than \\&quot;regular\\&quot; soap.</li>
            <li> My husband picked one of these soaps up at a gentleman&#x27;s clothing store and love it so he decided to order more.</li>
            <li> We never run out of this soap</li>
            <li> GREAT for dry skin and a very nice scent. Smells even better when paired with Azzaro Pour Homme EDT. Lasts a long time so you get our $ worth (going on the same bar for 2.5 weeks used twice-a-day religiously and still have enough for another couple weeks). Will buy again and again</li>
            <li> This is the second box of this great soap that I have ordered from Amazon.  Good fragrance and creates lather as well.  A good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> And it is actually soap, not some type of bar detergent mix.  Rinses clean, smells great without an overpowering after-smell.  Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves tis soap, i buy it for him on a regular basis and he smells wonderful all the time.</li>
            <li> The best soap, great refreshing smell</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic soap, with a rich, thick lather (thanks to the tallow) and a clean, very Pine-ey scent. It really does smell like a pine forest!</li>
            <li> Great long lasting sudsy bar.</li>
            <li> Great scent &amp; lasts long!</li>
            <li> Extra nice, especially for a man.  Great gift.  Lovely smell of pine.  Husband loves it.</li>
