            <li>I love it, thanks to its pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>This tea taste pretty good</li>
            <li>the fact that it is healthy, makes it easy.  </li>
            <li>This is good white tea and a good value.</li>
            <li>It is a good white tea, good flavor.</li>
            <li>A very good price for individual tea bags of</li>
            <li>Smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Happily, I do; I find its natural sweetness</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a nice tea - i like mine STRONG so am having to use 2 bags per cup, but quite enjoyable, and is very reasonably priced</li>
            <li>This morning I sipped my first cup and it seems very nice, light, mild.  </li>
            <li>It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it.</li>
            <li>taste great, though white tea is sweeter and more antioxidants.</li>
            <li>It is soothing and easy on my stomach.  </li>
            <li>For the first couple of months, this tea was absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was nice to find that an Amazon seller also offers this awesome tea, and at about the same price as the health food store.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and the box used perfectly fit the inner-box containing this tea.  </li>
            <li>It tastes fine.</li>
            <li>I am a tea geek and love the mild smooth taste of this tea.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s a nice change of pace and has a more \\&quot;alkaline\\&quot; profile than other teas I&#x27;ve tried; highly recommended--this is a good tasting tea that won&#x27;t strain your wallet!</li>
            <li>The difference was noticeable to me, but not so huge that I wouldn&#x27;t drink POP again as prices fluctuate.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic tea.</li>
            <li>If you like a really light mellow tea you may like this.</li>
            <li>Although some may thing the taste of the tea is on the light side.</li>
            <li>You do have to add anything, just relax and enjoy.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, you will love it.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this product for my sister and she is extremely happy with this tea.</li>
            <li>I didn’t feel comfortable about ordering this tea because I prefer taking pills; I don’t like to drink liquids.  </li>
            <li>But I very much enjoy this tea, and drink it often for the taste, rather than the original reason I went looking for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really looking for an organic product but decided to keep this because it has a nice mild flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>Though quality isn&#x27;t my first priority, I still notice and appreciate getting more for my money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am quite satisfied with my first cup.</li>
            <li>Love this tea, thank you for your fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I just received it and only brewed tea two times but the taste was good.</li>
            <li>Knowing this China White Tea is good for the body is all that was needed for me to purchase this item.  </li>
            <li>Very tasty and healthy</li>
            <li>I can drink it at night and still get a full nights sleep because of the &amp;#34;low caffeine&amp;#34; level.</li>
            <li>The quality of the tea is not bad.  </li>
            <li>It is mild and slightly sweet.  </li>
            <li>I had never heard of it before and luckily, Amazon had a vendor.  </li>
            <li>I think this is an excellent value, it&#x27;s actually the second time I&#x27;ve gotten i.</li>
            <li>It is mild and not astringent at all.  </li>
            <li>I like the mild taste.  </li>
            <li>well-packed, quick delivery&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product was fine,arrived in excellent condition, but recently, antioxidants are getting mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Loved this tea and it lasted a long time!</li>
            <li>This is my second order and it was as good as the first.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very smooth and light, and I&#x27;ll be able to drink this all day, as opposed to too much green tea upsetting the stomach.  </li>
            <li>This tea is amazingly tasty white tea.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of a pain taking them out since I open 3 at a time.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>I recently read an article and I am sure there are others which discuss teas which are good for people wanting to lose weight and white tea is one of the kinds supposed to do this.  </li>
            <li>I like this white tea, but there is nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li>this one proves that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to POP, I&#x27;d say this is a more subtle tea (and subtly is good, see what I did there?)</li>
            <li>Good tea to mix with other fruity teas.</li>
            <li>Also: Thanks to the seller for his friendly e-mails.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>the shipment was on time and the price was right</li>
            <li>and the price seemed right for 100 tea bags too.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and I have enjoyed the tea for the last couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I bought it more for the health benefits then the taste but was hoping for a little more flavor.</li>
            <li>Mild taste, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>A nice light white tea with no bitter aftertaste.</li>
            <li>THIS TEA VERY MUCH WILL KEEP SOME ON HAND.</li>
            <li>Its a very light flavor of white tea.</li>
            <li>I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the white tea.</li>
            <li>For most people they may not know what white tea taste like.</li>
            <li>first  it&#x27;s cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;that</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this white tea from uncle lees.</li>
            <li>love this white tea.</li>
            <li>I love Uncle Lee&#x27;s white tea.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is a more silky, smooth taste and less grassy.</li>
            <li>I have had better tasting white teas in the past, but this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Good, solid staple white.</li>
            <li>dont know if thats true, but it isnt hurting me so far.</li>
            <li>White tea is usually very mild in taste...</li>
            <li>Should last a good long time.</li>
            <li>Since I am not familiar with teas in general or with white tea, all I can say is that it has a pleasant mild taste and seems very pure.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Very mellow and somewhat calming.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered this and really wanting to try it but upon opening I see a piece of paper with my order on it and at the bottom</li>
            <li>It does not have an after taste and really helps if you have acid reflux.</li>
            <li>have used it for one week, 3 cups a day very tasty.  </li>
            <li>so I gave it a try, and I couldn&#x27;t readily notice any difference.</li>
            <li>Yet there is real tea taste there.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I wish it were available here locally in the Richmond, Virginia area.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it doesn’t have much of a taste at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite good, but some tap waters, if not charcoal-filtered, will overwhelm delicate flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of the white tea I have tried, this is my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li>New to White Tea and enjoy very much.</li>
            <li>Decent price and readily ordered.  </li>
            <li>I most prefer black tea, but for when I don&#x27;t want to drink black, this is my favorite non-black tea.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m not actually a big fan of tea, which is why I went looking for something mild.</li>
            <li>(dangerously high).  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The material used to make there tea bags make the bags float to the top of the water line in my cup, more than any other type of tea bag I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>White tea should be light and clean on the palate and refreshing when served hot or cold.  </li>
            <li>NO AFTER BITTER TASTE, SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li>Not sure about the benefits ect but overall good tea products . .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying this tea for a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All individually wrapped, too - will stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li>Green tea has a more grassy taste.</li>
            <li>Overall, I feel pretty relaxed and the benefits of this tea mentally and physically are really nice.</li>
            <li>Normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>I have had white tea in the past, but it did not have as good a flavor</li>
            <li>The flavor is sweet and mild and I hardly need much sweeter.</li>
            <li>the light refreshing taste hot or cold mixed with other teas or alone is what you need on a nice summer day</li>
            <li>Tasted slightly astringent ( liked that), color was darker than I&#x27;m used to for a white tea.</li>
            <li>it fits in my tea regimen that I&#x27;m doing for a flat belly drinkin certain teas at certain times saw on Dr Oz</li>
            <li>To be absolutely sure about the next part, I&#x27;d really almost need to try a few more bags of POP, but I think it might have less caffeine, or at least, a better balance of caffeine and l-theanine.  </li>
            <li>It has a great taste (different than the earthy green tea flavor that I generally cut with a small amount of lemon) and as described, is somewhat sweet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;White tea is the MOST healthful of all the teas - all the cardio-vascular benefits of green tea w/ a more delicate taste</li>
            <li>I doubt most folks would notice the difference, but I avoid caffeine, so small amounts can have an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>short, I think this is a higher quality tea than the POP</li>
            <li>At the time I bought this white tea, I was mostly interested in increasing my antioxidant intake.</li>
            <li>I still do drink other varieties, but now I make sure I am always stocked with this white.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a $3.99 can of loose leaf white tea from a Chinese supermarket that tasted way better than these teabags.</li>
            <li>She was quite surprised to get tea in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that nobody else has observed this.</li>
            <li>I look for in a daily tea is really price, and I don&#x27;t mind getting lower quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sort of disappointed as the first 15 bags were the best tea I ever had and was looking forward to drinking the remaining tea bags over the course of the next several months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With Legends, I still use 2 tea bags per 12oz cup, make sure the water is boiling, and steep it for at least 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I use it because white tea has even more antioxidants than green tea, and doesn&#x27;t have the bite.</li>
            <li>I do not normally drink hot tea</li>
            <li>It had a subtle, yet refreshing taste.</li>
            <li>This Tea tastes like a black tea, mild in flavor, using for a diet plan...</li>
            <li>100 tea bags of decent tasting white tea.</li>
            <li>it is a little distinctive taste, but its not a bad taste.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this white tea!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a longtime green tea drinker &amp; while doing some health research, discovered that white tea is another healthy option, loaded with perhaps even MORE antioxidants than green tea, due to its lighter processing.  </li>
            <li>White tea is naturally low in caffeine and if you&#x27;re trying to lose weight, is a better alternative than green tea.....</li>
            <li>Very weak, so you have to use multiple bags if you want to get a stronger cup, but it comes with so many bags that even if you use 3 bags/cup, you&#x27;ll be ready for a new tea by the time you&#x27;re out of bags.</li>
            <li>It is probably easier to drink for new tea drinkers that are interested in green tea and the lighter flavors.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t tried white tea until a couple of years ago, when I happened upon this particular brand at my local health food store.  </li>
            <li>Tender Young White Tea Leaves</li>
            <li>Very good white tea and less expensive in the larger box.  </li>
            <li>, I think I prefer a more brisk green or black tea.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried that the taste would suffer, but the quality and taste did not suffer at all from the loose leaf tea that I normally buy.  </li>
            <li>that brews a tiny bit lighter than POP, but still darker than more expensive White Teas I&#x27;ve used, and has a slightly more delicate flavor to it.  </li>
            <li>So, I have to weight them down with a large metal spoon to help them brew.</li>
            <li>The bags are filled with so little tea -- I wonder if my Jewish Parents are running Uncle Lee&#x27;s -- my God its like dust in the filter bags, the taste is BITTER unlike Gevalia, SPOT or TAZO where its that of Honey.  </li>
            <li>So I searched high and low for another source, ultimately buying some much more expensive white tea at the tea shop in the mall.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a long time tea drinker.</li>
            <li>taste is delicate and sweet.</li>
            <li>It is very high in antioxidants (higher than in green or black tea) and is quite tasty.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a lighter flavor than a green tea, but I like it very much</li>
            <li>Legends is the least expensive and the best tasting of every other white tea I tried.  </li>
            <li>And you can&#x27;t really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves.</li>

            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>

            <li> I love it, thanks to its pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> This tea taste pretty good</li>
            <li> the fact that it is healthy, makes it easy.  </li>
            <li> This is good white tea and a good value.</li>
            <li> It is a good white tea, good flavor.</li>
            <li> A very good price for individual tea bags of</li>
            <li> Smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Happily, I do; I find its natural sweetness</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a nice tea - i like mine STRONG so am having to use 2 bags per cup, but quite enjoyable, and is very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> This morning I sipped my first cup and it seems very nice, light, mild.  </li>
            <li> It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it.</li>
            <li> taste great, though white tea is sweeter and more antioxidants.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and easy on my stomach.  </li>
            <li> For the first couple of months, this tea was absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was nice to find that an Amazon seller also offers this awesome tea, and at about the same price as the health food store.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and the box used perfectly fit the inner-box containing this tea.  </li>
            <li> It tastes fine.</li>
            <li> I am a tea geek and love the mild smooth taste of this tea.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s a nice change of pace and has a more \\&quot;alkaline\\&quot; profile than other teas I&#x27;ve tried; highly recommended--this is a good tasting tea that won&#x27;t strain your wallet!</li>
            <li> The difference was noticeable to me, but not so huge that I wouldn&#x27;t drink POP again as prices fluctuate.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic tea.</li>
            <li> If you like a really light mellow tea you may like this.</li>
            <li> Although some may thing the taste of the tea is on the light side.</li>
            <li> You do have to add anything, just relax and enjoy.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product for my sister and she is extremely happy with this tea.</li>
            <li> I didn’t feel comfortable about ordering this tea because I prefer taking pills; I don’t like to drink liquids.  </li>
            <li> But I very much enjoy this tea, and drink it often for the taste, rather than the original reason I went looking for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really looking for an organic product but decided to keep this because it has a nice mild flavor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> Though quality isn&#x27;t my first priority, I still notice and appreciate getting more for my money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am quite satisfied with my first cup.</li>
            <li> Love this tea, thank you for your fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I just received it and only brewed tea two times but the taste was good.</li>
            <li> Knowing this China White Tea is good for the body is all that was needed for me to purchase this item.  </li>
            <li> Very tasty and healthy</li>
            <li> I can drink it at night and still get a full nights sleep because of the &amp;#34;low caffeine&amp;#34; level.</li>
            <li> The quality of the tea is not bad.  </li>
            <li> It is mild and slightly sweet.  </li>
            <li> I had never heard of it before and luckily, Amazon had a vendor.  </li>
            <li> I think this is an excellent value, it&#x27;s actually the second time I&#x27;ve gotten i.</li>
            <li> It is mild and not astringent at all.  </li>
            <li> I like the mild taste.  </li>
            <li> well-packed, quick delivery&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product was fine,arrived in excellent condition, but recently, antioxidants are getting mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Loved this tea and it lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> This is my second order and it was as good as the first.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very smooth and light, and I&#x27;ll be able to drink this all day, as opposed to too much green tea upsetting the stomach.  </li>
            <li> This tea is amazingly tasty white tea.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of a pain taking them out since I open 3 at a time.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> I recently read an article and I am sure there are others which discuss teas which are good for people wanting to lose weight and white tea is one of the kinds supposed to do this.  </li>
            <li> I like this white tea, but there is nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li> this one proves that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to POP, I&#x27;d say this is a more subtle tea (and subtly is good, see what I did there?)</li>
            <li> Good tea to mix with other fruity teas.</li>
            <li> Also: Thanks to the seller for his friendly e-mails.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> the shipment was on time and the price was right</li>
            <li> and the price seemed right for 100 tea bags too.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I have enjoyed the tea for the last couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I bought it more for the health benefits then the taste but was hoping for a little more flavor.</li>
            <li> Mild taste, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> A nice light white tea with no bitter aftertaste.</li>
            <li> THIS TEA VERY MUCH WILL KEEP SOME ON HAND.</li>
            <li> Its a very light flavor of white tea.</li>
            <li> I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the white tea.</li>
            <li> For most people they may not know what white tea taste like.</li>
            <li> first  it&#x27;s cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;that</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this white tea from uncle lees.</li>
            <li> love this white tea.</li>
            <li> I love Uncle Lee&#x27;s white tea.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a more silky, smooth taste and less grassy.</li>
            <li> I have had better tasting white teas in the past, but this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Good, solid staple white.</li>
            <li> dont know if thats true, but it isnt hurting me so far.</li>
            <li> White tea is usually very mild in taste...</li>
            <li> Should last a good long time.</li>
            <li> Since I am not familiar with teas in general or with white tea, all I can say is that it has a pleasant mild taste and seems very pure.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Very mellow and somewhat calming.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered this and really wanting to try it but upon opening I see a piece of paper with my order on it and at the bottom</li>
            <li> It does not have an after taste and really helps if you have acid reflux.</li>
            <li> have used it for one week, 3 cups a day very tasty.  </li>
            <li> so I gave it a try, and I couldn&#x27;t readily notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Yet there is real tea taste there.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I wish it were available here locally in the Richmond, Virginia area.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> it doesn’t have much of a taste at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite good, but some tap waters, if not charcoal-filtered, will overwhelm delicate flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of the white tea I have tried, this is my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li> New to White Tea and enjoy very much.</li>
            <li> Decent price and readily ordered.  </li>
            <li> I most prefer black tea, but for when I don&#x27;t want to drink black, this is my favorite non-black tea.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m not actually a big fan of tea, which is why I went looking for something mild.</li>
            <li> (dangerously high).  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The material used to make there tea bags make the bags float to the top of the water line in my cup, more than any other type of tea bag I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> White tea should be light and clean on the palate and refreshing when served hot or cold.  </li>
            <li> NO AFTER BITTER TASTE, SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the benefits ect but overall good tea products . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying this tea for a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All individually wrapped, too - will stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li> Green tea has a more grassy taste.</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel pretty relaxed and the benefits of this tea mentally and physically are really nice.</li>
            <li> Normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I have had white tea in the past, but it did not have as good a flavor</li>
            <li> The flavor is sweet and mild and I hardly need much sweeter.</li>
            <li> the light refreshing taste hot or cold mixed with other teas or alone is what you need on a nice summer day</li>
            <li> Tasted slightly astringent ( liked that), color was darker than I&#x27;m used to for a white tea.</li>
            <li> it fits in my tea regimen that I&#x27;m doing for a flat belly drinkin certain teas at certain times saw on Dr Oz</li>
            <li> To be absolutely sure about the next part, I&#x27;d really almost need to try a few more bags of POP, but I think it might have less caffeine, or at least, a better balance of caffeine and l-theanine.  </li>
            <li> It has a great taste (different than the earthy green tea flavor that I generally cut with a small amount of lemon) and as described, is somewhat sweet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;White tea is the MOST healthful of all the teas - all the cardio-vascular benefits of green tea w/ a more delicate taste</li>
            <li> I doubt most folks would notice the difference, but I avoid caffeine, so small amounts can have an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> short, I think this is a higher quality tea than the POP</li>
            <li> At the time I bought this white tea, I was mostly interested in increasing my antioxidant intake.</li>
            <li> I still do drink other varieties, but now I make sure I am always stocked with this white.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying a $3.99 can of loose leaf white tea from a Chinese supermarket that tasted way better than these teabags.</li>
            <li> She was quite surprised to get tea in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that nobody else has observed this.</li>
            <li> I look for in a daily tea is really price, and I don&#x27;t mind getting lower quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of disappointed as the first 15 bags were the best tea I ever had and was looking forward to drinking the remaining tea bags over the course of the next several months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With Legends, I still use 2 tea bags per 12oz cup, make sure the water is boiling, and steep it for at least 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I use it because white tea has even more antioxidants than green tea, and doesn&#x27;t have the bite.</li>
            <li> I do not normally drink hot tea</li>
            <li> It had a subtle, yet refreshing taste.</li>
            <li> This Tea tastes like a black tea, mild in flavor, using for a diet plan...</li>
            <li> 100 tea bags of decent tasting white tea.</li>
            <li> it is a little distinctive taste, but its not a bad taste.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this white tea!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime green tea drinker &amp; while doing some health research, discovered that white tea is another healthy option, loaded with perhaps even MORE antioxidants than green tea, due to its lighter processing.  </li>
            <li> White tea is naturally low in caffeine and if you&#x27;re trying to lose weight, is a better alternative than green tea.....</li>
            <li> Very weak, so you have to use multiple bags if you want to get a stronger cup, but it comes with so many bags that even if you use 3 bags/cup, you&#x27;ll be ready for a new tea by the time you&#x27;re out of bags.</li>
            <li> It is probably easier to drink for new tea drinkers that are interested in green tea and the lighter flavors.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried white tea until a couple of years ago, when I happened upon this particular brand at my local health food store.  </li>
            <li> Tender Young White Tea Leaves</li>
            <li> Very good white tea and less expensive in the larger box.  </li>
            <li> , I think I prefer a more brisk green or black tea.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried that the taste would suffer, but the quality and taste did not suffer at all from the loose leaf tea that I normally buy.  </li>
            <li> that brews a tiny bit lighter than POP, but still darker than more expensive White Teas I&#x27;ve used, and has a slightly more delicate flavor to it.  </li>
            <li> So, I have to weight them down with a large metal spoon to help them brew.</li>
            <li> The bags are filled with so little tea -- I wonder if my Jewish Parents are running Uncle Lee&#x27;s -- my God its like dust in the filter bags, the taste is BITTER unlike Gevalia, SPOT or TAZO where its that of Honey.  </li>
            <li> So I searched high and low for another source, ultimately buying some much more expensive white tea at the tea shop in the mall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a long time tea drinker.</li>
            <li> taste is delicate and sweet.</li>
            <li> It is very high in antioxidants (higher than in green or black tea) and is quite tasty.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a lighter flavor than a green tea, but I like it very much</li>
            <li> Legends is the least expensive and the best tasting of every other white tea I tried.  </li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves.</li>
            <li> Low quality white tea is still chock full of antioxidants and has a pleasing l-theanine boost, though sometimes it might have a worse caffeine to l-theanine ratio.  </li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t burn (gets a &#x27;dark&#x27; aftertaste if steeped too long), &amp; mixes easily with honey/agave (some green teas i&#x27;ve tried do not mix well with other ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li> Because of this I only got to enjoy 25 or so bags, with the last 10 being mediocre in flavour.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not completely wild about the individual packets for each tea bag, because for one thing I&#x27;m not a fan of paper and for another</li>
            <li> I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this brand of white tea here, in large quantities.</li>
            <li> so instead of sending back these I put the box in the Goodwill bag for the local goodwill Center.  </li>
            <li> Nothing fancy...just plain, old white tea.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hardly qualified to judge grades, but I can spot certain indicators of quality, and below, I&#x27;ll compare these two teas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally was able to find a few places that had (expensive) white tea, trying Salada brand and a couple of others, including loose white tea from another health food</li>
            <li> Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color.</li>
            <li> being said, this tea has a more subtle flavor then green &amp; black teas.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> I used to drink the standard black pekoe and the occasional Earl Grey until then.  </li>
            <li> This white tea did not taste like a white tea or a green tea.  </li>
            <li> one day I ran out of &#x27;Legends&#x27; white tea, and I just zipped down to the health food store.  </li>
            <li> I have prepared it both hot and cold and have never enjoyed a tea as much - it doesn&#x27;t take any effort to &amp;#34;get used to&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again as I like brown, green and now white tea.  </li>
            <li> the Green tea by the same company</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a green tea fan - but, after reading about white tea and the benefits I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Not much flavor here</li>
            <li> Avoid unless you want orage peoke tea labeled as white tea derived from green tea.  </li>
            <li> It should be noted that white, green and black all have health benefits, including varying levels of antioxidants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it says, &amp;#34; These products contain a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.&amp;#34; Just wondering what thats all about cause</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this remedy make a difference; all I know is Ziplocs don&#x27;t stop the process entirely.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this product and any other tea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find white tea in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> They look like little balloons when they get wet.</li>
            <li> I FELT IT WAS MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT IT DID.</li>
            <li> I usually drink green tea but had read about the benefits of white tea</li>
            <li> Once you break that seal, the tea will slowly lose its luster, since the bags are only wrapped in paper.  </li>
            <li> Also, I personally have to use 2 bags as the flavor is very weak, I guess because its white tea.  </li>
            <li> I discovered the sad truth that black and green tea has very high concentrations of fluoride in the tea leaves.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee.</li>
            <li> Found this product on another website for less than half the cost.  </li>
            <li> It blends well for hot or cold tea</li>
            <li> , I drink it all day either hot and cold and</li>
            <li> However, the little bit of glue added to hold the tab to the bag of tea causes a hole to form when I pull the holding tab away.</li>
            <li> I feel a little upset</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t even fond of green tea.</li>
            <li> Even though they get wet they refuse to fall in the water unless forced.  </li>
            <li> I also read about green tea and oolong tea</li>
            <li> Usually you steep tea longer if its black tea.</li>
            <li> I like it plain.  </li>
            <li> little milder than usual.</li>
            <li> and I was forced to throw out over half of the bags.</li>
            <li> Its almost tasteless, and its very clear in color.</li>
            <li> ( Purported to help you lose weight; not sure about that yet)</li>
            <li> Using this methodology with all the other brands still produced very weak tea, and with some, the flavor was just not &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to, and sometimes it&#x27;s less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I would feel bad to give this to another tea drinker in case they have the same reaction that I did.</li>
            <li> Its a bit frustrating.</li>
            <li> However, after about 3-4 months, the tea bags became useless.</li>
            <li> bottom line is that all of the others I tried paled in comparison, and were all expensive.  </li>
            <li> Almost tasteless.  </li>
            <li> It was awful.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I read somewhere about the health benefits of white tea.  I had never heard of it before and luckily, Amazon had a vendor.  Fair price, quick shipping.  I like my tea stronger than most people and use 3 bags per glass of iced tea. It reminds me of oolong tea.  I will purchase again as I like brown, green and now white tea.  Cheers y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li> Great Item using it every day</li>
            <li> Excellent taste. Smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The tea is great tasting.  Wanted to try it, heard it helps with weight loss.</li>
            <li> Smooth delightful flavor. Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I just received it and only brewed tea two times but the taste was good. I do not normally drink hot tea but this was good and I expect it will taste better over ice.</li>
            <li> I LEARNED WHITE TEA BENEFITS THE STOMACH, IT ALSO TASTE GREAT NO AFTER BITTER TASTE, SMOOTH. I LIKE THIS TEA VERY MUCH WILL KEEP SOME ON HAND.</li>
            <li> Very mellow and somewhat calming.  I use it because white tea has even more antioxidants than green tea, and doesn&#x27;t have the bite.</li>
            <li> Just ordered this and really wanting to try it but upon opening I see a piece of paper with my order on it and at the bottom it says, &amp;#34; These products contain a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.&amp;#34; Just wondering what thats all about cause ive never got that with anything else ive ordered ever. Just wondering if anyone else got this paper or if its a mistake cause tea would be one of the last things to cause health problems I would of thought.</li>
            <li> saw white tea on katie couric once. decided to try it. it is a little distinctive taste, but its not a bad taste. supposed to help your innards. dont know if thats true, but it isnt hurting me so far. I do believe it may have some medicinal stuff to it</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;Have the Green tea by the same company as well&lt;br /&gt;Both taste great, though white tea is sweeter and more antioxidants.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love the white tea.</li>
            <li> Great Flavor - Good Price</li>
            <li> Best Deal and TASTE ever!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for the health benefits. It arrived on time. The price was right. As for the taste, it tastes like tea.</li>
            <li> Knowing this China White Tea is good for the body is all that was needed for me to purchase this item.  It blends well for hot or cold tea and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Mild taste, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this tea.  It does not have an after taste and really helps if you have acid reflux.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.  This is a nice, light tea.</li>
            <li> New to White Tea and enjoy very much. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Great tea, service getting it to me was fast. Just hoping the health benefits are what say they are. Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and get good quantity for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Tea is delicious. Needs no sugar at all. Thank you for your prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a green tea fan - but, after reading about white tea and the benefits I decided to try it.  I love it, it&#x27;s very smooth and light, and I&#x27;ll be able to drink this all day, as opposed to too much green tea upsetting the stomach.  I have prepared it both hot and cold and have never enjoyed a tea as much - it doesn&#x27;t take any effort to &amp;#34;get used to&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> have used it for one week, 3 cups a day very tasty.  delivery was excellent.  great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is SO very good. I&#x27;m not a long time tea drinker. In fact, I&#x27;m not actually a big fan of tea, which is why I went looking for something mild. I wanted the caffeine and health benefits but I wasn&#x27;t even fond of green tea. But I very much enjoy this tea, and drink it often for the taste, rather than the original reason I went looking for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not completely wild about the individual packets for each tea bag, because for one thing I&#x27;m not a fan of paper and for another, it&#x27;s kind of a pain taking them out since I open 3 at a time. Still, I suspect that is what is keeping the tea so fresh and delicious, so I won&#x27;t complain. I think this is an excellent value, it&#x27;s actually the second time I&#x27;ve gotten i.</li>
            <li> I love this product! always a perfect choice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tea that doesn&#x27;t cost a million dollars.  I only drink white tea to steep with my ayurvedic chai blend I bought and it does just the trick.</li>
            <li> Delicious tea, loaded with good for you polyphenols, and super cheap on Amazon in this quantity. Don&#x27;t pay more for boutique teas!</li>
            <li> This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn&#x27;t have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can&#x27;t really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.&lt;br /&gt;Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn&#x27;t readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.</li>
            <li> Loved this tea and it lasted a long time! Great price too.</li>
            <li> Decent price and readily ordered.  Delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> This tea taste pretty good it fits in my tea regimen that I&#x27;m doing for a flat belly drinkin certain teas at certain times saw on Dr Oz</li>
            <li> Very tasty and healthy</li>
            <li> Fantastic tea. I am a tea geek and love the mild smooth taste of this tea. Excellent tea.</li>
            <li> This tea tastes good. I bought it because of the antioxidants provided by this type of tea and its abilities to help your weight loss.</li>
            <li> first  it&#x27;s cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;that being said, this tea has a more subtle flavor then green &amp; black teas.&lt;br /&gt;it brews well, doesn&#x27;t burn (gets a &#x27;dark&#x27; aftertaste if steeped too long), &amp; mixes easily with honey/agave (some green teas i&#x27;ve tried do not mix well with other ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My mom couldn&#x27;t find white tea anywhere in town so I looked on Amazon and found this one it got good reviews so I bought it for her and had it sent to her doorstep.  She was quite surprised to get tea in the mail.  She said it is very good and is also making Kombucha with it and said that is yummy too.</li>
            <li> I most prefer black tea, but for when I don&#x27;t want to drink black, this is my favorite non-black tea.  It&#x27;s quite good, but some tap waters, if not charcoal-filtered, will overwhelm delicate flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this tea bought from here or from stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found with boxes of 100 tea bags, wrapped in plastic, that they seem to have an unlimited shelf life until you open the plastic.  Once you break that seal, the tea will slowly lose its luster, since the bags are only wrapped in paper.  I&#x27;ve tried slowing that process using Ziplocs.  I&#x27;m not sure if this remedy make a difference; all I know is Ziplocs don&#x27;t stop the process entirely.</li>
            <li> The material used to make there tea bags make the bags float to the top of the water line in my cup, more than any other type of tea bag I&#x27;ve used in the past. They look like little balloons when they get wet. Even though they get wet they refuse to fall in the water unless forced.  So, I have to weight them down with a large metal spoon to help them brew. Its a bit frustrating. I&#x27;m surprised that nobody else has observed this. Also, I personally have to use 2 bags as the flavor is very weak, I guess because its white tea.  The ingredients listed on the side of the box is.... Tender Young White Tea Leaves (BaiMuDan).  The product is distributed by Uncle Lee&#x27;s Tea, Inc, 11020 E Rush Street, South El Monte, CA.</li>
            <li> Great price and great taste. Very happy. Not sure about the benefits ect but overall good tea products . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying this tea for a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the convenience of the 100 pack. This keeps me from running out and have to rush and replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is delicate and sweet. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy more of Mr Lees teas.</li>
            <li> Bought this because a character in a book drank white tea.  I had never heard of it, so I tried it.  It is the most fragrant, cleanest tasting tea I have ever had.  I try to drink 2 cups a day now.</li>
            <li> This is my second order and it was as good as the first.</li>
            <li> Almost tasteless.  I could drink water I guess!  I will not be ordering these again and may just give them to the cats!</li>
            <li> This makes a nice after noon tea and it add more flavor to my matcha tea.  Which acts like coffee in the afternoon for a pick me up.</li>
            <li> Good tea and good for me - all good.  All individually wrapped, too - will stay fresh longer.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Nothing fancy...just plain, old white tea.  The company is very courteous and concerned with customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This tea is awesome, I drink it all day either hot and cold and the fact that it is healthy, makes it easy.  I keep some in my bag for when I travel.</li>
            <li> Tea is fantastic!  Price is not. Found this product on another website for less than half the cost.  Shop wisely!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this white tea from uncle lees. It had a subtle, yet refreshing taste. It is probably easier to drink for new tea drinkers that are interested in green tea and the lighter flavors. Green tea has a more grassy taste. This is a more silky, smooth taste and less grassy. I steeped it til it turned a medium yellow. Usually you steep tea longer if its black tea. Overall, I feel pretty relaxed and the benefits of this tea mentally and physically are really nice.</li>
            <li> I discovered the sad truth that black and green tea has very high concentrations of fluoride in the tea leaves. (dangerously high).  Then I discovered that white tea (taken from the youngest leaves and buds) has very low fluoride and so I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this white tea. It is mild and slightly sweet.  It is very high in antioxidants (higher than in green or black tea) and is quite tasty.  Of the white tea I have tried, this is my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li> Good taste with nothing added</li>
            <li> Good, solid staple white. Very weak, so you have to use multiple bags if you want to get a stronger cup, but it comes with so many bags that even if you use 3 bags/cup, you&#x27;ll be ready for a new tea by the time you&#x27;re out of bags.</li>
            <li> This tea is very good and I&#x27;m enjoying drinking it at lunchtime. I only add a teaspoon of honey and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great tea!  A very good price for individual tea bags of 100 ct. I keep it on hand all the time.</li>
            <li> A nice light white tea with no bitter aftertaste. It has low caffeine so you can drink it in the evening. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime green tea drinker &amp; while doing some health research, discovered that white tea is another healthy option, loaded with perhaps even MORE antioxidants than green tea, due to its lighter processing.  I thought I&#x27;d try this and see if I liked the flavor.  Happily, I do; I find its natural sweetness doesn&#x27;t even call for a drop of stevia.  I like it plain.  This is definitely a lighter flavor than a green tea, but I like it very much--it&#x27;s a nice change of pace and has a more \\&quot;alkaline\\&quot; profile than other teas I&#x27;ve tried; highly recommended--this is a good tasting tea that won&#x27;t strain your wallet!</li>
            <li> This tea is good for keeping your blood sugars more stable,helpful for diabetics.</li>
            <li> This the so tasty and I drink it almost every day.  It is mild and not astringent at all.  Yet there is real tea taste there.  I don&#x27;t need sugar or lemon.  I tried it with sugar and milk which is how I drink my Darjeeling and Irish Breakfast tea and it did not benefit the flavor at all.</li>
            <li> I bought the tea to lose weight as on Dr Oz but have not had any results. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Delicious ! And the youngest of teas with health benefits .</li>
            <li> This is the best tea. Great tasting</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, a good quantity for a good price. White tea is naturally low in caffeine and if you&#x27;re trying to lose weight, is a better alternative than green tea.....received quickly and in good condition. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have recently taken up drinking white tea, and wanted some tea-bags to use at work without all the paraphernalia.  I was a bit worried that the taste would suffer, but the quality and taste did not suffer at all from the loose leaf tea that I normally buy.  This is a bit sweeter to the palate, almost as though it has a touch of honey in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed at all.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Tea tastes like a black tea, mild in flavor, using for a diet plan...2 cups with my lunch. I find it to be a good price for&lt;br /&gt;100 tea bags.</li>
            <li> the light refreshing taste hot or cold mixed with other teas or alone is what you need on a nice summer day</li>
            <li> Not much flavor here, I think I prefer a more brisk green or black tea. If you like a really light mellow tea you may like this. I bought it more for the health benefits then the taste but was hoping for a little more flavor.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I have enjoyed the tea for the last couple of days.  I like the mild taste.  It is soothing and easy on my stomach.  I am happy with this product</li>
            <li> well-packed, quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;White tea is the MOST healthful of all the teas - all the cardio-vascular benefits of green tea w/ a more delicate taste&lt;br /&gt;this is a nice tea - i like mine STRONG so am having to use 2 bags per cup, but quite enjoyable, and is very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Followed Dr Oz, but had an allergic reaction to it. Try a smaller package before committing to the big box.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this product and any other tea. I FELT IT WAS MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT IT DID.</li>
            <li> I love Uncle Lee&#x27;s white tea.  It is an excellent anti-oxident, and it tastes good, too!  The price however, has increased since I last ordered it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff hoping to burn some Fat</li>
            <li> Hard to find this brand of white tea here, in large quantities. Tasted slightly astringent ( liked that), color was darker than I&#x27;m used to for a white tea. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I drink white tea every day and have for two years.  Since I&#x27;m on a budget, that means I&#x27;m always looking for a deal.  Previously, my daily tea has been Prince of Peace (POP) brand, which is in a similar price range.  I&#x27;ve read others speculate that POP white tea isn&#x27;t really White Peony (Bai Mudan) as labeled, but is a lower grade still, Shou Mei.  I&#x27;m hardly qualified to judge grades, but I can spot certain indicators of quality, and below, I&#x27;ll compare these two teas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I look for in a daily tea is really price, and I don&#x27;t mind getting lower quality.  Low quality white tea is still chock full of antioxidants and has a pleasing l-theanine boost, though sometimes it might have a worse caffeine to l-theanine ratio.  Though quality isn&#x27;t my first priority, I still notice and appreciate getting more for my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to POP, I&#x27;d say this is a more subtle tea (and subtly is good, see what I did there?) that brews a tiny bit lighter than POP, but still darker than more expensive White Teas I&#x27;ve used, and has a slightly more delicate flavor to it.  To be absolutely sure about the next part, I&#x27;d really almost need to try a few more bags of POP, but I think it might have less caffeine, or at least, a better balance of caffeine and l-theanine.  I doubt most folks would notice the difference, but I avoid caffeine, so small amounts can have an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I think this is a higher quality tea than the POP I&#x27;m used to, and sometimes it&#x27;s less expensive.  The difference was noticeable to me, but not so huge that I wouldn&#x27;t drink POP again as prices fluctuate.  And in my experience, when you&#x27;re dealing with anything at this end of the price range, quality can vary from batch to batch, so YMMV.</li>
            <li> I got this tea because  it was suppose to get rid of stomach fat.  I haven&#x27;t  seen the fat decrease yet, but I am still waiiting.</li>
            <li> excellent tea, I like it very much served it to guests who all enjoyed it, will bw reordering</li>
            <li> the shipment was on time and the price was right</li>
            <li> Makes great cold-brewed iced tea 24 oz container filled with filtered water 3 tea bags let it sit for 12  hours in the refrigerator comes out great with no bitterness whatsoever. Normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this is good Tea.</li>
            <li> Healing Tea, good as a substitute for Chamomile. Perfect for an upset tummy.( Purported to help you lose weight; not sure about that yet) Good tea to mix with other fruity teas.</li>
            <li> I recently read an article and I am sure there are others which discuss teas which are good for people wanting to lose weight and white tea is one of the kinds supposed to do this.  I also read about green tea and oolong tea and I decided I&#x27;d give white tea a try. So as a member of Amazon Prime, I looked for a white tea which was Prime eligible which this one is and the price seemed right for 100 tea bags too. So having a PO Box I took my time going over there.  It arrived very quickly and the box used perfectly fit the inner-box containing this tea.  This morning I sipped my first cup and it seems very nice, light, mild.  Since I am not familiar with teas in general or with white tea, all I can say is that it has a pleasant mild taste and seems very pure. Time will only tell if it does something with my fat cells and this company&#x27;s box does not mention anything with regard to weight loss but just that it has antioxidants and what Chinese province it is from. So I had no problems with ordering or receiving this tea and I am quite satisfied with my first cup.</li>
            <li> This was not my cup of tea as they say.  White tea should be light and clean on the palate and refreshing when served hot or cold.  This white tea did not taste like a white tea or a green tea.  I ended up buying a $3.99 can of loose leaf white tea from a Chinese supermarket that tasted way better than these teabags. I will have to find a way to use these teabags in another way. I would feel bad to give this to another tea drinker in case they have the same reaction that I did.</li>
            <li> Product was fine,arrived in excellent condition, but recently, antioxidants are getting mixed reviews. At the time I bought this white tea, I was mostly interested in increasing my antioxidant intake. The recent reviews prompted me to  give it only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of months, this tea was absolutely amazing. However, after about 3-4 months, the tea bags became useless. They lost all of their flavour and I was forced to throw out over half of the bags. Because of this I only got to enjoy 25 or so bags, with the last 10 being mediocre in flavour. I&#x27;m sort of disappointed as the first 15 bags were the best tea I ever had and was looking forward to drinking the remaining tea bags over the course of the next several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to repurchase them through this seller after I used them all but now I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> This is good white tea and a good value. I was really looking for an organic product but decided to keep this because it has a nice mild flavor.</li>
            <li> no need to use sweetener with this tea. love it</li>
            <li> Great product at an amazing price.  The shipping was fast.  Excellent seller.</li>
            <li> My husband love this tea.</li>
            <li> I love this tea. So light, with a wonderful flavor. It&#x27;s very hard to find white tea in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> I like it. Very good tea and healthy</li>
            <li> This was the best priced tea that i could find anywhere around.  I was really surprised at how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried white tea until a couple of years ago, when I happened upon this particular brand at my local health food store.  It was the best-tasting tea I&#x27;d found, of any variety.  I used to drink the standard black pekoe and the occasional Earl Grey until then.  I still do drink other varieties, but now I make sure I am always stocked with this white.  It should be noted that white, green and black all have health benefits, including varying levels of antioxidants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So one day I ran out of &#x27;Legends&#x27; white tea, and I just zipped down to the health food store.  To my dismay, there were out of stock.  And the next couple of times I went there, they were again out of stock.  So I searched high and low for another source, ultimately buying some much more expensive white tea at the tea shop in the mall.  Don&#x27;t make that mistake.  It was awful.  I finally was able to find a few places that had (expensive) white tea, trying Salada brand and a couple of others, including loose white tea from another health food store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that all of the others I tried paled in comparison, and were all expensive.  Legends is the least expensive and the best tasting of every other white tea I tried.  With Legends, I still use 2 tea bags per 12oz cup, make sure the water is boiling, and steep it for at least 5 minutes.  This makes an excellent, clean-tasting and flavorful cup of tea.  Using this methodology with all the other brands still produced very weak tea, and with some, the flavor was just not &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice to find that an Amazon seller also offers this awesome tea, and at about the same price as the health food store.</li>
            <li> I like this white tea, but there is nothing spectacular about it. I have had better tasting white teas in the past, but this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> The quality of the tea is not bad.  Although some may thing the taste of the tea is on the light side.</li>
            <li> Nice tea light but somewhat tasty</li>
            <li> It is as described.Good stuff, too!</li>
            <li> good product and a very nice price!</li>
            <li> 100 tea bags of decent tasting white tea. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be blown away by this product because it&#x27;s only white tea, and that is why I bought it,</li>
            <li> Very nice flavor. I use stevia to sweeten it to avoid sugar. I really love tea and this is a nice one.</li>
            <li> Product always arrive early and the quality has always been the best quality</li>
            <li> White tea is usually very mild in taste... this one proves that. Found it to be&lt;br /&gt;a little milder than usual. But great taste.</li>
            <li> Very good white tea and less expensive in the larger box.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> very nice taste, have re-ordered</li>
            <li> This is a very good tea with a mild flavor. You do have to add anything, just relax and enjoy.</li>
            <li> This tea is sooooo good. One of the best I&#x27;ve had so far...or may be &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this tea, because of the taste and the way it make me feel.  Good healthy tea.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This tea was just what I have been wanting. The flavor is sweet and mild and I hardly need much sweeter. It is worth every penny, you will love it.</li>
            <li> This tea is very good I heard from it from dr Oz the tast is better if you make ice tea with it</li>
            <li> Tasty and healthy tea.</li>
            <li> It tastes fine. However, the little bit of glue added to hold the tab to the bag of tea causes a hole to form when I pull the holding tab away. The tea comes out into the cup, and I have to dump the tea. This happens to about 20% of the bags.</li>
            <li> Excellent tea great without anything,also exceptional  when used on your skin,really tightens skin.</li>
            <li> very nice tea, good price. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love it, thanks to its pleasant taste. I think it helps me a lot, with more energy and vitality. Also: Thanks to the seller for his friendly e-mails.</li>
            <li> Its a very light flavor of white tea. Its almost tasteless, and its very clear in color. But okay</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. Received as described and on time.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this tea, thank you for your fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Good tea. There are 100 bags in the box. Should last a good long time. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The bags are filled with so little tea -- I wonder if my Jewish Parents are running Uncle Lee&#x27;s -- my God its like dust in the filter bags, the taste is BITTER unlike Gevalia, SPOT or TAZO where its that of Honey.  Again I&#x27;d suggest looking elsewhere unless your use too being Ripped Off and cheated.  I feel a little upset so instead of sending back these I put the box in the Goodwill bag for the local goodwill Center.  Avoid unless you want orage peoke tea labeled as white tea derived from green tea.  Again Look elsewhere don&#x27;t get screwed like I just did.</li>
            <li> Great product ... I usually drink green tea but had read about the benefits of white tea so I ordered this to try.  I am hooked!  This tea is great and I have already ordered another box so that I don&#x27;t run out.  It has a great taste (different than the earthy green tea flavor that I generally cut with a small amount of lemon) and as described, is somewhat sweet.  I highly recommend this white tea!</li>
            <li> MY Granddaughter &amp; I think this is the best &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; tea we&#x27;ve ever had.  I buy about 4 boxes as a time as I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> We love this product for its flavor, health benefits, and its availability. I wish it were available here locally in the Richmond, Virginia area. Makes me want to possibly open a Variety Tea store. Thanks. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product for my sister and she is extremely happy with this tea.</li>
            <li> I didn’t feel comfortable about ordering this tea because I prefer taking pills; I don’t like to drink liquids.  If you don’t like most taste this is the tea for you it doesn’t have much of a taste at all.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love this tea.</li>
            <li> I can drink it at night and still get a full nights sleep because of the &amp;#34;low caffeine&amp;#34; level.</li>
            <li> It is a good white tea, good flavor. I have had white tea in the past, but it did not have as good a flavor</li>
