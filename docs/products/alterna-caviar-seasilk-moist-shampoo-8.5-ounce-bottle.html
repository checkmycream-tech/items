            <li>It is truly the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried ~50 different salon and non-salon brands of shampoo over the years.  </li>

            <li>so I need something that gives me more volume.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love the Altern Caviar hair products.  </li>
            <li>Most shampoo strips the color from my  hair but using the Alterna Caviar Seasilt Moist Shampoo</li>
            <li>I love these products and the prices on line</li>
            <li>I love the lather and thorough cleansing this has on my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want reviews of the products,you should allow people to choose how many words they want to use..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a luxurious shampoo though, for sure.</li>
            <li>This shampoo also helps get rid of dandruff, because I think it probably has a lot of nutrients healthy for hair cells.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>It looks better too.</li>
            <li>The one I found that works better is Morrocanoil.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Whatever it is, it smells like a great clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it rinses out clean.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and light, easily unisex.  </li>
            <li>Instead of my hair becoming puffy and frizzy after blowdrying it, my hair is silky, smooth, and most of the un-wanted volume has disappeared.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the service fast with no problems , and the product is good</li>
            <li>Very good product for dry hair, need 10 more words in order to submit, I think I have it.</li>
            <li>Even without the keratin treatment, this sulfate free shampoo (I&#x27;ve tried other brands) tames my hair the best!</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and shiny and it seems to give my hair more volume too which I love!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have a fine and dry hair, Alterna Caviar Seasilk Shampoo is really good moisturizer with nice smell.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I gave a travel size kit to my mother-in-law for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>It taught me about why I wanted sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>ends smooth again, and it makes hair silky just after a couple of rinses.</li>
            <li>(god I sound like a</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I find that my hair is very shiny, feels so healthy, and I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of shampoo to get it clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave those &amp;#34;acidic/base?&amp;#34; feel that many shampoo brands use, so I really recommend this product if budget allows for a special treat.</li>
            <li>my color lasts the full six weeks.  </li>
            <li>Besides, I thought the bottle was cool</li>
            <li>But you do not need much, and the fact that it is sulfate/paraben free etc is a plus!</li>
            <li>I like it very much!  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed since the formula is pretty rich</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most softly shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>the nurse told me I had to wear a hair net and commented on how nice of hair I had.</li>
            <li>I tired this and wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I have never spent more that $6.00 on a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo -- it is worth every dollar!</li>
            <li>I compared Amazon to salon prices of the shampoo and Amazon was by far more reasonable.</li>
            <li>I tried the shine stuff (green bottle) and this one is way better, more moisture.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but a lot of it, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like most moisturizing lines.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall exactly how I came across this product on Amazon</li>
            <li>A different stylist cut my hair and told me that I was lucky to have such nice hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference on my hair</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m that much of a fan of Alterna.  </li>
            <li>Not too much.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is gentle yet cleans my hair.  </li>
            <li>I think this is really comparable to Shiseido shampoos.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and tends to dry out easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time, and I notice a HUGE difference when using a non-inferior product.</li>
            <li>That is a major statement for me as I love to \\&quot;Flirt\\&quot; with hair products and makeup, never staying with one for long.</li>
            <li>I am on my 7th tappering run of high dose steroids and antibiotics</li>
            <li>After seeing high reviews, I decided to try the Caviar Seasilk Moist Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The discount isn&#x27;t worth it--will buy this locally from now on.</li>
            <li>It also smells great too and you only need a very small amount!</li>
            <li>Naturally, dealing with my hair on a daily basis is a huge hassle, and I have tried numerous shampoos over the course of my life in order to ease the stress of dealing with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I keep my hair pretty short during the summer.</li>
            <li>The Alterna Caviar Seasilk Moist Shampoo provides large amounts of lather so only a mount is required per use.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has made my hair feel like I just got a professional deep-conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have extension in my hair and it makes the hair soft and shiny. ..</li>
            <li>She said it makes her hair so soft that it falls out of the ponytail.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves my hair soft and manageable .  </li>
            <li>The texture of my hair is seriously worth every penny spent, it&#x27;s ridiculously soft and shiny even when I&#x27;m way overdue for a haircut it keeps my split ends to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Hey, the weather is pretty dry here in the Southwest</li>
            <li>Granted, it is more expensive but well worth the investment for my hair&#x27;s health and general outlook on life.  </li>
            <li>Because it becomes heavy, the hair will also be a bit weighed-down, especially if you have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have found with other moisturizing shampoos they don&#x27;t lather very much</li>
            <li>And btw, it&#x27;s about $9 less right here on my favoite store of all time...</li>
            <li>but my hair quickly reverted back to a dull frizz ball, barely recognizable as human hair.  </li>
            <li>Apparently co-workers noticed as one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 55 year old male.</li>
            <li>One of the few shampoos that is definitely worth every penny and does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>When I let my hair get longer, not very long though, it gets wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> One of the few shampoos that is definitely worth every penny and does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> When I let my hair get longer, not very long though, it gets wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was getting some minor hand surgery done last week.</li>
            <li> Conserve it as long as you can by using a product that has only the finest ingredients and no sulfur&#x27;s or parabans</li>
            <li> The expense is also overcome as I don&#x27;t need to use nearly the quantity of shampoo as previously.  </li>
            <li> After only one washing my hair has never been so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I mean really...</li>
            <li> have dry, relaxed hair</li>
            <li> but I just use Alterna dry shampoo on those days.  </li>
            <li> Recommend to everyone, you only use very little and this will last for months.</li>
            <li> Reading multiple shampoo reviews I was anxious to experiment further before the brillo pad on my head worsened.  </li>
            <li> Several shampoo brands were immediately ruled out due to my allergies/asthma as their natural products would only make my respiratory status even worse (Bumble and Bumble, Purelogy, Aveda etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my hair can look a little greasy the second day</li>
            <li> This has been a stressful year with ill health, multiple high dose runs of prednisone, antibiotics etc.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is expensive, but you use less and it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Alterna shampoos (when the anti-aging was out of stock)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an every other day washer</li>

            <li> This has been a stressful year with ill health, multiple high dose runs of prednisone, antibiotics etc.  Already color treated my hair became extremely dull and dry, a reflection of all my body has been enduring.  I switched from Redken to Fekkai but my hair quickly reverted back to a dull frizz ball, barely recognizable as human hair.  Reading multiple shampoo reviews I was anxious to experiment further before the brillo pad on my head worsened.  Several shampoo brands were immediately ruled out due to my allergies/asthma as their natural products would only make my respiratory status even worse (Bumble and Bumble, Purelogy, Aveda etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fingers crossed I tried Alterna Caviar Seasilk Shampoo.  It was as if my hair had dialed \\&quot;911\\&quot; and this shampoo answered the distress call.  I cannot believe what a difference it has made!  Granted, it is more expensive but well worth the investment for my hair&#x27;s health and general outlook on life.  The expense is also overcome as I don&#x27;t need to use nearly the quantity of shampoo as previously.  I compared Amazon to salon prices of the shampoo and Amazon was by far more reasonable. I also purchased the conditioner, another great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! This has been the one of my best purchases from Amazon this year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 10-04-10:  This has been a Godsend!  I just ordered the larger size as I continue to use it.  That is a major statement for me as I love to \\&quot;Flirt\\&quot; with hair products and makeup, never staying with one for long. (Check out my reviews if you don&#x27;t believe me.)  I am on my 7th tappering run of high dose steroids and antibiotics this year, it is crippling to my emotional health, feeling of well being not to mention the effects on my body.  This is the only shampoo that made my hair feel like hair again and not straw.  Apparently co-workers noticed as one just ordered the shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used!  I don&#x27;t like always having to use a conditioner so this is great.  My hair is very soft and shiny and it seems to give my hair more volume too which I love! It also smells great too and you only need a very small amount! I have found with other moisturizing shampoos they don&#x27;t lather very much and I hate that.  Not with this one, you get the best of everything.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, wavy hair.  Naturally, dealing with my hair on a daily basis is a huge hassle, and I have tried numerous shampoos over the course of my life in order to ease the stress of dealing with my hair.  I began to believe that all shampoo was the same and that \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; shampoos were just a gimmick.  After seeing high reviews, I decided to try the Caviar Seasilk Moist Shampoo.  I am SO happy that I decided to try it.  It is truly the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried ~50 different salon and non-salon brands of shampoo over the years.  The shampoo has made my hair feel like I just got a professional deep-conditioning treatment.  Instead of my hair becoming puffy and frizzy after blowdrying it, my hair is silky, smooth, and most of the un-wanted volume has disappeared.  I highly recommend this shampoo -- it is worth every dollar!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the girls... now am using it myself. Hey, the weather is pretty dry here in the Southwest and I need to treat my hair as well as I can before it all falls out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I use a small amount on my daughters hair every night and can notice a difference. Highly recommend it. The bottle cap is odd, and it took a couple tries to just get a small dab. A little pressue and a lot of shampoo comes out. Squeeze with caution.</li>
            <li> Great Product tons of volume! Recommend to everyone, you only use very little and this will last for months. I usually shampoo every 2nd day this will hold well over every third day and still hold your style. ; )</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best shampoo out there- once I tried it, I never went back- even after a year of use! I had used Kerastase for a long time along with other as expensive or more expensive brands like Phyto and Fekkai. My hair is very thick, color-treated, and coarse; I typically have to use a lot of shampoo as my coarse hair soaks in product. Immediately when I tried this my hair felt so great - even in the shower. I find that my hair is very shiny, feels so healthy, and I don&#x27;t have to use a ton of shampoo to get it clean. I definitely recommend this. I follow up with the same Alterna anti-aging conditioner. I have tried other Alterna shampoos (when the anti-aging was out of stock) but I didn&#x27;t like it as well as this one. I would say that this shampoo, conditioner + moroccanoil is all I need for my hair.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing shampoo!  Very good product for dry hair, need 10 more words in order to submit, I think I have it.</li>
            <li> After only one washing my hair has never been so dry and frizzy. And I&#x27;ve never had a sulfate-free shampoo lather to this extent; I could tell something was wrong as soon as I rinsed my hair. I&#x27;ve used Alterna before and I think this item is a counterfeit, as others have complained of as well. Will try to return. The discount isn&#x27;t worth it--will buy this locally from now on.</li>
            <li> I love alterna. I have fine hair so I need something that gives me more volume.  This shampoo would be great for thicker hair that needs moisture.</li>
            <li> Love it it is amazing hair product... I have extension in my hair and it makes the hair soft and shiny. ..</li>
            <li> This shampoo is sort of expensive but after one use of it, I got terrible dandruff on my head! Absolutely hate it!</li>
            <li> Did not work well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, relaxed hair and this did nothing to help it become softer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference on my hair</li>
            <li> Very good!   It&#x27;s the most softly shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  I like it very much!  Perhaps,I&#x27;ll be a regular for it.</li>
            <li> best shampoo and conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My hair is curly and tends to dry out easily.  My hairdresser recommended I try this shampoo (and conditioner) and I&#x27;ve been using it since.  I liked it so much I gave a travel size kit to my mother-in-law for her birthday.  She said it makes her hair so soft that it falls out of the ponytail. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alterna Caviar Shampoo and Conditioner for 4 years now and it has yet to disappoint.  I&#x27;m an every other day washer and I have noticed since the formula is pretty rich, my hair can look a little greasy the second day but I just use Alterna dry shampoo on those days.  Yes, I&#x27;m that much of a fan of Alterna.  The smell is nice and light, easily unisex.  My hair is fine but a lot of it, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like most moisturizing lines.  The texture of my hair is seriously worth every penny spent, it&#x27;s ridiculously soft and shiny even when I&#x27;m way overdue for a haircut it keeps my split ends to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I like this line&#x27;s fragrance. Whatever it is, it smells like a great clean, fresh fragrance. Not too much. I wish it were a body spray! The caviar stuff works well on my hair. I tried the shine stuff (green bottle) and this one is way better, more moisture. I would continue to use this. It made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> Love the Altern Caviar hair products.  This shampoo is gentle yet cleans my hair.  Most shampoo strips the color from my  hair but using the Alterna Caviar Seasilt Moist Shampoo my color lasts the full six weeks.  I love these products and the prices on line are much less that the salon pricess.</li>
            <li> I love the lather and thorough cleansing this has on my hair.  Does not strip my color at all and softens my coarse strands.  The smell is nice and it rinses out clean.  One of the few shampoos that is definitely worth every penny and does what it says it does.  A must-have shampoo that I need to keep in stock in my shower at all times!</li>
            <li> If you want reviews of the products,you should allow people to choose how many words they want to use..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft and manageable .  It smells good too!</li>
            <li> The Alterna Caviar Seasilk Moist Shampoo provides large amounts of lather so only a mount is required per use. It&#x27;s a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> The absolute best shampoo I have ever used.  I actually bought the larger size after using this for a week &amp; seeing a drastic difference in my hair. Constantly getting compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> The makers of this shampoo think that people cannot read the ingredients list: Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate.&lt;br /&gt;These are all sulfate derivatives.&lt;br /&gt;This IS a sulfate-based shampoo, just like any other shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> I think this is really comparable to Shiseido shampoos. Both smell very nice and lather up richly, and they also leave hair shiny and silky. However, they contain oils that cling to the hair and eventually leave the follicle brittle and dull. Because it becomes heavy, the hair will also be a bit weighed-down, especially if you have baby fine hair. I use this for up to a week at a time, and then I switch to a lighter shampoo or a clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a luxurious shampoo though, for sure.</li>
            <li> I tired having a Keratin treatment once.  It taught me about why I wanted sulfate free shampoo.  This shampoo is expensive, but you use less and it&#x27;s worth it.  Even without the keratin treatment, this sulfate free shampoo (I&#x27;ve tried other brands) tames my hair the best!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used. Although it&#x27;s very expensive, this is well worth the price. The shampoo leaves hair that has broken/split ends smooth again, and it makes hair silky just after a couple of rinses. This shampoo also helps get rid of dandruff, because I think it probably has a lot of nutrients healthy for hair cells. It doesn&#x27;t leave those &amp;#34;acidic/base?&amp;#34; feel that many shampoo brands use, so I really recommend this product if budget allows for a special treat.</li>
            <li> I have a fine and dry hair, Alterna Caviar Seasilk Shampoo is really good moisturizer with nice smell. I like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 55 year old male. I have never spent more that $6.00 on a shampoo. I don&#x27;t recall exactly how I came across this product on Amazon but I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I was just in one of those moods to try something expensive and find out why shampoo could cost so much. Besides, I thought the bottle was cool looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: My hair has never felt this good before. It looks better too. I keep my hair pretty short during the summer. When I let my hair get longer, not very long though, it gets wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting some minor hand surgery done last week. While I was in pre-op the nurse told me I had to wear a hair net and commented on how nice of hair I had. Earlier this week I went to get a haircut. A different stylist cut my hair and told me that I was lucky to have such nice hair. I&#x27;ve never gotten comments on the quality of my hair before, only on the cut.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. Especially after paying over $20 for it!!  But geez, the smell is just awful.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I tired this and wasn&#x27;t impressed. I read so many good reviews and I didn&#x27;t see that this help my hair at all.  I have chemically treated wavy hair so I am always looking for a good moisturizing shampoo.  The one I found that works better is Morrocanoil.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair products on the market, i&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for years and this product is amazing.  But you do not need much, and the fact that it is sulfate/paraben free etc is a plus!</li>
            <li> because was good service&lt;br /&gt;the service fast with no problems , and the product is good that&#x27;s whay is my rate</li>
            <li> I love this product. I mean really... it&#x27;s your HAIR people. Do you really want to put nasty chemicals from grocery store shampoo into something that you may or may not have for the rest of your life- aka YOUR HAIR. Conserve it as long as you can by using a product that has only the finest ingredients and no sulfur&#x27;s or parabans (god I sound like a commercial).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time, and I notice a HUGE difference when using a non-inferior product. It&#x27;s worth every penny! And btw, it&#x27;s about $9 less right here on my favoite store of all time... AMAZON!</li>
