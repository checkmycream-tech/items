            <li>For the price, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>To the vendor - honestly if you see something like this, why resell it!</li>
            <li>spectacular results!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>i would still recommend it and the price is good.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Nice product, good amount for the price, has no scent so doesn&#x27;t interfere.  </li>
            <li>whatever kind of moisturizer I wanted to use that day.  </li>
            <li>Also, the serum smells very strong &amp; synthetic.  </li>
            <li>The oil is just a much more effective product for brightening, clearing skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very light weight</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know if this helps a great deal or not</li>
            <li>and glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Great serum w/ vitamin E, which is good for the skin; use a combination of Palmers facial products.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve come to appreciate this serum more with continued use.</li>
            <li>Just give them some time :)</li>
            <li>love  this product and all of  palmer&#x27;s product</li>
            <li>i love all palmers products cuz i feel a difference in the softness and smoothness in my skin</li>
            <li>: It smells pretty good, floral-like.</li>
            <li>Good price, and worked as well or better than the high priced ones on the market.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles or fine lines.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really impressed with both of them, and in no small part because of the cost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of palmers brand.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, i have have been using the whole line</li>
            <li>i live in a very humid climate and they still work great.</li>
            <li>but I love the way it goes on and is absorbed quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>After 4 or 5 weeks of continued use, I came to realize that it really did make a difference in the my skin (minimimal pores and more even skin</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference since using this, but I love the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>I have noticed quite a difference in tone and acne scars fading really quickly.  </li>
            <li>Although my initial impression wasn&#x27;t particularly enthusiastic (4 rather than 5 stars)</li>
            <li>The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try it, as I am an avid user of all Palmer products.</li>
            <li>I like the way it is light and not heavy.</li>
            <li>you want to experiment with a serum, by all means try this one along with the rest of the Palmer&#x27;s system; these products are excellent without being pretentiously expensive.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone looking to reduce the appearance of their scars, it really works!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t make your face feel sticky or like too much is on it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want all that oil</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s more of one than the other that&#x27;s doing the job, or the combination of the products.  </li>
            <li>Very light, has a slight tightening effect.  </li>
            <li>The serum is very drying to the skin which surprises me because all the other products provide adequate moisture.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I could almost go outside without makeup for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>However I didn&#x27;t care too much for the facial serum.</li>
            <li>I use twice daily under my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I had tried the oil-based version of the formula with a sample and was amazed at how clear my skin became and how much acne (and shingles) scars became less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Terrific serum, notice the tightening effect immediately and the ingredients are working, I can see the fine lines getting less and less.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I prefer the oil to the serum, but I use both.  The oil is just a much more effective product for brightening, clearing skin.  Also, the serum smells very strong &amp; synthetic.  However...the serum doesn&#x27;t leave a shine, so I it when I&#x27;m in a hurry &amp; don&#x27;t have time for the oil to absorb.</li>
            <li> leaves a weird skin on your face. I&#x27;ll stick to Keihls.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know if this helps a great deal or not but I love the way it goes on and is absorbed quickly into the skin.  I use twice daily under my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Good price, and worked as well or better than the high priced ones on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it, as I am an avid user of all Palmer products.When I received it - it had some disgusting goop in it and the packaging was just terrible - as if someone else bought it, used it and returned it.

            <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My scars have not lessened yet, however they are deep so I will continue to use and see the long term results. I like the way it is light and not heavy. It does seem to improve the overall look of my skin.</li>
            <li> The serum is very drying to the skin which surprises me because all the other products provide adequate moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of palmers brand. However I didn&#x27;t care too much for the facial serum. I never tried it before so I figured I&#x27;ll give it a try. It is very light weight and you can wear it under make up along with lotion. Won&#x27;t make your face feel sticky or like too much is on it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference and for the price in not sold I it. I&#x27;m only 30 so I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles or fine lines. But I do have a few around my eye area. I don&#x27;t think I will buy this product again but I&#x27;ll definetly stick to they&#x27;re other products.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS AWFUL AND IT IS NOT WORTH THE RESULTS!  THE SMELL GAGS ME! I DO NOT ADVISE THIS.</li>
            <li> I had tried the oil-based version of the formula with a sample and was amazed at how clear my skin became and how much acne (and shingles) scars became less noticeable.  I could almost go outside without makeup for the first time in years.  I didn&#x27;t really want all that oil though so I decided to get the serum and layer over it whatever kind of moisturizer I wanted to use that day.  It works as well as the oil.  I also found it reduces the appearance of various skin lesions like tags.  They dry up and shrink.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face!</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot and glad I tried it. I wear under and over morning face cream. It seems to hydrate well.</li>
            <li> Great serum w/ vitamin E, which is good for the skin; use a combination of Palmers facial products. spectacular results!</li>
            <li> Although my initial impression wasn&#x27;t particularly enthusiastic (4 rather than 5 stars), I&#x27;ve come to appreciate this serum more with continued use. I&#x27;ve ordered it a second time and am adjusting my review accordingly. It&#x27;s really good. After 4 or 5 weeks of continued use, I came to realize that it really did make a difference in the my skin (minimimal pores and more even skin tone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to experiment with a serum, by all means try this one along with the rest of the Palmer&#x27;s system; these products are excellent without being pretentiously expensive. Just give them some time :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it works wonders on my acne scars. I recommend it to anyone looking to reduce the appearance of their scars, it really works!</li>
            <li> Nice product, good amount for the price, has no scent so doesn&#x27;t interfere.  Using day and night with great results.</li>
            <li> I had no idea Palmer&#x27;s made this serum, stumbled across it here on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  Wow!  I have noticed quite a difference in tone and acne scars fading really quickly.  My pores are also less noticeable.  All this after only about a week.  I also started using the Palmer&#x27;s Night Renewal Cream at the same time, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s more of one than the other that&#x27;s doing the job, or the combination of the products.  So far I&#x27;m really impressed with both of them, and in no small part because of the cost.  Quite a bargain with the results I&#x27;m seeing. (I&#x27;m 53).</li>
            <li> Very light, has a slight tightening effect.  I have VERY sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.  For the price, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> love  this product and all of  palmer&#x27;s product</li>
            <li> i love all palmers products cuz i feel a difference in the softness and smoothness in my skin and they never break me out. i live in a very humid climate and they still work great. this serum makes my skin feel tighter and my pores smaller without giving it a dried out feel, a little goes a long way.  i will say that i havent seen improvement in wrinkles but i dont use twice a day and i havent been using it for that long. i would still recommend it and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Terrific serum, notice the tightening effect immediately and the ingredients are working, I can see the fine lines getting less and less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Palmer&#x27;s Scar Serum a while ago and absolutely LOVED it! I bought this product hoping that it would have similar effects in helping reduce the appearance of acne scarring. I have been using this product faithfully (everyday) for about a month and a half, and I still have yet to notice a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It smells pretty good, floral-like. It also dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The product squirts from the pump and goes everywhere. It hasn&#x27;t done anything for me thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use it and maybe start applying it in the morning and at night to see if I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, i have have been using the whole line and i have seen rapid improvement on my face within just a couple of days. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference since using this, but I love the way it feels on my face.</li>
