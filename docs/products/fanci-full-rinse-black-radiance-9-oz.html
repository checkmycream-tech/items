            <li>and this would have been wonderful between touchups</li>
            <li>Fanci-Full works great.  </li>
            <li>Great product from a great company.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t quite work for me, but I bet it would work great if I just used it on the roots (like they recommend)</li>
            <li>This product is great hair color.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>This product seemed to have good reviews</li>
            <li>So it did the job, it did a good job of it&#x27;s job, but it was a nightmare to get in.</li>
            <li>, I guess that was a fair deal.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, very attractive package, available in local stores.</li>
            <li>I use a shade darker because coverage is better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s more of a hair shader than a hair color.</li>
            <li>It is ok for what I want.just have to ues it 3times a week.</li>
            <li>and if I had more practice applying it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the look.</li>
            <li>I literally noticed no difference after putting it on my clean roots and blow drying it in.</li>
            <li>Top quality, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>May need to wash the towels a couple more times before they are completely clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t last more than 4 hours before original color is visible.</li>
            <li>It takes more product to get the same results.</li>
            <li>We had to redo my make up after the first time because the die dripped on my face and messed it up.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions, applied considerably more and my hair is still the exact same brown colour, not even darker brown.</li>
            <li>Washed out (what was left of it) very cleanly and didn&#x27;t stain the shower.</li>
            <li>It was easy to wash out too, and it was easy to wipe away the mess.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon,  wjh0329</li>
            <li>, I used nearly a whole bottle just to dye my.  </li>
            <li>The stuff is VERY runny.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Used to dye my dark blonde hair black, didn&#x27;t do the best of jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t think my thick hair would go under a wig well enough unless we got custom made and no one was willing to spend that kind of money.</li>
            <li>, it was cheap and wouldn&#x27;t last to long</li>
            <li>It does not blend well with black hair, but it is a smooth conditioner.</li>
            <li>It did the job,but it made a HUGE mess, dripping from our fingers and even my hair from time to time.</li>
            <li>Okay, so this did the job, but it was hard to make it do the job.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the shipping charges were a too much for this item.</li>
            <li>I opted for standard shipping which was still plenty fast.    </li>
            <li>I dye my naturally auburn hair</li>
            <li>I would not waste your money.</li>
            <li>so I could have my normal hair back soon after trying it.  </li>
            <li>After trying it for the first time there was absolutely no difference in my hair colour.</li>
            <li>I would never buy this again and do not recommend it unless you have a lot of time to spend cleaning your bathroom after you&#x27;ve spent way to much time trying to get it to stay in your hair.</li>

            <li> I dye my naturally auburn hair</li>
            <li> I would not waste your money.</li>
            <li> so I could have my normal hair back soon after trying it.  </li>
            <li> After trying it for the first time there was absolutely no difference in my hair colour.</li>
            <li> I would never buy this again and do not recommend it unless you have a lot of time to spend cleaning your bathroom after you&#x27;ve spent way to much time trying to get it to stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fully color hair but does diminish appearance of grey grow out.</li>
            <li> It just took so long because it got EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> Took us a very long time.</li>
            <li> It seemed very wet and the mess made me less than relaxed getting ready.</li>
            <li> Had to do a full fake make up.</li>
            <li> So, it does the trick, if you don&#x27;t mind spending a long time on it and dealing with dripping wet die.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed, or it will over-condition and leave the hair flat.</li>
            <li> but it was extremely thin and not pigmented very well either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so wet, that when I flipped my hair to do the under side, the drips of it got on the ceiling.</li>
            <li> I think because my hair was too wet when I applied the dye.</li>
            <li> I have a long dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Though I personally would have rather spent a few bucks and saved us the hassle.</li>
            <li> I bought the black radiance as I have black hair but grey at the front.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using the browns for really dark hair as they don&#x27;t blend that well, and seem to leave a greenish hue on the hair.    </li>
            <li> Might even have hit even with how much face make up we had to reapply when it dripped, and that stuff was expensive.</li>
            <li> Black Rage is difficult to find, but Amazon had it in stock, shipped it fast</li>
            <li> The black blends in well with dark hair and leaves a salt and pepper appearance.  </li>
            <li> black</li>
            <li> and my hands are still dyed black...</li>
            <li> Almost like black water.</li>
            <li> It did not make my brown hair black.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I was using this to dye all my hair black for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would make my hair temporarily black.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick dark brown hair, that for this show, had to be black.</li>
            <li> I cant&#x27; give it less than three stars because once it was in and dry, it turned this thick head of brown hair pitch black.</li>
            <li> brand is not available for black hair.</li>
            <li> so I received it within a few days.  </li>
            <li> It is sloppy and wet</li>
            <li> It was not useful for total coverage of grey.&lt;br /&gt;Was very disappointed as I thought it would totally cover them when I use it in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I mean, for the price it was when we got it</li>
            <li> Maybe we did something wrong, but after a week of this stuff, we all vowed never to use it again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product just doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> Even one a month would drive me mad.</li>
            <li> Hate to color my hair too often, so I use this rinse in between and now in an effort to &amp;#34;grow out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> awful runny filth.</li>

            <li> My Mom&#x27;s been using it for years and she loves it! The only thing is that the shipping charges were a too much for this item.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair black.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel satisfy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair color is the now the same.</li>
            <li> Fanci-Full works great.  The black blends in well with dark hair and leaves a salt and pepper appearance.  I don&#x27;t recommend using the browns for really dark hair as they don&#x27;t blend that well, and seem to leave a greenish hue on the hair.

            <li> This was a miss. I dye my naturally auburn hair black and this would have been wonderful between touchups but it was extremely thin and not pigmented very well either. I literally noticed no difference after putting it on my clean roots and blow drying it in. I would not waste your money. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for several years and it seemed like the bottles I got this time were &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;.  It takes more product to get the same results.</li>
            <li> I have brown hair and all this did was make my hair shinier. It didn&#x27;t change the color at all.</li>
            <li> Hate to color my hair too often, so I use this rinse in between and now in an effort to &amp;#34;grow out&amp;#34; my color.  I use a shade darker because coverage is better.  It doesn&#x27;t fully color hair but does diminish appearance of grey grow out.</li>
            <li> Real Big! Nice product.</li>

            <li> This product seemed to have good reviews so I decided why not try it for myself, it was cheap and wouldn&#x27;t last to long so I could have my normal hair back soon after trying it.  Yeah...... I managed to cover my entire bathroom with it and my hands are still dyed black... It is sloppy and wet, I used nearly a whole bottle just to dye my.  I would never buy this again and do not recommend it unless you have a lot of time to spend cleaning your bathroom after you&#x27;ve spent way to much time trying to get it to stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> Top quality, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> je suis très satisfait du produit.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this did the job, but it was hard to make it do the job. I have very long, thick dark brown hair, that for this show, had to be black. We didn&#x27;t think my thick hair would go under a wig well enough unless we got custom made and no one was willing to spend that kind of money. So we went with this path. So after I finally got my hair damp we got to work. The stuff is VERY runny. Almost like black water. I wondered if I was supposed to use it like shampoo. It did the job,but it made a HUGE mess, dripping from our fingers and even my hair from time to time. Maybe we did something wrong, but after a week of this stuff, we all vowed never to use it again. It did the job. I cant&#x27; give it less than three stars because once it was in and dry, it turned this thick head of brown hair pitch black. It was easy to wash out too, and it was easy to wipe away the mess. It just took so long because it got EVERYWHERE. It&#x27;s so wet, that when I flipped my hair to do the under side, the drips of it got on the ceiling. So it did the job, it did a good job of it&#x27;s job, but it was a nightmare to get in. Took us a very long time. We had to redo my make up after the first time because the die dripped on my face and messed it up. Had to do a full fake make up. So, it does the trick, if you don&#x27;t mind spending a long time on it and dealing with dripping wet die. I mean, for the price it was when we got it, I guess that was a fair deal. Though I personally would have rather spent a few bucks and saved us the hassle. Might even have hit even with how much face make up we had to reapply when it dripped, and that stuff was expensive. Bottom line, it works, just is a nightmare to get in. I WOULD NOT want to do this every day or anything like that. Even one a month would drive me mad.</li>
            <li> It is ok for what I want.just have to ues it 3times a week.Some time my head burn.Don&#x27;t know if this the cause.Enjoy the look.Still going through a trail moment with it. plus have to apply 3 times to hold in one setting !!</li>
            <li> awful runny filth. doesn&#x27;t last more than 4 hours before original color is visible.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Halloween.  It did not make my brown hair black.  It seemed very wet and the mess made me less than relaxed getting ready.</li>
            <li> Granted, I was using this to dye all my hair black for a Halloween costume. I think because my hair was too wet when I applied the dye. It was coming off on my hands when I styled my hair, probably again because I wasn&#x27;t using it as intended. Washed out (what was left of it) very cleanly and didn&#x27;t stain the shower. May need to wash the towels a couple more times before they are completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t quite work for me, but I bet it would work great if I just used it on the roots (like they recommend) and if I had more practice applying it.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, very attractive package, available in local stores. It does not blend well with black hair, but it is a smooth conditioner. Only a small amount is needed, or it will over-condition and leave the hair flat. Recommended for all shades of brown, it is temporary color that lasts only until the next shampoo. It has no ammonia or peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is not available for black hair.</li>
            <li> This product is great hair color.  Worked great for me.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought the black radiance as I have black hair but grey at the front. It was not useful for total coverage of grey.&lt;br /&gt;Was very disappointed as I thought it would totally cover them when I use it in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would make my hair temporarily black. Unfortunately, this product just doesn&#x27;t seem to work. I have a long dark brown hair. After trying it for the first time there was absolutely no difference in my hair colour. I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough so I tried again. Followed the instructions, applied considerably more and my hair is still the exact same brown colour, not even darker brown.</li>
