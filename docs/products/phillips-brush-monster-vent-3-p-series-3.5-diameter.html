            <li>Then it makes it so fly away frizzy</li>
            <li>it makes a great head massage-</li>
            <li>Would be great for longer hair (mine is shoulder length).</li>
            <li>Great product and extremely good service from company who provided it.</li>
            <li>Has nice sturdy bristles and great massaging tool for your scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair never looks this good, when I do it myself, at home?  </li>
            <li>This is a good product for my monster&#x27;s fur; he is always getting into the mud and into windy situations, and taming his locks has just been a nightmare.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find my favorite hair brush.</li>
            <li>I can, honestly, say that I&#x27;ve achieved the salon look, by using this brush (and, a good quality leave-in conditioner).</li>
            <li>Nice brush, great size, removes static out  as it made from wood.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>all love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Would have liked to return.</li>
            <li>It pulls through my hair nicely and gives it lots of volume.  </li>
            <li>This brush is also lightweight, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I love love love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>love the item and the service,,, thank you</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if all the great reviews on this brush are real or if I have an imposter Phillips Monster Brush</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I ordered an Olivia Garden NanoThermic Ceramic - ion brush at the same time (which is absolutely so wonderful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t be returned either since I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;used/tried</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brush; however, my kitty knocked it over and the top part broke.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still very usable and is great while blowdrying my hair.</li>
            <li>I really love how the brush feels on my scalp-</li>
            <li>I actually love how it easy brushes through my hair-</li>
            <li>I really like it because it has a good handle</li>
            <li>My Olivia Garden brushes are still going strong, but they don&#x27;t do the conditioning trick of boar bristles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable in my hand and easy for me to maneuver.</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST round brush.</li>
            <li>Works great with a blow dry to give volume and straightened your hair.</li>
            <li>Also, when I gently clean it, the sink is full of boar bristles afterwards.  </li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth with just the right bend.  </li>
            <li>The bristles bend and break really quick</li>
            <li>and that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strong and substantial, and it seems very durable.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light to hold, and it has a bit of rubber around the handle near the bristles which help to turn it this way</li>
            <li>I have noticed I can wait a little longer after washing my hair to begin drying it, and it still looks great.  </li>
            <li>The brush is amazing- just too big.</li>
            <li>My 6 yr old LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It smooths my wavy hair and runs right through it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and tames my wild curls</li>
            <li>The barrel also doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how big it was from the photo online.</li>
            <li>I think that for my hair length I would have ordered a smaller diameter but as my hair grows, the brush is working much better.</li>
            <li>This brush is only okay.  </li>
            <li>Hair is voluminous big waves and shiny smooth!</li>
            <li>I had a denser one before, which was better, but this one definitely works very well.</li>
            <li>I have not seen a curling iron this large, so I bought the brush to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I had ordered this brush years ago.</li>
            <li>Well made and really smooths the hair?</li>
            <li>My hair had more volume, it dried faster and looked better overall.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even imagine blow drying my whole head with this and what I would look like in the end.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and pack it carefully. :-)</li>
            <li>Really good for thick hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too big and the main important thing si</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s difficult to clean, but feels good going through the hair while it lasts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a smaller circumference brush by the same manufacturer for a very long time, and it is still in excellent shape and used daily.</li>
            <li>Now that I have this brush I am able to blow out my coarse way hair without using a flat iron afterwards to make it smooth and straight (as long as I throw in some texturizer first).  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m particular how my brushes feel.</li>
            <li>I have super coarse and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite round brush.  </li>
            <li>and now I need to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this brush to blow dry my bangs with a very large curl to them.</li>
            <li>My hair is also extremely soft and shiny after I use it.</li>
            <li>(I have a sensitive head).  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair, this was a good brush but way to hard to handle pulling through my hair, if you have thin hair maybe it would be good for you</li>
            <li>so you can really grip it when you blow dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair is fine, but thick, and goes to my waist.  </li>
            <li>I do however find the handle to be a bit too slippery when my hands are wet, as my monster squirms and fusses as I&#x27;m drying his hair, so firmly gripping the brush is occasionally difficult while also trying to calm the beast.</li>
            <li>so my hair isn&#x27;t crazy hot, feel like that&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li>This product has certainly met my expectations so far, and although I only purchased it in January, I expect it to last a very long</li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle on my hair which has damage due to coloring.  </li>
            <li>I see myself replacing it soon, but I&#x27;m a fanatic about clean brushes.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Phillips Monster Vent brush and it really is so good that I find it difficult to blow dry my hair with anything else.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush, but after a plane trip last week, it got broken-</li>
            <li>It takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair and did I mention that it leaves me with soft, shiny, salon like hair everytime!</li>
            <li>Really cuts down drying time and and straightens my waves.</li>

            <li> Really cuts down drying time and and straightens my waves.</li>
            <li> First of all I can hardly get this brush through my fine hair and I blow dry my hair in thin pieces  using clips to clip the rest of my hair back.  </li>
            <li> that I have to use another brush to smooth it down and the little frizzies down with spray!  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, layered and length is near middle back.</li>
            <li> I use other to style and this only when hair is product-free.</li>
            <li> dry--  </li>
            <li> It was probably due to baggage handlers or TSA not being careful with my bag, but I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 months</li>
            <li> Firm wooden handle and smoothing bristles that don&#x27;t snag your hair,</li>
            <li> I would have give 5 stars but the handle is so big it is hard to handle.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of really fine hair, and this brush makes blowdrying it less annoying.  </li>
            <li> I use 5 round brushes as I blow out my hair and let them set at the crown.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a straightening iron before styling with a rubber round brush and blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> It has hardly shed any bristles either compared to other brushes I have had.</li>
            <li> My hand gets tired holding it to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> So I have a hard time keeping my hair tangle-free without hurting my head</li>
            <li> I hardly have to use my straightener if I use this brush.</li>
            <li> One complaint is that when your hands a greased from hair products</li>
            <li> I have been using a random ceramic round brush for years.</li>
            <li> The weight of the head compared to the handle does not weigh eachother out, making it difficult to hold and not have it fall out of your hand.  </li>
            <li> Although this brush wasn&#x27;t very expensive, $14.50 IS expensive when you can&#x27;t even use it!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very expensive, so hey...</li>
            <li> I never write bad reviews</li>
            <li> Then I use this brush to do my bangs and base.  </li>
            <li> but this brush is horrible.  </li>

            <li> Perfect for Blowouts. Easy to use and tames my wild curls</li>
            <li> I really wish I had ordered this brush years ago. I have been using a random ceramic round brush for years. Now that I have this brush I am able to blow out my coarse way hair without using a flat iron afterwards to make it smooth and straight (as long as I throw in some texturizer first).  My hair is also extremely soft and shiny after I use it. This brush saves me a lot of time and hassle. I will be ordering a couple of these as Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. It smooths my wavy hair and runs right through it. Ive had no issue with snagging or tangling. I use it for my blow outs.</li>
            <li> Way too big for my hair. Would have liked to return. Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It straighten well without grabbing hair at lower part of the barrel.  The barrel also doesn&#x27;t get too hot so my hair isn&#x27;t crazy hot, feel like that&#x27;s better.  Gives lots of volume!  This barrel width is best for shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> It suits its purpose.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find the perfect brush for my type of hair, but no luck yet</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how big it was from the photo online. It&#x27;s way too big and the main important thing si the bristles are rather short.  I have to return this.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product!</li>
            <li> This will give you bouncy shiny just got my hair done at a salon blowouts.  Amazing. Agree it is best for shoulder length hair.  Really good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect in every way - for me. I have a lot of hair and worried this one wouldn&#x27;t grab hold - it does.&lt;br /&gt;It also feels great in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;All in all - feels like it was made for me!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite round brush.  I use 5 round brushes as I blow out my hair and let them set at the crown.  Then I use this brush to do my bangs and base.  My hair is silky smooth with just the right bend.  My hair is thick, layered and length is near middle back.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, great size, removes static out  as it made from wood. Has nice sturdy bristles and great massaging tool for your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, this was a good brush but way to hard to handle pulling through my hair, if you have thin hair maybe it would be good for you</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find my favorite hair brush. There is nothing else like this brush on the market.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Phillips Monster Vent brush and it really is so good that I find it difficult to blow dry my hair with anything else.  I had tried lots of similar products but this is the only one that tames my frizzy hair.  Great product and extremely good service from company who provided it.</li>
            <li> This brush is the sh*t. Absolutely amazing. One complaint is that when your hands a greased from hair products the wooden handle tends to slip.</li>
            <li> I got the combo plastic/boar bristles because my stylist told me it would help keep my hair smoother and it does!  My hair is easier to straighten and stays smoother even with humidity..</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush.  It pulls through my hair nicely and gives it lots of volume.  It has hardly shed any bristles either compared to other brushes I have had.</li>
            <li> Best brush. Well made and really smooths the hair? Firm wooden handle and smoothing bristles that don&#x27;t snag your hair,</li>
            <li> Bought this brush after my sister got it from a salon and I tried it out.  The combination bristles make all the difference.  My hair had more volume, it dried faster and looked better overall.  Great Brush very happy with it</li>
            <li> YES!!!!!!! looked everywhere... This is the BEST brush! I ordered Two and feel like I should stock up bc it seems things I covet are always discontinued .</li>
            <li> Have you ever walked out of the salon &amp; thought to yourself - My hair never looks this good, when I do it myself, at home?  I can, honestly, say that I&#x27;ve achieved the salon look, by using this brush (and, a good quality leave-in conditioner).</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I&#x27;ve used this brand for 8 years. Really cuts down drying time and and straightens my waves.</li>
            <li> One of my colleagues recommended this brush to me so I ordered it from Amazon.  I really like it because it has a good handle so you can really grip it when you blow dry your hair.  The bristles are gentle on my hair which has damage due to coloring.  I think that for my hair length I would have ordered a smaller diameter but as my hair grows, the brush is working much better.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for my monster&#x27;s fur; he is always getting into the mud and into windy situations, and taming his locks has just been a nightmare. I do however find the handle to be a bit too slippery when my hands are wet, as my monster squirms and fusses as I&#x27;m drying his hair, so firmly gripping the brush is occasionally difficult while also trying to calm the beast.</li>
            <li> Cuts my drying time; good brush!</li>
            <li> love the item and the service,,, thank you</li>
            <li> The bristles bend and break really quick, it&#x27;s difficult to clean, but feels good going through the hair while it lasts. I use other to style and this only when hair is product-free. Wish it weren&#x27;t wood, or were sealed wood, etc. I see myself replacing it soon, but I&#x27;m a fanatic about clean brushes. It wasn&#x27;t very expensive, so hey... My Olivia Garden brushes are still going strong, but they don&#x27;t do the conditioning trick of boar bristles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if all the great reviews on this brush are real or if I have an imposter Phillips Monster Brush but this brush is horrible.  I never write bad reviews but I just had to say something about this.  First of all I can hardly get this brush through my fine hair and I blow dry my hair in thin pieces  using clips to clip the rest of my hair back.  Then it makes it so fly away frizzy that I have to use another brush to smooth it down and the little frizzies down with spray!  I couldn&#x27;t even imagine blow drying my whole head with this and what I would look like in the end.  Thankfully, I ordered an Olivia Garden NanoThermic Ceramic - ion brush at the same time (which is absolutely so wonderful I&#x27;m going to order another one!).  Although this brush wasn&#x27;t very expensive, $14.50 IS expensive when you can&#x27;t even use it!  I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t be returned either since I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;used/tried it&amp;#34; through my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is only okay.  The weight of the head compared to the handle does not weigh eachother out, making it difficult to hold and not have it fall out of your hand.  Also, when I gently clean it, the sink is full of boar bristles afterwards.  I haven&#x27;t noticed this impacting the functionality of the bristles, though.</li>
            <li> This hair brush is great, the size of the brush is perfect for my shoulder length hair. It takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair and did I mention that it leaves me with soft, shiny, salon like hair everytime! The combination bristles works perfect!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush; however, my kitty knocked it over and the top part broke. It&#x27;s still very usable and is great while blowdrying my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to curl the tips of my hair under.  My hairdresser used it, so I thought I would give it a try.  It works well for those purposes.  I actually love how it easy brushes through my hair- my hair is fine, but thick, and goes to my waist.  So I have a hard time keeping my hair tangle-free without hurting my head (I have a sensitive head).  I really love how the brush feels on my scalp- it makes a great head massage- I&#x27;m licensed so I&#x27;m particular how my brushes feel. Overall, I love this brush!</li>
            <li> I have a ton of really fine hair, and this brush makes blowdrying it less annoying.  I have noticed I can wait a little longer after washing my hair to begin drying it, and it still looks great.  This brush is also lightweight, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I would have give 5 stars but the handle is so big it is hard to handle. My hand gets tired holding it to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great with a blow dry to give volume and straightened your hair. My 6 yr old LOVE it. Does not pull her hair even when she has a million knots. It&#x27;s the only brush she will let me use. A MUST BUY FOR ANY CHILD THAT HAS TONS OF KNOTS.</li>
            <li> I like that he ends are protected and don&#x27;t scratch my scalp. Works very well. I had a denser one before, which was better, but this one definitely works very well.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, but after a plane trip last week, it got broken- the wood itself was cracked and broke off.  It was probably due to baggage handlers or TSA not being careful with my bag, but I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 months and now I need to buy a new one.  Do yourself a favor and pack it carefully. :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to blow dry my bangs with a very large curl to them. I have not seen a curling iron this large, so I bought the brush to do the job.  It works great! It&#x27;s comfortable in my hand and easy for me to maneuver. It&#x27;s very light to hold, and it has a bit of rubber around the handle near the bristles which help to turn it this way and that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strong and substantial, and it seems very durable. I&#x27;ve had a smaller circumference brush by the same manufacturer for a very long time, and it is still in excellent shape and used daily. This product has certainly met my expectations so far, and although I only purchased it in January, I expect it to last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no affiliation with this company.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing- just too big. I thought it was smaller in diameter. Would be great for longer hair (mine is shoulder length).</li>
            <li> I have super coarse and frizzy hair. This is THE BEST round brush. I hardly have to use my straightener if I use this brush. It&#x27;s rad!</li>
            <li> I have the larger version of this brush,and I saw that you sold the smaller size.So I purchased one for each of my girls.&lt;br /&gt;We all love it!</li>
            <li> The best.  I used to use a straightening iron before styling with a rubber round brush and blow dryer.  Now I just use this brush and blow dry--  and no product needed.  Hair is voluminous big waves and shiny smooth!</li>
