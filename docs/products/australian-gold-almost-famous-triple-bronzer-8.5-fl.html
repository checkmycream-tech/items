            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I use this stuff regularly and never burn just tan perfectly!</li>
            <li>It TOO seems to have its own exfoliating properties, and leaves my skin feeling smooth, supple, and even firmer, just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>(my favorite for that is \\&quot;Body Kisses,\\</li>
            <li>At $150 a bottle, it was way more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found Almost Famous at a VERY affordable price now.</li>
            <li>I love it.this</li>
            <li>this is my favorite</li>
            <li>This bronzer worked okay in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Have used it many times  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to apply it evenly or you&#x27;ll be streaky, and wash your hands before tanning.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion...</li>
            <li>sticker over top.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion, here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do keep it on overnight, since it helps it soak in better.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product that I have used for several years.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It really helps to get a great tanning</li>
            <li>I do make sure to wipe my hands well, and blend it in with care, just in case, but it seems to be a high quality and good blend of bronzers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion itself smells pretty good, with a light and not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is sorta honey vanilla and is very mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be a vanilla, but it is so incredibly strong and overly sweet/rich.  </li>
            <li>it is still hands down the best bronzer of all the lotions I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Nice bronzer without the real bronzing odor.  </li>
            <li>The tube packaging is super easy to get lotion out of, even with slippery lotion</li>
            <li>First, I love this lotion for its aroma and moisturizing properties.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it gives you a natural bronzed  look :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Australian Gold almost famous triple bronzer also smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I never look orange, just nice and naturally tan!</li>
            <li>BUT, for best results, at least in my case, I&#x27;d recommend exfoliating/shaving beforehand, AND planning on keeping lotion on after tanning overnight.  </li>
            <li>&quot; but some may not like the sweet smell) leading up to your tanning day, which again you&#x27;ll want to exfoliate &amp; shave for but leave off any lotion except for this when you get to your session.  </li>
            <li>Gives a true color and doesn&#x27;t stain hands.  </li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing without the greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I also have tanned for many years, and have tried many different products.</li>
            <li>I Absolutely Love My Almost Famous By Australian Gold.</li>
            <li>It leaves you dark and feeling great.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and easy transaction.</li>
            <li>You notice results the first time you use it!</li>
            <li>It is literally my favorite lotion so far, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them!</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money and shipping</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions, mostly are very feminine smelling, with that said, obviously I&#x27;m a male.</li>
            <li>most natural color you will ever put on.</li>
            <li>I recall reading somewhere on here about its smell, which is pleasant enough, but I pretty much plan on stinking for a night because I leave it on, tan under my arms, sweat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Australian Gold Satin D Sol (best ever) or Designer Skin Black</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s cheap and second of all, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>The immediate color is good (a little orange), but it faded after one day.  </li>
            <li>Why such a huge cost increase!</li>
            <li>and I wanted a scent that would help make me feel and smell pretty - not</li>
            <li>My tan is beach ready!  </li>
            <li>The lotion makes you bronze (not orange unless you put too much on and do not rub it in, that&#x27;s a big mistake of many.)</li>
            <li>The lotion I purchased from my tanning place was ok, but the Australian Gold has really revved up my tan.</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much all of the lotions.but</li>
            <li>It last a long time and it was a good price.  </li>
            <li>is really fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>This REALLY firms your skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new &amp; thought the reviews looked okay BUT don&#x27;t let the other reviews fool</li>
            <li>my experience is strictly with the high pressure/low UV beds</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>(The DHA bronzer smell does get a little prominent as time goes on, but fades after a while and is tolerable.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is like a sweet cigar and the smell does not go away for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early forties, and try to tan in high pressure/</li>
            <li>least UV rays beds, as little as possible, and with this lotion I&#x27;m able to maintain a nice tan by going once every 7-10 days.  </li>
            <li>Also the triple action anti-wrinkle and firming formula is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>I still like it as a tanning lotion, but I have to say no on the bronzing action.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a couple of days but so far, it has exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Totally recommend this to anyone who wants a dark natural looking tan....fast!</li>
            <li>The consistency is very nice for a tanning lotion--not too thin, and not too thick.</li>
            <li>Want to get dark fast?</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s slightly towards the thicker side, but NOT hard to rub in at all!</li>

            <li> I would say it&#x27;s slightly towards the thicker side, but NOT hard to rub in at all!</li>
            <li> Personally I wouldn&#x27;t plan on tanning with this product on &amp; going anywhere that matters until I&#x27;ve bathed the next day, optimally, or 6-8hrs minimally.</li>
            <li> It spreads very well without being the least bit watery.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time on the color I get from this product which is deep and dark.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> With other products I&#x27;ve tried, I burn in the tanning bed, and it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;ve been in the bed for a longer time or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the other reviews fool</li>
            <li> I usually like the Australian Gold line, but this was an exception.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get quicker color (because I&#x27;m impatient)</li>
            <li> Plus my skin felt sticky for a few hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this product.</li>
            <li> You have to keep in mind, when using a bronzer you want to wait to shower at least 8 hours after your tanning process..</li>
            <li> But what is really disappointing was that it was actually a different lotion, with a &amp;#34;Almost Famous&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> For five or six years now I had been purchasing this at the tanning salons for around $50, until for some reason everyone stopped stocking it around here, which led me to look online and be a bit disappointed that I hadn&#x27;t thought to do so sooner (since I got the very same product at half the price).  </li>

            <li> Almost Famous by Australian Gold is an awesome product. I have tanned for about 8 years now and I&#x27;ve tried many lotions. This is one of the very best! Want to get dark fast? Want the best bronzers and moisturizers? Almost Famous is the way to go. The price on Amazon is well worth the money. It is super moisturizing without the greasy feel. The smell is sorta honey vanilla and is very mild and not overpowering. I can tan and not feel like I smell like tanning bed for the rest of the day. I get compliments all the time on the color I get from this product which is deep and dark. Also the triple action anti-wrinkle and firming formula is an added bonus. I can feel great getting a tan and knowing my skin is well taken care of and healthy. Love this product! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on all of the great feedback I read about it.  I have only been using it for a couple of days but so far, it has exceeded my expectations.  I have a 9-5 office job and find it difficult to go tanning after work.  I bought this lotion hoping for a couple of things...I wanted to get quicker color (because I&#x27;m impatient) and I wanted a scent that would help make me feel and smell pretty - not like I just went tanning.  I have to say, this lotion did both of those things.  It is well worth the money and shipping is really fast.  Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion! I&#x27;ve bought this lotion 3 times and I swear by it. First of all, it&#x27;s cheap and second of all, it&#x27;s so worth it! You notice results the first time you use it! It leaves you dark and feeling great. Totally recommend this to anyone who wants a dark natural looking tan....fast!</li>
            <li> Love the product.  My tan is beach ready!  Fast delivery and easy transaction.</li>
            <li> I bought this tanning lotion for my wife and myself to carry on vacation to Jamaica.  We wanted to get a head start on our tan so I looked for a lotion with a bronzer.  First, I love this lotion for its aroma and moisturizing properties.  However, three days of use didn&#x27;t seem to offer any indoor bronzing effect.  I still like it as a tanning lotion, but I have to say no on the bronzing action.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I have been using this product ever since I discovered it!  With other products I&#x27;ve tried, I burn in the tanning bed, and it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;ve been in the bed for a longer time or anything like that. I use this stuff regularly and never burn just tan perfectly! I think the hemp in it gives the skin some protection. Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this!</li>
            <li> For five or six years now I had been purchasing this at the tanning salons for around $50, until for some reason everyone stopped stocking it around here, which led me to look online and be a bit disappointed that I hadn&#x27;t thought to do so sooner (since I got the very same product at half the price).  I&#x27;m in my early forties, and try to tan in high pressure/least UV rays beds, as little as possible, and with this lotion I&#x27;m able to maintain a nice tan by going once every 7-10 days.  BUT, for best results, at least in my case, I&#x27;d recommend exfoliating/shaving beforehand, AND planning on keeping lotion on after tanning overnight.  Besides its \\&quot;bronzing\\&quot; effects, which again in my case are perfect (I have an olive complexion and tend to tan easily, but I mean there&#x27;s no orange or otherwise undesirable tinting in my case), I truly feel this lotion benefits my aging skin in ways that others simply do not.  It TOO seems to have its own exfoliating properties, and leaves my skin feeling smooth, supple, and even firmer, just as advertised.  Mind you my experience is strictly with the high pressure/low UV beds so I can&#x27;t comment on the cheaper beds with this product.  But I&#x27;d also recommend keeping your skin moisturized daily (my favorite for that is \\&quot;Body Kisses,\\&quot; but some may not like the sweet smell) leading up to your tanning day, which again you&#x27;ll want to exfoliate &amp; shave for but leave off any lotion except for this when you get to your session.  I&#x27;ve even used on my face with no problems, although sometimes will wash my face only before going to bed after tanning while leaving the rest on until the morning.  I recall reading somewhere on here about its smell, which is pleasant enough, but I pretty much plan on stinking for a night because I leave it on, tan under my arms, sweat, you get the picture.  Personally I wouldn&#x27;t plan on tanning with this product on &amp; going anywhere that matters until I&#x27;ve bathed the next day, optimally, or 6-8hrs minimally.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used for tanning bed. I have also used it in the sun. Best ever.</li>
            <li> About 7 years ago I was searching for a good and affordable tanning lotion, a coworker let me try her Almost Famous and I immediately loved it. At $150 a bottle, it was way more than I wanted to spend but, I could not resist. I am so happy to have found Almost Famous at a VERY affordable price now. I would highly suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it gives you a natural bronzed  look :)&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leaves streaks on your skin and it won&#x27;t stain your hand palms or your clothes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new &amp; thought the reviews looked okay BUT don&#x27;t let the other reviews fool you like it did me -- This bronzer is NASTY FAKE ORANGE, leaves streaks, AND smells DISGUSTING!!! Threw it away and never going back I&#x27;ll stick with Australian Gold Satin D Sol (best ever) or Designer Skin Black</li>
            <li> I love it.this is all I ever use and the color stays nicely after using the tanning bed.I have tried pretty much all of the lotions.but this is my favorite</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the other reviews fool you- the smell is atrocious.  It&#x27;s supposed to be a vanilla, but it is so incredibly strong and overly sweet/rich.  Disgusting.  It was so bad that my friends commented on how nasty it was after we went tanning.  Plus my skin felt sticky for a few hours afterwards. The immediate color is good (a little orange), but it faded after one day.  Terrible lotion, will never use again.</li>
            <li> This bronzer worked okay in the beginning. but started to turn me orange. It also left streaks. I wish I would have looked into it further before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I also have tanned for many years, and have tried many different products. I usually like the Australian Gold line, but this was an exception. It smelled terrible all day after tanning, felt very thick on my skin, and turned me orange (even with a good base tan). I gave this product to a friend so that I could get my JWOW tanning lotion back from her.</li>
            <li> This bronzer is very good.  Have used it many times  It last a long time and it was a good price.  Rachel</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and is a good price. This is an awesome product as always. This is one of my favorite tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I was noticeably darker within three days of using this. Just be sure to apply it evenly or you&#x27;ll be streaky, and wash your hands before tanning.</li>
            <li> Love this. But cannot get it anymore.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this tanning lotion.  It adds a very nice brown/ bronze shade while suntanning.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely Love My Almost Famous By Australian Gold. I Would Definitely Recommend This To Anyone.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions, mostly are very feminine smelling, with that said, obviously I&#x27;m a male. The tanning salons won&#x27;t stock this anymore around here...this I think is because it works! Not only does it work but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Smell is like a sweet cigar and the smell does not go away for a long time.  People keep asking me if I smell a cigar.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion... I have used it for going on 5 years now.. it is still hands down the best bronzer of all the lotions I have ever used.  You have to keep in mind, when using a bronzer you want to wait to shower at least 8 hours after your tanning process.. it would be useless to wash it off.  The smell is not that great after your tan session.. but it is the best lotion to use to get your bronzing affect.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!!!  It was a great price.  But what is really disappointing was that it was actually a different lotion, with a &amp;#34;Almost Famous&amp;#34;  sticker over top.</li>
            <li> Nice bronzer without the real bronzing odor.  Gives a true color and doesn&#x27;t stain hands.  I have tried many AG products and my favorite is still IDOL, but this is nice too!</li>
            <li> This REALLY firms your skin. All of those creams for ANTI cellulite are nothing next to this product. The lotion makes you bronze (not orange unless you put too much on and do not rub it in, that&#x27;s a big mistake of many.) Australian Gold almost famous triple bronzer also smells amazing. This is the only tanning lotion I will ever use.</li>
            <li> Came in a couple days.  Will buy again soon!!!!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this lotion to replace a Devoted Creations disaster. I LOVE this lotion, here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The tube packaging is super easy to get lotion out of, even with slippery lotion hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The lotion itself smells pretty good, with a light and not overpowering scent. It&#x27;s kind of vanilla-y. (The DHA bronzer smell does get a little prominent as time goes on, but fades after a while and is tolerable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It does an AMAZING job of moisturizing AND bronzing!! It has a ton of awesome ingredients that contain mega smooth, long-lasting moisturizers WITH a great bronze! I do keep it on overnight, since it helps it soak in better. I never look orange, just nice and naturally tan! It also has not stained or streaked in any way for me. I do make sure to wipe my hands well, and blend it in with care, just in case, but it seems to be a high quality and good blend of bronzers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The consistency is very nice for a tanning lotion--not too thin, and not too thick. It is also tinted a caramel color so it helps to see any thicker spots to rub in.  It spreads very well without being the least bit watery. I would say it&#x27;s slightly towards the thicker side, but NOT hard to rub in at all! It is literally my favorite lotion so far, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them! Try it, you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that I have used for several years.  The problem is the way they are constantly raising the price.  I started out paying like $38.00 a tube, last month I paid $75.00 and now I go to order and its $98.00.  Why such a huge cost increase!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while and I reallly like it.  This was the best priced of any I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> So this product came out back in 2004 or 2005 when I was working at a tanning place. I fell in love with it. I finally found it again on here and Ive been buying it ever since, It has a self tanner in it plus the triple bronzer, great for tanning beds. People always compliment on my tan.</li>
            <li> It really helps to get a great tanning</li>
            <li> most natural color you will ever put on. people cannot believe i have not been laying out in the sun!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!! I have been using it for years! And being able to get it online at this price is a steal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to indoor tanning. The lotion I purchased from my tanning place was ok, but the Australian Gold has really revved up my tan. I am very happy with it and would buy again.</li>
