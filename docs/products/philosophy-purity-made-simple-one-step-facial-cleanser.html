            <li>I first received this in the sample bottle, and honestly, I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with it.</li>
            <li>This face wash is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling amazing without any irritation or tightness.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product, just doesn&#x27;t work with my skin.</li>
            <li>Well as a manly man, I&#x27;m proud to admit that this is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Nice cleanser.</li>
            <li>I will begin by stating that I have never had problem skin of any kind, no acne, no blotches, no wrinkles, and</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my sister and she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey</li>
            <li>There is some kind of oil in there which helps melt away the makeup.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t feel drying after you wash your face and has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>Nice scent too.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m kind of in between acne prone skin and the need for anti-aging products.</li>
            <li>It has a creamy consistency and a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>is nice</li>
            <li>nice &amp;#34;spa-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love all there products I use this on my face, gives a nice healthy glow and very nice</li>
            <li>Also you can clean your makeup brushes with it and it works great.</li>
            <li>It takes my eye make up off very easily.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, gives my face a nice glow.</li>
            <li>After looking online, I found that this cleanser was one of the most popular ones</li>
            <li>so far the best face wash I have been used!</li>
            <li>Arrived days early, perfectly intact.  </li>
            <li>It is the best cleanser I have found so far for my face.  </li>
            <li>Makeup remover is great and leaves me with a fresh face</li>
            <li>I am surprised as to how great this stuff works!</li>
            <li>My favorite thing to use to clean my makeup brushes and a great facewash, can be used in place of makeup remover for sure.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended product!</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>The first couple of days using this was great.</li>
            <li>It has evened out my complection and leaves it feeling  very smooth.</li>
            <li>I have so many great products from philosophy, and it is such a great company, but purity made simple is the best product from philosophy that I have.</li>
            <li>Sometimes my skin seems to have a mind of its own, and adapt to things easily, meaning something will work for 2 months and then just stop working, and I&#x27;ll start breaking out again.</li>
            <li>The large container is a great value.</li>
            <li>I seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have even bought Dermoligica stuff, but this is wayyygy better.</li>
            <li>Gentle, smells good and leaves skin feeling absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be blown away :)</li>
            <li>I also bought some more products from philosophy</li>
            <li>so maybe in combination I&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments on my \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; :) skin.</li>
            <li>After all of the rave reviews on this product I really thought it was going to be great to use.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many acne products and cleansers including prescriptions.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many over my 53 years.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure to buy it at a place you can return it at if you have breakouts or a reaction as a result of using this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li>This is very calming and works great.</li>
            <li>Also this leaves me with healthy feeling, porcelain looking skin and even skin tone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a face wash like many others.  </li>
            <li>This is simply the best face wash i have ever found.</li>
            <li>Initially, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.</li>
            <li>, this cleanser is OK, once again it just may have been my skin type.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser as I do every Philosophy product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Do what the say and massage it in, and your skin will feel much better day by day.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for the perfect facewash my entire life.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love to pair it with their Hope in  a Jar moisturizer before I apply makeup.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift, and they love it.  </li>
            <li>Just another cleanser that probably made me break out even more.</li>
            <li>My 8 oz bottle lasts more than 5 months.</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better since I have been using it.</li>
            <li>Philosophy Purity is the best daily cleanser I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, have been using for years.</li>
            <li>Just takes some getting used to since it doesn&#x27;t foam like most cleansers.</li>
            <li>and I could not believe how much better my face felt.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite facewash of all time.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Its the same great product!</li>
            <li>You must rub your eyes for a minute or two with water with the wash to make sure all of the makeup comes off.</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser that I have used.</li>
            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>I still love the product</li>
            <li>and I found a better and cheaper face cleaning and moisturizing product at Walmart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>What more could a girl ask for?  </li>
            <li>Was this an allergic reaction to something I ate, I wondered, because I refused to believe that this wonderful company that &amp;#34;celebrates the beauty of the human spirit&amp;#34; with products that &amp;#34;enhance your skin and well-being with multitasking benefits&amp;#34; could be the culprit.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel sexy</li>
            <li>The 16 oz bottle is more affordable than the clarisonic cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I initially experienced Purity Made Simple 7 years ago and loved the cleanser at the time.  </li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Made out of more chemicals that the &amp;#34;Purity&amp;#34; title would leave you to believe.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, it made my face oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t use my money.</li>
            <li>When I do wear makeup, it stays on better, lasts longer, and doesn&#x27;t rub off my nose and chin</li>
            <li>and it feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>So I ordered it more than a month ago and have been using it since it arrive.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>A WAY better deal for something I use all the time.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Wish we would have found many years ago.</li>
            <li>and it is outstanding.</li>
            <li>this is the best facial cleanser i have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>

            <li>This is one of the best facial cleansers that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten my acne under control after having used many prescibed cleansers that overdried.  </li>

            <li>I love purity, it never breaks my skin out</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this face wash.</li>
            <li>Your complexion is smoother and looks so much better.</li>
            <li>My husband noticed and told me my skin looked better since i started using it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I just love this face wash.</li>
            <li>Will buy more again :)</li>
            <li>Love this face wash.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and there is nothing better that I have found.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite aspect of this product is that it removes all traces of makeup in ONE wash.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>Nice, light scent.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li>I always thought that the answer to breaking out was more medicated washes, something like Proactiv (which I tried many moons ago).</li>
            <li>Started out with the sample size and that was when I discovered this perfect facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser of all time.</li>
            <li>always love this product.  </li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this stuff is able to penetrate the skin membrane and damage your collagen</li>
            <li>to give you more in depth criticism of this product is...</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I will be looking for more products.  </li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, it takes off all my eye makeup from the lids and lashes.</li>
            <li>Since I began using Purity 4 years ago, I haven&#x27;t tried anything else, it has a pleasant smell, washing off any and all makeup, its great in the winter as it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and it washes off my waterproof mascara that even eye makeup remover doesn&#x27;t always do.</li>
            <li>I love the smell; it&#x27;s very clean.  </li>
            <li>It just leaves a nice squeaky clean face.</li>
            <li>My skin felt really nice and clean.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and I have beautiful and resilient skin.</li>
            <li>but it left this residue in my fine lines that not even the best exfoliator and moisturizer can get rid off.</li>
            <li>Definitely financially best to buy the large size, works out much cheaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>An 8 ounce bottle easily lasts three months or more.</li>
            <li>takes everything off, easy to use and leaves skin feeling hydrated without feeling too oily...with buy again for sure</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin, but I also heard this was one of the best out there.</li>
            <li>Extremely gentle on the skin, this cleanser leave my face feeling clean, fresh, and best of all, hydrated!</li>
            <li>I love many of the Philosophy products, this is a fabulous face wash</li>
            <li>best facial cleanser available</li>
            <li>This is great for sensitive skin types like mine!</li>
            <li>Bonus--I use this to clean my makeup brushes..works like a charm!</li>
            <li>it leave my face feeling squeaky clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>Pair with a Clarisonic for an even deeper clean!</li>
            <li>This has a nice clean scent and a light texture.</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair, and always looked so splotchy and irritated that I never left the house without wearing foundation to cover it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>A small amount is all that&#x27;s needed :) I definitely suggest this face wash, and would recommend Beauty bridge for their excellent service (I placed my order on the 15th &amp; received it on the 18th, impressive!)</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was a \\&quot;purge\\&quot; reaction, my skin becoming \\&quot;pure\\&quot;, and perhaps it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>great value, cap came cracked but we used old bottle cap</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this when I purchased another item and loved it so much had to buy the bottle.</li>
            <li>this is such a good product!</li>
            <li>best thing about it is that it is not harsh and it makes tour face feel nice and soft, and clean as well, with no tightening, drying effect.</li>
            <li>It got mascara off like I had never been able to get it off before, and my face did feel as though I had used toner; it did not feel tight,just clean.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the delicately clean smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild though, so I would recommend removing makeup before using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li>It removes all your makeup easily.</li>
            <li>but my hands, even around my eyes, and the mascara on my eyelashes comes off so easily.</li>
            <li>Some that I had tried irritated my skin easily and others I tried didn&#x27;t remove the make up that well.</li>
            <li>and it removes my makeup easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying but removes dirt and makeup easily.  </li>
            <li>Gets makeup off easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the scent is strong and I can still smell</li>
            <li>This stuff has a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>it leave my face filling very clean, smooth, and oil free.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on the packaging or shipping, but the product itself at first seemed really nice.  </li>
            <li>I continued with the cleanser for a full month (remember, I used to love it) without seeing an improvement.  </li>
            <li>This face wash is hands down the best I have ever come across.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fine&#x27;, &#x27;this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin&#x27;</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and always leaves my skin perfectly balanced-- never dry or oily.</li>
            <li>As a guy I don&#x27;t have makeup to remove, but I find this to be a very nice and easy to use daily face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>First many people rave how this product completely clears your skin of make and that it&#x27;s even great to clean your make up brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Philosophy, I&#x27;ve been using Purity for about two years now.</li>
            <li>I would get huge cystic pimples around my chin, on the corners of my mouth, and in between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>or so I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>In two days, a huge improvement was seen.</li>
            <li>I needed a cleanser that was NOT oil free and would also remove makeup.</li>
            <li>When paired with the Hope in a Jar lotion it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This soap is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I use it before i shave and it makes shaving a smooth experience.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling cleansed, refreshed, and smooth.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is great when you need to get all that gunk off your face without being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleanser is gentle but effective, but way too pricey for a face cleanser.</li>
            <li>it was fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth after I use it.  </li>
            <li>At the time of this review I paid about 27.50 here on Amazon with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I do like the light scent, and also use the Purity cloths at night before bed.</li>
            <li>and it does a nice job of cleaning off products gently and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle, yet effective, that you can rub it across your eyes with no problem.</li>
            <li>Great makeup remover and facial wash.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so smooth after use.</li>
            <li>I loved the savings on my favorite facial cleanser!</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash, mild and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I so wanted to like this since Philosophy is a good name and many other reviewers loved it, plus I invested in the large bottle.  </li>
            <li>Truth be told, many of the reviews were right.</li>
            <li>, Girls, if you&#x27;re cross shopping for any philosophy, Amazon pretty much always has the best prices plus free shipping :]</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the clean fresh feeling it leaves.</li>
            <li>It cleanses thoroughly, leaves my oily skin fresh and clean, plus it smell fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE all kinds of skin products and cosmetics, tried many and while I can say this is a decent one</li>
            <li>It gets all the makeup and oil off my face easily, but it feels really mild and creamy.  </li>
            <li>absolutely leaves your skin beautiful, clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>This product is NOT travel friendly.</li>
            <li>It is worth the hype!</li>
            <li>First of all, I LOVE what is written on the front.</li>
            <li>i first bought this at ulta and love it</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Originally I received a sample of this as part of a beauty shipment.</li>
            <li>worth the price for a known product that works!</li>
            <li>My wife originally bought this for her, but after trying it I&#x27;ve become a fan myself.</li>
            <li>I have seen so many YouTube gurus rave about this product but never thought it necessary because of the price, but I wish I did sooner because the amount of money I have used in CVS/Walgreens hoping to find the perfect facial makeup cleanser, could have probably been put to use in buying this holy grail product!  </li>
            <li>By far the BEST facial cleanser</li>
            <li>I feel clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>and I like my cleanser to clean well</li>
            <li>Before buying I thought it was a cream cleanser that doesn&#x27;t foam up, and worried it doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li>While this didn&#x27;t sting my face like everything index the sun and did clean</li>
            <li>I used this cleanser with my clarosonic brush and after washing my faces I would try to clean my clarosonic brush with it and the make would not come of my brush.</li>
            <li>which is awesome, because I spent so much time dabbing on concealers and powder to hide my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets your face clean.  </li>
            <li>Use it to clean my makeup brushes...</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after washing with Purity.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is that it was free, a bottle was given to me by a friend.</li>
            <li>I use a Clarisonic and it leaves my face feeling hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin &amp; read great reviews about this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face clean of all makeup including mascara.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>you wear a non-waterproof mascara, this cleanser will clean your lashes as well.</li>
            <li>clean feeling</li>
            <li>Skin always feels so clean</li>
            <li>use the aria + cleanser every night, &amp; my face feels so squeaky clean when I&#x27;m falling asleep</li>
            <li>I do like how clean it makes your skin feel</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean, refreshed, and doesn&#x27;t take away moisture.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean w/o any residue&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I read it every day and it gives me a positive feeling. :)</li>
            <li>Its a true clean.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the right amount of moisture in my skin when I use it!</li>
            <li>It has a really nice subtle smell, and seemed to cleanse my face well and does a great job at removing makeup, however after continuing use for about 2 months</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my skin clean, soft and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>Gentle cleanser washes clean, needs more work to remove mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other moisture-rich products have left me feeling like I still had a glaze of something on my skin, but a good rinse always leaves my face feeling clean of all product.</li>
            <li>Have been using Purity for a full year and will never be without it.  </li>
            <li>Actually, it does not smell good.</li>
            <li>It cleans without drying out, and I feel light and fresh after using it.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much :)</li>
            <li>I really believe it&#x27;s kept me looking more youthful.</li>
            <li>It had my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ve finally found my answer to good skin. . .</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>#34;You get what you pay for,&amp;#34; and in this case, it is really true.</li>
            <li>It has a nice mellow scent, it both cleanses and tones, and it has no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for sensitive, acne-prone, dry skin.</li>
            <li>i purchase this as a recommendation to use along my clarisonic mia 2, and i love it, it leaves my oily skin feeling clean and fresh, and removes make up like no other, excellent to save a few steps of my nightly routine.</li>
            <li>The facial cleanser is pure and does a great job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh too.</li>
            <li>The scent is so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It has been more vibrant and glowing since I have used this.</li>
            <li>Unless you have super oily skin, I would recommend this cleanser to anyone.</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and soft and calm after using the Purity.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra $ for good quality face wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to trust this brand more and more.</li>
            <li>The scent is really mild and nice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Including prescriptions and the most high end products..spending thousands on my skin.</li>
            <li>thank you very much!</li>
            <li>This creame version of facial wash is nice, but the foam formula is better and much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing how this cleanser removes all makeup without drying the skin--works better than I expected!  </li>
            <li>I used to buy this at Macys and was so happy when I found it on Amazon for slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild, smells fine and cleans my face up really, really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t drink pop, and I eat pretty good, so there was no outside cause to this.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, non-greasy, gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE how soft it makes your skin!</li>
            <li>This is my second order, I love it!</li>
            <li>The lather was just right, and I saw more make-up come off on my Clarisonic brush than normal.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and breaks out really easy, fortunately this cleanser did not irritate my skin at all</li>
            <li>This is by far the best face wash I have ever used; it does not dry out my skin at all and has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>Heard great reviews about this face wash &amp; bought the little sample size.</li>
            <li>I follow-up up with a cleanser that has acne medication just because I need to treat my acne, but I am sure for those who do not have acne issues like me, this cleanser would be fine to serve as the only cleanser in your skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much make up and though in the summer I do enjoy a suntan with sunscreen protected skin, I by no means am a sun worshipper.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic, gentle, milky product.</li>
            <li>Makes the price worth it.</li>
            <li>it melts makeup off my face and leaves me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling nice and clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it out either.</li>
            <li>but I feel it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>, I like aveeno ultra sensitive foaming face wash better than this because this has a touch of scent to it</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I decided to buy the larger size online.</li>
            <li>On a popular beauty site it was 32 bucks for this same size plus shipping.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I came to Amazon and ordered a big bottle.  </li>
            <li>It acts as a powerful cleanser and is worth the money</li>
            <li>I think it is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash so far.</li>
            <li>and I always say Purity is the foundation of it all because you have to have an excellent facial cleanser at the base, and this one is superb.</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;m looking for is cleanse without irritating my skin, and this one meets my need perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never unhappy with a Philosophy product.</li>
            <li>Worth getting.</li>
            <li>and it takes away dirt from the day and my face feels fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>This winter I noticed my skin was changing becoming more dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle but still gets rid of all the makeup even mascara!</li>
            <li>I have tried neutrogena, biore, proactive, clearasil, acne free, and clean and clear, but nothing compares to this facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using my face looks mostly okay but doesn&#x27;t feel clean (and I only use mineral powder or bb cream).</li>
            <li>It is a simple way to keep my skin clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>Purity may be all right for oiler skin</li>
            <li>Gentle, yet makes my face feel clean and</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel very refreshed &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>Its so gentle that I can use it on my eyes to clean my make up off</li>
            <li>Kiehl&#x27;s: Rosa Arctica lightweight moisturizer (daily wear, great for foundation application), rare earth pore cleansing mask (there&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t beat with a quick drying mud mask), &amp; their overnight biological peel (for the love of god, get a sample of this stuff - It has a small concentration of hydrogen peroxide that makes your skin tingle and</li>
            <li>But anyways it leaves my face feeling soft, clean and fresh after!</li>
            <li>I have tried numersous products, both cheap and high end, for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Has a very light scent and does not dry her skin out.</li>
            <li>I bought the 16oz bottle of this for $32 after reading several great reviews and after hearing from a few friends that use and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin that easily breaks out if my skin is either too dry or too oily, and Purity has worked better for me than anything at keeping my skin clear, hydrated, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face extremely oily or dry, but the perfect balance.</li>
            <li>After seeing so many good reviews about it, I decided to try it and even though it is a bit expensive, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>This cleanser feels very creamy and gentle on the skin and has a somewhat herbal or medicinal smell that I actually enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Never use anything else - if you&#x27;re looking for a one step facial cleanser that is gentle, yet effective to remove the heaviest makeup, including mascara, this is for you.  </li>
            <li>Simple easily removes all my makeup (including mascara) and leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally feel that this face wash is gentle or effective.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve happily used the Philosophy line of 3-in-1 body washes but since they are on the expensive side, I use the product sparingly and seldom treat myself to more than 3 bottles a year.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I expect this review will be unpopular, but I&#x27;m really just being honest with how the product affected me personally, and I may or may not be alone in my experience.  </li>
            <li>Clarisonic + Purity Made Simple&#x3D; good clear skin</li>
            <li>great to have all around, my 3rd big bottle.</li>
            <li>Not a few, not small pimples, huge bright red pimples!</li>
            <li>it lasts a good two or three months and isn&#x27;t priced much higher than your typical drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and so this cleanser is very gentle on it.</li>
            <li>but this product actually flared up my very light case of Rosacia</li>
            <li>Very gentle on your face while it removes all your makeup.  </li>
            <li>This product is very gentle without lacking the ability to get all of the day&#x27;s dirt and makeup off of my face.</li>
            <li>version!&lt;br /&gt;This takes off all my waterproof makeup, and does so very very gently.  </li>
            <li>I originally was looking for the philosophy purity oil free facial cleanser but found this one and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>My face is clean without a lot of extra steps and is blemish free.</li>
            <li>skin has never felt so clean, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have more clear natural skin.</li>
            <li>dissolves my makeup, leaves face feeling clean and fresh and not tight.</li>
            <li>My pores aren&#x27;t smaller, I have been breaking out more</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m blaming the hot weather?), and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel softer.</li>
            <li>Anything I am looking for I always look on Amazon first.</li>
            <li>Purity is the first Philosophy product I have used.</li>
            <li>I spoke with a salesperson at Ulta who said this is what Purity does when you first start using it because its cleansing your skin and pushing out the dirt.</li>
            <li>This face wash is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>She loved it and could tell a difference within the first few times using it.  </li>
            <li>and I am able to avoid using multiple products because of the one-step product.  </li>
            <li>Will make your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My first time this brand</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>For the price there are several better options.  </li>
            <li>Will most definitely purchase this again!  </li>
            <li>Glad I finally found it,</li>
            <li>This product may be ok for someone else, but it did not lather enough for me.</li>
            <li>My favorite daily cleanser.  </li>
            <li>and it was an absolute nightmare!  </li>
            <li>Such a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>My first thought was &amp;</li>
            <li>First of all it smells exactly like</li>
            <li>After the first day I could tell this just was not working for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend trying the 4oz sample bottle first-</li>
            <li>I first purchased it December 2012..</li>
            <li>, that is also next to a patch of more oily skin, and so on and so forth...</li>
            <li>It came with a trial-size Hope in a Jar moisturizer (purported to &amp;#34;moisturize, hydrate and provide antioxidant protection, while improving skin texture&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>recommend buying it if you&#x27;re looking for a cleanser that makes your skin not only feel healthy, but clears it up.</li>
            <li>and it worked wonders at first...</li>
            <li>Plus it is also gentle on my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>my skin is once again bright firm and supple.</li>
            <li>Really miss it!</li>
            <li>stuff, thanks Veroz!</li>
            <li>I love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I just received it today and used it for the first time while taking a shower.</li>
            <li>but I always make sure that I use makeup removing facial wipes, for instance;</li>
            <li>It does have a funny smell; I associate it with mosquito spray, so I was a bit worried to begin with</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I no longer have any acne, my skin is smooth and looks fresh, and I don’t need to use exfoliating products any more to get off my dead skin.</li>
            <li>Great prduct that works well for me and no more burning eyes!</li>
            <li>Great gentle non-foaming cleanser..we use them with the Extra Gentle Buf Puf facial sponge.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, smooth, acne free, and looking better than it has in a few years.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and soft, and I would dare to compare the results of this product to the results I get from a certain well known acne treatment.  </li>
            <li>B005BJ69V4 Clean &amp; Clear Cream Cleanser]]</li>
            <li>Aveeno, Clean &amp; Clear, Biore, Neutrogena - you name it</li>
            <li>Your skin feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It removes all of my makeup including eyeliner and mascara without burning my eyes and leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>It removes my makeup and leaves my face feeling completely clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li>I have tried many over the years &amp; keep coming back to this one, reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>Super easy on your skin, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the job done, but it still cleanses well and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li>OVERALL, I&#x27;m in love with this stuff and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I recently made the leap from small trial size bottle to a full size bottle of Purity, and it is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mildly scented, a little goes a long way, and it does a great job of removing makeup and thoroughly cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li>have normal skin (not too dry or oily) and this feels like a nice, gentle cleanse.  </li>
            <li>I found this cleanser on amazon by looking at highly rated ones from other buyers and I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li>Item was shipped as promised quickly and completely intact</li>
            <li>I was previously using and loving the Arbonne line, but for the cost I&#x27;ll keep using this product instead.</li>
            <li>Love the way it cleanses my skin, it feels soothing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to wipe off with a towel, but sometimes I need to use a makeup remover wipe- which defeats the purpose of a one step cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seems pure, just as the title says.</li>
            <li>I use this for my morning shaves plus a mix of pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li>This and the Pure Grace items are what keep me buying Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>I had a small travel size of this and began using it since the packaging was cute, and I&#x27;ve found my skin actually looks better after using this consistently, so I bought a bigger size. :)</li>
            <li>It smells great and you only need to use a little.</li>
            <li>By far favorite face wash.. I break out easily and I also have sensitive skin due to ezcema and this wash saves my life.</li>
            <li>soap is huge and will last forever.  </li>
            <li>my wife uses this product and really like it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>They are on the pricey side, so I definitely expected much better quality.</li>
            <li>I found Purity Made Simple at a fantastic price and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>Works really well with clarisonic</li>
            <li>It is really a one-step cleanser.</li>
            <li>You can really feel it dissolving your makeup, and  it leaves your skin oil-free.</li>
            <li>very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much truth there...</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really cleans  the makeup off my face with and does not irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>while washing it has a slimy texture, it doesn&#x27;t foam up unless you were to really make an attempt</li>
            <li>I really like how it does not strip your skin</li>
            <li>Women have to much to buy as it is in life and 30 + dollars for face cleanser is too much.</li>
            <li>.. gentle</li>
            <li>This product was recommended in Sophora because it cleanses as well as removes eye makeup really well.</li>
            <li>These products did not defy age, nor did the cleanser &amp;#34;gently cleanse, tone and melt away all face and eye makeup in one simple step, while lightly hydrating the skin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I wash, rinse and wash it again gentle.  </li>
            <li>Foundation, blush, not so much.  </li>
            <li>She loves it so much she uses it on her whole body</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to have to give this back to her and let her enjoy it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s  quite gentle.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle cleanser that does not scratch or scrub.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin SO much softer and has helped get rid of my redness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a light feel to it but cleanses so well that my skin actually glows after using it.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have problematic skin</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup but was gentle and non stripping.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Gentle, cleansing and moisturizing...</li>
            <li>cleanser is a standard cleanser that I keep available at all</li>
            <li>(not so much for waterproof mascara)&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>your face all de-greazed and ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>High recommend it!</li>
            <li>milky, lathers easily, gentle, leaves your skin hydrated and not feeling dry/tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the blemishes I do have go away much faster</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had heard so much about it.</li>
            <li>I really like how my face feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>purity indicative of being gentle?</li>
            <li>It does it all and is so gentle on my eyes.</li>
            <li>It left my skin silky smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt without any residue leftover from my makeup.</li>
            <li>If you have combo skin, I highly recommend this face wash!</li>
            <li>Love this simple &amp; complete way to wash my face &amp; remove all traces of make-up ♡♡♡</li>
            <li>For example, Burts Bees makes a sensitive facial cleaner that I&#x27;m now using and LOVE.  </li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical to try it because the reviews sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I believe this cleanser would work well for all skin types unless your skin is super, super dry.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle fragrance and after using it daily you can really notice a difference in how clean your skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time, I said WOW!  </li>
            <li>Cleanses makeup off face better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>In my opinion there are other drug store product that are cheaper and work way better then this product.</li>
            <li>Noxzema Deep Cleansing Cream, Original - 14 oz]]</li>
            <li>I continue to buy this product solely because it removes make-up better than any other cleanser or make-up remover I have tried.</li>
            <li>but once I got past that I love it!</li>
            <li>I have also heard that the formula has changed, which, while I cannot judge that as a new user of this product, It seems that for the price, there should be a lot more oils and natural ingredients in it, instead of just standard detergents.</li>
            <li>This is the  only cleanser that I have ever had that cleans without drying and my face still feels clean.</li>
            <li>Never dries me out &amp; allways leaves me completely clean with no film left over.</li>
            <li>It definitely dissolves all the make I have on my face and leaves it feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>I am a big clean freak when it comes to removing make-up or cleansing my face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>While this is easily the most expensive item, per ounce, in my bathroom, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean and is the only cleanser that can handle my breakouts and control my flare-ups</li>
            <li>Clears up acne quickly, cuts through makeup and dirt, and does not dry your skin out.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle and leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>My mom is devoted to this stuff, so when I recently saw that QVC was having a $70 special buy for two of the 32 ounce bottles, I splurged and got one for her, and one for me to try it</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and have been using oil free products for years, not knowing how much it was drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>This Purity cleanser is simple and easy, and leaves my face feeling soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The parabens are there for shelf life, however, and that&#x27;s good because a 16 ounce will last me a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t promise that this will work for everyone, but for my skin, which is dry, slightly sensitive, and breaks out due to hormones/stress, it worked great for me.</li>
            <li>so evidently it keeps my face clear as well.  </li>
            <li>Naturally I was interested in a product that would reverse the signs of aging, and improve the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>my tried and true Philosophy Purity Made Simple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to keep my face clean only to find it oily at mid day and more pimples by the next day.</li>
            <li>It smells a little more medicinal than it used to, but I REALLY can&#x27;t find anything that comes close to it.  </li>
            <li>It is the only facial cleanser I will use and the bottle is pretty enough to look nice on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Less drying, better smell and WAY</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look at this as a scented product, so I am glad the slightly odd smell does not stay with you after using it.  </li>
            <li>Now i have the 16oz and half the ownership - my husband has also fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love this product it lasts for AGES because you only have to use a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>One thing I would suggest to anyone buying a larger bottle of this product, be careful the product is a bit runny, so the flip top cap on the 16oz bottle tends to gush far more than you need for one application (especially if you are juggling the bottle in the shower like I do).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price and keeps my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li>hardly ever get blemishes any more!</li>
            <li>I have started using the Rodan and Fields Redefine - but I need a makeup melt cleanser which R&amp;F does not offer particularly for eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal user of Purity cleanser for several years now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleansers in my 60 years, and this is the only one that:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I initially tried a small sample from Ulta and loved it so much that I went with this 16-oz full-size</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone on the fence about this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I was in high school and college</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products for those of you struggling with combo skin.</li>
            <li>We both feel that it leaves our complexions smooth and clear, and we&#x27;ll be buying a new bottle as soon as this one starts running low.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li>price may seem a little high compared to drug store cleansers, but the bottle lasts a long time so it&#x27;s in deed a good value.</li>
            <li>now my skin is clear and I only use makeup for special occasions.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean without feeling overly dry.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean, but not too dry father use.</li>
            <li>I have very fussy, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It cleanses well but is gentle, with no harsh dyes or perfumes.</li>
            <li>I have discontinued using this product, and switched to Exuviance cleansing creme and my face already feels better after just a few days.  </li>
            <li>After giving one of these away as a gift along with a 3in1 shower gel, I ran out of my normal cleanser, and opened the Purity I had put away for myself.</li>
            <li>I have fairly normal skin --</li>
            <li>Within 3 days my face developed whiteheads and pimples, much more so than average.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for normal to oily skins.</li>
            <li>that i decided it was time to spend money on something good that will benefit my skin (and maybe even reverse the effects of my poor skin maintenance).</li>
            <li>Very gentle and does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>This thing not only peeled my face right off</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took about a month for my skin to get used to it, and at first I wasn’t convinced it was worth it; however, once my skin got used to it, I will not use any other face wash out there.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, I break out in many huge, red, cystic, painful pimples all over my face but mostly on my chin and around my mouth, also in my hairline and between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It washes off all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling very clean without the sting some alcohol heavy cleansers leave.</li>
            <li>QVC shows live demos of this cleanser removing make up.</li>
            <li>I received a 2 oz sample of this in my new beauty test tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using 7 years after I saw on television HSN about new products &amp;#34;Philosophy&amp;#34; in 1994.  </li>
            <li>Pimples, whiteheads and blackheads aren&#x27;t new to me</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product, and have began stocking up by the liter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but it seems effective.</li>
            <li>I bought the largest available size of this product over a year ago and I am still using that same bottle (it was a BIG one).</li>
            <li>No matter what other cleanser I try, I keep coming back to this one, and I loved the 16 ounce size...kind of jumbo, but easier to handle than the 32 ounce I was getting for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but have had no problems with it at all.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Bought for my mother-in-law who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It melts away make-up easily, is gentle on the skin, and leaves it REALLY clean without feeling tight.</li>
            <li>Ill make further updates as I see fit, hopefully the results continue to be positive :)</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how the two mix so well, but it&#x27;s surely a match made in cosmetic heaven.</li>
            <li>No harsh smells or chemicals!</li>
            <li>I was excited to finally have a facial cleanser to melt away makeup</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been pretty under control for the last couple of years.</li>
            <li>Philosophy is the first makeup cleansing removing that actually does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always simply used Dove soap to clean my face, I&#x27;ve never used other products, and I don&#x27;t even know why I keep giving this bottle more tries!</li>
            <li>This is so ridiculous that it wants more words to post this.</li>
            <li>Although I was concerned about the price being too high at first, it lasts a really long time .While</li>
            <li>which is kind of hard to find on a facewash bottle!</li>
            <li>I get pimples a little more than normal and this cleanser is gentle enough to not dry out my skin completely with the combination of my acne medication.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it now about 5 different times, thinking maybe I just need to get past an initial breakout for it to start giving me good results.</li>
            <li>I have used several philosophy products before, and I believe that they really try to live a &amp;#34;philosophy&amp;#34; and are dedicated to quality.</li>
            <li>In the winter I take extra care with moisturizers anyway, so putting a little extra cream on the face after using this wasn&#x27;t a big deal just to get rid of the dryness, but I&#x27;m not so sure that for the price it is worth it at all.  </li>
            <li>And with the price of this stuff, that would be a huge waste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really helped to clear my teenagers skin when used with the Buf Fuf facial sponge.</li>
            <li>I never had to use a cleanser to keep my face clear.  </li>
            <li>I am using the Purity and alternating with the clear days ahead line.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin clear without over drying.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else cleans the makeup off my face but still keeps it soft.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping my skin would be clear as an adult.  </li>
            <li>I had seen several presentations on this on QVC, and wondered if it really did what was claimed.</li>
            <li>This works so well on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft afterwards and felt</li>
            <li>It is soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this made me break out.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s near the sink I also use it as a hand cleaner instead of buying separate liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it and I sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also, it leave your skin really soft and the pores has improve a lot.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as drying as the Purity, which surprised me, as it has exfoliator beads in it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and I never have to worry with Purity rather or not it&#x27;s going to break out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>has no trouble washing all of that off.</li>
            <li>I got mono, and my skin completely freaked out.</li>
            <li>In three weeks my skin was almost completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 8 ounce container lasted nearly a year.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled for years with adult acne</li>
            <li>My skin always feels soft from it too.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I was truly surprised</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin, and not like, &amp;#34; oh my t-zone is oily and my cheeks are dry,&amp;#34; or vise versa,</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of Earl Grey tea at first.</li>
            <li>Used for years on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning, and they were all over my forehead, up one whole side of my face, and on my chin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now, and my skin is soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and need a product that doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li>I only wish it didn&#x27;t have quite so much fragrance, which might be a deal-breaker for some people.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>a wash, your face feels moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a 24 year old woman, who was never too considerate of her problem skin until this year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a lot of skin care products to help prevent the things we don&#x27;t want as we age, and I love this cleanser because it is probably the ONLY thing I use that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have average skin (not oily nor dry), I tend to get a pimple once in a while and in stressful times I might break out a bit more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricy, but worth it!</li>
            <li>It has a light faint smell and makes my skin feel so refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>and I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight and overly dry after washing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too harsh, as my skin is sensitive and gets irritatingly dry when using most face washes.</li>
            <li>Still have enough from the first to last until December..</li>
            <li>(I do moisturize my face right after using it though, so that might&#x27;ve been other people&#x27;s problem).</li>
            <li>Acne Free, Aveeno, Olay, Dove, Clearasil, Neutrogena, exfoliating washes, super expensive stuff, etc.</li>
            <li>Finally, with this Purity Made Simple cleanser, I have found a product that is really helping to clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>Between this and the bareMinerals Purely Nourishing Moisturizer Ive been using, I&#x27;ve noticed not just a little clearing up of the skin but maybe also a little bit more of a softer, younger glow...</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with some dry patches in the winter, but this face wash seems to balance that out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of dry skin along with acne and this really has helped my face.</li>
            <li>Purity Made Simple is SO gentle that you can open your eyes while washing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, clear, and my skin tone is finally starting to even out</li>
            <li>so I ordered it and have seen a major improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say if it made me break out worse for any amount of time in the beginning since I was such a hot mess, but within about three weeks my skin cleared up, and when I say cleared up, I mean it looks the best it has EVER looked.</li>
            <li>first, I felt like this cleanser was a little too drying, and I&#x27;d use moisturizer afterward because otherwise it felt kind of tight for a little while after using it.</li>
            <li>All you need is a small amount to clean face.</li>
            <li>A small peanut sized amount leaves skin clean and supple and it does remove makeup modestly.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>I still get the occasional tiny zit, but overall my face is so clear now that I have actually gone out with no makeup on a few times and felt like I looked OK.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this the first cleaner I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight and blotchy.</li>
            <li>the rest of my face is fine nothing out of the ordinary, its only my nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several facial cleansers, mainly drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I left my pizza face in middle school and the beginning stages of high school.</li>
            <li>but I can generally predict when I&#x27;ll begin to see them.  </li>
            <li>I rinse with clear water then use a facecloth to remove any last traces then nothing else until I put on my moisturizer before bed.  </li>
            <li>My face was already clear prior to use.</li>
            <li>(Now having that said, let me just be clear that I use pretty heavy eye makeup during the day.)</li>
            <li>It has evened out my complexion, I barely have to wear make up</li>
            <li>My skins is so sensitive that almost EVERYTHING either breaks it out or turns it red.  </li>
            <li>As a result, my pores are smaller and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>Never expected this from Philosophy.</li>
            <li>After switching back to my old cleanser</li>
            <li>Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I have not experienced any more cysts while using the Purity..</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way so this tiny bottle is still going strong after washing my face twice a day for a month.</li>
            <li>Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for a facial cleanser, but I&#x27;ve found success in other Philosophy products and came into a little extra money, so</li>
            <li>Plus, you only need to use a little bit so the bottle should last you at least a good 2-3 months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out afterwards--which is saying a lot for me, as I have sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin and has remedied my break outs!</li>
            <li>Now, I usually don&#x27;t write reviews unless the product is somewhat extraordinary and THIS, my friend, it is.</li>
            <li>It seems pricey but is high quality &amp; lasts a long time!!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin balanced and soft, not tight or dry.</li>
            <li>There were no cracks and the cap was not loose.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin but this product leaves my nose oily for DAYS!</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer and the redness and uneven appearance is almost gone completely.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it leaves some eyeliner left in my inner rim, which makes sense because I am not using soap directly on that area.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>No pimples and no dry skin and redness.</li>
            <li>Also its does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed because of all the great reviews I saw on this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve completely stopped using any acne stuff other than the spot treatment, and my skin has stayed clear.</li>
            <li>Will be going back to my holy grail bare minerals purifying cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Personally, when I first used this product I massaged it on my face without problem, but when I rinsed it off my skin felt tight and dry!&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Much cheaper here at Amazon vs other retailers!  </li>
            <li>This is a nice large size so don&#x27;t be afraid of the price!</li>
            <li>I like this formula, if you have sensitive skin it doesn&#x27;t dry it out or irritate it</li>
            <li>I wear no makeup, but still sometimes have adult acne problems, combined with rather dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>skin is dry and somewhat sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Both of us have combination / sensitive skin that gets dry after washing</li>
            <li>face stays soft and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin which is what I was looking to do.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, which is great considering how expensive it</li>
            <li>Now I buy it in the large bottle and fill up the little bottle when I&#x27;m going traveling.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product a couple of days but, in my case, that&#x27;s generally long enough to say because my skin is SO sensitive,</li>
            <li>I bought a small version of this cleanser a few years back to take with me on vacation and fell in love with the product.</li>
            <li>I woke up, and my skin felt smoother, it wasn&#x27;t as dry and sensitive from all the acne stuff, and my breakouts seemed smaller.</li>
            <li>I had been using Neutrogena face wash with a tiny amount of Oil of Olay moisturizer, but had frequent breakouts and always felt like my skin was either too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li>I once suffered from major and minor brake outs but not anymore.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and an extreme dislike for strongly-scented products, so I was hesitant about trying this product.</li>
            <li>but my skin is very sensitive, I&#x27;ve tried going bank to other face washes</li>

            <li> and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, kind of woodsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I first received this in the sample bottle, and honestly, I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with it.</li>
            <li> This face wash is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling amazing without any irritation or tightness.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product, just doesn&#x27;t work with my skin.</li>
            <li> Well as a manly man, I&#x27;m proud to admit that this is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Nice cleanser.</li>
            <li> I will begin by stating that I have never had problem skin of any kind, no acne, no blotches, no wrinkles, and</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister and she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey</li>
            <li> There is some kind of oil in there which helps melt away the makeup.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t feel drying after you wash your face and has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> Nice scent too.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m kind of in between acne prone skin and the need for anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> It has a creamy consistency and a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> is nice</li>
            <li> nice &amp;#34;spa-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love all there products I use this on my face, gives a nice healthy glow and very nice</li>
            <li> Also you can clean your makeup brushes with it and it works great.</li>
            <li> It takes my eye make up off very easily.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, gives my face a nice glow.</li>
            <li> After looking online, I found that this cleanser was one of the most popular ones</li>
            <li> so far the best face wash I have been used!</li>
            <li> Arrived days early, perfectly intact.  </li>
            <li> It is the best cleanser I have found so far for my face.  </li>
            <li> Makeup remover is great and leaves me with a fresh face</li>
            <li> I am surprised as to how great this stuff works!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing to use to clean my makeup brushes and a great facewash, can be used in place of makeup remover for sure.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended product!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> The first couple of days using this was great.</li>
            <li> It has evened out my complection and leaves it feeling  very smooth.</li>
            <li> I have so many great products from philosophy, and it is such a great company, but purity made simple is the best product from philosophy that I have.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my skin seems to have a mind of its own, and adapt to things easily, meaning something will work for 2 months and then just stop working, and I&#x27;ll start breaking out again.</li>
            <li> The large container is a great value.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have even bought Dermoligica stuff, but this is wayyygy better.</li>
            <li> Gentle, smells good and leaves skin feeling absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be blown away :)</li>
            <li> I also bought some more products from philosophy</li>
            <li> so maybe in combination I&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; :) skin.</li>
            <li> After all of the rave reviews on this product I really thought it was going to be great to use.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many acne products and cleansers including prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried many over my 53 years.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure to buy it at a place you can return it at if you have breakouts or a reaction as a result of using this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li> This is very calming and works great.</li>
            <li> Also this leaves me with healthy feeling, porcelain looking skin and even skin tone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a face wash like many others.  </li>
            <li> This is simply the best face wash i have ever found.</li>
            <li> Initially, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.</li>
            <li> , this cleanser is OK, once again it just may have been my skin type.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser as I do every Philosophy product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Do what the say and massage it in, and your skin will feel much better day by day.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the perfect facewash my entire life.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love to pair it with their Hope in  a Jar moisturizer before I apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, and they love it.  </li>
            <li> Just another cleanser that probably made me break out even more.</li>
            <li> My 8 oz bottle lasts more than 5 months.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> Philosophy Purity is the best daily cleanser I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, have been using for years.</li>
            <li> Just takes some getting used to since it doesn&#x27;t foam like most cleansers.</li>
            <li> and I could not believe how much better my face felt.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite facewash of all time.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> Its the same great product!</li>
            <li> You must rub your eyes for a minute or two with water with the wash to make sure all of the makeup comes off.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser that I have used.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> I still love the product</li>
            <li> and I found a better and cheaper face cleaning and moisturizing product at Walmart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> What more could a girl ask for?  </li>
            <li> Was this an allergic reaction to something I ate, I wondered, because I refused to believe that this wonderful company that &amp;#34;celebrates the beauty of the human spirit&amp;#34; with products that &amp;#34;enhance your skin and well-being with multitasking benefits&amp;#34; could be the culprit.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel sexy</li>
            <li> The 16 oz bottle is more affordable than the clarisonic cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I initially experienced Purity Made Simple 7 years ago and loved the cleanser at the time.  </li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Made out of more chemicals that the &amp;#34;Purity&amp;#34; title would leave you to believe.</li>
            <li> And to top it off, it made my face oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t use my money.</li>
            <li> When I do wear makeup, it stays on better, lasts longer, and doesn&#x27;t rub off my nose and chin</li>
            <li> and it feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> So I ordered it more than a month ago and have been using it since it arrive.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> A WAY better deal for something I use all the time.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Wish we would have found many years ago.</li>
            <li> and it is outstanding.</li>
            <li> this is the best facial cleanser i have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Most of them can&#x27;t remove all of my makeup</li>
            <li> This is the very best facial cleanser on the market.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite face cleaner of all times..</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a month, and my skin has never looked better.</li>

            <li> This is one of the best facial cleansers that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten my acne under control after having used many prescibed cleansers that overdried.  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I love purity, it never breaks my skin out</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this face wash.</li>
            <li> Your complexion is smoother and looks so much better.</li>
            <li> My husband noticed and told me my skin looked better since i started using it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I just love this face wash.</li>
            <li> Will buy more again :)</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and there is nothing better that I have found.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite aspect of this product is that it removes all traces of makeup in ONE wash.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> Nice, light scent.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li> I always thought that the answer to breaking out was more medicated washes, something like Proactiv (which I tried many moons ago).</li>
            <li> Started out with the sample size and that was when I discovered this perfect facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser of all time.</li>
            <li> always love this product.  </li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this stuff is able to penetrate the skin membrane and damage your collagen</li>
            <li> to give you more in depth criticism of this product is...</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I will be looking for more products.  </li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, it takes off all my eye makeup from the lids and lashes.</li>
            <li> Since I began using Purity 4 years ago, I haven&#x27;t tried anything else, it has a pleasant smell, washing off any and all makeup, its great in the winter as it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and it washes off my waterproof mascara that even eye makeup remover doesn&#x27;t always do.</li>
            <li> I love the smell; it&#x27;s very clean.  </li>
            <li> It just leaves a nice squeaky clean face.</li>
            <li> My skin felt really nice and clean.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and I have beautiful and resilient skin.</li>
            <li> but it left this residue in my fine lines that not even the best exfoliator and moisturizer can get rid off.</li>
            <li> Definitely financially best to buy the large size, works out much cheaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> An 8 ounce bottle easily lasts three months or more.</li>
            <li> takes everything off, easy to use and leaves skin feeling hydrated without feeling too oily...with buy again for sure</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, but I also heard this was one of the best out there.</li>
            <li> Extremely gentle on the skin, this cleanser leave my face feeling clean, fresh, and best of all, hydrated!</li>
            <li> I love many of the Philosophy products, this is a fabulous face wash</li>
            <li> best facial cleanser available</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin types like mine!</li>
            <li> Bonus--I use this to clean my makeup brushes..works like a charm!</li>
            <li> it leave my face feeling squeaky clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Pair with a Clarisonic for an even deeper clean!</li>
            <li> This has a nice clean scent and a light texture.</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair, and always looked so splotchy and irritated that I never left the house without wearing foundation to cover it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> A small amount is all that&#x27;s needed :) I definitely suggest this face wash, and would recommend Beauty bridge for their excellent service (I placed my order on the 15th &amp; received it on the 18th, impressive!)</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was a \\&quot;purge\\&quot; reaction, my skin becoming \\&quot;pure\\&quot;, and perhaps it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> great value, cap came cracked but we used old bottle cap</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this when I purchased another item and loved it so much had to buy the bottle.</li>
            <li> this is such a good product!</li>
            <li> best thing about it is that it is not harsh and it makes tour face feel nice and soft, and clean as well, with no tightening, drying effect.</li>
            <li> It got mascara off like I had never been able to get it off before, and my face did feel as though I had used toner; it did not feel tight,just clean.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the delicately clean smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild though, so I would recommend removing makeup before using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li> It removes all your makeup easily.</li>
            <li> but my hands, even around my eyes, and the mascara on my eyelashes comes off so easily.</li>
            <li> Some that I had tried irritated my skin easily and others I tried didn&#x27;t remove the make up that well.</li>
            <li> and it removes my makeup easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying but removes dirt and makeup easily.  </li>
            <li> Gets makeup off easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the scent is strong and I can still smell</li>
            <li> This stuff has a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> it leave my face filling very clean, smooth, and oil free.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on the packaging or shipping, but the product itself at first seemed really nice.  </li>
            <li> I continued with the cleanser for a full month (remember, I used to love it) without seeing an improvement.  </li>
            <li> This face wash is hands down the best I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fine&#x27;, &#x27;this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin&#x27;</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and always leaves my skin perfectly balanced-- never dry or oily.</li>
            <li> As a guy I don&#x27;t have makeup to remove, but I find this to be a very nice and easy to use daily face cleanser.  </li>
            <li> First many people rave how this product completely clears your skin of make and that it&#x27;s even great to clean your make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Philosophy, I&#x27;ve been using Purity for about two years now.</li>
            <li> I would get huge cystic pimples around my chin, on the corners of my mouth, and in between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> or so I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> In two days, a huge improvement was seen.</li>
            <li> I needed a cleanser that was NOT oil free and would also remove makeup.</li>
            <li> When paired with the Hope in a Jar lotion it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This soap is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I use it before i shave and it makes shaving a smooth experience.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling cleansed, refreshed, and smooth.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is great when you need to get all that gunk off your face without being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleanser is gentle but effective, but way too pricey for a face cleanser.</li>
            <li> it was fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so smooth after I use it.  </li>
            <li> At the time of this review I paid about 27.50 here on Amazon with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I do like the light scent, and also use the Purity cloths at night before bed.</li>
            <li> and it does a nice job of cleaning off products gently and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle, yet effective, that you can rub it across your eyes with no problem.</li>
            <li> Great makeup remover and facial wash.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so smooth after use.</li>
            <li> I loved the savings on my favorite facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash, mild and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to like this since Philosophy is a good name and many other reviewers loved it, plus I invested in the large bottle.  </li>
            <li> Truth be told, many of the reviews were right.</li>
            <li> , Girls, if you&#x27;re cross shopping for any philosophy, Amazon pretty much always has the best prices plus free shipping :]</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the clean fresh feeling it leaves.</li>
            <li> It cleanses thoroughly, leaves my oily skin fresh and clean, plus it smell fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE all kinds of skin products and cosmetics, tried many and while I can say this is a decent one</li>
            <li> It gets all the makeup and oil off my face easily, but it feels really mild and creamy.  </li>
            <li> absolutely leaves your skin beautiful, clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> This product is NOT travel friendly.</li>
            <li> It is worth the hype!</li>
            <li> First of all, I LOVE what is written on the front.</li>
            <li> i first bought this at ulta and love it</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Originally I received a sample of this as part of a beauty shipment.</li>
            <li> worth the price for a known product that works!</li>
            <li> My wife originally bought this for her, but after trying it I&#x27;ve become a fan myself.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many YouTube gurus rave about this product but never thought it necessary because of the price, but I wish I did sooner because the amount of money I have used in CVS/Walgreens hoping to find the perfect facial makeup cleanser, could have probably been put to use in buying this holy grail product!  </li>
            <li> By far the BEST facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I feel clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> and I like my cleanser to clean well</li>
            <li> Before buying I thought it was a cream cleanser that doesn&#x27;t foam up, and worried it doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li> While this didn&#x27;t sting my face like everything index the sun and did clean</li>
            <li> I used this cleanser with my clarosonic brush and after washing my faces I would try to clean my clarosonic brush with it and the make would not come of my brush.</li>
            <li> which is awesome, because I spent so much time dabbing on concealers and powder to hide my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets your face clean.  </li>
            <li> Use it to clean my makeup brushes...</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after washing with Purity.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is that it was free, a bottle was given to me by a friend.</li>
            <li> I use a Clarisonic and it leaves my face feeling hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin &amp; read great reviews about this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face clean of all makeup including mascara.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> you wear a non-waterproof mascara, this cleanser will clean your lashes as well.</li>
            <li> clean feeling</li>
            <li> Skin always feels so clean</li>
            <li> use the aria + cleanser every night, &amp; my face feels so squeaky clean when I&#x27;m falling asleep</li>
            <li> I do like how clean it makes your skin feel</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling clean, refreshed, and doesn&#x27;t take away moisture.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean w/o any residue&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I read it every day and it gives me a positive feeling. :)</li>
            <li> Its a true clean.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the right amount of moisture in my skin when I use it!</li>
            <li> It has a really nice subtle smell, and seemed to cleanse my face well and does a great job at removing makeup, however after continuing use for about 2 months</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves my skin clean, soft and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li> Gentle cleanser washes clean, needs more work to remove mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other moisture-rich products have left me feeling like I still had a glaze of something on my skin, but a good rinse always leaves my face feeling clean of all product.</li>
            <li> Have been using Purity for a full year and will never be without it.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it does not smell good.</li>
            <li> It cleans without drying out, and I feel light and fresh after using it.  </li>
            <li> thank you so much :)</li>
            <li> I really believe it&#x27;s kept me looking more youthful.</li>
            <li> It had my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ve finally found my answer to good skin. . .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> #34;You get what you pay for,&amp;#34; and in this case, it is really true.</li>
            <li> It has a nice mellow scent, it both cleanses and tones, and it has no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for sensitive, acne-prone, dry skin.</li>
            <li> i purchase this as a recommendation to use along my clarisonic mia 2, and i love it, it leaves my oily skin feeling clean and fresh, and removes make up like no other, excellent to save a few steps of my nightly routine.</li>
            <li> The facial cleanser is pure and does a great job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and fresh too.</li>
            <li> The scent is so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It has been more vibrant and glowing since I have used this.</li>
            <li> Unless you have super oily skin, I would recommend this cleanser to anyone.</li>
            <li> My skin is nice and soft and calm after using the Purity.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra $ for good quality face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to trust this brand more and more.</li>
            <li> The scent is really mild and nice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Including prescriptions and the most high end products..spending thousands on my skin.</li>
            <li> thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This creame version of facial wash is nice, but the foam formula is better and much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing how this cleanser removes all makeup without drying the skin--works better than I expected!  </li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Macys and was so happy when I found it on Amazon for slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild, smells fine and cleans my face up really, really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink pop, and I eat pretty good, so there was no outside cause to this.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, non-greasy, gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE how soft it makes your skin!</li>
            <li> This is my second order, I love it!</li>
            <li> The lather was just right, and I saw more make-up come off on my Clarisonic brush than normal.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and breaks out really easy, fortunately this cleanser did not irritate my skin at all</li>
            <li> This is by far the best face wash I have ever used; it does not dry out my skin at all and has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> Heard great reviews about this face wash &amp; bought the little sample size.</li>
            <li> I follow-up up with a cleanser that has acne medication just because I need to treat my acne, but I am sure for those who do not have acne issues like me, this cleanser would be fine to serve as the only cleanser in your skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much make up and though in the summer I do enjoy a suntan with sunscreen protected skin, I by no means am a sun worshipper.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic, gentle, milky product.</li>
            <li> Makes the price worth it.</li>
            <li> it melts makeup off my face and leaves me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling nice and clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it out either.</li>
            <li> but I feel it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> , I like aveeno ultra sensitive foaming face wash better than this because this has a touch of scent to it</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I decided to buy the larger size online.</li>
            <li> On a popular beauty site it was 32 bucks for this same size plus shipping.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I came to Amazon and ordered a big bottle.  </li>
            <li> It acts as a powerful cleanser and is worth the money</li>
            <li> I think it is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash so far.</li>
            <li> and I always say Purity is the foundation of it all because you have to have an excellent facial cleanser at the base, and this one is superb.</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;m looking for is cleanse without irritating my skin, and this one meets my need perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never unhappy with a Philosophy product.</li>
            <li> Worth getting.</li>
            <li> and it takes away dirt from the day and my face feels fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> This winter I noticed my skin was changing becoming more dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle but still gets rid of all the makeup even mascara!</li>
            <li> I have tried neutrogena, biore, proactive, clearasil, acne free, and clean and clear, but nothing compares to this facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using my face looks mostly okay but doesn&#x27;t feel clean (and I only use mineral powder or bb cream).</li>
            <li> It is a simple way to keep my skin clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Purity may be all right for oiler skin</li>
            <li> Gentle, yet makes my face feel clean and</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel very refreshed &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Its so gentle that I can use it on my eyes to clean my make up off</li>
            <li> Kiehl&#x27;s: Rosa Arctica lightweight moisturizer (daily wear, great for foundation application), rare earth pore cleansing mask (there&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t beat with a quick drying mud mask), &amp; their overnight biological peel (for the love of god, get a sample of this stuff - It has a small concentration of hydrogen peroxide that makes your skin tingle and</li>
            <li> But anyways it leaves my face feeling soft, clean and fresh after!</li>
            <li> I have tried numersous products, both cheap and high end, for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Has a very light scent and does not dry her skin out.</li>
            <li> I bought the 16oz bottle of this for $32 after reading several great reviews and after hearing from a few friends that use and love it.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin that easily breaks out if my skin is either too dry or too oily, and Purity has worked better for me than anything at keeping my skin clear, hydrated, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face extremely oily or dry, but the perfect balance.</li>
            <li> After seeing so many good reviews about it, I decided to try it and even though it is a bit expensive, it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> This cleanser feels very creamy and gentle on the skin and has a somewhat herbal or medicinal smell that I actually enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Never use anything else - if you&#x27;re looking for a one step facial cleanser that is gentle, yet effective to remove the heaviest makeup, including mascara, this is for you.  </li>
            <li> Simple easily removes all my makeup (including mascara) and leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally feel that this face wash is gentle or effective.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve happily used the Philosophy line of 3-in-1 body washes but since they are on the expensive side, I use the product sparingly and seldom treat myself to more than 3 bottles a year.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I expect this review will be unpopular, but I&#x27;m really just being honest with how the product affected me personally, and I may or may not be alone in my experience.  </li>
            <li> Clarisonic + Purity Made Simple&#x3D; good clear skin</li>
            <li> great to have all around, my 3rd big bottle.</li>
            <li> Not a few, not small pimples, huge bright red pimples!</li>
            <li> it lasts a good two or three months and isn&#x27;t priced much higher than your typical drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and so this cleanser is very gentle on it.</li>
            <li> but this product actually flared up my very light case of Rosacia</li>
            <li> Very gentle on your face while it removes all your makeup.  </li>
            <li> This product is very gentle without lacking the ability to get all of the day&#x27;s dirt and makeup off of my face.</li>
            <li> version!&lt;br /&gt;This takes off all my waterproof makeup, and does so very very gently.  </li>
            <li> I originally was looking for the philosophy purity oil free facial cleanser but found this one and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> My face is clean without a lot of extra steps and is blemish free.</li>
            <li> skin has never felt so clean, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have more clear natural skin.</li>
            <li> dissolves my makeup, leaves face feeling clean and fresh and not tight.</li>
            <li> My pores aren&#x27;t smaller, I have been breaking out more</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m blaming the hot weather?), and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel softer.</li>
            <li> Anything I am looking for I always look on Amazon first.</li>
            <li> Purity is the first Philosophy product I have used.</li>
            <li> I spoke with a salesperson at Ulta who said this is what Purity does when you first start using it because its cleansing your skin and pushing out the dirt.</li>
            <li> This face wash is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> She loved it and could tell a difference within the first few times using it.  </li>
            <li> and I am able to avoid using multiple products because of the one-step product.  </li>
            <li> Will make your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My first time this brand</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> For the price there are several better options.  </li>
            <li> Will most definitely purchase this again!  </li>
            <li> Glad I finally found it,</li>
            <li> This product may be ok for someone else, but it did not lather enough for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite daily cleanser.  </li>
            <li> and it was an absolute nightmare!  </li>
            <li> Such a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> My first thought was &amp;</li>
            <li> First of all it smells exactly like</li>
            <li> After the first day I could tell this just was not working for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend trying the 4oz sample bottle first-</li>
            <li> I first purchased it December 2012..</li>
            <li> , that is also next to a patch of more oily skin, and so on and so forth...</li>
            <li> It came with a trial-size Hope in a Jar moisturizer (purported to &amp;#34;moisturize, hydrate and provide antioxidant protection, while improving skin texture&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> recommend buying it if you&#x27;re looking for a cleanser that makes your skin not only feel healthy, but clears it up.</li>
            <li> and it worked wonders at first...</li>
            <li> Plus it is also gentle on my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> my skin is once again bright firm and supple.</li>
            <li> Really miss it!</li>
            <li> stuff, thanks Veroz!</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I just received it today and used it for the first time while taking a shower.</li>
            <li> but I always make sure that I use makeup removing facial wipes, for instance;</li>
            <li> It does have a funny smell; I associate it with mosquito spray, so I was a bit worried to begin with</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I no longer have any acne, my skin is smooth and looks fresh, and I don’t need to use exfoliating products any more to get off my dead skin.</li>
            <li> Great prduct that works well for me and no more burning eyes!</li>
            <li> Great gentle non-foaming cleanser..we use them with the Extra Gentle Buf Puf facial sponge.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, smooth, acne free, and looking better than it has in a few years.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and soft, and I would dare to compare the results of this product to the results I get from a certain well known acne treatment.  </li>
            <li> B005BJ69V4 Clean &amp; Clear Cream Cleanser]]</li>
            <li> Aveeno, Clean &amp; Clear, Biore, Neutrogena - you name it</li>
            <li> Your skin feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It removes all of my makeup including eyeliner and mascara without burning my eyes and leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> It removes my makeup and leaves my face feeling completely clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li> I have tried many over the years &amp; keep coming back to this one, reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> Super easy on your skin, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the job done, but it still cleanses well and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li> OVERALL, I&#x27;m in love with this stuff and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I recently made the leap from small trial size bottle to a full size bottle of Purity, and it is great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mildly scented, a little goes a long way, and it does a great job of removing makeup and thoroughly cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> have normal skin (not too dry or oily) and this feels like a nice, gentle cleanse.  </li>
            <li> I found this cleanser on amazon by looking at highly rated ones from other buyers and I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Item was shipped as promised quickly and completely intact</li>
            <li> I was previously using and loving the Arbonne line, but for the cost I&#x27;ll keep using this product instead.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleanses my skin, it feels soothing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to wipe off with a towel, but sometimes I need to use a makeup remover wipe- which defeats the purpose of a one step cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems pure, just as the title says.</li>
            <li> I use this for my morning shaves plus a mix of pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This and the Pure Grace items are what keep me buying Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had a small travel size of this and began using it since the packaging was cute, and I&#x27;ve found my skin actually looks better after using this consistently, so I bought a bigger size. :)</li>
            <li> It smells great and you only need to use a little.</li>
            <li> By far favorite face wash.. I break out easily and I also have sensitive skin due to ezcema and this wash saves my life.</li>
            <li> soap is huge and will last forever.  </li>
            <li> my wife uses this product and really like it.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> They are on the pricey side, so I definitely expected much better quality.</li>
            <li> I found Purity Made Simple at a fantastic price and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li> Works really well with clarisonic</li>
            <li> It is really a one-step cleanser.</li>
            <li> You can really feel it dissolving your makeup, and  it leaves your skin oil-free.</li>
            <li> very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much truth there...</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really cleans  the makeup off my face with and does not irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> while washing it has a slimy texture, it doesn&#x27;t foam up unless you were to really make an attempt</li>
            <li> I really like how it does not strip your skin</li>
            <li> Women have to much to buy as it is in life and 30 + dollars for face cleanser is too much.</li>
            <li> .. gentle</li>
            <li> This product was recommended in Sophora because it cleanses as well as removes eye makeup really well.</li>
            <li> These products did not defy age, nor did the cleanser &amp;#34;gently cleanse, tone and melt away all face and eye makeup in one simple step, while lightly hydrating the skin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I wash, rinse and wash it again gentle.  </li>
            <li> Foundation, blush, not so much.  </li>
            <li> She loves it so much she uses it on her whole body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to have to give this back to her and let her enjoy it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s  quite gentle.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleanser that does not scratch or scrub.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin SO much softer and has helped get rid of my redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a light feel to it but cleanses so well that my skin actually glows after using it.  </li>
            <li> It is much cheaper at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have problematic skin</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup but was gentle and non stripping.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Gentle, cleansing and moisturizing...</li>
            <li> cleanser is a standard cleanser that I keep available at all</li>
            <li> (not so much for waterproof mascara)&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> your face all de-greazed and ready for the day.  </li>
            <li> High recommend it!</li>
            <li> milky, lathers easily, gentle, leaves your skin hydrated and not feeling dry/tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the blemishes I do have go away much faster</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had heard so much about it.</li>
            <li> I really like how my face feels after using it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> purity indicative of being gentle?</li>
            <li> It does it all and is so gentle on my eyes.</li>
            <li> It left my skin silky smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt without any residue leftover from my makeup.</li>
            <li> If you have combo skin, I highly recommend this face wash!</li>
            <li> Love this simple &amp; complete way to wash my face &amp; remove all traces of make-up ♡♡♡</li>
            <li> For example, Burts Bees makes a sensitive facial cleaner that I&#x27;m now using and LOVE.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical to try it because the reviews sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I believe this cleanser would work well for all skin types unless your skin is super, super dry.</li>
            <li> It has a gentle fragrance and after using it daily you can really notice a difference in how clean your skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time, I said WOW!  </li>
            <li> Cleanses makeup off face better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> In my opinion there are other drug store product that are cheaper and work way better then this product.</li>
            <li> Noxzema Deep Cleansing Cream, Original - 14 oz]]</li>
            <li> I continue to buy this product solely because it removes make-up better than any other cleanser or make-up remover I have tried.</li>
            <li> but once I got past that I love it!</li>
            <li> I have also heard that the formula has changed, which, while I cannot judge that as a new user of this product, It seems that for the price, there should be a lot more oils and natural ingredients in it, instead of just standard detergents.</li>
            <li> This is the  only cleanser that I have ever had that cleans without drying and my face still feels clean.</li>
            <li> Never dries me out &amp; allways leaves me completely clean with no film left over.</li>
            <li> It definitely dissolves all the make I have on my face and leaves it feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> I am a big clean freak when it comes to removing make-up or cleansing my face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> While this is easily the most expensive item, per ounce, in my bathroom, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean and is the only cleanser that can handle my breakouts and control my flare-ups</li>
            <li> Clears up acne quickly, cuts through makeup and dirt, and does not dry your skin out.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle and leaves your skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> My mom is devoted to this stuff, so when I recently saw that QVC was having a $70 special buy for two of the 32 ounce bottles, I splurged and got one for her, and one for me to try it</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and have been using oil free products for years, not knowing how much it was drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> This Purity cleanser is simple and easy, and leaves my face feeling soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The parabens are there for shelf life, however, and that&#x27;s good because a 16 ounce will last me a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t promise that this will work for everyone, but for my skin, which is dry, slightly sensitive, and breaks out due to hormones/stress, it worked great for me.</li>
            <li> so evidently it keeps my face clear as well.  </li>
            <li> Naturally I was interested in a product that would reverse the signs of aging, and improve the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> my tried and true Philosophy Purity Made Simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to keep my face clean only to find it oily at mid day and more pimples by the next day.</li>
            <li> It smells a little more medicinal than it used to, but I REALLY can&#x27;t find anything that comes close to it.  </li>
            <li> It is the only facial cleanser I will use and the bottle is pretty enough to look nice on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Less drying, better smell and WAY</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look at this as a scented product, so I am glad the slightly odd smell does not stay with you after using it.  </li>
            <li> Now i have the 16oz and half the ownership - my husband has also fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product it lasts for AGES because you only have to use a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> One thing I would suggest to anyone buying a larger bottle of this product, be careful the product is a bit runny, so the flip top cap on the 16oz bottle tends to gush far more than you need for one application (especially if you are juggling the bottle in the shower like I do).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price and keeps my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li> hardly ever get blemishes any more!</li>
            <li> I have started using the Rodan and Fields Redefine - but I need a makeup melt cleanser which R&amp;F does not offer particularly for eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have been a loyal user of Purity cleanser for several years now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleansers in my 60 years, and this is the only one that:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I initially tried a small sample from Ulta and loved it so much that I went with this 16-oz full-size</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone on the fence about this.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school and college</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products for those of you struggling with combo skin.</li>
            <li> We both feel that it leaves our complexions smooth and clear, and we&#x27;ll be buying a new bottle as soon as this one starts running low.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> price may seem a little high compared to drug store cleansers, but the bottle lasts a long time so it&#x27;s in deed a good value.</li>
            <li> now my skin is clear and I only use makeup for special occasions.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean without feeling overly dry.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean, but not too dry father use.</li>
            <li> I have very fussy, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It cleanses well but is gentle, with no harsh dyes or perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have discontinued using this product, and switched to Exuviance cleansing creme and my face already feels better after just a few days.  </li>
            <li> After giving one of these away as a gift along with a 3in1 shower gel, I ran out of my normal cleanser, and opened the Purity I had put away for myself.</li>
            <li> I have fairly normal skin --</li>
            <li> Within 3 days my face developed whiteheads and pimples, much more so than average.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for normal to oily skins.</li>
            <li> that i decided it was time to spend money on something good that will benefit my skin (and maybe even reverse the effects of my poor skin maintenance).</li>
            <li> Very gentle and does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> This thing not only peeled my face right off</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took about a month for my skin to get used to it, and at first I wasn’t convinced it was worth it; however, once my skin got used to it, I will not use any other face wash out there.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, I break out in many huge, red, cystic, painful pimples all over my face but mostly on my chin and around my mouth, also in my hairline and between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It washes off all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling very clean without the sting some alcohol heavy cleansers leave.</li>
            <li> QVC shows live demos of this cleanser removing make up.</li>
            <li> I received a 2 oz sample of this in my new beauty test tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 7 years after I saw on television HSN about new products &amp;#34;Philosophy&amp;#34; in 1994.  </li>
            <li> Pimples, whiteheads and blackheads aren&#x27;t new to me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product, and have began stocking up by the liter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but it seems effective.</li>
            <li> I bought the largest available size of this product over a year ago and I am still using that same bottle (it was a BIG one).</li>
            <li> No matter what other cleanser I try, I keep coming back to this one, and I loved the 16 ounce size...kind of jumbo, but easier to handle than the 32 ounce I was getting for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but have had no problems with it at all.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother-in-law who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It melts away make-up easily, is gentle on the skin, and leaves it REALLY clean without feeling tight.</li>
            <li> Ill make further updates as I see fit, hopefully the results continue to be positive :)</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the two mix so well, but it&#x27;s surely a match made in cosmetic heaven.</li>
            <li> No harsh smells or chemicals!</li>
            <li> I was excited to finally have a facial cleanser to melt away makeup</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been pretty under control for the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> Philosophy is the first makeup cleansing removing that actually does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always simply used Dove soap to clean my face, I&#x27;ve never used other products, and I don&#x27;t even know why I keep giving this bottle more tries!</li>
            <li> This is so ridiculous that it wants more words to post this.</li>
            <li> Although I was concerned about the price being too high at first, it lasts a really long time .While</li>
            <li> which is kind of hard to find on a facewash bottle!</li>
            <li> I get pimples a little more than normal and this cleanser is gentle enough to not dry out my skin completely with the combination of my acne medication.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it now about 5 different times, thinking maybe I just need to get past an initial breakout for it to start giving me good results.</li>
            <li> I have used several philosophy products before, and I believe that they really try to live a &amp;#34;philosophy&amp;#34; and are dedicated to quality.</li>
            <li> In the winter I take extra care with moisturizers anyway, so putting a little extra cream on the face after using this wasn&#x27;t a big deal just to get rid of the dryness, but I&#x27;m not so sure that for the price it is worth it at all.  </li>
            <li> And with the price of this stuff, that would be a huge waste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really helped to clear my teenagers skin when used with the Buf Fuf facial sponge.</li>
            <li> I never had to use a cleanser to keep my face clear.  </li>
            <li> I am using the Purity and alternating with the clear days ahead line.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin clear without over drying.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else cleans the makeup off my face but still keeps it soft.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping my skin would be clear as an adult.  </li>
            <li> I had seen several presentations on this on QVC, and wondered if it really did what was claimed.</li>
            <li> This works so well on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft afterwards and felt</li>
            <li> It is soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this made me break out.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s near the sink I also use it as a hand cleaner instead of buying separate liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it and I sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also, it leave your skin really soft and the pores has improve a lot.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as drying as the Purity, which surprised me, as it has exfoliator beads in it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and I never have to worry with Purity rather or not it&#x27;s going to break out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> has no trouble washing all of that off.</li>
            <li> I got mono, and my skin completely freaked out.</li>
            <li> In three weeks my skin was almost completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 8 ounce container lasted nearly a year.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled for years with adult acne</li>
            <li> My skin always feels soft from it too.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I was truly surprised</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin, and not like, &amp;#34; oh my t-zone is oily and my cheeks are dry,&amp;#34; or vise versa,</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of Earl Grey tea at first.</li>
            <li> Used for years on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning, and they were all over my forehead, up one whole side of my face, and on my chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now, and my skin is soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and need a product that doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> I only wish it didn&#x27;t have quite so much fragrance, which might be a deal-breaker for some people.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> a wash, your face feels moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a 24 year old woman, who was never too considerate of her problem skin until this year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a lot of skin care products to help prevent the things we don&#x27;t want as we age, and I love this cleanser because it is probably the ONLY thing I use that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have average skin (not oily nor dry), I tend to get a pimple once in a while and in stressful times I might break out a bit more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricy, but worth it!</li>
            <li> It has a light faint smell and makes my skin feel so refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> and I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight and overly dry after washing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too harsh, as my skin is sensitive and gets irritatingly dry when using most face washes.</li>
            <li> Still have enough from the first to last until December..</li>
            <li> (I do moisturize my face right after using it though, so that might&#x27;ve been other people&#x27;s problem).</li>
            <li> Acne Free, Aveeno, Olay, Dove, Clearasil, Neutrogena, exfoliating washes, super expensive stuff, etc.</li>
            <li> Finally, with this Purity Made Simple cleanser, I have found a product that is really helping to clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> Between this and the bareMinerals Purely Nourishing Moisturizer Ive been using, I&#x27;ve noticed not just a little clearing up of the skin but maybe also a little bit more of a softer, younger glow...</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with some dry patches in the winter, but this face wash seems to balance that out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of dry skin along with acne and this really has helped my face.</li>
            <li> Purity Made Simple is SO gentle that you can open your eyes while washing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, clear, and my skin tone is finally starting to even out</li>
            <li> so I ordered it and have seen a major improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say if it made me break out worse for any amount of time in the beginning since I was such a hot mess, but within about three weeks my skin cleared up, and when I say cleared up, I mean it looks the best it has EVER looked.</li>
            <li> first, I felt like this cleanser was a little too drying, and I&#x27;d use moisturizer afterward because otherwise it felt kind of tight for a little while after using it.</li>
            <li> All you need is a small amount to clean face.</li>
            <li> A small peanut sized amount leaves skin clean and supple and it does remove makeup modestly.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I still get the occasional tiny zit, but overall my face is so clear now that I have actually gone out with no makeup on a few times and felt like I looked OK.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this the first cleaner I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight and blotchy.</li>
            <li> the rest of my face is fine nothing out of the ordinary, its only my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several facial cleansers, mainly drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I left my pizza face in middle school and the beginning stages of high school.</li>
            <li> but I can generally predict when I&#x27;ll begin to see them.  </li>
            <li> I rinse with clear water then use a facecloth to remove any last traces then nothing else until I put on my moisturizer before bed.  </li>
            <li> My face was already clear prior to use.</li>
            <li> (Now having that said, let me just be clear that I use pretty heavy eye makeup during the day.)</li>
            <li> It has evened out my complexion, I barely have to wear make up</li>
            <li> My skins is so sensitive that almost EVERYTHING either breaks it out or turns it red.  </li>
            <li> As a result, my pores are smaller and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> Never expected this from Philosophy.</li>
            <li> After switching back to my old cleanser</li>
            <li> Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any more cysts while using the Purity..</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so this tiny bottle is still going strong after washing my face twice a day for a month.</li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for a facial cleanser, but I&#x27;ve found success in other Philosophy products and came into a little extra money, so</li>
            <li> Plus, you only need to use a little bit so the bottle should last you at least a good 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out afterwards--which is saying a lot for me, as I have sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin and has remedied my break outs!</li>
            <li> Now, I usually don&#x27;t write reviews unless the product is somewhat extraordinary and THIS, my friend, it is.</li>
            <li> It seems pricey but is high quality &amp; lasts a long time!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin balanced and soft, not tight or dry.</li>
            <li> There were no cracks and the cap was not loose.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin but this product leaves my nose oily for DAYS!</li>
            <li> My skin is much clearer and the redness and uneven appearance is almost gone completely.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it leaves some eyeliner left in my inner rim, which makes sense because I am not using soap directly on that area.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> No pimples and no dry skin and redness.</li>
            <li> Also its does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because of all the great reviews I saw on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve completely stopped using any acne stuff other than the spot treatment, and my skin has stayed clear.</li>
            <li> Will be going back to my holy grail bare minerals purifying cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Personally, when I first used this product I massaged it on my face without problem, but when I rinsed it off my skin felt tight and dry!&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Much cheaper here at Amazon vs other retailers!  </li>
            <li> This is a nice large size so don&#x27;t be afraid of the price!</li>
            <li> I like this formula, if you have sensitive skin it doesn&#x27;t dry it out or irritate it</li>
            <li> I wear no makeup, but still sometimes have adult acne problems, combined with rather dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> skin is dry and somewhat sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Both of us have combination / sensitive skin that gets dry after washing</li>
            <li> face stays soft and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin which is what I was looking to do.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, which is great considering how expensive it</li>
            <li> Now I buy it in the large bottle and fill up the little bottle when I&#x27;m going traveling.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product a couple of days but, in my case, that&#x27;s generally long enough to say because my skin is SO sensitive,</li>
            <li> I bought a small version of this cleanser a few years back to take with me on vacation and fell in love with the product.</li>
            <li> I woke up, and my skin felt smoother, it wasn&#x27;t as dry and sensitive from all the acne stuff, and my breakouts seemed smaller.</li>
            <li> I had been using Neutrogena face wash with a tiny amount of Oil of Olay moisturizer, but had frequent breakouts and always felt like my skin was either too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li> I once suffered from major and minor brake outs but not anymore.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and an extreme dislike for strongly-scented products, so I was hesitant about trying this product.</li>
            <li> but my skin is very sensitive, I&#x27;ve tried going bank to other face washes</li>
            <li> no more like I have a patch of oily skin right next to a patch of dry skin</li>
            <li> That hasn&#x27;t happened yet, and though my skin&#x27;s not perfect, it seems to be better than usual, and I don&#x27;t really get breakouts.</li>
            <li> and my face is starting to look normal again after a lot of work and medicated acne lotion, but I&#x27;ve still got a few pimples that don&#x27;t want to go away.</li>
            <li> I would like to note that when I first started this product I did have one nasty flare-up of pimples, but once healed I have been good since.</li>
            <li> My mother was having a hard time with facial cleansers irritating her eyes, and this is the only one she has found that is effective and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Philosophy clears your face right up and keeps you shine free throughout the day, even those crazy days before menses!</li>
            <li> , I believe there are out there better ones for much less (such as Naive Aloe Facial Cleansing Foam by Kracie - 110g for less than $7).</li>
            <li> but at the price it&#x27;s still cheaper than my previous facewash and so far (2 months later)</li>
            <li> I know that if you bought a facial cleanser and an eye makeup remover separately, you might pay the $32 anyway, but if it leaves my face dry and flakey, nothing terrific can be said for this product.  </li>
            <li> &quot; when I needed to really scrub out all the cigarette smoke from my pores, or nights I was too lazy to take off my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> try to do what they say on the front - to massage the facial cleanser in for 30-60 seconds - which seems like a long time when you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning or just want to get to bed at night.</li>
            <li> The product last for a long time too.</li>
            <li> size - will last a long time&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li> I have never had an acne problem, just the normal few pimples during that time of the month.</li>
            <li> But it also feels dry, so lotion is essential.</li>
            <li> I alternate with an exfoliate face scrub, but this product cleans thoroughly, and does not leave my face dry or oily.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a product that I&#x27;d only use during the winter months when I&#x27;m experiencing dry skin.  </li>
            <li> No more redness, no more bumps, and my skin is smooth, wrinkles diminished...</li>
            <li> But, I found this product many years ago and am afraid of only one thing...that they stop making it!  </li>
            <li> A quick swipe of a toner soaked cotton ball proved it false time and again.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a single bad thing about it, it&#x27;s my new &#x27;holy grail&#x27; cleanser :).</li>
            <li> Or perhaps, after spending so much money, I was embarrassed to admit my stupidity in diving in so deep, without first testing them out.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Purity Made Simple in conjunction with other Philosophy products such as Hope in a Jar and Microdelivery Peel for years, gosh over a decade.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle, but tough enough to remove waterproof make-up.  </li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> for a long time, which my girlfriend swears by,</li>
            <li> And I was getting pimples in strange places like the tip of my nose and around my eye sockets</li>
            <li> but it is way too harsh for sensitive, drier skin.</li>
            <li> Stopped using this product and face return to normal and no more skin peeling.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not too drying, evens out skin tone, keeps minor acne away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused as to how it provides a \\&quot;deep cleanse\\&quot; when it can&#x27;t even cut through the first layer of grime.  </li>
            <li> The Purity kept my face from getting too dry, breakouts were few and far between and healed faster.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t find other moisturizers EVER do the same!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a kit from another vendor and had it on auto delivery with several other Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products just to make a comparison, and have always gone back to Purity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other cleansers from time to time, but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the only Philosophy product I can use due to eye sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I tried this entire line and cause me SEVERE dry skin for weeks!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all, and it even seems to settle some of the redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and it&#x27;s the best of all the crap I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> it cleans yet doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> After washing, I don&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> and it does not leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> A product that isn&#x27;t going to dry my skin out to the point of severe --</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s combination dry during the colder months, combination oily during the warmer.  </li>
            <li> It will literally melt off all your makeup without making the skin too dry.  </li>
            <li> Does not over dry your skin. .......  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I have unbelievably dry skin but still get break outs from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have acne and my skin is both dry and oily...</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I had extremely dry skin and rosacea that were caused by the pill I was taking.  </li>
            <li> but I would say it verges on dry if I don&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or flaky.</li>
            <li> Cleans well but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser doesn&#x27;t ever bother or dry out my skin, and it&#x27;s a lot easier than using makeup remover AND cleanser.  </li>
            <li> but this product doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (oily in some parts and dry around the T zone)</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t see enough of a difference between this and any other skin cleanser to justify the steep price tag, especially when I can get 32 ounces of cetaphil cleanser for less than $17.</li>
            <li> I taped it down and put it back in my suitcase and went on a car trip.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is more expensive than the typical drugstore brand but a bottle lasts for months and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was breaking out using other products and i usually have very clear skin.</li>
            <li> and after using it for a week I began to notice that my face became extremely dry!  </li>
            <li> Decided to use this on my normal/slightly dry skin and WHOA!</li>
            <li> In my enthusiasm to switch to the Philosophy line of facial products, I ordered the ridiculously over-priced Time in a Bottle daily age-defying serum, and the Time in a Bottle daily age-defying eye serum from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has felt very dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like all the other cleansers do.</li>
            <li> I have extremely temperamental skin, which is both dry and acne prone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with cleansers in the past due to skin sensitivity and a tendency to feel dry after washing my face, but Philosophy&#x27;s Purity is the only product I&#x27;ll use as long as it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li> I was getting crazy huge pimples all around my mouth and chin area.</li>
            <li> It lasts so long because it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have strayed a few times but always come back.</li>
            <li> This cleanser can be used even to remove lash adhesive with absolutely no stinging.</li>
            <li> It lathers just enough to take off any makeup, even heavy eye shadow/liner.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> but it did not really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I tend not to order expensive products but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried using this recently for a few days morning and night.</li>
            <li> This cleanser dried out my face even further filling up and creating wrinkles and a saginess to my face that I NEVER had</li>
            <li> I had aged about 10 years after 1 week of this stuff.</li>
            <li> a year cause not much product is needed.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not real drying on the face.</li>
            <li> For reference my face is sensitive oily and clog prone, Acne prone especially with irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li> It does work for basic make-up, but I not really like it has dried out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way; so this bottle with last me a few months.</li>
            <li> I only need a small amount of the product for each time, I use it everyday, but I think the bottle will last for a while.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a high-end face wash, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing any favors for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so this size lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, it didn&#x27;t lather, and it just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything special.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Can leave my skin tight and dry</li>
            <li> but it doesnt leave my face feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> No more extra steps for toner and eye makeup remover, because Purity Made</li>
            <li> Although I switch out other beauty products,I will not even consider giving up his product.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like other cleansers, it slides around easier</li>
            <li> Not sure what the big deal is.  </li>
            <li> I still have blackheads and the occasional pimple, but the ones I get now are small and go away within a day or two.</li>
            <li> I ran out and used some other cleanser for a week</li>
            <li> I give up on every other cleanser.</li>
            <li> My face was extremely taught and even flaking in areas (nose, cheeks).  </li>
            <li> It can be pricey compared to grocery store brands, but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Have tried other products and keep returning to purity for a face wash.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other cleanser again.</li>
            <li> With other cleansers, I&#x27;d have to wash 3-4 times to remove all of my makeup</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other cleanser on my face.</li>
            <li> It works on very hard to remove make up and keep your skin clear!</li>
            <li> So, a 16oz bottle lasts a year, and this is with washing my face at least once, sometimes twice daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years, it works double duty...removes makeup with a small amount of Purity and rinsed with water</li>
            <li> Some of them are showing up in a line of three attached to each other!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t put any other face wash on my face!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, when I say my skin took revenge on me, I mean it - I lived out a solid two months feeling like a red-faced teenager</li>
            <li> Now I get to look forward to celebrating my 32nd birthday with huge red painful cysts on my face for everyone to see!</li>
            <li> never too dry, never too oily, not many break-outs --</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s also a few other things along with Philosophy and aria</li>
            <li> After using facial cleanser to wash my face, I do not have feel of tense in my face.</li>
            <li> I have typically just used whatever face wash</li>
            <li> IT HAS FREAKING BLACK PEPPER</li>
            <li> I am 27 and have found that my skin is a little less oily now, but still gets that way by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> tight-</li>
            <li> However this is a too expensive product for it not to live up to the hype and my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and it was a little bit of a problem before I started using this wash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product ever since - a little over 2 years as of this review.</li>
            <li> little goes a loooong way and it takes all my makeup off and leaves my skin feeling</li>
            <li> After 3 days the stinging was unbearable, and I now freely admit my stupid mistake.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea that regular Ponds Cold Cream would beat out such a product as Philosophy.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot; and not changed my line of facial products.</li>
            <li> I did find that it cleared up in my 20&#x27;s, but alas, now in my 30&#x27;s zits have come back to plague me with a vengeance.  </li>
            <li> My son started using it by accident when he used mine in the shower a few times and realized that it was clearing up his acne.</li>
            <li> After a lot of time and money wasted I came across this product on accident.</li>
            <li> It dried out my skin and caused breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I use it as my everyday cleanser even with no makeup on.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant on purchasing this cleanser, because a lot of reviews were saying how it dried their skin out.</li>
            <li> I thought the consistency was too heavy and creamy for me</li>
            <li> I am turning 32 in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this wash and decided to try it because my face was soooo dried out from purpose cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-purchased this a few times now</li>
            <li> w/ out a film left behind.  </li>
            <li> I received this product a few years ago as a gift.</li>
            <li> I was not a huge fan to begin with.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in my hands and rub it all over my face that has been previously dampened with water.</li>
            <li> lucky me :(  </li>
            <li> After using it a few times a week, I can say it works well as any $10 drug store cleanser, but dries my skin out so badly, that even putting eye cream and facial cream on afterward isn&#x27;t enough to take away the tight feeling my face has every time I use this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every morning I use Philosophy Purity face wash, Dermalogica Active Toner, and Complex 15 moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin often felt burning and raw after using it</li>
            <li> Simple IS my personal arsenal against bad skin.</li>
            <li> Had Noxema not changed their \\&quot;original\\&quot; scent from way back when, I would still be using that for a mere few bucks a jar.  </li>
            <li> Found this little sucker.</li>
            <li> The product I was using was expensive and had several steps to it.  </li>
            <li> I do not use waterproof mascara, so I&#x27;m not sure if it would remove that without irritation.)  </li>
            <li> the 8 oz bottle was a just a stocking stuffer a few Christmas holidays ago, it is now a must have!</li>
            <li> but showing the usual wear &amp; tear of 50+ years &amp; sun-bathing abuse from my teens.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.  </li>
            <li> No more oily Rudolph look--</li>
            <li> I usually use this at night before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m admittedly lazy about washing my face at night--I don&#x27;t like using a makeup remover AND using a separate cleanser afterwards</li>
            <li> To start off with, this stuff is disgustingly OVERPRICED, considering how many damaging ingredients there are in this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser in the past.</li>
            <li> This plus the Mia 2&#x3D; No more acne.</li>
            <li> if all of the other oils filling in this junk product weren&#x27;t irritating enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used a ton of face washes after having pretty bad sick in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but I have to admit that the lotion doesn;t seem as thick as it did when I had purchased the small bottle in the store.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever get any blemishes.</li>
            <li> I can finally say goodbye to those deep, painful, embarrassing blemishes!</li>
            <li> so it hard for me to find face products that do the job without causing irritation.</li>
            <li> cleanser removes all my makeup without having to scrub hard, and I wear waterproof eyeliners.</li>
            <li> My skin felt dirty, pores were larger, face seemed irritated.</li>
            <li> I was starting to get desperate, but after a night out, I used the Purity and went to bed.</li>
            <li> my late 20&#x27;s my face has started to break out around my chin.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> Sitting here again after using it daily for the past 5days, my face is stinging and painful from all the pimples on it, extremely uncomfortable, and very dry.</li>
            <li> Because of this regimen my skin has been drying out worse and worse and I&#x27;ve finally gotten to the point that I&#x27;ve seen plenty enough evidence [at 25 :( ]</li>
            <li> This bottle is expensive and just like any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> No more breakouts!</li>
            <li> and I mean SEVERE -- itching and flaking.  </li>
            <li> After 2 days of using this I had 3 major, painful cysts come up.</li>
            <li> The face wash was very small.  </li>
            <li> I know it is a little on the expensive side</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical but after using Purity for a couple a days I was sold.</li>
            <li> Frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> I am overall really disappointed with all of the Philosophy products that I have tried lately.</li>
            <li> And while it might seem expensive, it&#x27;s really not too bad when you realize how little of the stuff you have to use.</li>
            <li> It removes every last bit of makeup, oil, and other nasty things from my pores.</li>
            <li> I have decreased my breakouts maybe one pimple a month now</li>
            <li> Something in this was quite irritating and didn&#x27;t wash off my face probably.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any negatives with my skin from using this product.</li>
            <li> However, when I tried it, it felt slightly irritating and smelled a lot like bug spray.</li>
            <li> Stay away from this crap, or at least test it carefully before putting it all over your face.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a cold cream cleanser to remove my make up before I wash it</li>
            <li> Very subtle smell,</li>
            <li> and, when I need to wash off my eye makeup, shampoo and conditioner (not good for your face btw!).  </li>
            <li> well it dried me out really bad.</li>
            <li> I am 44, have terrible roseacea and tend to break out frequently.</li>
            <li> Sad that I cannot return these products.</li>
            <li> I cannot express how angry I am, not just because it&#x27;s expensive but also because it&#x27;s supposed to purify your skin.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> This product works well for my troubled skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and ill keep buying it.</li>
            <li> And after reading a couple reviews I was concerned I would end up with the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible but it didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me like I had expected it to.</li>
            <li> I used to have around three pimples on my face always and they always drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> Like a breeze on a winter day without all the cold and shivering.</li>
            <li> but I persisted, making excuses like the cold weather was drying my skin.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Philosophy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad at myself now for using this product because it&#x27;s not oil-free and not non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li> , it made me break out badly and did not remove eye make up.</li>
            <li> My skin was so bad I was embarrassed to be seen..</li>
            <li> i am shocked.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed,</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> Try this you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d take the parabens out, though.  :(  </li>
            <li> BAD!</li>
            <li> I am just SO DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> However, it was awful</li>
            <li> I have been using Purity for 2 months now and have had nothing but nasty pimples!</li>
            <li> I use to get the worst razor bumps.</li>
            <li> This is one of the absolutely worst cleansers I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Terrible, terrible product.</li>
            <li> and my face broke out terribly,</li>
            <li> Not to mention, I look horrible, like a pubescent teenager, but I&#x27;m 40!</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a mechanic and it washes all the nasty grease off his face.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best. Face wash. Ever. I seriously love this stuff. I have been waiting to try this out for like ever. I have even bought Dermoligica stuff, but this is wayyygy better. Gentle, yet makes my face feel clean and tight- so don&#x27;t forget to moisturize! Bonus, it cleans off my make up too, including mascara!!!!</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Best cleanser ever! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Heard great reviews about this face wash &amp; bought the little sample size. A little bit goes a long way so this tiny bottle is still going strong after washing my face twice a day for a month. It makes your face feel very refreshed &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Its the same thing as getting a cleanser in a drugstore. Only cheaper. This bottle is expensive and just like any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> my wife uses this product and really like it.</li>
            <li> By far the BEST facial cleanser I&#x27;ve EVER tried!  I even use it occasionally to wash my hair!  Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like all the other cleansers do.</li>
            <li> Best face wash of all time!!! Gentle, smells good and leaves skin feeling absolutely amazing&lt;br /&gt;Use this with a clarisonic and you&#x27;ll be blown away :)</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I thought this will be a wonderful product. I have been using it for 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. My pores aren&#x27;t smaller, I have been breaking out more (I&#x27;m blaming the hot weather?), and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel softer. It smells great and you only need to use a little. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not giving it enough time to work, so I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see how it goes. I also bought some more products from philosophy so maybe in combination I&#x27;ll get better results. I&#x27;ll update my review if my results change.</li>
            <li> I have been using Purity Made Simple in conjunction with other Philosophy products such as Hope in a Jar and Microdelivery Peel for years, gosh over a decade.  I have strayed a few times but always come back. Nothing else cleans the makeup off my face but still keeps it soft.  It is gentle and moisturizing.  I always get compliments on my \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; :) skin. I hardly ever get any blemishes. If I do its because of something I ate (dairy, or red meat). It might be genetics but I definitely think these products don&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> I am just SO DISAPPOINTED! After all of the rave reviews on this product I really thought it was going to be great to use. However, it was awful, it made me break out badly and did not remove eye make up. I am overall really disappointed with all of the Philosophy products that I have tried lately. They are on the pricey side, so I definitely expected much better quality. I had no idea that regular Ponds Cold Cream would beat out such a product as Philosophy. I should have erred on the side of \\&quot;if it isn&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot; and not changed my line of facial products. Lesson learned. Sad that I cannot return these products.</li>
            <li> I have extremely temperamental skin, which is both dry and acne prone. I had acne as a teenager, and had to go to a dermatologist for treatments on a regular basis. I was hoping my skin would be clear as an adult.  I did find that it cleared up in my 20&#x27;s, but alas, now in my 30&#x27;s zits have come back to plague me with a vengeance.  I have tried so many acne products and cleansers including prescriptions.  Finally, with this Purity Made Simple cleanser, I have found a product that is really helping to clear up my skin.  I still have the occasional PMS pimple, but it is nothing like the cystic acne I was getting before.  This cleanser feels very creamy and gentle on the skin and has a somewhat herbal or medicinal smell that I actually enjoy.  I don&#x27;t like products that smell like perfume as they irritate my skin and exacerbate my acne.  I am hooked on this cleanser.  I hope Philosophy never changes the formula or discontinues this product.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a high-end face wash, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing any favors for my dry skin. I have been using this for a few weeks now, and I really like it! It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all, and it even seems to settle some of the redness. Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I have been using Purity for several years. Will not use anything else. It is perfect for removing makeup and leaves skin clean but moisturized. My son started using it by accident when he used mine in the shower a few times and realized that it was clearing up his acne.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have tried  and I have tried many over my 53 years.  It removes all the makeup.  It is very gentle on the skin.  Highly recommend for anyone on the fence about this.  You will not be disappointed,</li>
            <li> I use purity every morning and night. Its so gentle that I can use it on my eyes to clean my make up off&lt;br /&gt;and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or irritate my eyes at all! It has evened out my complexion, I barely have to wear make up anymore!&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never felt so clean, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have more clear natural skin.</li>
            <li> This face wash is absolutely amazing. It doesn&#x27;t foam or tingle so it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything, but within days it has a glowing effect on the skin. It&#x27;s seems pure, just as the title says.</li>
            <li> I found Purity Made Simple at a fantastic price and thought I would try it. I absolutely love this product. The price was great. Anything I am looking for I always look on Amazon first. I have never been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> Purity is the first Philosophy product I have used. I bought it as it was recommended by a salesperson at Sephora. I have dry skin, and have been using oil free products for years, not knowing how much it was drying out my skin. I needed a cleanser that was NOT oil free and would also remove makeup. I have never had an acne problem, just the normal few pimples during that time of the month. I have been using Purity for 2 months now and have had nothing but nasty pimples! I have never seen pimples like this before. Some of them are showing up in a line of three attached to each other! The pimples have not stopped, and now my face has a plethora of scabs and scars from popped pimples that bled a lot. I spoke with a salesperson at Ulta who said this is what Purity does when you first start using it because its cleansing your skin and pushing out the dirt. Another salesperson said the opposite that she does not recommend Philosophy products for face because of the fragrance. I have discontinued using this product, and switched to Exuviance cleansing creme and my face already feels better after just a few days.  There are loads of different skin types out there...just because this product didn&#x27;t work for me, it may work for you. It is a nice product, just doesn&#x27;t work with my skin. Make sure to buy it at a place you can return it at if you have breakouts or a reaction as a result of using this product.  ALSO: This product is NOT travel friendly. I recently went on a trip to Florida where I brought along Purity. After arriving, I opened my suitcase and the bottle had leaked everywhere. There were no cracks and the cap was not loose. I taped it down and put it back in my suitcase and went on a car trip. When we arrived, the same thing happened! I opened my suitcase and soap was everywhere. There were no cracks in the bottle. Strange.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is awesome!  It does not dry out my skin.  I feel clean after using it.  When paired with the Hope in a Jar lotion it is fantastic.  I have decreased my breakouts maybe one pimple a month now and my pores appear smaller.  My skin looks better than ever.  Buy this for all of your girlfriends!  Wish I had had this during my pregnancies!</li>
            <li> I had seen several presentations on this on QVC, and wondered if it really did what was claimed. It claims that it gets makeup off in one step, and you do not need toner.  When I used it for the first time, I said WOW!  It got mascara off like I had never been able to get it off before, and my face did feel as though I had used toner; it did not feel tight,just clean.  No more extra steps for toner and eye makeup remover, because Purity Made Simple does it all.  Amazon has it on Subscribe and Save, so I will order it that way next time.</li>
            <li> This face wash is exactly what I have been looking for. I have tried neutrogena, biore, proactive, clearasil, acne free, and clean and clear, but nothing compares to this facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about it is that it is not harsh and it makes tour face feel nice and soft, and clean as well, with no tightening, drying effect. Works really well with clarisonic</li>
            <li> I gave this to someone who is acne prone and has breakouts.  She loved it and could tell a difference within the first few times using it.  It was way to drying for my skin but works great for hers.</li>
            <li> My skins is so sensitive that almost EVERYTHING either breaks it out or turns it red.  This is very calming and works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!  I am using it combined with Keep the peace a moisturizer from Philosophy and it is working out well. No pimples and no dry skin and redness. I would like to note that when I first started this product I did have one nasty flare-up of pimples, but once healed I have been good since. I did find it best to use this product at night and use my moisturizer in the morning, this combo seems to be working the best for my very sensitive and can get irritated skin. Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> I love many of the Philosophy products, this is a fabulous face wash I use it twice daily. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> The best - found a good cleanser !</li>
            <li> Been using this about 2 years.Belive the hype,people.This cleanser can be used even to remove lash adhesive with absolutely no stinging.Can take off an entire face of make up in about one minute.Although I switch out other beauty products,I will not even consider giving up his product.&lt;br /&gt; QVC shows live demos of this cleanser removing make up.An 8 ounce bottle easily lasts three months or more.</li>
            <li> This was recommended on a YouTube video that I watched, and decided to give it a try.  The product I was using was expensive and had several steps to it.  The face wash was very small.  This Philosophy face soap is huge and will last forever.  I have very sensitive skin, but have had no problems with it at all.  I have very oily skin with some dry patches in the winter, but this face wash seems to balance that out.</li>
            <li> Meh.  This product just wasn&#x27;t for me.  I didn&#x27;t actually buy from amazon, I bought it from ulta so I can&#x27;t comment on the packaging or shipping, but the product itself at first seemed really nice.  It has a really nice subtle smell, and seemed to cleanse my face well and does a great job at removing makeup, however after continuing use for about 2 months I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has felt very dry and itchy.  I recommend this as a makeup remover, but as a daily cleanser I just didn&#x27;t have a good experience.  I have regular to oily skin.</li>
            <li> This works so well on my sensitive skin and I am able to avoid using multiple products because of the one-step product.  This cleanser is great!</li>
            <li> This soap is fabulous. I use it before i shave and it makes shaving a smooth experience. Also its does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Never use anything else - if you&#x27;re looking for a one step facial cleanser that is gentle, yet effective to remove the heaviest makeup, including mascara, this is for you.  I rinse with clear water then use a facecloth to remove any last traces then nothing else until I put on my moisturizer before bed.  It has always worked for me.</li>
            <li> Love this simple &amp; complete way to wash my face &amp; remove all traces of make-up ♡♡♡</li>
            <li> Love the product, and the customer service was great!</li>
            <li> excellent face wash. I will continue using it. A little goes a long way with this product. My skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product it lasts for AGES because you only have to use a tiny bit. It&#x27;s not like other cleansers, it slides around easier so you need the tiniest drop! So one bottle with last you probably a year of just the tiniest bottle! Makes the price worth it. Also this leaves me with healthy feeling, porcelain looking skin and even skin tone I just can&#x27;t find other moisturizers EVER do the same! Even leaves me feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> Have been using Purity for a full year and will never be without it.  Leaves my skin feeling amazing without any irritation or tightness.  I have given Purity as a gift to several friends and now they&#x27;re hooked!  I recommend Purity to everyone!</li>
            <li> Not sure what the big deal is.  It&#x27;s a face wash like many others.  Nothing special.  And I don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I like using this with my Clarisonic Mia. It is really a one-step cleanser. Even removes my mascara without aggravating my acne.</li>
            <li> After a lot of time and money wasted I came across this product on accident. A coworker gave me this because she couldn&#x27;t fly with it. Well as a manly man, I&#x27;m proud to admit that this is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used. I use this for my morning shaves plus a mix of pure coconut oil. No shaving cream or after shave gimmicks. I use to get the worst razor bumps. Now just this and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. This is by far the best face wash I have ever used; it does not dry out my skin at all and has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best face wash i have ever found. Will make your face soft and smooth. Try this you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using [[ASIN:B005BJ69V4 Clean &amp; Clear Cream Cleanser]] for a long time, which my girlfriend swears by, but I found my face always still felt oily afterwards.  This Purity cleanser is simple and easy, and leaves my face feeling soft afterwards.  But it also feels dry, so lotion is essential.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for sensitive skin.  It removes dirt and make up with out over drying or irritation.</li>
            <li> I have combination normal/oily skin, and I have been using Philosophy skin care for about a month.  I wear make-up every day, and Purity Made Simple easily removes all my makeup (including mascara) and leaves my skin feeling clean.  With the product I was using before, I had to apply eye makeup remover and then use a cleanser.  This product gets rid of all of it and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  (NOTE: I do not use waterproof mascara, so I&#x27;m not sure if it would remove that without irritation.)  I love the smell; it&#x27;s very clean.  A little goes a long way.  You can really feel it dissolving your makeup, and  it leaves your skin oil-free.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Great for any age or type of skin. We had the product in a matter of days.  Great service</li>
            <li> I purchased a sample of this at Sephora out of curiosity, and to see what all the hype was about. Initially, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed. It wasn&#x27;t horrible but it didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me like I had expected it to. I have oily skin, and it maybe was just my skin type or lack of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought a Clarisonic, and wow! I&#x27;m not sure how the two mix so well, but it&#x27;s surely a match made in cosmetic heaven. The lather was just right, and I saw more make-up come off on my Clarisonic brush than normal. My skin was so soft afterwards and felt so clean!&lt;br /&gt;By itself, this cleanser is OK, once again it just may have been my skin type. but if you have a Clarisonic, it&#x27;s a must have. It is worth the hype!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use another face wash ever again. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and it&#x27;s the best of all the crap I&#x27;ve tried! If u have cystic acne... TRY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  No matter what other cleanser I try, I keep coming back to this one, and I loved the 16 ounce size...kind of jumbo, but easier to handle than the 32 ounce I was getting for a long time.  This in between size is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cleanses my face thoroughly and never drys it out.  It smells a little more medicinal than it used to, but I REALLY can&#x27;t find anything that comes close to it.  This and the Pure Grace items are what keep me buying Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> This is one of the absolutely worst cleansers I have ever tried. It dried out my skin and caused breakouts. Terrible, terrible product. Will be going back to my holy grail bare minerals purifying cleanser. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will never switch again. And because of this horrendous product, I will never try another philosophy product on my face!</li>
            <li> It is soft. After using facial cleanser to wash my face, I do not have feel of tense in my face. Actually, it does not smell good.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE this facial cleanser. After seeing so many good reviews about it, I decided to try it and even though it is a bit expensive, it&#x27;s so worth it! It has a light faint smell and makes my skin feel so refreshed and clean. It has been more vibrant and glowing since I have used this. Love it!!</li>
            <li> My first time this brand and I do like it and it cleanses well , I guess I don&#x27;t understand all the hype, I have been using cerave for sometime now and it works just as well and is dermatology recommened</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter. She loves it.</li>
            <li> this is such a good product! it leaves my skin soft and smooth. it melts makeup off my face and leaves me feeling fresh. I use it everyday before I go to sleep. I really like it! if you are thinking about buying a face wash, get this one! I have so many great products from philosophy, and it is such a great company, but purity made simple is the best product from philosophy that I have.</li>
            <li> I can see what all the fuss is about!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser as I do every Philosophy product I have ever tried.  It is moisturizing and it takes off eye makeup as well as facial.  I will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and it was a little bit of a problem before I started using this wash. I used to have around three pimples on my face always and they always drove me crazy. So then, that&#x27;s when I went on my adventure to find a face wash. I used about everything, but then boom. Found this little sucker. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s amazing. It smells clean and fresh too. Like a breeze on a winter day without all the cold and shivering. Anywho, it&#x27;s the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever gotten. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought the 16oz bottle of this for $32 after reading several great reviews and after hearing from a few friends that use and love it.  I have sensitive skin and this made me break out.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with a giant bottle of it that I&#x27;ll never use.  :  For the price there are several better options.  For example, Burts Bees makes a sensitive facial cleaner that I&#x27;m now using and LOVE.  No break outs with Burt&#x27;s Bees, and it only costs $9.99.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and absolutely love it. Item was shipped as promised quickly and completely intact thank you very much!</li>
            <li> First of all, I LOVE what is written on the front. There&#x27;s so much truth there... which is kind of hard to find on a facewash bottle! I have used several philosophy products before, and I believe that they really try to live a &amp;#34;philosophy&amp;#34; and are dedicated to quality. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to do what they say on the front - to massage the facial cleanser in for 30-60 seconds - which seems like a long time when you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning or just want to get to bed at night. But believe me, that&#x27;s the trick. Otherwise you&#x27;re just coating your skin and washing it off without letting it do anything. And with the price of this stuff, that would be a huge waste. Do what the say and massage it in, and your skin will feel much better day by day. I really like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but it seems effective. Sometimes my skin seems to have a mind of its own, and adapt to things easily, meaning something will work for 2 months and then just stop working, and I&#x27;ll start breaking out again. That hasn&#x27;t happened yet, and though my skin&#x27;s not perfect, it seems to be better than usual, and I don&#x27;t really get breakouts. I use a Clarisonic about 1-2x a week, with the philosophy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and an extreme dislike for strongly-scented products, so I was hesitant about trying this product. My aunts raved about it, so I gave it a try. I absolutely love the delicately clean smell. It leaves my skin feeling cleansed, refreshed, and smooth. I have been using this product ever since - a little over 2 years as of this review. Another pro for this product is the text on the bottle. I read it every day and it gives me a positive feeling. :)</li>
            <li> A girlfriend turned me onto this stuff. It&#x27;s mild, smells fine and cleans my face up really, really well. Love this stuff, gives my face a nice glow. Definitely financially best to buy the large size, works out much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;All of Philosophy&#x27;s products are great for girls, and boys, but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Great gentle non-foaming cleanser..we use them with the Extra Gentle Buf Puf facial sponge. We all use this cleanser.  It&#x27;s also really helped to clear my teenagers skin when used with the Buf Fuf facial sponge.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the perfect facewash my entire life. I have always had problematic semi-oily skin. I am 27 and have found that my skin is a little less oily now, but still gets that way by the end of the day. I am in love with this stuff. The scent is great, not too fragrant, but very pleasant. It lathers just enough to take off any makeup, even heavy eye shadow/liner. My pores shrank a week after using it. I love to pair it with their Hope in  a Jar moisturizer before I apply makeup.</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves my skin clean, soft and smelling nice.  Since it&#x27;s near the sink I also use it as a hand cleaner instead of buying separate liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is more expensive than the typical drugstore brand but a bottle lasts for months and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think with things like cleansers you should not review for about a month. I am on my second bottle of this cleanser and I can say it is excellent. My face is clean without a lot of extra steps and is blemish free. This is the  only cleanser that I have ever had that cleans without drying and my face still feels clean. You will like this, and because you dont need a lot a bottle will last you a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I love it. Cleans without drying out your skin. Your skin feels soft and clean. I would recommend it and I sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nice cleanser. I use it with my clairsonic and have for over a year. No complaints. 8oz bottle lasts approx 4 months. Great price here. Have ordered multiple times. I don&#x27;t even comparison shop for it.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, and they love it.  It&#x27;s also one of my faves and I didn&#x27;t have to get in the car to go get it.</li>
            <li> it does melt make up but waterproof eye make you have to use it twice and sometime I end up taking the rest with a pad and liquid eye makeup remover. Also, it leave your skin really soft and the pores has improve a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have used others, and this is the best liquid cleanser I have ever used.  Will most definitely purchase this again!  Glad I finally found it, and of course, it was as simple as looking to Amazon!</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is great when you need to get all that gunk off your face without being too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is one step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of make up because it tends to clog my pores and when I do have to use make up, I want everything off at the end of the day immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philosophy does a perfect job of removing it without drying my face.</li>
            <li> And does a thorough job of cleaning without stripping the skin of moisture. My daughter had a bottle in her shower that I sampled while visiting and was hooked.</li>
            <li> This product may be ok for someone else, but it did not lather enough for me. I will return in the future to the gel.</li>
            <li> This cleared up my face , looks shinier healthier and cleaner.</li>
            <li> As a guy I don&#x27;t have makeup to remove, but I find this to be a very nice and easy to use daily face cleanser.  Leaves skin feeling nice and clean but doesn&#x27;t dry it out either.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all. I purchased it because of all the good reviews but it did not really do anything for me. Just another cleanser that probably made me break out even more. It did wash away all of my eye make up which is probably the only plus. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> My favorite daily cleanser.  It cleans without drying out, and I feel light and fresh after using it.  It has a gentle fragrance and after using it daily you can really notice a difference in how clean your skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and I like my cleanser to clean well, leave no residue, and not drying. This cleanser has it all. Before buying I thought it was a cream cleanser that doesn&#x27;t foam up, and worried it doesn&#x27;t clean well. After using it I am impressed how well it cleans yet doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. The scent isn&#x27;t the best (smells like lavender and some kind of chemical).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price may seem a little high compared to drug store cleansers, but the bottle lasts a long time so it&#x27;s in deed a good value. I use it in the morning only (use different cleanser at night) and a dime size does the job. My 8 oz bottle lasts more than 5 months.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product. I add sugar to it so it turns into the perfect face scrub for my oily skin</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. Cleanses makeup off face better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i purchase this as a recommendation to use along my clarisonic mia 2, and i love it, it leaves my oily skin feeling clean and fresh, and removes make up like no other, excellent to save a few steps of my nightly routine.</li>
            <li> My daughter got me to start using this product a couple of years ago.  It really cleans  the makeup off my face with and does not irritate my eyes.  I know it is a little on the expensive side but I feel it is worth it.  A little goes a long way; so this bottle with last me a few months.</li>
            <li> I used this along with the sonic face cleanser (forgot the name but it&#x27;s the electric machine to scrub your face that goes around in circles) and it was an absolute nightmare!  This thing not only peeled my face right off but it gave me an irritaional acne that I&#x27;ve never seen before.  Stay away from this crap, or at least test it carefully before putting it all over your face.  Don&#x27;t let it happen what happened to me...  total nightmare!</li>
            <li> Such a lovely scent. It&#x27;s very mild though, so I would recommend removing makeup before using. I tend not to order expensive products but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have combination (mor eon the oily side) skin and I used this for about three months. Didn&#x27;t see any improvement in acne, or any oil control of any sort. I was disappointed because of all the great reviews I saw on this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a kit from another vendor and had it on auto delivery with several other Philosophy products. After giving one of these away as a gift along with a 3in1 shower gel, I ran out of my normal cleanser, and opened the Purity I had put away for myself. My first thought was &amp;#34;Peeu! This stinks&amp;#34;, but smells a lot like the Hope in a jar skin cream from Philosophy, so it didn&#x27;t stop me from using it. After using it a few times a week, I can say it works well as any $10 drug store cleanser, but dries my skin out so badly, that even putting eye cream and facial cream on afterward isn&#x27;t enough to take away the tight feeling my face has every time I use this. I also received the Micro-delivery cleanser in the kit I ordered and use it in the shower. This isn&#x27;t as drying as the Purity, which surprised me, as it has exfoliator beads in it. In all, I don&#x27;t recommend this product because of the drying effect on the skin, the smell and the price. Go to Walgreens and purchase their brand of  &amp;#34;regenerist&amp;#34; cream cleanser. Less drying, better smell and WAY Cheaper!</li>
            <li> Great prduct that works well for me and no more burning eyes!</li>
            <li> While this didn&#x27;t sting my face like everything index the sun and did clean well it dried me out really bad.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and so this cleanser is very gentle on it. Very nice. I have ordered 3 times now. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash ever! My skin looks and feels better since I have been using it. No more breakouts! Makeup comes off with one wash! No harsh smells or chemicals! I am a Philosophy girl for life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and will never use anything else. Not only does it remove all makeup (including mascara)it absolutely leaves your skin beautiful, clean and soft.  I&#x27;ve never had a break out, dryness or itchy skin after using. I&#x27;ve tried other products just to make a comparison, and have always gone back to Purity. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is truely great soap for your face and removing makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes or leaving a filmy coat in them like eye makeup remover.  It just leaves a nice squeaky clean face.</li>
            <li> I like this formula, if you have sensitive skin it doesn&#x27;t dry it out or irritate it, I like aveeno ultra sensitive foaming face wash better than this because this has a touch of scent to it</li>
            <li> I received a 2 oz sample of this in my new beauty test tube. I tried using this recently for a few days morning and night. I used it as directed (leave on for 60 seconds). First of all it smells exactly like bug repellant spray lol. Not a big deal but thought I would mention it. But yeah while washing it has a slimy texture, it doesn&#x27;t foam up unless you were to really make an attempt but that&#x27;s not an issue just mentioning. There is *some* foaming action but not much. After using my face looks mostly okay but doesn&#x27;t feel clean (and I only use mineral powder or bb cream). If I had a breakout then that area would be reddened after washing. After the first day I could tell this just was not working for my skin. My skin felt dirty, pores were larger, face seemed irritated. After the third day I was breaking out a LOT. I was getting crazy huge pimples all around my mouth and chin area. And I was getting pimples in strange places like the tip of my nose and around my eye sockets lol. Something in this was quite irritating and didn&#x27;t wash off my face probably. I don&#x27;t personally feel that this face wash is gentle or effective. For reference my face is sensitive oily and clog prone, Acne prone especially with irritating ingredients. Therefore I cannot recommend this face wash and I will have to figure out what to do with the remainder as I never throw anything out that isn&#x27;t expired (and neither should you!) maybe I will use as a brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> Philosophy Purity is the best daily cleanser I&#x27;ve found. A little bit goes a long way, so this size lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> My skin loves it. After washing, I don&#x27;t feel dry. It balances the oil. I used it together with hope in a jar. Very good</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, have been using for years. Does a good job removing makeup as well as mascara. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. Just takes some getting used to since it doesn&#x27;t foam like most cleansers.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to like this since Philosophy is a good name and many other reviewers loved it, plus I invested in the large bottle.  My skin often felt burning and raw after using it (and I only washed my face with this once a day) but I persisted, making excuses like the cold weather was drying my skin.  Finally I went back to my Skinceuticals cleanser and I could not believe how much better my face felt.  Purity may be all right for oiler skin but it is way too harsh for sensitive, drier skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facewash of all time. It cleans the skin without drying it out at all. Would recommend to all skin types.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday-use product.  I alternate with an exfoliate face scrub, but this product cleans thoroughly, and does not leave my face dry or oily.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Philosophy, I&#x27;ve been using Purity for about two years now. I won&#x27;t put any other face wash on my face! I have extremely sensitive skin, and I never have to worry with Purity rather or not it&#x27;s going to break out or irritate my skin. This face wash is perfect for taking off all of my makeup, even my all day waterproof eye makeup. I work at a makeup store, so the products I wear all day are meant for 24 hour wear and Purity has no trouble washing all of that off. It&#x27;s a perfect face wash, I won&#x27;t ever use anything else!</li>
            <li> works well in one step</li>
            <li> Smells good, kind of woodsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin (not too dry or oily) and this feels like a nice, gentle cleanse.  I do end up having to use quite a bit to get a good suds going but at the price it&#x27;s still cheaper than my previous facewash and so far (2 months later) I think it&#x27;s doing a similar job. I was previously using and loving the Arbonne line, but for the cost I&#x27;ll keep using this product instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about this cleanser and after reading  some online reviews on it I decided to give it a try. I really like how it does not strip your skin and it does not leave your skin dry. However this is a too expensive product for it not to live up to the hype and my expectations. First many people rave how this product completely clears your skin of make and that it&#x27;s even great to clean your make up brushes. In my opinion this  cleanser did none of the above. I used this cleanser with my clarosonic brush and after washing my faces I would try to clean my clarosonic brush with it and the make would not come of my brush. I usually use a cold cream cleanser to remove my make up before I wash it so it&#x27;s not like my skin is packed with make up. In my opinion there are other drug store product that are cheaper and work way better then this product. I regret wasting my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Arrived in perfect shape. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my face. It does not burn my eyes ever and smells great too!</li>
            <li> I first received this in the sample bottle, and honestly, I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with it. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, it didn&#x27;t lather, and it just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything special. I kept it around for \\&quot;bar nights\\&quot; when I needed to really scrub out all the cigarette smoke from my pores, or nights I was too lazy to take off my eye makeup. (This works great for eye-makeup, and I use waterproof everything.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to my senior year of college. I got mono, and my skin completely freaked out. I would get huge cystic pimples around my chin, on the corners of my mouth, and in between my eyebrows. NOTHING I tried seemed to work. I used Proactiv, Neutrogena products, all the over-the-counter acne sets. I was starting to get desperate, but after a night out, I used the Purity and went to bed. I woke up, and my skin felt smoother, it wasn&#x27;t as dry and sensitive from all the acne stuff, and my breakouts seemed smaller. I kept using it every night, along with my acne cleanser in the morning and spot treatment at night. The Purity kept my face from getting too dry, breakouts were few and far between and healed faster. Within a week or so I saw a huge difference. In three weeks my skin was almost completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve completely stopped using any acne stuff other than the spot treatment, and my skin has stayed clear. I don&#x27;t even need moisturizer. I still have blackheads and the occasional pimple, but the ones I get now are small and go away within a day or two. I can go into public without concealer- which is awesome, because I spent so much time dabbing on concealers and powder to hide my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t promise that this will work for everyone, but for my skin, which is dry, slightly sensitive, and breaks out due to hormones/stress, it worked great for me. It is expensive, but it lasts a long time. I&#x27;d recommend trying the 4oz sample bottle first- it lasts a good two or three months and isn&#x27;t priced much higher than your typical drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> takes everything off, easy to use and leaves skin feeling hydrated without feeling too oily...with buy again for sure...good price</li>
            <li> If I could only buy one beauty product for the rest of my life, it would be this cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t claim to do anything fancy. It gets your face clean.  Combine this with the Clarisonic and your face is so deeply cleansed.  I ran out and used some other cleanser for a week and my face broke out terribly, so evidently it keeps my face clear as well.  I LOVE IT!  I wish they&#x27;d take the parabens out, though.  :(  The parabens are there for shelf life, however, and that&#x27;s good because a 16 ounce will last me a year and a half.  The 8 ounce container lasted nearly a year.  I love this cleanser!  Can&#x27;t say it enough!</li>
            <li> Cleanser is gentle but effective, but way too pricey for a face cleanser. Women have to much to buy as it is in life and 30 + dollars for face cleanser is too much.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  everyone in the house uses it, the 12, 16 and 42 year olds. Its perfect for everyone!</li>
            <li> Used this product for years. My makeup melts off. I have struggled for years with adult acne now my skin is clear and I only use makeup for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years now, and it never disappoints. It is very gentle and leaves your skin feeling so soft. I use it after a workout and before bed in combination with a morning medicated wash. It provides a break from the harshness of the chemical wash, and I feel like I am treating my skin well when I use this product. Although I was concerned about the price being too high at first, it lasts a really long time .While the 8 oz bottle was a just a stocking stuffer a few Christmas holidays ago, it is now a must have!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Macys and was so happy when I found it on Amazon for slightly cheaper. Its the same great product!</li>
            <li> Will not purchase again.  Could not figure out why my face and nose continually had peeling skin. Stopped using this product and face return to normal and no more skin peeling.</li>
            <li> great face wash.. gentle</li>
            <li> By far favorite face wash.. I break out easily and I also have sensitive skin due to ezcema and this wash saves my life. You scrub your makeup/eye makeup off and cleanse your skin all in one step! It&#x27;s so easy and it&#x27;s the best not having to use eyemakeup remover or wipes. You must rub your eyes for a minute or two with water with the wash to make sure all of the makeup comes off. I scrub it all off after with my Olay-Pro-X. My skin always feels soft from it too.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser that I have used. Good for minimizing  oily break through.  Leaves skin soft. I use I it with the Clarisonic brush. Cleans off make up without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> I will begin by stating that I have never had problem skin of any kind, no acne, no blotches, no wrinkles, and I&#x27;m in my forties.  I don&#x27;t wear much make up and though in the summer I do enjoy a suntan with sunscreen protected skin, I by no means am a sun worshipper.  Over the years I&#x27;ve happily used the Philosophy line of 3-in-1 body washes but since they are on the expensive side, I use the product sparingly and seldom treat myself to more than 3 bottles a year.  When I tried a sample of this PURITY face cleanser, I was impressed that it was a one-step cleanser for face and eye makeup, plus it was fragrance free.  I shelled out the $32 plus tax for this 16oz. bottle (ouch!) and after using it for a week I began to notice that my face became extremely dry!  I was not expecting this at all.  In the winter I take extra care with moisturizers anyway, so putting a little extra cream on the face after using this wasn&#x27;t a big deal just to get rid of the dryness, but I&#x27;m not so sure that for the price it is worth it at all.  I know that if you bought a facial cleanser and an eye makeup remover separately, you might pay the $32 anyway, but if it leaves my face dry and flakey, nothing terrific can be said for this product.  Yes, I expect this review will be unpopular, but I&#x27;m really just being honest with how the product affected me personally, and I may or may not be alone in my experience.  Had Noxema not changed their \\&quot;original\\&quot; scent from way back when, I would still be using that for a mere few bucks a jar.  [[ASIN:B0000530O6 Noxzema Deep Cleansing Cream, Original - 14 oz]]</li>
            <li> I love the product! I was happy to see it for a great price on Amazon. The seller shipped it promptly and it arrived 2 days after I placed my order. Will order again here.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It seems pricey but is high quality &amp; lasts a long time!! I first purchased it December 2012.. It is now November 18th, I received my 2nd bottle today in the mail.. Still have enough from the first to last until December.. So, a 16oz bottle lasts a year, and this is with washing my face at least once, sometimes twice daily. A small amount is all that&#x27;s needed :) I definitely suggest this face wash, and would recommend Beauty bridge for their excellent service (I placed my order on the 15th &amp; received it on the 18th, impressive!) thank you so much :)</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> I bought a small version of this cleanser a few years back to take with me on vacation and fell in love with the product. I love the scent and the clean fresh feeling it leaves. Now I buy it in the large bottle and fill up the little bottle when I&#x27;m going traveling.</li>
            <li> This product does miracles! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This removes all make-up, including mascara. It leaves your skin feeling smoothe.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. $33 for 16oz and my eyes look like a panda bear. I have to wash multiple times and use cleanser afterward. Not what I was expecting. I don&#x27;t know if I can return it or not but this is a one time purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser. It removes all your makeup easily.</li>
            <li> Purity has been my cleanser of choice for almost ten years.  It removes all of my makeup including eyeliner and mascara without burning my eyes and leaves my skin clean and soft.  Unless you have super oily skin, I would recommend this cleanser to anyone.</li>
            <li> It does work for basic make-up, but I not really like it has dried out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It not works well for the waterproof mascara! You will still need to use the eye make up remove afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my Girlfriend&#x27;s request and one day my face wash was all gone. Decided to use this on my normal/slightly dry skin and WHOA! My skin felt really nice and clean. It didn&#x27;t make my face oily or girly smelling. Now I use it all the time, but don&#x27;t tell her.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended in Sophora because it cleanses as well as removes eye makeup really well. I loved it so much that I decided to buy the larger size online. I still love the product but I have to admit that the lotion doesn;t seem as thick as it did when I had purchased the small bottle in the store.</li>
            <li> Use it to clean my makeup brushes...I was truly surprised but this product actually flared up my very light case of Rosacia and I found a better and cheaper face cleaning and moisturizing product at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin, and not like, &amp;#34; oh my t-zone is oily and my cheeks are dry,&amp;#34; or vise versa, no more like I have a patch of oily skin right next to a patch of dry skin, that is also next to a patch of more oily skin, and so on and so forth...I have only been using this product a couple of days but, in my case, that&#x27;s generally long enough to say because my skin is SO sensitive, that if a product is not compatible I&#x27;ll know within a day or two with evidence being that I will break out all over.... I have yet to find ANY facial cleanser that works for me and have been using water and, when I need to wash off my eye makeup, shampoo and conditioner (not good for your face btw!).  Because of this regimen my skin has been drying out worse and worse and I&#x27;ve finally gotten to the point that I&#x27;ve seen plenty enough evidence [at 25 :( ] that i decided it was time to spend money on something good that will benefit my skin (and maybe even reverse the effects of my poor skin maintenance). Between this and the bareMinerals Purely Nourishing Moisturizer Ive been using, I&#x27;ve noticed not just a little clearing up of the skin but maybe also a little bit more of a softer, younger glow...Ill make further updates as I see fit, hopefully the results continue to be positive :)</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. doesnt take the eyeliner off that great</li>
            <li> I purchased this cleanser from Sophora.  It came with a trial-size Hope in a Jar moisturizer (purported to &amp;#34;moisturize, hydrate and provide antioxidant protection, while improving skin texture&amp;#34;).  In my enthusiasm to switch to the Philosophy line of facial products, I ordered the ridiculously over-priced Time in a Bottle daily age-defying serum, and the Time in a Bottle daily age-defying eye serum from Amazon.  Well, I guess you can say that the joke is on me.  These products did not defy age, nor did the cleanser &amp;#34;gently cleanse, tone and melt away all face and eye makeup in one simple step, while lightly hydrating the skin&amp;#34;.  I have fairly normal skin -- never too dry, never too oily, not many break-outs -- but showing the usual wear &amp; tear of 50+ years &amp; sun-bathing abuse from my teens.  Naturally I was interested in a product that would reverse the signs of aging, and improve the texture of my skin.  Hope in a Jar.  Time in a Bottle.  Purity Made Simple.  What more could a girl ask for?  I&#x27;ll tell you:  A product that isn&#x27;t going to CREATE more wrinkles!  A product that isn&#x27;t going to dry my skin out to the point of severe -- and I mean SEVERE -- itching and flaking.  A product that isn&#x27;t going to make my eyelids sting and droop and crease.  I  looked like someone took a wire brush to my chin and around my mouth area, the redness was so pronounced.  My face has never been so chapped!  Was this an allergic reaction to something I ate, I wondered, because I refused to believe that this wonderful company that &amp;#34;celebrates the beauty of the human spirit&amp;#34; with products that &amp;#34;enhance your skin and well-being with multitasking benefits&amp;#34; could be the culprit.  Or perhaps, after spending so much money, I was embarrassed to admit my stupidity in diving in so deep, without first testing them out.  UUUGH!  I could kick myself!  After 3 days the stinging was unbearable, and I now freely admit my stupid mistake.  These products are not for me.  I&#x27;m doing all I can to salvage my skin, having to sleep with a coating of maximum strength cortizone 10 ultra moisturizing cream to keep the itching at bay.  What a nightmare this experience has been!I&#x27;m doing all I can to salvage my skin, having to sleep with a coating of maximum strength cortizone 10 ultra moisturizing cream to keep the itching at bay.  What a nightmare this experience has been!</li>
            <li> When I was in high school and college I never had to use a cleanser to keep my face clear.  Now that I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s my face has started to break out around my chin.  After looking online, I found that this cleanser was one of the most popular ones so I ordered it and have seen a major improvement in my skin.  I use it in the morning and at night in the shower.  It makes my skin feel so smooth after I use it.  I started out by only ordering the 5 oz. bottle and when that was gone I ordered one of the biggest bottles there are because I know it works.  I can finally say goodbye to those deep, painful, embarrassing blemishes!</li>
            <li> I recently made the leap from small trial size bottle to a full size bottle of Purity, and it is great.  I wear no makeup, but still sometimes have adult acne problems, combined with rather dry skin.  My face is smooth and soft, and I would dare to compare the results of this product to the results I get from a certain well known acne treatment.  I don&#x27;t look at this as a scented product, so I am glad the slightly odd smell does not stay with you after using it.  One thing I would suggest to anyone buying a larger bottle of this product, be careful the product is a bit runny, so the flip top cap on the 16oz bottle tends to gush far more than you need for one application (especially if you are juggling the bottle in the shower like I do).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need makeup remover.  This product Philosophy remove all makeup.  I wash, rinse and wash it again gentle.  It works and it rid of blackhead, oily skin, and pimples.  I&#x27;ve been using 7 years after I saw on television HSN about new products &amp;#34;Philosophy&amp;#34; in 1994.  I love it.</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I give up on every other cleanser. I&#x27;ve tried SO many. I have acne-prone skin and this cleanser helps keep breakouts under control in combination with the rest of my regimen (all Philosophy products except 50% apple cider vinegar 50% water as toner after cleansing). The smell reminds me of Earl Grey tea at first. Love it.</li>
            <li> I continue to buy this product solely because it removes make-up better than any other cleanser or make-up remover I have tried. I put a small amount in my hands and rub it all over my face that has been previously dampened with water. My make-up will literally melt off. I don&#x27;t need to use anything but my hands, even around my eyes, and the mascara on my eyelashes comes off so easily. I have not experienced any negatives with my skin from using this product. I follow-up up with a cleanser that has acne medication just because I need to treat my acne, but I am sure for those who do not have acne issues like me, this cleanser would be fine to serve as the only cleanser in your skincare routine.</li>
            <li> recommend buying it if you&#x27;re looking for a cleanser that makes your skin not only feel healthy, but clears it up. It makes me feel sexy and i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use the purity with a mia clarisonic.  The 16 oz bottle is more affordable than the clarisonic cleaner.  Saves me money and works great.</li>
            <li> I was excited to finally have a facial cleanser to melt away makeup and it worked wonders at first...HOWEVER, I started to break out...BAD! I could literally connect the pimple dots on my face! UGHHH! Then I discovered that it has IMIDAZOLIDINYL UREA(found in urine)! Which I have researched and it is toxic for your skin! I cannot express how angry I am, not just because it&#x27;s expensive but also because it&#x27;s supposed to purify your skin. I&#x27;m never purchasing from Philosophy again.</li>
            <li> I initially experienced Purity Made Simple 7 years ago and loved the cleanser at the time.  I eventually moved on to others and recently decided to give it another go after my skin started misbehaving.  Unfortunately, Purity Made Simple only made the problem areas more problematic.  I&#x27;ve always experienced combination skin - it&#x27;s combination dry during the colder months, combination oily during the warmer.  Pimples, whiteheads and blackheads aren&#x27;t new to me but I can generally predict when I&#x27;ll begin to see them.  This cleanser however just created chaos.  The description issued by Philosophy states that it \\&quot;dissolves\\&quot; make-up, a claim which I found untrue back when I used it daily and again this time around.  A quick swipe of a toner soaked cotton ball proved it false time and again.  Though I will say, it does dissolve eye make-up almost entirely.  Foundation, blush, not so much.  I&#x27;m a bit confused as to how it provides a \\&quot;deep cleanse\\&quot; when it can&#x27;t even cut through the first layer of grime.  Now, onto the chaos.  As PMS contains oil it&#x27;s a product that I&#x27;d only use during the winter months when I&#x27;m experiencing dry skin.  This didn&#x27;t hydrate my skin, it rather seemed to DEhydrate it.  My face was extremely taught and even flaking in areas (nose, cheeks).  Within 3 days my face developed whiteheads and pimples, much more so than average.  Do facial products cause a face to purge?  Perhaps.  Some doctors say yes, some say no, I say who knows.  Perhaps it was a \\&quot;purge\\&quot; reaction, my skin becoming \\&quot;pure\\&quot;, and perhaps it wasn&#x27;t.  I continued with the cleanser for a full month (remember, I used to love it) without seeing an improvement.  As soon as I made the switch back to my glycolic acid cleanser my skin cleared within days.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for sensitive, acne-prone, dry skin. It is also cruelty-free. Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> it cleans my skin helpfully,i love it!</li>
            <li> Made out of more chemicals that the &amp;#34;Purity&amp;#34; title would leave you to believe. Gentle cleanser washes clean, needs more work to remove mascara.</li>
            <li> LOVE how soft it makes your skin!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser! Been using it for at least 10 years. It leaves my skin balanced and soft, not tight or dry. I really believe it&#x27;s kept me looking more youthful. I&#x27;ve tried other cleansers from time to time, but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I loved the savings on my favorite facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> Honestly! I have PCOS and have had acne all throughout my teens and beyond. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to keep my face clean only to find it oily at mid day and more pimples by the next day. Frustrating to say the least. Philosophy clears your face right up and keeps you shine free throughout the day, even those crazy days before menses! Purity Made Simple IS my personal arsenal against bad skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.  My face feels so clean after washing with Purity.  Very gentle and does not dry out your skin.  I highly recomend this product</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is that it was free, a bottle was given to me by a friend. She and all the women in her family swear by it so she insisted that I try it. Every time I use it, I break out in many huge, red, cystic, painful pimples all over my face but mostly on my chin and around my mouth, also in my hairline and between my eyebrows. I have average skin (not oily nor dry), I tend to get a pimple once in a while and in stressful times I might break out a bit more. But nothing like when I use this product!! I&#x27;ve tried it now about 5 different times, thinking maybe I just need to get past an initial breakout for it to start giving me good results. Wrong. I officially give up. Sitting here again after using it daily for the past 5days, my face is stinging and painful from all the pimples on it, extremely uncomfortable, and very dry. Not to mention, I look horrible, like a pubescent teenager, but I&#x27;m 40! I&#x27;ve always simply used Dove soap to clean my face, I&#x27;ve never used other products, and I don&#x27;t even know why I keep giving this bottle more tries!</li>
            <li> i first bought this at ulta and love it so i got a bigger bottle! little goes a loooong way and it takes all my makeup off and leaves my skin feeling awesome!!!i love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleanser and makeup remover. Used for years on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days using this was great. It had my skin feeling nice and soft. My face was already clear prior to use. I had acne but it&#x27;s been pretty under control for the last couple of years. That is, until about the 5th day using this. I don&#x27;t drink pop, and I eat pretty good, so there was no outside cause to this. This face was broke my ENTIRE face out in pimples! Not a few, not small pimples, huge bright red pimples! Everywhere! And to top it off, it made my face oily. It started with one pimple, which was no big deal. I still get one here and there. I woke up the next morning, and they were all over my forehead, up one whole side of my face, and on my chin. It was horrible. I did not want to believe it was this soap because my aunt swears by it. She loves it so much she uses it on her whole body and she ordered a bottle for me, and another one for my mom and sister so we all could try it. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t use my money. I&#x27;m just going to have to give this back to her and let her enjoy it. Definitely did not work for me. I&#x27;ve been off of it for a week and my face is starting to look normal again after a lot of work and medicated acne lotion, but I&#x27;ve still got a few pimples that don&#x27;t want to go away. I left my pizza face in middle school and the beginning stages of high school. I do not want to be walking around looking like I jumped back 7 or 8 years in my life. For the people it does work for, good for you. This is not for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair, and always looked so splotchy and irritated that I never left the house without wearing foundation to cover it. I had been using Neutrogena face wash with a tiny amount of Oil of Olay moisturizer, but had frequent breakouts and always felt like my skin was either too oily or too dry. I decided to try this and have been using it for a couple of weeks now. I wish I had taken before and after pics! My skin is much clearer and the redness and uneven appearance is almost gone completely. I still get the occasional tiny zit, but overall my face is so clear now that I have actually gone out with no makeup on a few times and felt like I looked OK. When I do wear makeup, it stays on better, lasts longer, and doesn&#x27;t rub off my nose and chin like it used to. No more oily Rudolph look--woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I felt like this cleanser was a little too drying, and I&#x27;d use moisturizer afterward because otherwise it felt kind of tight for a little while after using it. I ended up with more zits and oilier skin, so I cut out the moisturizer and that helped a ton! This was definitely a good purchase and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After searching and using different soaps and facial cleansers, I&#x27;ve finally settled on Philosphy&#x27;s Purity.  Love the way it cleanses my skin, it feels soothing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I like the smell and it feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am a VERY light skinned hispanic who couldn&#x27;t find a good face wash! Some that I had tried irritated my skin easily and others I tried didn&#x27;t remove the make up that well. I only use mineral powder on my face (none of that liquid stuff). I spoke to my coworker about this and she recommended I try Purity. So I ordered it more than a month ago and have been using it since it arrive. It&#x27;s AMAZING! I love it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It removes the make up. It feels great. I usually use this at night before I go to sleep. I will forever be buying Purity.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Purity, its the best cleanser ever. It will literally melt off all your makeup without making the skin too dry.  I wear a lot of water proof eyeliners and this stuff works great on that. I use it as my everyday cleanser even with no makeup on.  Its just great and doesn&#x27;t strip the skin. Its a true clean.  The price Amazon has for subsribe and save is AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!!! On a popular beauty site it was 32 bucks for this same size plus shipping. At the time of this review I paid about 27.50 here on Amazon with free shipping.  A WAY better deal for something I use all the time. Its great, you won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> I am the queen of facial cleansers! I&#x27;ve tried them all (well not ALL of them) and this is one I LOVE! It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest....its a bit woodsy, but it cleanses effectively without drying out your skin and does not leave a residue! Now my teens are using it and loving it too! :) Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, non-greasy, gentle on your skin. Does not over dry your skin. .......  ........  .........  ..........  .........  .....</li>
            <li> The only thing that works for my wifes face!! Wish we would have found many years ago.</li>
            <li> Purity Made Simple is SO gentle that you can open your eyes while washing.  PERFECT for those microdermabrasion wands.  Never dries me out &amp; allways leaves me completely clean with no film left over.</li>
            <li> I am using the Purity and alternating with the clear days ahead line.  My skin is nice and soft and calm after using the Purity. I have not experienced any more cysts while using the Purity..which is a good thing. Will definitely order again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time. highly reccomend this to anyone. I actually had given this as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is the best make up remover ever! Plus it is also gentle on my skin! Love it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and it&#x27;s  quite gentle.</li>
            <li> I could not do without this! I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months now, and my skin is soft and glowing. I recommend using Josie Maran Argan Oil after using Purity. Great combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricy, but worth it!</li>
            <li> After years and years of trying to find a facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I finally found the one. Purity Made Simple! I have used this for about a year now and it is outstanding. It removes every last bit of makeup, oil, and other nasty things from my pores. As a result, my pores are smaller and my skin is soft. I&#x27;ve had no breakouts since I started using this cleanser. It can be pricey compared to grocery store brands, but a little goes a long way! I am 40 years old and I have beautiful and resilient skin. I use it alone or with my Clarisonic. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Philosophy!</li>
            <li> Originally I received a sample of this as part of a beauty shipment. I loved it so much I came to Amazon and ordered a big bottle.  I have dry sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it removes my makeup easily.</li>
            <li> this is the best facial cleanser i have ever used.  I have been buying it for several years. removes all make make up!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister and she liked it a lot. It acts as a powerful cleanser and is worth the money</li>
            <li> Great face wash. Worth the extra $ for good quality face wash. Even my husband loves it. He&#x27;s a mechanic and it washes all the nasty grease off his face.</li>
            <li> This product works well for my troubled skin. I saw immediate results. I think it is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> best facial cleanser available</li>
            <li> All you need is a small amount to clean face. I use a Clarisonic and it leaves my face feeling hydrated and clean. It lasts so long because it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on your face while it removes all your makeup.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! It works on very hard to remove make up and keep your skin clear!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling great and clears up some blemishes. Thanks for a great product. Will buy again. . . .</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on purchasing this cleanser, because a lot of reviews were saying how it dried their skin out. I have really dry skin, but I also heard this was one of the best out there. After lots or research I finally decided just to try it out. My skin has never looked better. It&#x27;s soft, clear, and my skin tone is finally starting to even out (I do moisturize my face right after using it though, so that might&#x27;ve been other people&#x27;s problem). I LOVE it. Plus, you only need to use a little bit so the bottle should last you at least a good 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many facial cleansers. Most of them can&#x27;t remove all of my makeup so I have to pair them with an eye makeup remover. But the Philosophy One-Step is perfect. It washes off all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling very clean without the sting some alcohol heavy cleansers leave. This has a nice clean scent and a light texture. It also lasts FOREVER.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash so far. I have used a ton of face washes after having pretty bad sick in my early 20&#x27;s. Since I began using Purity 4 years ago, I haven&#x27;t tried anything else, it has a pleasant smell, washing off any and all makeup, its great in the winter as it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and it washes off my waterproof mascara that even eye makeup remover doesn&#x27;t always do.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleanser that does not scratch or scrub. This is great for sensitive skin types like mine!</li>
            <li> Have tried other products and keep returning to purity for a face wash.  worth the price for a known product that works!</li>
            <li> Deep cleansing without drying out the skin</li>
            <li> This is the very best facial cleanser on the market.  I have tried many over the years &amp; keep coming back to this one, reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this the first cleaner I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight and blotchy. It smells nice and feels good on my skin. The large container is a great value.</li>
            <li> great value, cap came cracked but we used old bottle cap</li>
            <li> so far the best face wash I have been used!</li>
            <li> Purity is my all time facial cleanser. It melts away make-up easily, is gentle on the skin, and leaves it REALLY clean without feeling tight.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face cleaner of all times.. It&#x27;s super gentle but still gets rid of all the makeup even mascara! And it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin .. Love it</li>
            <li> Miracle product for me!!! I am 44, have terrible roseacea and tend to break out frequently. I have tried just about anything and everything... Including prescriptions and the most high end products..spending thousands on my skin. I received a sample of this, and brought it on a business trip just because of its size. In two days, a huge improvement was seen. I have been using this now for a month, and my skin has never looked better. No more redness, no more bumps, and my skin is smooth, wrinkles diminished...i am shocked. My skin was so bad I was embarrassed to be seen..now i can go out with no makeup if I wanted. Never expected this from Philosophy. I do like the light scent, and also use the Purity cloths at night before bed. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but if you suffer like I did, give it a shot!! I am a believer, and so grateful to find a product that works for me.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin &amp; read great reviews about this cleanser.  However, when I tried it, it felt slightly irritating and smelled a lot like bug spray.</li>
            <li> After months of emergency use simply because my regular skin cleanser wasn&#x27;t around, I began using Purity regularly. I was not a huge fan to begin with. I thought the consistency was too heavy and creamy for me but since i left my Yves Rocher cream cleanser about 150 miles away, I started using purity a for aweek straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry and somewhat sensitive.  This cleanser dried out my face even further filling up and creating wrinkles and a saginess to my face that I NEVER had and I&#x27;m only in my mid 20s. I had aged about 10 years after 1 week of this stuff. Horrible! Not only that but it left this residue in my fine lines that not even the best exfoliator and moisturizer can get rid off. After switching back to my old cleanser my skin is once again bright firm and supple.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this when I purchased another item and loved it so much had to buy the bottle. It&#x27;s well worth the price and keeps my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It leaves my skin feeling extremely smooth! I once suffered from major and minor brake outs but not anymore.</li>
            <li> A very good product that my face likes for removing the waterproof Mabelline mascara that I also love.</li>
            <li> BEST facial cleanser ever!</li>
            <li> I switched to Purity after purchasing a clarasonic. Best choice I ever made. My skin feels clean without feeling overly dry. The product last for a long time too. I only have to purchase it once a year cause not much product is needed.</li>
            <li> I refuse to buy the $30 bottle of Clairsonic cleaner your re supposed to buy, so I buy this because It cleans your face very good and at a nice price!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it.  It&#x27;s not drying but removes dirt and makeup easily.  Really good for my face.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey but it does the job without drying out my skin. I&#x27;d recommend it for normal to oily skins.</li>
            <li> Always love Philosophy products. The facial cleanser is pure and does a great job of cleaning. I have sensitive skin and need a product that doesn&#x27;t irritate. Philosophy fits that bill!</li>
            <li> thank you, philosophy for creating the perfect face wash! I have unbelievably dry skin but still get break outs from time to time. This facial cleanser has changed my life. Does not dry out my skin and has remedied my break outs! hardly ever get blemishes any more! Also recommend following with Hope in a Jar by Philosophy. I have followed this routine religiously ever since i discovered it a couple of years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back! love my skin now :)</li>
            <li> Arrived days early, perfectly intact.  Excellent seller, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my face.  No makeup, no chemicals.  At 60, my skin is real nice.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years.</li>
            <li> This face wash is hands down the best I have ever come across. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and ill keep buying it. It has made my skin SO much softer and has helped get rid of my redness. Must have!</li>
            <li> This cleanser works very good it leave my face filling very clean, smooth, and oil free.  I love it.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I love this product.  At first I was skeptical to try it because the reviews sounded too good to be true. Truth be told, many of the reviews were right. This product is great!  I look forward to washing my face daily. It cleanses thoroughly, leaves my oily skin fresh and clean, plus it smell fantastic!  The scent alone is spa-like and relaxing. I have oily and acne prone skin and this product works wonders on it.  Guess I&#x27;ve finally found my answer to good skin. . . Clarisonic + Purity Made Simple&#x3D; good clear skin</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial cleansers that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have acne and my skin is both dry and oily...lucky me :(  But, I found this product many years ago and am afraid of only one thing...that they stop making it!  It&#x27;s got a light feel to it but cleanses so well that my skin actually glows after using it.  It cleans without drying and I use it from 2-3 times a day.  It&#x27;s gotten my acne under control after having used many prescibed cleansers that overdried.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love Philosophy Purity.  Leaves my face clean of all makeup including mascara.  Been using it for years; nothing else measures up.</li>
            <li> Have used this cleanser for years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Everyone asks me what facial products i use and I always say Purity is the foundation of it all because you have to have an excellent facial cleanser at the base, and this one is superb.</li>
            <li> My must have product, used it for years &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> This product cleans off the toughest waterproof makeup.  I have really dry skin and I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight and overly dry after washing.  It also doubles as a great makeup brush cleaner.  Would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I u this with my Clarisonic and it does a nice job of cleaning off products gently and thoroughly. My skin feels clean, but not too dry father use. Did not clog pores or cause acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using Purity Made Simple for about six years now, and I wouldn&#x27;t think of using anything else. It is so gentle, yet effective, that you can rub it across your eyes with no problem. You can look at your wash cloth and see all the make-up and mascara that it removes. It is much cheaper at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I only wish it didn&#x27;t have quite so much fragrance, which might be a deal-breaker for some people. Smell before you buy if you can.</li>
            <li> My mother was having a hard time with facial cleansers irritating her eyes, and this is the only one she has found that is effective and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I have started using the Rodan and Fields Redefine - but I need a makeup melt cleanser which R&amp;F does not offer particularly for eye makeup.  So I stick with my tried and true Philosophy Purity Made Simple.</li>
            <li> It definitely dissolves all the make I have on my face and leaves it feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> Best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> use this stuff all the time</li>
            <li> Love this! Cleans all of my makeup off, and leaves my skin feeling great. I use a lot of skin care products to help prevent the things we don&#x27;t want as we age, and I love this cleanser because it is probably the ONLY thing I use that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh ingredients. Bonus--I use this to clean my makeup brushes..works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Moisturizing without being greasy. There is some kind of oil in there which helps melt away the makeup. Great makeup remover and facial wash. I wash twice if I&#x27;m wearing makeup, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Never drys your face yet cleans so well. Love Philosophy products!</li>
            <li> Very gentle, but tough enough to remove waterproof make-up.  It is the only facial cleanser I will use and the bottle is pretty enough to look nice on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> My wife originally bought this for her, but after trying it I&#x27;ve become a fan myself. I like that it&#x27;s not too harsh, as my skin is sensitive and gets irritatingly dry when using most face washes. We both feel that it leaves our complexions smooth and clear, and we&#x27;ll be buying a new bottle as soon as this one starts running low. And while it might seem expensive, it&#x27;s really not too bad when you realize how little of the stuff you have to use.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.  I had extremely dry skin and rosacea that were caused by the pill I was taking.  My skin has balanced out and I don&#x27;t even use moisturizer now.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this does not make my skin break out or have hives. It takes my eye make up off very easily.</li>
            <li> Like it!! I doesn&#x27;t feel drying after you wash your face and has a nice scent to it. Not too overpowering or anything. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Have purchased for several years either from Sephora or Ulta but the price on here was better!</li>
            <li> I found this cleanser on amazon by looking at highly rated ones from other buyers and I am so glad I found this! Super easy on your skin, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the job done, but it still cleanses well and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. Nice scent too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t really have problematic skin but I would say it verges on dry if I don&#x27;t moisturize. I have typically just used whatever face wash I have around because it didn&#x27;t make a difference. I had a small travel size of this and began using it since the packaging was cute, and I&#x27;ve found my skin actually looks better after using this consistently, so I bought a bigger size. :)</li>
            <li> I will never use any other cleanser again. I have very sensitive skin so it hard for me to find face products that do the job without causing irritation. This product is very gentle without lacking the ability to get all of the day&#x27;s dirt and makeup off of my face. I love it!</li>
            <li> Have used this for YEARS......, best recommendation I can give.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so smooth after use. I&#x27;m starting to trust this brand more and more. I&#x27;ve used this daily to get rid of oil and dirt. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or flaky. It leaves the right amount of moisture in my skin when I use it! USE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup but was gentle and non stripping. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This winter I noticed my skin was changing becoming more dry. I am turning 32 in a few weeks so I&#x27;m kind of in between acne prone skin and the need for anti-aging products. I had a sample of this wash and decided to try it because my face was soooo dried out from purpose cleanser. After 2 days of using this I had 3 major, painful cysts come up. This used to be a problem for me but after doing research I have found out how to prevent the cystic acne. I&#x27;m so mad at myself now for using this product because it&#x27;s not oil-free and not non-comedogenic. I should have known better. Now I get to look forward to celebrating my 32nd birthday with huge red painful cysts on my face for everyone to see! Maybe I will look closer to my teenage years with this breakout???</li>
            <li> My friend told me about the product. I was a little skeptical but after using Purity for a couple a days I was sold. It cleanses without drying your skin. It leaves my skin soft and feeling fresh. My search for a face cleanser is over.</li>
            <li> I love purity, it never breaks my skin out and I have sensitive skin.  This is so ridiculous that it wants more words to post this.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  It removes my makeup and leaves my face feeling completely clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li> This creame version of facial wash is nice, but the foam formula is better and much easier to use.  Really miss it! Don&#x27;t know why the manufacturer discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this face wash. Gentle, cleansing and moisturizing...</li>
            <li> I used it for a week or two and it did remove my makeup. I am now using something else only because I have melasma so I need something different for it.</li>
            <li> Your complexion is smoother and looks so much better. My husband noticed and told me my skin looked better since i started using it.</li>
            <li> very nice scent and i hear nice things so hopefully will do great on my skin</li>
            <li> Saw the recommended.  Don&#x27;t know why.  Does nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years. Love it. All I&#x27;m looking for is cleanse without irritating my skin, and this one meets my need perfectly. It&#x27;s affordable &amp; simple enough. Will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-purchased this a few times now and I just love this face wash. Not only does it remove all my make up but my skin is very sensitive, I&#x27;ve tried going bank to other face washes but I always end up back to purity it leave my face feeling squeaky clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I am a big clean freak when it comes to removing make-up or cleansing my face.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is a standard cleanser that I keep available at all times.&lt;br /&gt;After a wash, your face feels moisturized and soft. The scent is really mild and nice.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser does not lather though.  If you are a foam cleanser person, this is not a cleanser that you will like.&lt;br /&gt;If you wear a non-waterproof mascara, this cleanser will clean your lashes as well. (not so much for waterproof mascara)&lt;br /&gt;Very good product! Will buy more again :)</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal user of Purity cleanser for several years now.  It is the best cleanser I have found so far for my face.  Clears up acne quickly, cuts through makeup and dirt, and does not dry your skin out.  It has a creamy consistency and a nice lather.  Some people complain about the smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  I think it smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.  I believe this cleanser would work well for all skin types unless your skin is super, super dry.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing to use to clean my makeup brushes and a great facewash, can be used in place of makeup remover for sure. great to have all around, my 3rd big bottle.</li>
            <li> While this is easily the most expensive item, per ounce, in my bathroom, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets your face all de-greazed and ready for the day.  You don&#x27;t even need to gym or tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, thanks Veroz!</li>
            <li> I use this with the facial scrub daily.  It leaves my skin feeling great.  Gets makeup off easily.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.  I have very sensitive skin and it keeps my skin clear without over drying.  I have used it for years and will continue to.  High recommend it!</li>
            <li> Horrible.  I can not use Philosopy products.  I tried this entire line and cause me SEVERE dry skin for weeks!!! Still trying to recover my face!</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother-in-law who has very sensitive skin.  She loves it.  Has a very light scent and does not dry her skin out.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning your make up brushes n jus a relaxing bath gel</li>
            <li> Love all there products I use this on my face, gives a nice healthy glow and very nice clean feeling w/ out a film left behind.  I would recommend this to any one. If you haven&#x27;t tried this you should.</li>
            <li> I bought Purity because I saw on QVC that you can use it on your eyes to remove mascara.  IT WORKS!  It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and takes every trace of makeup off.  I can&#x27;t live without this product, and have began stocking up by the liter.</li>
            <li> my go to face wash! Skin always feels so clean and it takes off makeup so well.</li>
            <li> My mom is devoted to this stuff, so when I recently saw that QVC was having a $70 special buy for two of the 32 ounce bottles, I splurged and got one for her, and one for me to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros&lt;br /&gt;Nice size - will last a long time&lt;br /&gt;smell is nice&lt;br /&gt;creamy formula&lt;br /&gt;dissolves all of my makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons&lt;br /&gt;the scent is strong and I can still smell is for hours after I wash&lt;br /&gt;Can leave my skin tight and dry&lt;br /&gt;The price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t see enough of a difference between this and any other skin cleanser to justify the steep price tag, especially when I can get 32 ounces of cetaphil cleanser for less than $17. I have also heard that the formula has changed, which, while I cannot judge that as a new user of this product, It seems that for the price, there should be a lot more oils and natural ingredients in it, instead of just standard detergents.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and there is nothing better that I have found. Makeup remover is great and leaves me with a fresh face</li>
            <li> FORMULA: milky, lathers easily, gentle, leaves your skin hydrated and not feeling dry/tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m admittedly lazy about washing my face at night--I don&#x27;t like using a makeup remover AND using a separate cleanser afterwards--that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like cleansers that can&#x27;t be used around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser removes all my makeup without having to scrub hard, and I wear waterproof eyeliners. One of the best aspects about this cleanser is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes at all. It&#x27;s gentle on skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out afterwards--which is saying a lot for me, as I have sensitive dry skin. I can&#x27;t think of a single bad thing about it, it&#x27;s my new &#x27;holy grail&#x27; cleanser :).</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product works great.  Much cheaper here at Amazon vs other retailers!  This is a nice large size so don&#x27;t be afraid of the price!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s mildly scented, a little goes a long way, and it does a great job of removing makeup and thoroughly cleaning my skin. You can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philosophy Purity Made Simple for a number of years and I love it. It is a simple way to keep my skin clean and healthy. The 16 ounce bottle lasts for over a year!</li>
            <li> Allow me to \\&quot;preface\\&quot; (Ha..Ha...)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 24 year old woman, who was never too considerate of her problem skin until this year.&lt;br /&gt;When I moved up to Northern California for grad school, my skin decided to reap revenge on me.&lt;br /&gt;Now, i&#x27;ve always had \\&quot;problem\\&quot; skin, to the point that I was on accutane for several years (yuck)&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I grew out of it with the occasional end of the month breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, when I say my skin took revenge on me, I mean it - I lived out a solid two months feeling like a red-faced teenager, it was SO embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;I tried all sorts of face washes, creams, even doxycyclin didn&#x27;t help, &amp; there was no I was going back on accutane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cue the clairisonic aria and purity cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if it made me break out worse for any amount of time in the beginning since I was such a hot mess, but within about three weeks my skin cleared up, and when I say cleared up, I mean it looks the best it has EVER looked. Even the blemishes I do have go away much faster and my skin is moisturized, &amp; dare I say it.. Glowing?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the aria + cleanser every night, &amp; my face feels so squeaky clean when I&#x27;m falling asleep it makes me giddy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Girls, if you&#x27;re cross shopping for any philosophy, Amazon pretty much always has the best prices plus free shipping :] Can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also a few other things along with Philosophy and aria I use for my \\&quot;Beauty routine\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The Philosophy foaming cleanser for make-up removal&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Purity-Simple-Foaming-Cleanser/dp/B001KYTWLS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1358998632&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;philosophy+foaming+cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Kiehl&#x27;s: Rosa Arctica lightweight moisturizer (daily wear, great for foundation application), rare earth pore cleansing mask (there&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t beat with a quick drying mud mask), &amp; their overnight biological peel (for the love of god, get a sample of this stuff - It has a small concentration of hydrogen peroxide that makes your skin tingle and has you waking up looking so refreshed.)</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser. It is very soothing and always leaves my skin perfectly balanced-- never dry or oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years, it works double duty...removes makeup with a small amount of Purity and rinsed with water it moisturizes whether removing makeup or simply cleansing the face. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a strong odor.  I do like how clean it makes your skin feel however it smells as though I have cleaned my face with floor cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Purity for over 5 years now and there&#x27;s nothing else like it.  It cleans my face without drying it.  It&#x27;s also a good eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several facial cleansers, mainly drugstore brands. Aveeno, Clean &amp; Clear, Biore, Neutrogena - you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. I never had an issue with these brands until I decided to purchase Purity Made Simple. Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for a facial cleanser, but I&#x27;ve found success in other Philosophy products and came into a little extra money, so I thought \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. It doesn&#x27;t make my face extremely oily or dry, but the perfect balance. It doesn&#x27;t break me out. It smells pleasant. My favorite aspect of this product is that it removes all traces of makeup in ONE wash. With other cleansers, I&#x27;d have to wash 3-4 times to remove all of my makeup and I&#x27;d still wake up with residue under my eyes. A little goes a long way, which is great considering how expensive it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the price, give this product a try. I could almost guarantee that you won&#x27;t wanna turn back.</li>
            <li> Took me a while to get used to this face wash not lathering up like all the others but once I got past that I love it! Cleans well but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had heard so much about it. I LOVE all kinds of skin products and cosmetics, tried many and while I can say this is a decent one, I believe there are out there better ones for much less (such as Naive Aloe Facial Cleansing Foam by Kracie - 110g for less than $7). I will not buy it again</li>
            <li> I originally was looking for the philosophy purity oil free facial cleanser but found this one and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I really like how my face feels after using it.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of dry skin along with acne and this really has helped my face.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It cleanse but it doesnt leave my face feeling tight and dry. Plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> this product did not work for me. I can&#x27;t believe how oily it leaves my nose. I have normal to dry skin but this product leaves my nose oily for DAYS! the rest of my face is fine nothing out of the ordinary, its only my nose. Never buying it again!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Not real drying on the face. I like it and would order it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used. It leaves your skin feeling clean, refreshed, and doesn&#x27;t take away moisture. Its great to remove your eye makeup too it won&#x27;t burn your eyes. Also you can clean your makeup brushes with it and it works great. Nice, light scent.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  And after reading a couple reviews I was concerned I would end up with the wrong product.  But low-and-behold I ended up with the correct product and all is well!  I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash, mild and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought the largest available size of this product over a year ago and I am still using that same bottle (it was a BIG one). My skin loves this stuff! I have combination skin that easily breaks out if my skin is either too dry or too oily, and Purity has worked better for me than anything at keeping my skin clear, hydrated, and comfortable. I always thought that the answer to breaking out was more medicated washes, something like Proactiv (which I tried many moons ago). For me, ditching medicated anything and just getting quality products that soothe my skin has been the trick to ending my break outs-- this product is perfect for that. I use this in combination with Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;Hope in A Jar\\&quot; moisturizer, now I get compliments on my skin all the time!</li>
            <li> I was breaking out using other products and i usually have very clear skin. I switched to this and my skin is back the way it used to be. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I tried this product, wondering about all the hype around the &#x27;Philosophy&#x27; brand.  I initially tried a small sample from Ulta and loved it so much that I went with this 16-oz full-size version!&lt;br /&gt;This takes off all my waterproof makeup, and does so very very gently.  I have combination-dry skin that is temperamental in colder weather.  This cleanser doesn&#x27;t ever bother or dry out my skin, and it&#x27;s a lot easier than using makeup remover AND cleanser.  Sometimes it leaves some eyeliner left in my inner rim, which makes sense because I am not using soap directly on that area.  I get the remnants of liner off with a q-tip - this resulted in the 4-star rating, even though its not a big deal at all.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Started out with the sample size and that was when I discovered this perfect facial cleanser. Now i have the 16oz and half the ownership - my husband has also fallen in love with it. Both of us have combination / sensitive skin that gets dry after washing but this product doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate the skin. A small peanut sized amount leaves skin clean and supple and it does remove makeup modestly.&lt;br /&gt;Its good value for money too as the 3oz bottle lasted a month for the 2 of us. Well packaged and shipped. Strongly recommended product!</li>
            <li> Greatest face wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  I received a sample with a philosophy order and use nothing else but this cleanser.  I&#x27;m never unhappy with a Philosophy product.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well for me</li>
            <li> It is amazing how this cleanser removes all makeup without drying the skin--works better than I expected!  Do not want to go without it now!</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser of all time. I get pimples a little more than normal and this cleanser is gentle enough to not dry out my skin completely with the combination of my acne medication.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, gentle, milky product. Gets off all traces of makeup and dirt without stripping the skin. My mother even uses this now!</li>
            <li> always love this product.  good prixe too</li>
            <li> Makes my face break out, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different and my friend swears by it.</li>
            <li> Extremely gentle on the skin, this cleanser leave my face feeling clean, fresh, and best of all, hydrated! I&#x27;ve struggled with cleansers in the past due to skin sensitivity and a tendency to feel dry after washing my face, but Philosophy&#x27;s Purity is the only product I&#x27;ll use as long as it&#x27;s around. Pair with a Clarisonic for an even deeper clean!</li>
            <li> If I could give this no stars, I would do it without hesitation. To start off with, this stuff is disgustingly OVERPRICED, considering how many damaging ingredients there are in this product. While I might get comments in response to this &#x27;My skin feels fine&#x27;, &#x27;this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin&#x27; this doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this stuff is able to penetrate the skin membrane and damage your collagen (what makes your skin supple). Personally, when I first used this product I massaged it on my face without problem, but when I rinsed it off my skin felt tight and dry!&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t purity indicative of being gentle? Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;Just to give you more in depth criticism of this product is... IT HAS FREAKING BLACK PEPPER IN IT.&lt;br /&gt;As if all of the other oils filling in this junk product weren&#x27;t irritating enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to damage your skin from the inside out, go ahead and buy this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over a year. It has evened out my complection and leaves it feeling  very smooth.</li>
            <li> I received this product a few years ago as a gift. It was amazing. It is great on your face and no greasy feeling. Very subtle smell, if any. Cleans makeup off in a flash, even eye makeup. It does it all and is so gentle on my eyes. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction with the Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Balance.  This is the perfect dry-skin fighting duo.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other moisture-rich products have left me feeling like I still had a glaze of something on my skin, but a good rinse always leaves my face feeling clean of all product.</li>
            <li> face stays soft and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin which is what I was looking to do. Worth getting.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser in the past. I decided to try different products but have returned to this product. The scent is so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Now, I usually don&#x27;t write reviews unless the product is somewhat extraordinary and THIS, my friend, it is. I just received it today and used it for the first time while taking a shower. It left my skin silky smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt without any residue leftover from my makeup. Philosophy is the first makeup cleansing removing that actually does what it claims to do. I have used everything from Neutrogena, Garnier, Aveeno---makeup wipes to their foaming cleansers and nothing seemed to get my foundation and mascara and eyeliner off at the end of the day. (Now having that said, let me just be clear that I use pretty heavy eye makeup during the day.) I am surprised as to how great this stuff works! It is pricey but you know what they say &amp;#34;You get what you pay for,&amp;#34; and in this case, it is really true. I have seen so many YouTube gurus rave about this product but never thought it necessary because of the price, but I wish I did sooner because the amount of money I have used in CVS/Walgreens hoping to find the perfect facial makeup cleanser, could have probably been put to use in buying this holy grail product!  I will continue buying this product until I stop using makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many facial cleansers in my 60 years, and this is the only one that:&lt;br /&gt;*  Leaves my face feeling clean w/o any residue&lt;br /&gt;*  Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes&lt;br /&gt;*  Takes off mascara and liner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the only Philosophy product I can use due to eye sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product 100%.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great price.  I will be looking for more products.  Thank yoiu so much.&lt;br /&gt;keep up the good work</li>
            <li> dissolves my makeup, leaves face feeling clean and fresh and not tight. nice &amp;#34;spa-like&amp;#34; scent. will continue to purchase !</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. It lasts months if you use it like they tell you to, a size of a dime even though I probably use a quarter size. It makes my skin feel clean and is the only cleanser that can handle my breakouts and control my flare-ups</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. This plus the Mia 2&#x3D; No more acne.</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that simplifies my night time routine. Most of the time, it takes off all my eye makeup from the lids and lashes. The only thing that bugs me is that it leaves the makeup under my eye. It&#x27;s easy enough to wipe off with a towel, but sometimes I need to use a makeup remover wipe- which defeats the purpose of a one step cleanser. OVERALL, I&#x27;m in love with this stuff and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my second order, I love it!</li>
            <li> I have very fussy, sensitive skin. In the winter, this is perfect. Not too drying, evens out skin tone, keeps minor acne away. In the summer, I need something stronger. That is not a fault of the product, it&#x27;s just my skin. I say give it a try and see what happens.</li>
            <li> This face wash is great.  It gets all the makeup and oil off my face easily, but it feels really mild and creamy.  It also has a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> This cleanser by philosophy is THE BOMB DOT COM! I love using it when removing my makeup at the end of the day! It removes all my makeup but I always make sure that I use makeup removing facial wipes, for instance; the Neutrogena Makeup Removing Cleansing Towlettes to remove any left over foundation/makeup from my face. But anyways it leaves my face feeling soft, clean and fresh after!</li>
            <li> I have tried numersous products, both cheap and high end, for my skin.  PHILOSOPHY has got to be the BEST!  I have been using the products since 2011 and I am very pleased.  PHILOSOPHY is the only thing that I will ever use again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a very long time.It cleanses well but is gentle, with no harsh dyes or perfumes. I don&#x27;t use any other cleanser on my face. Great for sensitive skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The product does a great job of cleansing without drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of the product too!</li>
            <li> I tried this as a sample and loved everything about it.  It has a nice mellow scent, it both cleanses and tones, and it has no harsh chemicals.  I use it with a clarisonic mia and I haven&#x27;t had any acne since!</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and breaks out really easy, fortunately this cleanser did not irritate my skin at all and it takes away dirt from the day and my face feels fresh after using it. It does have a funny smell; I associate it with mosquito spray, so I was a bit worried to begin with (but it was nothing to worry about). I only need a small amount of the product for each time, I use it everyday, but I think the bottle will last for a while. It has already lasted some months. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product....thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (oily in some parts and dry around the T zone) and I have tried every type of face wash out there: Acne Free, Aveeno, Olay, Dove, Clearasil, Neutrogena, exfoliating washes, super expensive stuff, etc. I read the reviews for Philosophy Purity and thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a month for my skin to get used to it, and at first I wasn’t convinced it was worth it; however, once my skin got used to it, I will not use any other face wash out there. I love this stuff! I no longer have any acne, my skin is smooth and looks fresh, and I don’t need to use exfoliating products any more to get off my dead skin. This face wash seems to chemically exfoliate my skin without causing irritation or acne. If you have combo skin, I highly recommend this face wash! Just give your skin time to adjust to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning I use Philosophy Purity face wash, Dermalogica Active Toner, and Complex 15 moisturizer. My skin is soft, smooth, acne free, and looking better than it has in a few years. I highly recommend these products for those of you struggling with combo skin.</li>
