            <li> If you like it it is the best. However, one can not argue about taste or smell.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!,  TOO STRONG!!&lt;br /&gt;PACO BLEW IT  :(</li>
            <li> I have used Paco Rabanne for 40+ years!  I do love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many others, never liked anything as much.&lt;br /&gt;The compliments are frequent with my Paco Rabanne, Eau de Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never switch, It works for me, and always has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply the best!</li>
            <li> This cologne is the only one that my husband likes.  I give this to him at every B-Day and Xmas.  He is never tired of it.</li>
            <li> It was as expected and original version.&lt;br /&gt;I will strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> This cologne is my btothe&#x27;s favorite and my brother in law.&lt;br /&gt;I was surpriced not to find it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;The service from amazon was excellent.</li>
            <li> I have used Paco Rabanne for men for 35 years - and felt it was the perfect if not only cologne I felt good - and I do mean good - using. This product seems to capture the essentials - but somehow lasts for only half as long, if that. So, bottom line, I like it - but this purchase doesn&#x27;t have the staying power.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this cologne!! Unfortunately it&#x27;s getting tougher to find, since newer ones have come out by paco rabanne. He as many different colognes but this is the one he seems to wear the most.</li>
            <li> I liked one million so I put my faith in Paco rabanne when I ordered this. I would describe it as a 20-30&#x27;s yo mans cologne.  Very nice smell that changes it&#x27;s fragrance throughout the day much like one million, although much more appropriate for like a dinner or date than the bar/club or bar scene.</li>
            <li> attractive...noticeable.</li>
            <li> I use to use it and now it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction.  The product is exactly what I wanted.  Paco is a scent that never grows old.  I tried a lot of the newer Cologne but did not like them</li>
            <li> like this item very much</li>
            <li> Awesome. Good price and smells great.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Paco and he cannot find in any other store. thank you for carrying this fragrance.</li>
            <li> As advertised and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great smell.  Great price.</li>
