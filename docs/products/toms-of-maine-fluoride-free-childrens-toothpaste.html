            <li>and there were so many chemical ingredients I just gave up.</li>
            <li>Our kids love this tooth paste.  </li>

            <li>I went to amazon to see if I could find a better alternative.  </li>
            <li>Not only did I find this awesome brand</li>
            <li>Kids love it</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s fluorine-free.</li>
            <li>My kids (4 and 2) love it</li>
            <li>and I am glad it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride.</li>
            <li>It is her favorite from among all brands and flavors.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great product, my two young daughters love it.</li>
            <li>It smees very sweet.</li>
            <li>My kids love this toothpaste, and it&#x27;s fluoride free.</li>

            <li>Not super impressed.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great, fluoride free toothpaste for kids.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s peace of mind knowing its Flouride free.</li>
            <li>Fluoride free so they can swallow it if they don&#x27;t know how to spit yet.</li>
            <li>three tubes of toothpaste or saran wrapped together with the sticker and barcode indicating fluoride free however the product was fully fluorinated.</li>
            <li>It was a welcome addition with musical toothbrushes-</li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d noticed it was fluoride free before I bought it</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s on me for not reading closely enough lol.</li>
            <li>Good, but my girl is too young and I believe she will like it</li>
            <li>The strawberry flavor is fantastic, and hasn&#x27;t changed a bit since the 90&#x27;s when I first discovered it. :-)</li>
            <li>My 2 and 4 year olds love the flavor of this fluoride free toothpaste (versus mint flavors), which makes brushing their teeth a much easier production!</li>
            <li>My son is 3 yrs old and loves brushing his teeth with this toothpaste and I am glad to have a quality and safe toothpaste for him to keep his breath fresh and teeth clean!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this one and am glad we decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Not overly sweet.</li>
            <li>Good initially for teaching kids how to brush their teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really good, the next will consider buying in, thank you!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the flavor (as an adult) because I don&#x27;t like the strong taste of mint.</li>
            <li>- it doesn&#x27;t have a minty taste and is a pretty fantastic product all around.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s typically has great products.</li>
            <li>Grandkids really liked the taste; it&#x27;s a nice break from the usual minty  </li>
            <li>Really like this; received a free sample with another purchase.</li>
            <li>It is so useful..</li>
            <li>This toothpaste makes me feel better knowing that the ingredients are natural and they do not add fluoride.</li>
            <li>Our 2 years old love the strawberry taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult and love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The kids get fluorine treatments at the dentist&#x27;s office, but I was weary of them ingesting too much (which the dentist said can happen if they&#x27;re getting it in so many places), so I wanted something without the fluorine that also isn&#x27;t practically full of candy (like many other kids toothpastes appear to be).</li>
            <li>is the toothpaste seems a bit thin or runny, but it is still very good  and well worth using.</li>
            <li>After trying this brand my daughter (3 year old) started grabbing this one before the old tube of stuff she liked was finished.  </li>
            <li>These tubes are also full size, not the small childrens size so its a pretty good deal for 3 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Children&#x27;s toothpaste, by the United States to China, which lasted 23 days, although a little late, but the quality is very good, with good results, the children liked the taste, freon natural, trustworthy, will come back.</li>
            <li>My daughter likes it very much</li>
            <li>Good introduction to toothpaste for little ones.</li>
            <li>I have used this for all my kids when they first started brushing and they like it.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been using Tom&#x27;s standard toothpaste for a year or so and love it as well.</li>
            <li>I purchased fluoride free toothpaste for my 3 year old daughter, and received fully fluorinated toothpaste instead.  </li>
            <li>Lindsey seems to really like the taste, and readily opens her mouth when it&#x27;s time to brush teeth every night!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s fluoride free and overall more natural in comparison to typical kid toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Bought three at a time, a large one, the baby is like.</li>
            <li>got the &amp;#34;RADIUS Pure Baby Toothbrush for 6 months</li>
            <li>My son really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>So much for being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>My kids really like this</li>
            <li>( my picky granddaughter really hates mint) toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>I really like every product of Tom&#x27;s that we have tried.</li>
            <li>Very good,my son loves it.</li>
            <li>But she likes it and will let us use it, which is the main goal in brushing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Tom&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>The kids like this toothpaste and they are picky with most of the other natural toothpaste flavors.  </li>
            <li>I believe xylitol is enzymatic and will help clean the teeth which is so helpful with a squirmy toddler who doesn&#x27;t want to sit still for very long to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>but as they get older (mine are 5 and 3 years old)</li>
            <li>Look into these ingredients before you allow young children to use them!</li>
            <li>my 1.5yr old son loves the flavor and I have used it too when I run out of my regular Toms ;-)</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;d still rather them use plain old baking soda or Young Livings more natural alternative with essential oils, I will continue to buy this stuff until their little mouths mature :-)</li>
            <li>This is a great toothpaste, and my kids won&#x27;t use any other one (my older uses also the wicked mint by Tom&#x27;s of Maine).&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that it done not contain all the nasty stuff in regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li>So instead of pea-size amount I have to fill a whole brush head in order to be enough foam.</li>
            <li>I am always worried about which toothpaste to use for my 2 1/2 year old daughter because she is still learning to brush without swallowing the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Made from natural ingredients and works well.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s used to have like three ingredients, not anymore they may be wearing tank tops and volunteering, but they no longer make natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It also made my teeth sensitive after using it every evening for a month.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 2.5 year old.  </li>
            <li>My 2.5 year old loves this tooth paste.</li>
            <li>Fluoride is a near toxin.  </li>
            <li>I have a 2 and 3 year old and they like this.  </li>
            <li>+, Ultra Soft Bristles (3 Pack)&amp;#34; toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>My four year old daughter loves this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Tastes great for my little one but so thick!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for preschool aged kids (and probably older).</li>
            <li>Just a little more than the expected.</li>
            <li>Also, the top is a little harder to open for my three and four year old.  </li>
            <li>This is the only toothpaste my kids will use, and it&#x27;s significantly less sticky than other children&#x27;s fluoride-free toothpastes (such as those made by Jason and Kiss My Face, which I have great respect for, but which leave my kids&#x27; hands and faces, and the bathroom countertop, a gooey mess).</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste without the guilt of bad chemicals</li>
            <li>All I know is that this is the only toothpaste my young daughter enjoys brushing with, which means she will brush her teeth twice a day without being asked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hidden right there on the label, so be careful.</li>
            <li>my little boy likes so much it.</li>

            <li> is the toothpaste seems a bit thin or runny, but it is still very good  and well worth using.</li>
            <li> After trying this brand my daughter (3 year old) started grabbing this one before the old tube of stuff she liked was finished.  </li>
            <li> These tubes are also full size, not the small childrens size so its a pretty good deal for 3 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Children&#x27;s toothpaste, by the United States to China, which lasted 23 days, although a little late, but the quality is very good, with good results, the children liked the taste, freon natural, trustworthy, will come back.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it very much</li>
            <li> Good introduction to toothpaste for little ones.</li>
            <li> I have used this for all my kids when they first started brushing and they like it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using Tom&#x27;s standard toothpaste for a year or so and love it as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased fluoride free toothpaste for my 3 year old daughter, and received fully fluorinated toothpaste instead.  </li>
            <li> Lindsey seems to really like the taste, and readily opens her mouth when it&#x27;s time to brush teeth every night!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s fluoride free and overall more natural in comparison to typical kid toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Bought three at a time, a large one, the baby is like.</li>
            <li> got the &amp;#34;RADIUS Pure Baby Toothbrush for 6 months</li>
            <li> My son really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> So much for being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My kids really like this</li>
            <li> ( my picky granddaughter really hates mint) toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I really like every product of Tom&#x27;s that we have tried.</li>
            <li> Very good,my son loves it.</li>
            <li> But she likes it and will let us use it, which is the main goal in brushing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Tom&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> The kids like this toothpaste and they are picky with most of the other natural toothpaste flavors.  </li>
            <li> I believe xylitol is enzymatic and will help clean the teeth which is so helpful with a squirmy toddler who doesn&#x27;t want to sit still for very long to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> but as they get older (mine are 5 and 3 years old)</li>
            <li> Look into these ingredients before you allow young children to use them!</li>
            <li> my 1.5yr old son loves the flavor and I have used it too when I run out of my regular Toms ;-)</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;d still rather them use plain old baking soda or Young Livings more natural alternative with essential oils, I will continue to buy this stuff until their little mouths mature :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste, and my kids won&#x27;t use any other one (my older uses also the wicked mint by Tom&#x27;s of Maine).&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that it done not contain all the nasty stuff in regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> So instead of pea-size amount I have to fill a whole brush head in order to be enough foam.</li>
            <li> I am always worried about which toothpaste to use for my 2 1/2 year old daughter because she is still learning to brush without swallowing the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Made from natural ingredients and works well.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s used to have like three ingredients, not anymore they may be wearing tank tops and volunteering, but they no longer make natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It also made my teeth sensitive after using it every evening for a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2.5 year old.  </li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old loves this tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Fluoride is a near toxin.  </li>
            <li> I have a 2 and 3 year old and they like this.  </li>
            <li> +, Ultra Soft Bristles (3 Pack)&amp;#34; toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> My four year old daughter loves this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Tastes great for my little one but so thick!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for preschool aged kids (and probably older).</li>
            <li> Just a little more than the expected.</li>
            <li> Also, the top is a little harder to open for my three and four year old.  </li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my kids will use, and it&#x27;s significantly less sticky than other children&#x27;s fluoride-free toothpastes (such as those made by Jason and Kiss My Face, which I have great respect for, but which leave my kids&#x27; hands and faces, and the bathroom countertop, a gooey mess).</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste without the guilt of bad chemicals</li>
            <li> All I know is that this is the only toothpaste my young daughter enjoys brushing with, which means she will brush her teeth twice a day without being asked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hidden right there on the label, so be careful.</li>
            <li> my little boy likes so much it.</li>
            <li> I can usually get at least a few good swipes with the toothbrush before she decides to just swallow the toothpaste</li>
            <li> The kids didn&#x27;t like the new brand which makes it a little more difficult to get them to brush.  </li>
            <li> I found this deal, thinking I&#x27;m gonna get what I want comparatively cheaper; BUT first of strawberry feels not natural, AND it doesn&#x27;t foam as others usually do.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 17 months now and we&#x27;ve been brushing her teeth since she was just a few months old with just water, but decided to add in some toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t attest to its cavity fighting properties, will have to see in the long run, but she likes it and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
            <li> and it is very minor,</li>
            <li> I was worried about my kids ingesting too much fluoride from their usual toothpaste (they have a hard time understanding that they need to spit out their toothpaste, especially when they have to brush for a long time).</li>
            <li> Three pack lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> They did better with a regular minty toothpaste; they hate the taste and don&#x27;t swallow it.</li>
            <li> Our kids say they love the strawberry flavor of the paste and we don&#x27;t worry about kids getting sick from eating fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> They prefer it to other kids&#x27; toothpaste flavors.</li>
            <li> My daughter won&#x27;t brush with any other type of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t like the minty flavor of other kid&#x27;s tooth brushes, even the non mint ones all seem to have a bit of that biting minty stuff.</li>
            <li> So not appropriate for anyone who cannot spit appropriately, ESPECIALLY our children!</li>
            <li> My only complaint</li>
            <li> Slight mint taste.</li>
            <li> We have been brushing baby&#x27;s teeth since 10 months with this (previously using baby Colgate until it ran out).</li>
            <li> I remember using this toothpaste as a teenager newly obsessed with natural living, and I still use it sometimes to indulge my nostalgia.</li>
            <li> We used to buy his tooth paste at target but it became expensive because our target only held the small toothpaste tubes.  </li>
            <li> Triggers my allergies, I started trying to narrow down what ingredient made me nauseated each time I used the toothpaste</li>
            <li> Baby literally sucks this off the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> no more fussing !</li>
            <li> Thin packaging, and my son destroyed the lid immediately.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately could not return as the items have been opened</li>
            <li> We tried switching before because the brand our kids likes was expensive.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t usual, but is annoying when it happens.</li>
            <li> they just eat the toothpaste and in the end their breath still stinks.</li>
            <li> This is so expensive at the stores!  </li>
            <li> They sent me a wrong item!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is so useful.. my little boy likes so much it.</li>
            <li> my daughter has been using this since she was born. And since it contains no dyes, she&#x27;ll be using it for quite a time more.</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste. Well the kids love it.</li>
            <li> This product is very good , but my kids do not like it</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the flavor (as an adult) because I don&#x27;t like the strong taste of mint. My only complaint and it is very minor, is the toothpaste seems a bit thin or runny, but it is still very good  and well worth using.</li>
            <li> my girls like it！taste good！</li>
            <li> My daughter is 17 months now and we&#x27;ve been brushing her teeth since she was just a few months old with just water, but decided to add in some toothpaste. I&#x27;m really liking this one and am glad we decided to give it a try. Lindsey seems to really like the taste, and readily opens her mouth when it&#x27;s time to brush teeth every night! I can usually get at least a few good swipes with the toothbrush before she decides to just swallow the toothpaste and I can finish the job with some extra water. Good introduction to toothpaste for little ones.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product, my two young daughters love it. I can feel good about the Tom&#x27;s of Maine quality and that it is fluoride-free. It is one of those things that makes the bedtime routine easier because the kids look forward to brushing their teeth with this strawberry-flavored toothpaste. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Children&#x27;s toothpaste, by the United States to China, which lasted 23 days, although a little late, but the quality is very good, with good results, the children liked the taste, freon natural, trustworthy, will come back.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes the strawberry flavor but i wish it had xylitol to help even more than just brushing to decrease plaque and tartar. I believe xylitol is enzymatic and will help clean the teeth which is so helpful with a squirmy toddler who doesn&#x27;t want to sit still for very long to brush her teeth. But she likes it and will let us use it, which is the main goal in brushing.</li>
            <li> Nice toothpaste, my son likes it and his teeth is so bright &amp; shiny!</li>
            <li> I was worried about my kids ingesting too much fluoride from their usual toothpaste (they have a hard time understanding that they need to spit out their toothpaste, especially when they have to brush for a long time). Our kids say they love the strawberry flavor of the paste and we don&#x27;t worry about kids getting sick from eating fluoride toothpaste. I highly recommend this for preschool aged kids (and probably older).</li>
            <li> My son really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li> Daughter doesn&#x27;t refuse it!</li>
            <li> Great price! my 1.5yr old son loves the flavor and I have used it too when I run out of my regular Toms ;-)</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste my kids will use - it doesn&#x27;t have a minty taste and is a pretty fantastic product all around.  I would highly recommend Tom&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I have used this for all my kids when they first started brushing and they like it. It&#x27;s non fluoride so if they swallow some while brushing it&#x27;s not harmful.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for kids.  No fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had the caps break off of a couple of tubes.  It isn&#x27;t usual, but is annoying when it happens.</li>
            <li> My kids love this toothpaste, and it&#x27;s fluoride free. I have been using it for over 3 years already.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste without the guilt of bad chemicals, I will order again. My children also love it</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste!  Taste is nice and cleans well. It&#x27;s peace of mind knowing its Flouride free.</li>
            <li> My sons swear by this toothpaste. They love the taste. I love that it&#x27;s fluoride free and overall more natural in comparison to typical kid toothpaste. While I&#x27;d still rather them use plain old baking soda or Young Livings more natural alternative with essential oils, I will continue to buy this stuff until their little mouths mature :-)</li>
            <li> my kids love this and the flavor.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the flavor and I like that it does not contain fluoride so I don&#x27;t have to worry about her swallowing it!  My wife and I have been using Tom&#x27;s standard toothpaste for a year or so and love it as well.</li>
            <li> Good. Just a little more than the expected.</li>
            <li> Tastes great for my little one but so thick!</li>
            <li> Slight mint taste. Not overly sweet.</li>
            <li> I like this brand, and I was looking for fluoride-free paste as my last one was finished. I found this deal, thinking I&#x27;m gonna get what I want comparatively cheaper; BUT first of strawberry feels not natural, AND it doesn&#x27;t foam as others usually do. So instead of pea-size amount I have to fill a whole brush head in order to be enough foam. Now I have 2 more to go...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a better deal anywhere like this</li>
            <li> This is such a great, fluoride free toothpaste for kids. I am always worried about which toothpaste to use for my 2 1/2 year old daughter because she is still learning to brush without swallowing the toothpaste. This toothpaste makes me feel better knowing that the ingredients are natural and they do not add fluoride.</li>
            <li> My kids love the toothpaste. Made from natural ingredients and works well. It&#x27;s a nice alternative to mint toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I like it and prefer this for my children. But my kids like the toms toddler tooth paste better.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste, and my kids won&#x27;t use any other one (my older uses also the wicked mint by Tom&#x27;s of Maine).&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that it done not contain all the nasty stuff in regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> My son uses this toothpaste and we don&#x27;t have to worry about him swallowing fluoride. No cavities, either! Much better price than buying in the store.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the ingredients, but until i find a great recipe, this is the best to buy.</li>
            <li> Bought three at a time, a large one, the baby is like.</li>
            <li> Good, but my girl is too young and I believe she will like it</li>
            <li> kids love this strawberry smell.</li>
            <li> Good initially for teaching kids how to brush their teeth but as they get older (mine are 5 and 3 years old) they just eat the toothpaste and in the end their breath still stinks. They did better with a regular minty toothpaste; they hate the taste and don&#x27;t swallow it.</li>
            <li> My son is 3 yrs old and loves brushing his teeth with this toothpaste and I am glad to have a quality and safe toothpaste for him to keep his breath fresh and teeth clean!</li>
            <li> Good poducts.Fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my kids will use, and it&#x27;s significantly less sticky than other children&#x27;s fluoride-free toothpastes (such as those made by Jason and Kiss My Face, which I have great respect for, but which leave my kids&#x27; hands and faces, and the bathroom countertop, a gooey mess). I remember using this toothpaste as a teenager newly obsessed with natural living, and I still use it sometimes to indulge my nostalgia. The strawberry flavor is fantastic, and hasn&#x27;t changed a bit since the 90&#x27;s when I first discovered it. :-)</li>
            <li> Triggers my allergies, I started trying to narrow down what ingredient made me nauseated each time I used the toothpaste and there were so many chemical ingredients I just gave up. Tom&#x27;s used to have like three ingredients, not anymore they may be wearing tank tops and volunteering, but they no longer make natural toothpaste. I tried to get information of the source of their ingredients by email and they were not helpful, saying to call (who has the time for that?).</li>
            <li> My kid will only use Tom&#x27;s strawberry flavored toothpaste</li>
            <li> My boys favorite toothpaste!! They won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Baby literally sucks this off the toothbrush.  Thank goodness there&#x27;s no fluoride...</li>
            <li> My son loves the flavor</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it very much</li>
            <li> Our kids love this tooth paste.  And we feel it is really good for them.</li>
            <li> Yes, just like all the one-star reviews say, this contains SLS. It&#x27;s hidden right there on the label, so be careful. I&#x27;m sure the incredibly minute dose found in a pea-sized ball of toothpaste will kill us all one day.  All I know is that this is the only toothpaste my young daughter enjoys brushing with, which means she will brush her teeth twice a day without being asked. Better than I did when I was her age, when my choice was mint...or mint.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  This is so expensive at the stores!  Thankful I found this as I don&#x27;t like toothpaste with fluoride.</li>
            <li> My 2 and 4 year olds love the flavor of this fluoride free toothpaste (versus mint flavors), which makes brushing their teeth a much easier production!</li>
            <li> very good and  the child likes it.</li>
            <li> Good flavor and fluoride free!</li>
            <li> Has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Carrageenan! So much for being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.  It also made my teeth sensitive after using it every evening for a month. I will never use this product again!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, I was very satisfied.  Thank you... A+++</li>
            <li> My son hates any toothpaste that is too minty (spicy he calls it) and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the non fluoride option for ids. My kids like the toothpaste too. Will get again and again. Wish I could find it at a grocery store though. I only find the Tom&#x27;s fluoride toothpaste for kids at the store.</li>
            <li> My kids love this and I love that it is free from fluoride. They prefer it to other kids&#x27; toothpaste flavors.</li>
            <li> Perfect toothpaste for kids. Our 2 years old love the strawberry taste. Fluoride free so they can swallow it if they don&#x27;t know how to spit yet.</li>
            <li> My kids really like this</li>
            <li> Pretty good, my girl loves it!</li>
            <li> The best children&#x27;s learning toothpaste</li>
            <li> Wish it were cheaper, but...  These make brushing more tolerable for my son.</li>
            <li> Thankful to find this on line with out fluoride. The store version contains it. My daughter likes the taste and it doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I purchased fluoride free toothpaste for my 3 year old daughter, and received fully fluorinated toothpaste instead.  three tubes of toothpaste or saran wrapped together with the sticker and barcode indicating fluoride free however the product was fully fluorinated. unfortunately could not return as the items have been opened</li>
            <li> Kids love the taste!!</li>
            <li> My kids like the taste, I like that the ingredients are safe.</li>
            <li> They sent me a wrong item! Never buy this again.</li>
            <li> My children all love the strawberry flavored toothpaste. It&#x27;s a winner in our house.</li>
            <li> keeps the doctor away.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to brush her teeth using this toothpaste, and I feel safe knowing that there are no added ingredients that will harm her. Tom&#x27;s typically has great products.</li>
            <li> Thin packaging, and my son destroyed the lid immediately.  Great flavor... So great we run through it much quicker than when we use aqua fresh.</li>
            <li> My children do not like the taste.</li>
            <li> It smees very sweet. But I tried it and feel it like flour quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult and love this toothpaste. It took me a while to find a fluoride free toothpaste that was a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2.5 year old.  We used to buy his tooth paste at target but it became expensive because our target only held the small toothpaste tubes.  I went to amazon to see if I could find a better alternative.  Not only did I find this awesome brand it was a great deal.  My 2.5 year old loves this tooth paste.</li>
            <li> We have been brushing baby&#x27;s teeth since 10 months with this (previously using baby Colgate until it ran out). He had no issues with the Colgate but felt this was a healthier alternative. Baby is now 21 months and has always been cooperative about brushing. The strawberry fragrance is pleasant yet not overpowering, though I haven&#x27;t tried tasting it myself. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Using this product results in rapid buildup of yuck on teeth that brushing doesn&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li> Kids love it and I love that it&#x27;s fluorine-free. The kids get fluorine treatments at the dentist&#x27;s office, but I was weary of them ingesting too much (which the dentist said can happen if they&#x27;re getting it in so many places), so I wanted something without the fluorine that also isn&#x27;t practically full of candy (like many other kids toothpastes appear to be).</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 4 year old.  no fluoride! and tastes good for him</li>
            <li> Really like this; received a free sample with another purchase. Grandkids really liked the taste; it&#x27;s a nice break from the usual minty  ( my picky granddaughter really hates mint) toothpastes.  It was a welcome addition with musical toothbrushes- no more fussing !</li>
            <li> After all the browsing and shopping around, I selected this model upon favorable reviews. So far It works great on my kids and the price affordable.</li>
            <li> I use this and I&#x27;m a grown woman. It&#x27;s delicious! Makes me actually care about brushing after every meal.</li>
            <li> My daughter won&#x27;t brush with any other type of toothpaste. She doesn&#x27;t like the minty flavor of other kid&#x27;s tooth brushes, even the non mint ones all seem to have a bit of that biting minty stuff. Wish I&#x27;d noticed it was fluoride free before I bought it but that&#x27;s on me for not reading closely enough lol.</li>
            <li> sodium laurel sulfate? Carageenan? Look into these ingredients before you allow young children to use them!</li>
            <li> Good product for a fluoride free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My kids (4 and 2) love it</li>
            <li> I really like every product of Tom&#x27;s that we have tried.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the stuff. Can&#x27;t attest to its cavity fighting properties, will have to see in the long run, but she likes it and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
            <li> Fluoride is a near toxin.  It can create all kinds of behavior and academic dysfunctions.  If you have fluoride in your drinking water, please please research this.  Did you know on the back of fluoride toothpaste it says if ingested call poison control?  O  M  G.  So not appropriate for anyone who cannot spit appropriately, ESPECIALLY our children!</li>
            <li> Got this for me and my toddler, im trying to stay away from flouridated toothpaste</li>
            <li> Very good,my son loves it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is not too fond of the taste. After this, I might switch back to Nuk</li>
            <li> 真的不错，下次还会考虑购买在，谢谢了！&lt;br /&gt;Really good, the next will consider buying in, thank you!</li>
            <li> Not super impressed.  Has sugar in it and my toddler stopped liking in within a week.</li>
            <li> Kiddo loves brushing her teeth with this stuff and I am glad it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride. Three pack lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Like that it is not mint flavored&lt;br /&gt;No fluoride&lt;br /&gt;Easy order and delivery</li>
            <li> The kids like this toothpaste and they are picky with most of the other natural toothpaste flavors.  It is a bit sticky so it loves to adhere to the sink bowl.  Also, the top is a little harder to open for my three and four year old.  That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The kids like this stuff a lot.  I have a 2 and 3 year old and they like this.  We tried switching before because the brand our kids likes was expensive.  The kids didn&#x27;t like the new brand which makes it a little more difficult to get them to brush.  After trying this brand my daughter (3 year old) started grabbing this one before the old tube of stuff she liked was finished.  Bingo we have a winner.  With the Fluoride Free they can swallow it and its ok.  These tubes are also full size, not the small childrens size so its a pretty good deal for 3 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also got the &amp;#34;RADIUS Pure Baby Toothbrush for 6 months +, Ultra Soft Bristles (3 Pack)&amp;#34; toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The kids don&#x27;t run out of the bathroom after showers/bath now, they ask to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter loves this toothpaste.  It is her favorite from among all brands and flavors.  Never had any teeth problems.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say that can be swallowed by a baby.. Include in specs</li>
