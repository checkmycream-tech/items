            <li> My sister loves getting this for a gift.</li>
            <li> The wonderful scent of this body creme makes you feel like you&#x27;ve been pampered in luxury. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that never feels sticky or oily and it lasts all day.  When I use this creme, I don&#x27;t even need the parfum.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s great for m dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this item for me for Valentine&#x27;s Day, but what I received was a 2.5oz. tube that is actually part of a gift set.  The back of the tube states, &amp;#34;Not for individual sale.&amp;#34;  I did not notice this until I had used a few times.  I love this fragrance, but not the deception!</li>
            <li> This item was just as described.  My grandmother loves it.  It has a very light scent to it and it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love Cashmere Mist. This body creme is lovely. The cream itself is nice but it has enough fragrance that I travel with it rather than take a glass container.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Donna Karan cashmere mist parfum body spray (picture displayed and received the body creme and was charged for the amount of 69.95GBP. This is not correct as the page I was viewing said 18..GBP. I would like to know what happened to the parfum that I ordered because I bought it with my christmas gift voucher for 50.00GBP.  Regards  Charlotte Thorburn</li>
            <li> Cashmere Mist is one of my favorite scents. It was great to get it at a bit of a discount.</li>
            <li> Great was to wear a very light sent and soften your skin. I get so many compliments wearing it as well. Price was much better then what I have paid at Macy&#x27;s department store for the same Body cream.</li>
            <li> Wife loves everyDonna Karan products</li>
            <li> Donna Karen never disappoints. This creme  is thick without being gloppy and goes on smooth. You already know what to expect of the fragrance... compliments from whoever you pass!</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful! Love this product. I have used this for years and amazon has a much better bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that this did not hold it&#x27;s fragrance for me.

            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this Cashmere Mist body cream, it didn&#x27;t smell like Cashmere Mist perfume to me, however this is just my opinion. I guess it will just sit on my dresser :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely DREAMY!!!!  The scent is FABULOUS - don&#x27;t bother with the perfume because it is NOT as good as the lotion!  HIGHLY recommend!!!!!</li>

            <li> A great fragrance you will never forget that lasts a very long time!  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The product came with clear tape across the cap, no tamper evident protection - looks like it was opened before and used.  Other similar products have packaging that provides safety assurance.  Way too much money for a product that I can&#x27;t use....I&#x27;ll be sending it back.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance! Now I can &amp;#34;layer&amp;#34;, as I also have the shower cream and mist! I usually do NOT pay this much for fragrances, but for this, even though it was a good price, it&#x27;s more than I would normally spend...but I love it!</li>
            <li> Just what I thought it would be!  A beautiful soft powder like scent!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Cashmere Mist for several years.  I love all of the products.  A day seldom goes by that I am not asked what beautiful fragrance I am wearing.</li>
            <li> I just bought this perfume after I received a sample of it from Sephora. I have to say that I absolutely adore this scent. It&#x27;s light enough to wear during the day or night and is versatile because it comes in many other forms besides the Eau de Parfum. I bought the 3.4oz bottle, and on top of the fragrance becoming one of my new favorites, the bottle looks great on my dressing table. I would most certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent,soft and light,get compliments every time I have it on!</li>
            <li> Donna Karan Cashmere Mist is one of my favorite fragrances for work - nice and light, but pretty.  It is too expensive in the department stores to afford.</li>
            <li> I the best body creme ever I Love it I smell a sample in the store and I order online it exactly the same. I will order more :). Thanks</li>
            <li> For me, I can&#x27;t ask for anything better. The smell of this lotion is so soft, elegant, and feminine but not overwhelming which is exactly what I needed. I ordered the perfume as well, but that has not arrived yet. By the way things have gone so far, i&#x27;m pretty sure I will love it!</li>
            <li> This cream feel wonderful on the skin. Not at all greasy. The fragrance is light and leaves room for the perfume without being too much.</li>
            <li> A good bargain, it is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Donna Karan never disappoints.  Cashmere Mist is a soft and subtle fragrance.  The body creme is wonderful and gives an overall but not strong scent.  It is a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> My wifes favorite and I was having a hard time finding it until I turned to Amazon. She is a daily user and I will say I like the smell of it too. That is probably why I buy it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it continues to be my favorite fragrance.  Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a rich creme that lasts for a good period.  Everytime I put it on, someone asks &amp;#34;who smells so good&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times...it is not greasy but smooth.  I love the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I do prefer the lotion over the creme now that I&#x27;ve tried both.</li>
            <li> This tube lasts me about six months; I wear it daily and layer it with DK Cashmere Mist Cologne.  I wore a different cologne and body lotion for 30 years until they discontinued the body lotion.  I wanted something fresh that didn&#x27;t have a sweet, sickening fragrance that gave me a headache.  This is such a great fragrance, and I so glad to find something that smells so fresh.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the service and product!</li>
            <li> This creme is perfect for summer parched skin with its richness and light fragrance.  I always get compliments on the aroma.</li>
            <li> Smells as good as the Parfum Spray.</li>
