            <li> This has become my Go To brush. Easy to clean and holds lots of liquid. Wishing I had bought 2 so I would have a spare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited for so many years to find a brush for acrylic that wouldn&#x27;t gather product and get all clumpy. Found it! The bristles in this thing are excellent! It&#x27;s well-made and fits easily in the hand. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of pressure as the bristles are the proper stiffness. I absolutely adore this brush. If I ever have to replace it, I&#x27;ll get another one just like it. (20 years experience)</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheap $8 brush I bought at Sally&#x27;s. Makes a huge difference in applying acrylic. so much easier!</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this brush. Its not awkward or long and heavy. The bristles are soft and there&#x27;s a lot. My acrylic doesn&#x27;t easily get stuck in it. It makes doing acrylics a lot easier for me. It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve purchased so far.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped very quickly. I ordered it on May 6th and I received it on May 9th.&lt;br /&gt;If I ever need another one, id purchase this one again no doubt.</li>
            <li> This is my top pick to use in my salon for nails.  The perfect point at the end makes it easy to create beautiful smile lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cool ;) my best acrylic brush. My teacher let me try this brush when I was in acrylic class.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent brush but there&#x27;s no metal cover like on the picture for it so I will give it 4 stars</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great price and beautiful brush. Definitely recommend this to any nail technician or at home user. Excited to put it to work!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this brush for her acrylic applications. She is self taught from videos online, we bought all the products from various websites and some practice fingers. This brush is a great brush for beginners and is a perfect size to put acrylic on smaller to medium size hands. You will love this brush, easy to clean, and keeps its shape.</li>
            <li> Excellent for applying acrylic, Perfect size and no shedding!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Very easy to use, great durability.</li>
            <li> Amazing! It got here super fast and it works great! Makes everything so much easier !  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and its still in perfect condition.. It&#x27;s super light and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I ordered the brush to replace one that I had before for several years.  It is not exactly the same but it is a very nice brush.  It did not come the the silver cover as shown in the pic.  A picture was requested of what was received but I have don&#x27;t have a camera.  I still like the brush!</li>
