            <li>I love the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product from this seller.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is cheap junk but works OK for about 2 months and starts to degrade thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream will cool, stop itching and help heal your condition in about a week!</li>
            <li>so if you use it to clean your butt if you have hemorrhoids be sure you putting creme on your \\&quot;area\\&quot; after your out of the bath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to give it 2 more stars, the fact that it has stained all of my lovely washcloths (would&#x27;ve purchased cheap pk had I known) and doesn&#x27;t lather much prevents</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic at keeping acne away.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, and works great.</li>
            <li>Hibicleans is great for cleaning my hands (not frequently) only when needed on my hiking trips or where I have no access to water.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for bacne which I developed after thyroidectomy- hormonal</li>
            <li>I love the foaming mode, and the dispensing 16oz size is just right for home or travel.  </li>
            <li>The best soap for my wrestling son&#x27;s to keep the skin germs at a LOW!&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle enough that it does not dry their skin and good for the face.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is easily 50% of other retail- allowing the use of the best product available at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely excited to find that Amazon.com carries this item.  </li>
            <li>at the first sign of a break out I put Hibiclens on and within a day or two its cleared up :)</li>
            <li>I use a clean wash cloth each day and the Hibiclens.  </li>
            <li>I am more cautious about catching germs now when in public places or restrooms, handling shopping carts etc.</li>
            <li>It has no discernible smell and rinses off cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I am obese and also use to clean between the folds of skin which has also prevented infections.  </li>
            <li>Hibiclens is used by physicians and nurses to clean away germs and bacteria on their hands.  </li>
            <li>Nice foaminfg action when used with the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the foaming pump with this product, this will make the application much easier with zero product loss.</li>
            <li>I made sure to then rinse with water very well and</li>
            <li>I tested negative and was very happy to not have to get the meds before giving birth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this per my doula&#x27;s recommendation to wash myself in order to pass my strep b test since I am pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Buying it from Amazon is quick, convenient and in this size with the pump</li>
            <li>This a very good cleanser for people with delicate skin or if you&#x27;re allergic to betadine</li>
            <li>So glad it is available to the public.</li>
            <li>When I traveled out of the country where many things were possibly contaminated, I felt comfortable in knowing that with a pump of this cleanser almost any virus or bacteria that touched my hands were going to be eliminated after washing.</li>
            <li>this will keep you feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>You must use soo much to feel clean.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have very sensitive skin and certain vitamins</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, I even use it to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li>I first used this when I was at the emergency room.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this stuff for a different reason.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>My 3 year old had reoccuring staph infections, after weekly use of this product she has now been infection free for 1 year.  </li>
            <li>His face looks pretty radiant now that he is using the product.</li>
            <li>really like the foam pump as well!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re interested in a skin scrub to eradicate ANY nasties, this is the one, ne plus ultra</li>
            <li>How could it have taken so long for someone to design such a simple product that works effortlessly and flawlessly</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>&quot; good, since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time (upon suggestion from a dermatologist).</li>
            <li>After falling off my mountain bike time after time, I had to learn to deal with all the injuries and Neosporin was the first product I used and learned quickly that Neosporin cannot be applied to wounds at all since after the body produces scab which is the natural healing process of the body tenting and covering the wound,</li>
            <li>I am strep b positive and will have to get penicillin while on labor.  </li>
            <li>actually found out that rubbing this on my face with my fingertips and following it up with warm water worked better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and any facial.</li>
            <li>and no doctor can give ma straight answer or a solution that really gets rid of them.</li>
            <li>You really need a pump, as this doesn&#x27;t lather on</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have any way to really tell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item to anyone!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much this stuff costs, I will never run out.  </li>
            <li>I had a very severe case of infected eczema.  </li>
            <li>and it seems the healing occurs much faster.</li>
            <li>Many years ago, my determatologist suggested that I use Hibiclens as a substitute for deodorant to combat the rash that developed every time I used the latter.  </li>
            <li>Great product , a little goes a long way .</li>
            <li>I am an obese female and my doctor was the one who recommended using Hibiclens as a way to keep the areas of my body which have \\&quot;folds\\&quot; clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty harsh cleanser though, I have eczema on my legs mostly in the winter, and I cannot use this on my legs.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t peel, but it keeps my oily skin from getting infected, resulting in very soft and gentle complexion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Calmospetine creme that I found at Wal_Mart in the pharmacy (but it over the counter cream).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Either buy a pump to go with it, or just buy a cheap foaming hand soap, empty it, and use that bottle.</li>
            <li>Less effective products only wipe out the weaker strains of germs...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little ocd about clean hands and this stuff does the trick!</li>
            <li>and after it was drained and my incision got closed up in four days, the doc had to pack it once( amazing for such a deep wound).</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and wanted to break from my normal use of alcohol due to it&#x27;s harshness, Hibiclens was chosen because of it&#x27;s dependable, mild antiseptic reputation.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter had an outbreak on her bottom that looked like acne.  </li>
            <li>I know if you type \\&quot;natural brush\\</li>
            <li>I washed with Hibiclens ONCE and the irritation and itching was completely gone.</li>
            <li>Whenever I&#x27;ve had a cut near a nail</li>
            <li>alcohol,&lt;br /&gt;4) apply Manuka honey or any quality raw honey full of pollens and enzymes,&lt;br /&gt;5) apply almond and castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bleach is a powerful disinfectant, but you don&#x27;t pour the stuff on a cut and yet many of us reach for a bleach called hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, not realizing that while it&#x27;s murder on germs, our skin also suffers.</li>
            <li>when they claim a broad range of efficacy, they understate.</li>
            <li>I had developed an odor in my-um- private area.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it smells absolutely terrific, is aggressive enough to prepare a surgeons hands for work, and gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful and I used it as directed per my doula and other internet websites.</li>
            <li>so it is very confusing to me to see alcohol rubs all over many institutions when just washings hand with soap and water can accomplish the same.</li>
            <li>We bought this because my son and husband came down with staph infections, and it was very helpful clearing those up.  </li>
            <li>Using any type of alcohol on skin, kills the good germs as well as the bad germs</li>

            <li> I highly recommend Calmospetine creme that I found at Wal_Mart in the pharmacy (but it over the counter cream).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Either buy a pump to go with it, or just buy a cheap foaming hand soap, empty it, and use that bottle.</li>
            <li> Less effective products only wipe out the weaker strains of germs...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little ocd about clean hands and this stuff does the trick!</li>
            <li> and after it was drained and my incision got closed up in four days, the doc had to pack it once( amazing for such a deep wound).</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and wanted to break from my normal use of alcohol due to it&#x27;s harshness, Hibiclens was chosen because of it&#x27;s dependable, mild antiseptic reputation.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter had an outbreak on her bottom that looked like acne.  </li>
            <li> I know if you type \\&quot;natural brush\\</li>
            <li> I washed with Hibiclens ONCE and the irritation and itching was completely gone.</li>
            <li> Whenever I&#x27;ve had a cut near a nail</li>
            <li> alcohol,&lt;br /&gt;4) apply Manuka honey or any quality raw honey full of pollens and enzymes,&lt;br /&gt;5) apply almond and castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bleach is a powerful disinfectant, but you don&#x27;t pour the stuff on a cut and yet many of us reach for a bleach called hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, not realizing that while it&#x27;s murder on germs, our skin also suffers.</li>
            <li> when they claim a broad range of efficacy, they understate.</li>
            <li> I had developed an odor in my-um- private area.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it smells absolutely terrific, is aggressive enough to prepare a surgeons hands for work, and gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful and I used it as directed per my doula and other internet websites.</li>
            <li> so it is very confusing to me to see alcohol rubs all over many institutions when just washings hand with soap and water can accomplish the same.</li>
            <li> We bought this because my son and husband came down with staph infections, and it was very helpful clearing those up.  </li>
            <li> Using any type of alcohol on skin, kills the good germs as well as the bad germs</li>
            <li> I used to get break outs all the time, and facial cleansers would just dry it out.</li>
            <li> so I am assuming she caught something sitting on the toilet seats there.  </li>
            <li> In fact I have spent hundreds of dollars in this time using prescription pills, antibiotics, cremes, oils, treatments - such as heating the area and trying to pop the bumps days later if you can get a head to form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on minor scrapes and cuts.  </li>
            <li> soap can dry your skin out as well</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it kept fighting the bacteria that caused my face to break out</li>
            <li> It makes them dry and itch like wildfire...</li>
            <li> pat dry.  </li>
            <li> I used this product (heavily diluted) to wash 2 times daily 4 days before I was to be tested for Strep B with our third child.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and performed as expected.  </li>
            <li> As long as he bathes with this to knock down the bacteria load on his skin he doesn&#x27;t experience boils &amp; irritations.</li>
            <li> I use Hibiclens for acne and other skin issues, like boils.</li>
            <li> bottle and just refill a small bottle as necessary.  </li>
            <li> Believe me you do not want it or any other disease.  </li>
            <li> If you have skin problems due to microbials, buy this.  </li>
            <li> I use it as other reviewers have noted for folds and other irritations....  </li>
            <li> But a must have if you have cancer or other immune problems.</li>
            <li> I use this on my mother due to skin breakdown.  </li>
            <li> Of course it is a different story for real heavy or disable individuals, with limited movements and for them Hibiclens may be a necessity since it is cut down 30% with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s active ingredients keep working after you have rinsed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;1) washing it with Dr. Bronner organic baby wash and water,&lt;br /&gt;2) allowing it to dry for few minutes,&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I purchased this from this page and have used it for a month and a half along with a body scrub brush I purchased on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> It does NOT come with a pump as stated in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Honey heals, almond and castor oil help with removing any black spots, scars and moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it when I had a minor skin infection in a place that was hard to bandage all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no a clean freak, but just cautious and take less chances now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> My husband has trouble with staph infections.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use hibiclens because it will destroy any pathogen in its way.</li>
            <li> So a few weeks ago I used my boyfriend&#x27;s razor to shave my underarms because I had forgot mine at home.</li>
            <li> It was quite embarassing and smelled bad even right out of the shower after washing with Dial.  </li>
            <li> Also when I feel a rash or infection or have a small cut I wash with this.</li>
            <li> since i was a small child, i&#x27;ve been around hibiclens.</li>
            <li> so sloppy use of weak antimicrobials may actually increase your risk.  </li>
            <li> I can also tell you that if you are fat like me and have oily dirty places on your body you not only need to shower or bathe twice a day</li>
            <li> The protocol for using Hibiclens is online and you can research it by typing in &amp;#34;Hibiclens for negative strep B test&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> Normally it is difficult to buy this as it is expensive; however, it is almost half the usual price  when bought at Amazon!</li>
            <li> After a hot day in Alabama it was awful.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work, thus I don&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This soap is very thin for a liquid soap, almost like water.</li>
            <li> My determatologist explained that it is those germs and bacteria that causes the unpleasant odor that deodorant was used to mask.  </li>
            <li> My skin would start peeling in a matter of days and flake (to the point where I could wipe my face with my hands and it would be like snowing :( )</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter had an outbreak on her bottom that looked like acne.  I read online that it could be from the same family as a staff infection.  She does go to daycare so I am assuming she caught something sitting on the toilet seats there.  I used this on her bottom for two weeks after I bathed her, and the acne bumps have all disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with these bumps that are like boils that fill with blood and puss between my legs. I have had a variety of visits through the 18 years I have dealt with these and no doctor can give ma straight answer or a solution that really gets rid of them. In fact I have spent hundreds of dollars in this time using prescription pills, antibiotics, cremes, oils, treatments - such as heating the area and trying to pop the bumps days later if you can get a head to form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this soap was brought to my attention by a pharmacist at Walgreen&#x27;s who said it may help to try it out. I purchased this from this page and have used it for a month and a half along with a body scrub brush I purchased on Amazon as well. I know if you type \\&quot;natural brush\\&quot; you will find it on here. It has a short handle and rounded brush end that makes a \\&quot;loop\\&quot; shape. The brush itself is cheap junk but works OK for about 2 months and starts to degrade thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that this soap keeps the infections at bay and the bumps conditions stabilize. But I still have to use antibiotic gel on my crotch and lower areas. But in managing this condition the soap has offered some help. I can also tell you that if you are fat like me and have oily dirty places on your body you not only need to shower or bathe twice a day (that&#x27;s the rule) you should invest in the brush and this soap along with antibiotic gel to keep yourself healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap can dry your skin out as well so if you use it to clean your butt if you have hemorrhoids be sure you putting creme on your \\&quot;area\\&quot; after your out of the bath. I highly recommend Calmospetine creme that I found at Wal_Mart in the pharmacy (but it over the counter cream). The cream will cool, stop itching and help heal your condition in about a week!</li>
            <li> this is a great product to have in the house in case of breaks in the skin from gardening or housework  it is very effective at killling germs and promoting healing</li>
            <li> I bought this per my doula&#x27;s recommendation to wash myself in order to pass my strep b test since I am pregnant.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work, thus I don&#x27;t recommend it.  I was very hopeful and I used it as directed per my doula and other internet websites. I am strep b positive and will have to get penicillin while on labor.  Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> great product. So glad it is available to the public. Great for  cleaning exposed arms hands and wrists  after shift work for piece of mind.</li>
            <li> I use Hibiclens for acne and other skin issues, like boils. I like this product and it works well. It does NOT come with a pump as stated in previous reviews. You really need a pump, as this doesn&#x27;t lather on it&#x27;s own. Either buy a pump to go with it, or just buy a cheap foaming hand soap, empty it, and use that bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product at all!  No pump which I didn&#x27;t think matters but it does because you don&#x27;t want to contaminate this soap.  Also, there is not an ounce of bubbles or lather.  You must use soo much to feel clean.  I used this after having a mommy make over.  Dial antibiotic liquid soap is a much better option.</li>
            <li> Very good antiseptic, more so for healing wounds. We even use it for treating exzema.</li>
            <li> When I traveled out of the country where many things were possibly contaminated, I felt comfortable in knowing that with a pump of this cleanser almost any virus or bacteria that touched my hands were going to be eliminated after washing. I am not fond of germs, but then again who is.</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face now. I used to get break outs all the time, and facial cleansers would just dry it out. My skin would start peeling in a matter of days and flake (to the point where I could wipe my face with my hands and it would be like snowing :( ) beneath all the peeling skin, I would have a lot of break outs. So it was a very difficult skin type to figure out what I needed because I have oily skin that breaks out a lot, but dries out and starts peeling, so I normally had to choose between the two extremes, and makeup would draw more attention to my peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually found out that rubbing this on my face with my fingertips and following it up with warm water worked better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and any facial. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it kept fighting the bacteria that caused my face to break out so I could wear makeup and go about my day with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference was seriously over night. Even makeup goes on my face very smoothly and cleanly, so I have a flawless complexion. Basically it lets the oils go back in to my skin so it doesn&#x27;t peel, but it keeps my oily skin from getting infected, resulting in very soft and gentle complexion. Miracle product.</li>
            <li> cured child&#x27;s stinky feet and also other weird odours as she enters adolescence and is not always as meticulous about hygiene as she should be..&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, but make sure you read the directions.  You need to keep this away from eyes.  This is a serious skin cleaner, the type that is often given to patients for pre-op preperation. The &amp;#34;anti-bacterial&amp;#34; ingredients in most soaps wash away.  This product&#x27;s active ingredients keep working after you have rinsed.  Some folks swear on its usefulness for Acne or persistant odor problems.  I used it when I had a minor skin infection in a place that was hard to bandage all day.  It works, but again, read the directions.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for bacne which I developed after thyroidectomy- hormonal I guess. I&#x27;m 65 and I apply on back brush then use salicyclic astringent. Reduces size of zits to almost zero. Wish they had 4amd 8 oz. containers with pump for travel</li>
            <li> This soap is very thin for a liquid soap, almost like water. I guess it works ok but I don&#x27;t have any way to really tell.</li>
            <li> Why do I use Hibiclens?  I am an obese female and my doctor was the one who recommended using Hibiclens as a way to keep the areas of my body which have \\&quot;folds\\&quot; clean.  I use a clean wash cloth each day and the Hibiclens.  This has prevented me from having sores and smelly body odor that is offensive to myself and others.  I have recommended this item to my sister who also uses it and she is thrilled!  The cheapest way to purchase this item is by buying it in the 16 oz. bottle and just refill a small bottle as necessary.  This makes it easier for travel as well.  I was absolutely excited to find that Amazon.com carries this item.  Regular store prices are double the price Amazon gives me, even with shipping/handling.  I highly recommend this item to anyone!</li>
            <li> I first used this when I was at the emergency room.  I really liked it, so I decided to buy some for my home.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase, just wish there was a pump included for easier use of the product.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> We bought this because my son and husband came down with staph infections, and it was very helpful clearing those up.  I am in love with this stuff for a different reason.  I had developed an odor in my-um- private area.  It was quite embarassing and smelled bad even right out of the shower after washing with Dial.  After a hot day in Alabama it was awful.  I tried Hibiclens and the problem is GONE.  I don&#x27;t care how much this stuff costs, I will never run out.  This is a pretty harsh cleanser though, I have eczema on my legs mostly in the winter, and I cannot use this on my legs.  It makes them dry and itch like wildfire...</li>
            <li> Skin cleared and remains cleared.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I read that surgons use this clenser to senitize before operations.  Better that anything you can buy at the supermaket.  Nice foaminfg action when used with the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> Great..quick delivery</li>
            <li> My husband has trouble with staph infections. As long as he bathes with this to knock down the bacteria load on his skin he doesn&#x27;t experience boils &amp; irritations.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as I have 2 cats and have noticed issues with healing from their scratches. As I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and wanted to break from my normal use of alcohol due to it&#x27;s harshness, Hibiclens was chosen because of it&#x27;s dependable, mild antiseptic reputation. It works wonderfully for speedy healing and gives peace of mind with any possible infections and allergic reactions. I received the shipment within a couple of days and was very pleased with both the product and the speedy delivery. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is a great antimicrobial, antiseptic skin cleanser.  I like the see through bottle.  Great cleanser.  Leaves your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have very sensitive skin and certain vitamins I take make me break-out so my doctor suggested I try Hibiclens as an astringent, I am impressed at my results. at the first sign of a break out I put Hibiclens on and within a day or two its cleared up :)</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff that surgeons and nurses use in hospitals.  I ordered this to kill germs on my hands. Also when I feel a rash or infection or have a small cut I wash with this. I am more cautious about catching germs now when in public places or restrooms, handling shopping carts etc. I wash my hands often during the day.  I once caught MRSA when waiting in an outpatient family room. I don&#x27;t want hepatitis from eating out either. If you don&#x27;t know what MRSA is goggle it. Believe me you do not want it or any other disease.  I&#x27;m no a clean freak, but just cautious and take less chances now.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to note that this product comes with a pump.  I wish I had known this, since I ordered a pump at the same time I ordered Hibiclens.  Oh well.    I can only state that the product \\&quot;seems\\&quot; good, since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time (upon suggestion from a dermatologist).</li>
            <li> This has been a life saving product.  My 3 year old had reoccuring staph infections, after weekly use of this product she has now been infection free for 1 year.  Just make sure you get the foaming pump with this product, this will make the application much easier with zero product loss.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He is 20. His face looks pretty radiant now that he is using the product. I could not help but notice.</li>
            <li> I had a very severe case of infected eczema.  I used this soap twice daily to help control the infection.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent for wounds cleaning and Surgery</li>
            <li> Great product !!  If you have skin problems due to microbials, buy this.  It is very gentle, I even use it to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for boils over decade ago and I was delighted to see it on Amazon today  I use it as other reviewers have noted for folds and other irritations....  works great!  really like the foam pump as well!</li>
            <li> THis is great stuff to clean your skin.</li>
            <li> my father is a doctor. since i was a small child, i&#x27;ve been around hibiclens. i used to wash my hands on purpose when i visited him at the hospital.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i use hibiclens because it will destroy any pathogen in its way. when they claim a broad range of efficacy, they understate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;it smells absolutely terrific, is aggressive enough to prepare a surgeons hands for work, and gentle enough to use every day. if you&#x27;re using antibacterial soaps that rely on super-icky furans like triclosan or triclocarban, then it&#x27;s time to give those the boot. for an extra couple of bucks, here is a cleanser with a proven history, myriad uses outside the medical field, which can be obtained without prescription. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re interested in a skin scrub to eradicate ANY nasties, this is the one, ne plus ultra</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY HUSBAND BECAUSE THE DOCTOR HAD ADVISED HIM TO USE IT. I RECIEVED IT ON TIME AND IT WORKED FOR HIM.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me to aid in clearing up skin issues.  The product arrived in a timely manner and performed as expected.  It has no discernible smell and rinses off cleanly.  I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Great product as always</li>
            <li> Got this prior to surgery and was asked to use it the day before the operation.  Did this and actually used it after the fact on the healing wound. I&#x27;ve also used it on minor scrapes and cuts.  Does a great job cleansing the area and it seems the healing occurs much faster.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My boyfriend washes it instead of using antiperspirant and he never has odor. I didn&#x27;t even know he never wears antiperspirant until we had dated for almost a year! Well I never thought to use the stuff on myself, but I had read on the bottle about what it does. So a few weeks ago I used my boyfriend&#x27;s razor to shave my underarms because I had forgot mine at home. I don&#x27;t know why, but for almost a week following my underarms were so irritated and itched. Everything I put on them failed at making them feel better. I washed with Hibiclens ONCE and the irritation and itching was completely gone.</li>
            <li> just what the Doctor ordered!</li>
            <li> Leg ulcers which would not heal until started washing them in Hibclens.  I am obese and also use to clean between the folds of skin which has also prevented infections.  Normally it is difficult to buy this as it is expensive; however, it is almost half the usual price  when bought at Amazon!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic at keeping acne away. Simple to use, and works great. Recommended to me by a doctor.</li>
            <li> This a very good cleanser for people with delicate skin or if you&#x27;re allergic to betadine it&#x27;s an alternative antiseptic.</li>
            <li> Hibiclens was introduced to our family as hospital-provided wash for MRSA infection requiring surgery and then found to be known to many of our contacts as a superior anti-bacterial product.  Less effective products only wipe out the weaker strains of germs... it&#x27;s survival of the fittest... so sloppy use of weak antimicrobials may actually increase your risk.  Amazon price is easily 50% of other retail- allowing the use of the best product available at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I so appreciate its antibacterial properties. I&#x27;d love to give it 2 more stars, the fact that it has stained all of my lovely washcloths (would&#x27;ve purchased cheap pk had I known) and doesn&#x27;t lather much prevents</li>
            <li> Many years ago, my determatologist suggested that I use Hibiclens as a substitute for deodorant to combat the rash that developed every time I used the latter.  Hibiclens is used by physicians and nurses to clean away germs and bacteria on their hands.  My determatologist explained that it is those germs and bacteria that causes the unpleasant odor that deodorant was used to mask.  Hibiclens cleans them away, hence no odor.  Buying it from Amazon is quick, convenient and in this size with the pump it is relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I used this product (heavily diluted) to wash 2 times daily 4 days before I was to be tested for Strep B with our third child.  I made sure to then rinse with water very well and pat dry.  I tested negative and was very happy to not have to get the meds before giving birth.  The protocol for using Hibiclens is online and you can research it by typing in &amp;#34;Hibiclens for negative strep B test&amp;#34;.  Best wishes!</li>
            <li> I bathe using this in areas that I sweat a lot on my body and this will keep you feeling fresh.  Highly recommend this product. Also used on acne on face and it seemed to help.</li>
            <li> I bought this for boils I was self treating. I had to go to the doctor for one pesky boil and she prescribed this in addition to antibiotics. I told her I already had it. She asked where I got it and I told her Amazon sells everything :) Saved money over the prescription version.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my doctor after he found MRSA in my nasal passages. It is what surgeons use to \\&quot;scrub up\\&quot;. However you will have to find the pump that fits the bottle and buy it (with extra for shipping of the pump http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V89QME/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s00_i00 ) from another seller. The cleanser is great. I use it in the shower and next to the sink. Just wish I hadn&#x27;t had to go looking for the pump elsewhere! But a must have if you have cancer or other immune problems. I&#x27;m told it kills stuff that grocery store antibacterial hand soaps don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Wide-mouth bottle needs a better dispenser. Perhaps this intended for refiling a pump-bottle. Doesn&#x27;t foam without a lot of effort</li>
            <li> Great product , a little goes a long way . will order again !</li>
            <li> This soap is great. I had a boil that was diagnosed as an abscess. I used this soap before and after it was drained and my incision got closed up in four days, the doc had to pack it once( amazing for such a deep wound). I still use it for showers once a week to prevent futur abscess for occurring.</li>
            <li> I have used hibiclens for several years.  It is effective but gental.  I love the foaming mode, and the dispensing 16oz size is just right for home or travel.  You have supplied a great product!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap. I use this on my mother due to skin breakdown.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t lather with a towel.</li>
            <li> Fights germs and bacteria for up to six hours. Cleanse with this, apply MEDI-HONEY, and cover with Red Cross Pads.</li>
            <li> A must have! I&#x27;m a little ocd about clean hands and this stuff does the trick!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and arrived immediately.</li>
            <li> How could it have taken so long for someone to design such a simple product that works effortlessly and flawlessly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product from this seller. They included the hand pump (some vendors are charging around $5 for that!) and it was free shipping and a good price. Hibiclens was recommended to me by my dermatologist to use instead of antibiotic creams whenever there is a cut or an infection. This is an excellent product! Whenever I&#x27;ve had a cut near a nail and it started to get infected, I put Hibiclens on it and the problem is resolved within a day!</li>
            <li> After falling off my mountain bike time after time, I had to learn to deal with all the injuries and Neosporin was the first product I used and learned quickly that Neosporin cannot be applied to wounds at all since after the body produces scab which is the natural healing process of the body tenting and covering the wound, applying Neosporin softened the scab, removed the scab, delayed the healing process of the wound which caused some scaring on my body. That was the last tube of Neosporin I ever used. Now, the only way that I treat any wound regardless of the size is;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) washing it with Dr. Bronner organic baby wash and water,&lt;br /&gt;2) allowing it to dry for few minutes,&lt;br /&gt;3) apply Hibiclens only if needed since it is 70% isopropyl alcohol,&lt;br /&gt;4) apply Manuka honey or any quality raw honey full of pollens and enzymes,&lt;br /&gt;5) apply almond and castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bleach is a powerful disinfectant, but you don&#x27;t pour the stuff on a cut and yet many of us reach for a bleach called hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, not realizing that while it&#x27;s murder on germs, our skin also suffers. It reduces the number of fibroblasts, a type of cell that&#x27;s crucial for cleaning and repairing damaged tissue. These are all effective products and do the trick since help the scab to do its job. Honey heals, almond and castor oil help with removing any black spots, scars and moisturize my skin. Hibicleans is great for cleaning my hands (not frequently) only when needed on my hiking trips or where I have no access to water. Using any type of alcohol on skin, kills the good germs as well as the bad germs so it is very confusing to me to see alcohol rubs all over many institutions when just washings hand with soap and water can accomplish the same. Of course it is a different story for real heavy or disable individuals, with limited movements and for them Hibiclens may be a necessity since it is cut down 30% with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> The best soap for my wrestling son&#x27;s to keep the skin germs at a LOW!&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle enough that it does not dry their skin and good for the face.</li>
            <li> I use hibiclens to shave with and I NEVER get any ravor burn afterwards with this product.  It kills all the bacteria on your skin after shaving before it has time to set it and irritate your skin and cause the razor burn.  It&#x27;s FANTASTIC, love it!!</li>
