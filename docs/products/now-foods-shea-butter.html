            <li> However, my last two containers have been gritty and take a while to soften enough to be rubbed in leaving me with little balls Shea butter all over the floor.  </li>
            <li> due to allergies , this is the only thing i use on my face and neck .  </li>
            <li> I will order one more time to see if maybe I just got a bad batch</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to melt the plastic jar in the microwave!</li>
            <li> The smallest amount weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> Every so often it can be a little grainy.</li>
            <li> I bought another brand trying to save a few $$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it on my hair, but it is too thick for my afro textured hair.</li>

            <li> Great product for use in homemade lotion (which I mixed with other Now Foods products: lanolin, coconut oil, Vit E cream &amp; Veg glyerine)</li>
            <li> This stuff was gritty and white. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the only body &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; I use. It&#x27;s scent free, non-greasy and natural. Every so often it can be a little grainy.

            <li> I always know I&#x27;ll be getting the best in quality with this item. Always a consistent texture and the quality is always excellent. I use this to make products for my business and it&#x27;s an ingredient I know I can always trust.</li>
            <li> Loved the pack of 2 and putting it to good use.  The price was right and would purchase again when needed :)</li>
            <li> feels like sand is in it.</li>

            <li> Loved it great product I will order some more when I&#x27;m ready</li>
            <li> Great product. Used it n my lotion bars... perfectly creamy.</li>
            <li> Loved the product, the price value, and the quick shipping!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shea butter. No smell, very smooth. Melts at body temp. I bought another brand trying to save a few $$. I&#x27;ll but this next time, much much nicer.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Love this shea butter and have used it many times for my own version of body butter.  The savings was great as I used to buy it at a store one at a time.  Will definitely buy from here again.</li>
            <li> Normally I absolutely love this product.  Normally it is very creamy and easy to use.  However, my last two containers have been gritty and take a while to soften enough to be rubbed in leaving me with little balls Shea butter all over the floor.  I will order one more time to see if maybe I just got a bad batch but after that I will consider another product.&lt;br /&gt;Having said all of that, before my last order, I would have given this product five stars.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar. This was recommended to me by a friend. I have been using it for 1 year. In the winter, I put it on my feet, hands and lips before bedtime. Since I have very oily, acne prone skin, i don&#x27;t put it on my face. I&#x27;ve tried using it on my hair, but it is too thick for my afro textured hair. The smallest amount weighs my hair down. But otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this Shea butter .... Whips up nicely!!!</li>
