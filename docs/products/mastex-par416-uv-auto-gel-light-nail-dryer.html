            <li>Be sure you do your research, there is a detailed instructional pdf on CND&#x27;s website.</li>

            <li>Light Nail Dryer]]&lt;br /&gt;ordered</li>
            <li>look great 3 days later.</li>
            <li>I can only speak for shellac gel-polish system, but I got great results with this lamp.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to put it together and arrived so fast.</li>
            <li>Other nail techs have commented on how much better this is then their own and purchased this one!</li>
            <li>The lights are certainly bright enough too!</li>
            <li>so I used it that same day and works rEally good.</li>
            <li>There are 4 posts at the end of each bulb that fit into matching holes in the sockets and they just pop right in.  </li>
            <li>This arrived in no time and is very user friendly!  </li>
            <li>The light gets to hot, even on the lowest minute setting.</li>
            <li>look on my nails, because the heat or UV index is too hot!</li>
            <li>I often find the top clear gel coat gives a &amp;#34;mealted&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The bra even fits, and that is rare for me.</li>
            <li>This product works great for curing the Shellac Nail Gel system and is large enough to fit both hands at the same time!</li>
            <li>Its light weight,can fit both hands or feet in at the same time.</li>
            <li>Well packed and arrived very fast after placing the order.</li>
            <li>I was really interested in getting a shellac manicure, but after doing some research I found they can cost up to $50.</li>
            <li>Apply the final coat of Shellac Top Coat and cure for 2 mins.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of times and feel it does a pretty okay job.  </li>
            <li>, I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret this purchase!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything on the internet to give me the exact time for each step</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d highly recommend this UV light to anyone, particularly to professionals.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very spacious enough to fit both hands and feet when I got</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to open the light (because you can&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>So I decided to buy my own setup that would pay for itself after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>This light looks sharp and the operation doesn&#x27;t get any more simple than this!  </li>
            <li>It is a great size, not too big not too small.</li>
            <li>I purchase this UV Gel light to dry the shellac nail polish.  </li>
            <li>This may seem a little funny, but I like the little handle at the top, so it it easy to pick up and move around.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put bulbs in, has different timers on it,a long cord..Works very well...</li>
            <li>I find that I have to take extra time (more than the recommended 2 minutes) to dry the polish.  </li>
            <li>One reviewer said she needed instructions which really left me scratching my head because in my opinion there&#x27;s really nothing to it!  </li>
            <li>Shellac Gel can only be removed with 100% Pure</li>
            <li>So to try to clear up the one thing the seller does not list about this item...</li>
            <li>Try using the softer lights they use professionally.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel</li>
            <li>This one has been used to do shellac and there is absolutely nothing different between them besides the cost!</li>
            <li>The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it would be nice if it turned itself off after the timer ends.</li>
            <li>So I was actually quite pleasantly surprised at the size of this thing!  </li>
            <li>Someone with large hands may have trouble with the installation, but,  it&#x27;s REALLY just THAT SIMPLE!!!  </li>
            <li>It is large enough to dry both hands at once.  </li>
            <li>I did feel like after keeping my hands in the dryer for about 10 minutes that I started to get a little pink from the light bulbs.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, it is very roomy, enough room for both hands or both feet!  </li>

            <li> The light gets to hot, even on the lowest minute setting.

            <li> [[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]]&lt;br /&gt;ordered product in June 2011 and stopped working in Feb 2012. Thought it would last longer than 8 months</li>
            <li> I was really interested in getting a shellac manicure, but after doing some research I found they can cost up to $50. So I decided to buy my own setup that would pay for itself after just a few uses. This lamp worked perfectly. Be sure you do your research, there is a detailed instructional pdf on CND&#x27;s website. I just followed the instructions and my nails look great 3 days later. I can only speak for shellac gel-polish system, but I got great results with this lamp.</li>
            <li> This arrived in no time and is very user friendly!  Simply install the lights that come packaged separately and plug it in!  Voila!  This product works great for curing the Shellac Nail Gel system and is large enough to fit both hands at the same time! Prepare the nail bed.  Apply a thin coat of the Shellac Base Coat and cure for 2 mins.  Apply two thin coats of Shellac color and cure each coat for 1 or two mins.  Apply the final coat of Shellac Top Coat and cure for 2 mins.  The top coat leaves a sticky residue that needs to be rubbed off with a cotton ball soaked with 91% Alcohol.

            <li> I play tennis in it, and it is the most comfortable tennis wear I have.  The bra even fits, and that is rare for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Shellac at different salons here in town and they charge around $30 per time. To buy this UV Gel Light and some Shellac and do it at home will save me alot of money!    Great machine, easy to put the light in. Well packed and arrived very fast after placing the order.</li>
            <li> I purchase this UV Gel light to dry the shellac nail polish.  It arrived very fast and works great.  It is large enough to dry both hands at once.  This may seem a little funny, but I like the little handle at the top, so it it easy to pick up and move around.  Very Nice product &amp; price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my sister&#x27;s birthday and had it sent to her. It came on time. Hurray! Then a couple weeks later I went to visit her and we did our nails and then used this handy dryer! It works great. I like that there are 3 settings on it. The lights are certainly bright enough too! I did feel like after keeping my hands in the dryer for about 10 minutes that I started to get a little pink from the light bulbs. My hands were a little tender for about 20 minutes afterward. But seriously, that&#x27;s not a deal breaker! Go and get yourself one!</li>
            <li> I have a beauty license and have access to getting these at wholesale price at the supply house and this is by far the best quality and price I have found.  the size is great for both hands together or feet.  the bulb strength is great and have had great success since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It works great, turned on and tested it. Took forever to get here but we are military stationed overseas in Japan and has an FPO address. Only issues are no instructions on how to install the lights and to use the machine. I&#x27;m not a professional its only for home use. Otherwise great product. Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased one until now. Its light weight,can fit both hands or feet in at the same time. Easy to put bulbs in, has different timers on it,a long cord..Works very well...Just a great light nail dryer</li>
            <li> This gel dryer works great. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it would be nice if it turned itself off after the timer ends. Otherwise this dryer has been used for the past 6 months no problems what so ever. Don&#x27;t listen to all the hype about needing an OPI shellac nail dryer. This one has been used to do shellac and there is absolutely nothing different between them besides the cost! I use it to do shellac all the time and have had no problems. Other nail techs have commented on how much better this is then their own and purchased this one!</li>
            <li> I use this dryer for the CND gel manicure.  I have only used it a couple of times and feel it does a pretty okay job.  I find that I have to take extra time (more than the recommended 2 minutes) to dry the polish.  I think if I had to do again I would put out the money for the CND dryer.</li>
            <li> So I was actually quite pleasantly surprised at the size of this thing!  It&#x27;s HUGE compared to most UV nail dryers that I&#x27;ve seen at any salon!  So to try to clear up the one thing the seller does not list about this item...the wattage:  it says it&#x27;s 45 watts but each bulb is actually 18 watts and there are 3 bulbs.  It would be nice for the price if a padded hand rest were included but it&#x27;s not something that I just HAVE to have.  The shipping though seemed really slow.  In reality it took 8 days to get here but I ordered the OPI Gel starter kit the same day and it only took 3 days to arrive and I&#x27;ve been dying to use it but had to wait on this order, so it just SEEMED like it took forever and a day to get here.  Other than my very minor complaint (and I hesitate to use that word but can&#x27;t come up with anything better at the moment!), I&#x27;d highly recommend this UV light to anyone, particularly to professionals.  As other reviewers have said, it is very roomy, enough room for both hands or both feet!  Oh, I should mention bulb installation.  One reviewer said she needed instructions which really left me scratching my head because in my opinion there&#x27;s really nothing to it!  There are 4 posts at the end of each bulb that fit into matching holes in the sockets and they just pop right in.  You don&#x27;t have to open the light (because you can&#x27;t).  Someone with large hands may have trouble with the installation, but,  it&#x27;s REALLY just THAT SIMPLE!!!  This light looks sharp and the operation doesn&#x27;t get any more simple than this!  There is only one button on it.  You push it once you get 2 minutes, push it a second time, you get 3 minutes and a third press of the button gives you \\&quot;continuous.\\&quot;  you simply press it a fourth time to turn it off.  It has an LED indicator over each setting so you know or remember what you&#x27;ve chosen.  So, if you&#x27;re thinking about buying this but just aren&#x27;t sure, I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I use this for my DIY manicures with CND shellacs and it works perfectly.      I would definitely recommend this to friends (in fact, I already have).</li>
            <li> This light is perfect to do gel manicures.... I use it for the shellac... Exactly what I needed. It was very easy to put it together and arrived so fast.</li>
            <li> very good A++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> dont work at all dont like it the come out the same day dont last not even a day .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very spacious enough to fit both hands and feet when I got I was very happy so I used it that same day and works rEally good. My guests also loved that it reduced time because you can put both hands inside. Don&#x27;t know what else to say but that i do recommend you do buy it.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I like to save money where I can and I have had it for at least two years. I am totally satisfied. It&#x27;s well priced too in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder if I have the correct timing for my polish though (OPI) as mine usually peel after only two or three days. I have never made it over 5 days. I couldn&#x27;t find anything on the internet to give me the exact time for each step so I&#x27;m guessing. Most people tell me theirs stay on until they take it off! I wish!</li>
