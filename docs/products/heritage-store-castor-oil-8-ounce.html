            <li>and I love how it helps hold moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li>After using this product semi regularly (most nights) on my eyelashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s a difference for sure even when I haven&#x27;t applied the night</li>
            <li>It seems the more</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad to find a company that</li>
            <li>Personally, I use for shaving and I find&lt;br /&gt;it to be excellent shaving resource.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also found (since I now can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my super soft hair) that its wonderful on my nails and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting this stuff in my hair and on my body overnight and feel sooooo beautiful and soft after a shower.</li>
            <li>I recived this item quickly and it was packaged safely.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a spot treatment for acne.  </li>
            <li>It really stretches my curls nicely and leaves my hair nice and soft.  </li>

            <li>I had bunion surgery and had to wear a special shoe.</li>

            <li>It is true castor oil work well in every category.  </li>
            <li>A good moisturizer not only for skin but also for hair.</li>
            <li>this is the only one I will buy because of the good quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product &#x3D;).</li>
            <li>Some castor oils don&#x27;t seem fit for consumption, and I wonder just how pure they are.</li>
            <li>Nice big jar too!</li>
            <li>or so I put the therabead pad back into the microwave for 40 seconds to keep my knee warm.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and works well with all its benefits</li>
            <li>I use castor oil for many natural home made beauty products.</li>
            <li>worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin silky smooth (face and body) and in time and is help my acne scares, has made black heads vanish with in days and help&#x27;s great with a good deep facial cleansing.</li>
            <li>This particular brand works really good, especially for the price I received from Medicine &amp; Supplements.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m going to order a larger size because this is a great treatment for pain</li>
            <li>I mix it with different oils and wash my face in it everyday - it gives me a feeling of perfect smoothness.</li>
            <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS CASTOR OIL!!</li>
            <li>Ice is the first treatment during the first 2-3 days of an injury.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used castor oil</li>
            <li>She was my first baby</li>
            <li>For the first week</li>
            <li>I use the more I have left.  </li>
            <li>Everyone wants to know my secret to my beautiful shiny &amp; fast growing hair...</li>
            <li>I really dont like it at all .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very inexpensive treatment for pain.</li>
            <li>How much can a person say about castor oil?</li>
            <li>I recovered much slower and had to wear sometype of orthotic shoe for 3 months.</li>
            <li>I use it on my lashes which has really made them longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as fast as I&#x27;d like it to, however.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews on amazon for this product were for external use only, but if you are overdue with a baby, I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be good for your hair, and some say if you apply it to a place of missing eyebrows, it will grow back!  </li>
            <li>This castor oil treatment works as well or better than several physical therapy sessions.</li>
            <li>This seems to work well on older injuries.</li>
            <li>Within a few days I was able to put weight on the foot that was operated on.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smear it all over my face or use it to remove make-up because it seems to leave a residue, and to cause new break-outs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that this brand is any better than any other brand as this is the only one that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The Heritage Store brand is  cold pressed and hexane free, so its safe and reliable.</li>
            <li>BUT THIS BRAND WAS BY FAR</li>
            <li>15- 20 min before bedtime and early morning I also use it for my feet swollen  </li>
            <li>I think it is a natural anti inflammatory</li>
            <li>Natural Health Users for pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was young</li>
            <li>The bruising and swelling went down tremendously.</li>
            <li>Also be careful not to make it too hot in the microwave.</li>
            <li>IT MADE MY DRY HAIR VERY SOFT AND SHINY!!</li>
            <li>I mix this with other oil products to create hot oil treatments, also just use it alone on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I thought it just gave the APPEARANCE of looking longer and thicker but checking out old photos compared to recent ones</li>
            <li>The oil is very sticky, not worth the buy and my time.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The oil is very sticky, not worth the buy and my time.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick like the raw form without the heavy nutty smell.</li>
            <li> definite reduction in blemishes, redness, blackheads, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> and i have a family history of long labors, so</li>
            <li> and it lasts long to</li>
            <li> this is a must have in my everyday hair regimen, , if you are a natural i would reccomend inncorporatting this in your hair journey .</li>
            <li> If I can catch it at the earliest stage I can often prevent the deep ones from even forming -- they just go back down.  </li>
            <li> I had bunion surgery on my other foot 4 years ago and only used arnica and Traumeel on my skin.</li>
            <li> Use before you dry the skin.</li>
            <li> it works well on my dry hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next morning, when walking down the stairs, I still had some sharp but short pains in my knee.</li>
            <li> Its been about a month, and i do see little baby hairs coming back in.</li>
            <li> little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> I TRIED OTHER BRANDS OF CASTOR OIL</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first after my sister recommended it to me for that, and even after I saw it working</li>
            <li> The dark marks go away over time too.  </li>
            <li> its too Heavy .</li>
            <li> Under make-up I dab it on, wait a few minutes, then blot it before applying cover-up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful to wait at least 48 hours after an injury before using heat.</li>
            <li> I started using the oil cleansing method a few weeks ago-</li>
            <li> My foot was very swollen and painful.</li>
            <li> (in small quantities)to help lubricate the colon, hence keeping one \\&quot;regular\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I recently developed painful tendonitis in my knee (which was also injured in the past).</li>
            <li> As a side note, I rub the excess on my nails and they&#x27;re hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> I got rid of at least 90% of the pain.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little weird to get used to, and it thick.</li>
            <li> It has a very thick texture to it which I like.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t taste nearly as bad as I had expected.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to it, it burns my eyes and my face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product using for my clients.  Well Done!</li>
            <li> I bought this castor oil to use in making my own shaving oil.  I purchased this brand because of the excellent price and reviews.  Whenever I replenish my supply of castor oil, I will order from the same company!  I also found that the castor oil is great for your skin--something I had never known before.  It also works great in my shaving oil!</li>
            <li> I bought it after I saw the review butt I really dont like it at all . its too Heavy .</li>
            <li> I read about how great this product is for various things and I am loving it!  It softens your skin and helps sore rashes to go away. It&#x27;s supposed to be good for your hair, and some say if you apply it to a place of missing eyebrows, it will grow back!  I think this is a product that we need to learn more about so we can use it liberally! Nice big jar too!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin silky smooth (face and body) and in time and is help my acne scares, has made black heads vanish with in days and help&#x27;s great with a good deep facial cleansing. Also help with stretch marks. I highly recommend this product &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to it, it burns my eyes and my face. The oil is very sticky, not worth the buy and my time. it&#x27;s garbage.</li>
            <li> I guess what ever the purpose of your use of this product it sorta works. The size of the bottle is a good size. The smell is a little weird to get used to, and it thick. Doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin without it leaving it oily and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily as a spot treatment for acne.  If I can catch it at the earliest stage I can often prevent the deep ones from even forming -- they just go back down.  I have to apply this along with taking 3 ibuprofen tabs though.  For the rest, they heal faster and without scarring.  The dark marks go away over time too.  Just apply several times a day when at home.  Under make-up I dab it on, wait a few minutes, then blot it before applying cover-up. (I use powdered mineral makeup.)  I don&#x27;t smear it all over my face or use it to remove make-up because it seems to leave a residue, and to cause new break-outs.  As a side note, I rub the excess on my nails and they&#x27;re hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Tried using this on my eyelashes for about two weeks but didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Instead I just keep going to bed and waking up with sticky oily eyes. However, the quality seems great. Maybe I just need to try a different use for it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!I HAVE NATURAL HAIR AND HEARD ABOUT ALL THE WONDERFUL BENEFITS FROM USING CASTOR OIL. I TRIED OTHER BRANDS OF CASTOR OIL AND THEY WERE JUST OK, BUT THIS BRAND WAS BY FAR THE BEST CASTOR OIL I&#x27;VE TRIED!! IT MADE MY DRY HAIR VERY SOFT AND SHINY!! LOVED IT..I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS CASTOR OIL!!</li>
            <li> I recently developed painful tendonitis in my knee (which was also injured in the past). I read that using CASTOR OIL covered with plastic and flannel and a heating pad can relieve joint pain in 1-2 hours. I ordered 8 ounces here at Amazon and it was delivered quickly in a few days which was fast. Since I read that castor oil can stain clothing I used several paper towels soaked with about 4-5 tablespoons of castor oil. Then I used an ace bandage to wrap the towels around my knee and hold them in place. Next I microwaved my Therabead (sold here: http://www.amazon.com/Duro-Med-Arthritis-Microwavable-Therabead-Standard/dp/B0009STNHY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1331950426&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left this on my knee for about 2 hours total. Every 20 minutes or so I put the therabead pad back into the microwave for 40 seconds to keep my knee warm. After the treatment with the heated castor oil my knee pain was about 75% gone. The next morning, when walking down the stairs, I still had some sharp but short pains in my knee. So I repeated the treatment and within 3 days I got rid of at least 90% of the pain. This castor oil treatment works as well or better than several physical therapy sessions. If you have pain anywhere it might help you as well. It&#x27;s a very inexpensive treatment for pain. Next time I&#x27;m going to order a larger size because this is a great treatment for pain relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful to wait at least 48 hours after an injury before using heat. Also be careful not to make it too hot in the microwave. This seems to work well on older injuries. Ice is the first treatment during the first 2-3 days of an injury.</li>
            <li> Worth the price and works well with all its benefits</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using castor oil for several months now and I love how it helps hold moisture in my hair. This particular brand works really good, especially for the price I received from Medicine &amp; Supplements. Very satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li> Quality product! I use castor oil for many natural home made beauty products. It works great as an oil cleanser for the face as it helps clean the skin and draw out impurities and leaves your skin soft and balanced and happy. I recived this item quickly and it was packaged safely. I will buy again and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I know. How much can a person say about castor oil? When having tried different brands, this is the one that stands above the rest. The quality and purity is great. Castor oil can be used topically of course but also ingested (in small quantities)to help lubricate the colon, hence keeping one \\&quot;regular\\&quot;. Some castor oils don&#x27;t seem fit for consumption, and I wonder just how pure they are. The Heritage Store brand is  cold pressed and hexane free, so its safe and reliable.</li>
            <li> I mix this with other oil products to create hot oil treatments, also just use it alone on my hair.  Castor oil is a very good product for hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this stuff in my hair and on my body overnight and feel sooooo beautiful and soft after a shower. Great stuff and great price too!</li>
            <li> Used this for inflammation uterus and helped a lot with warm compressions every 15- 20 min before bedtime and early morning I also use it for my feet swollen  it does the trick</li>
            <li> After using this product semi regularly (most nights) on my eyelashes and eyebrows I have noticed an increase in hair growth! Specifically my eyelashes that have become longer and thicker. I will continue using this product!</li>
            <li> Good product, I use this stuff daily on my hair &amp; eyebrows... Everyone wants to know my secret to my beautiful shiny &amp; fast growing hair...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months now as part of the oil cleansing method to remove my mineral make-up at night, and it does well (in a 1/2 and 1/2 mix with jojoba oil).  Doesn&#x27;t strip my skin but removes all my make-up cleanly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too good, but I love it! It moisturizes my skin and works well as a massage oil. It has a very thick texture to it which I like.</li>
            <li> worth the price.  I bought this for a couple of reasons - I read all of the health benefits (hair growth, regularity, skin care, etc).  It is true castor oil work well in every category.  Do your research on the benefits of castor oil.  I don&#x27;t know that this brand is any better than any other brand as this is the only one that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer not only for skin but also for hair. I mix it with different oils and wash my face in it everyday - it gives me a feeling of perfect smoothness.</li>
            <li> Just began using it for hair loss.</li>
            <li> We use this wonderful oil after we bathe my mother, just all over her body. Use before you dry the skin. We have been successfull in keeping any bedsores at bay and keeping her skin from cracking. I think it is a natural anti inflammatory and my nurse raves how great her skin is. I also tried it on my face and the moisterizing properties are amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick like the raw form without the heavy nutty smell. Works great as a moister sealer on hair.</li>
            <li> I had bunion surgery and had to wear a special shoe. My foot was very swollen and painful. For days I used Traumeel on my skin and bandaged my foot. I saw no results. I then started to soak cotton pads in castor oil and place them under my bandages. The results were immediate. The bruising and swelling went down tremendously. Within a few days I was able to put weight on the foot that was operated on.  I had bunion surgery on my other foot 4 years ago and only used arnica and Traumeel on my skin. I recovered much slower and had to wear sometype of orthotic shoe for 3 months. I wish I thought about using castor oil back then.</li>
            <li> Good for smooth the hair</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used castor oil so I do not have anything to compare to.  I will give it 5 stars based on the price.</li>
            <li> I used this product to induce my own labor and boy did it work. Most of the reviews on amazon for this product were for external use only, but if you are overdue with a baby, I highly recommend this stuff! I was 5 days overdue and drank 2oz castor oil, mixed with orange juice. It didn&#x27;t taste nearly as bad as I had expected. 2 hours after drinking the oil/juice mix, my labor started, 5 hours after that, my beautiful, healthy baby was born. She was my first baby and i have a family history of long labors, so since I have no comparison, I give all credit to the oil.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!!!!  I use it on my lashes which has really made them longer and thicker.  I was skeptical at first after my sister recommended it to me for that, and even after I saw it working I thought it just gave the APPEARANCE of looking longer and thicker but checking out old photos compared to recent ones, there&#x27;s a difference for sure even when I haven&#x27;t applied the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my non-relaxed African American hair.  It really stretches my curls nicely and leaves my hair nice and soft.  For the first week or so I used it after dampening my hair or after a wash.  Now that my hair is accustomed to it it works well on my dry hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found (since I now can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my super soft hair) that its wonderful on my nails and cuticles.  :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a LONG way.  It seems the more I use the more I have left.  LOL!  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this!  100% for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I heard that Castor oil is good for helping hair renewal. Its been about a month, and i do see little baby hairs coming back in. Doesn&#x27;t work as fast as I&#x27;d like it to, however.</li>
            <li> Natural Health Users for pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to find a company that&lt;br /&gt;supplies this item. Use it for pain on a cloth.&lt;br /&gt;It works!</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer for the skin. Especially good protectant for face and hands. Personally, I use for shaving and I find&lt;br /&gt;it to be excellent shaving resource. Minimizes/Eliminates irritation of facial skin.</li>
            <li> Castore oil has become part of my hair routine, really good stuff</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff and it lasts long to</li>
            <li> I use this oil and mix it with another to wash my face via the oil cleansing method. I love it and it works great</li>
            <li> love their products i use this to moisturize my hair and for hot packs, its not to greasy and doesnt smell,. I only wish I had gotten a bigger size, next time i will though</li>
            <li> Life saver!  I am in love with this oil! It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Bought this product to see if it would help to grow out my eye brows but it didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> Very good product this is the only one I will buy because of the good quality.</li>
            <li> I started using the oil cleansing method a few weeks ago- definite reduction in blemishes, redness, blackheads, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> When I was young I used this oil on my eyelashes and eyebrows to make them grow. I thought about using it now and found this one dense and pure for a very good price. Castor oil works well for constipation too.</li>
            <li> this is a must have in my everyday hair regimen, , if you are a natural i would reccomend inncorporatting this in your hair journey . great product</li>
