    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>mo23CZ51IMEYOQQ]]There are some wonderful reviews here that I can find no fault with so</li>
            <li>One of the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The head is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>for safety, this is especially nice for children, the elderly, those with heat sensitivity, or those with skin sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re  bright!  </li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>You are going to be so happy that you did.  </li>
            <li>(LOL)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li>I thought this sounded like a great idea.</li>
            <li>I can adjust the water before I get in the shower and be confident that it will be perfect when I step in.  </li>
            <li>So nice!  </li>
            <li>The color works well and is reasonably bright.  </li>
            <li>, we&#x27;ll be buying another one for the kids&#x27; bathroom, they loved it.</li>
            <li>I like a fairly vigorous spray.  </li>
            <li>This was very easy to install and works great.</li>
            <li>The flow is okay, nothing great, and is not adjustable at all.</li>
            <li>Having a light to indicate the temperature of the water is incredibly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hose is nice and flexible</li>
            <li>Now they don&#x27;t work and that keeps the safety feature from being effective.</li>
            <li>nice, I now get to shave in the shower with a light!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s nice to know when the water is finally warm.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Installation was very easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a visual indicator of when the water has reached the perfect temperature.</li>
            <li>Love the lights.</li>
            <li>This is best suited for children so that they can tell the temperature without having to actually touch the water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flow was lovely.  </li>
            <li>Be sure you have some teflon tape for installation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>to \\&quot;Color\\&quot; up some more dimension to the experience.</li>
            <li>but they can be used while in place or removed for greater flexibility for spraying off soap and suds from a number of angles.</li>
            <li>I love this shower head.  </li>
            <li>I see these popping up in stores more and more now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, this is a fun gadget that will be a good guideline for water temperature.</li>
            <li>However, nothing beats just sticking your hand under the faucet and making sure the water&#x27;s comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kids love</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can also see this as a fun touch for a guest bathroom (your guests will be pleasantly delighted when the color stream starts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would prefer a metal shower head because biofilms grow on plastic more than on metal.</li>
            <li>However, our mixer valve has seen better days and needs replacing soon, so I want to err on the side in favor of the shower</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>and I loved it right away.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to install and the LED light &#x27;no battery needed&#x27; as it runs off the kenetic energy generated by the running water.</li>
            <li>stream is consistent and narrows as it sprays farther, which is actually a good idea in that it doesn&#x27;t splash all over the place.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shower isn&#x27;t adjustable, so the soft stream is what you get, which is why it&#x27;s great for a kid&#x27;s or guest bathroom.</li>
            <li>for aesthetics, this is really cool when the bathrool is dimmed or at night!  </li>
            <li>They seem prone to easy breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was easy to install</li>
            <li>None-the-less, it was easy to install and no leaks</li>
            <li>and it is working fine.</li>
            <li>It is easy to install and even has a feature where the light changes color with the temperature of the water.  </li>
            <li>Our experience was that the water pressure and spray was fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing super fancy (no option to change the intensity of the stream), but I felt like it was more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dog seems to enjoy it too</li>
            <li>I do not know whether the LED light technology prevented HeathSmart from using an adjustable flow, but this would have been a desirable feature.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s not a lot of pressure for me, I would have liked a water saver type of stream as opposed to this gentle 4-inch stream</li>
            <li>We think the kids will really enjoy the lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice chrome-like finish with a modern look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you havekids I&#x27;m sure they will think this is fun.  </li>
            <li>All I know is that I enjoy it</li>
            <li>I must must admit I was intrigued by it...but wondered--an LED light in a shower-head?</li>
            <li>(Feel free to search mycobacteria in plastic shower heads if you don&#x27;t know about this.)</li>
            <li>The pros of this shower head are that it is easy to install and the lights seem accurate and fun.  </li>
            <li>Guess my first reaction, that I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would hold up, was correct.</li>
            <li>I originally rated this product with three stars and have lowered my rating to two stars.  </li>
            <li>My original review is below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>whether the LED illuminated lights in this shower head, showing water temperature, would be of any significant benefit.  </li>
            <li>It is a unique idea, albeit a pricey one.</li>
            <li>to be more consistent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, not too soft, and I think most people will like it.  </li>
            <li>The light does change colors but isn&#x27;t very consistent with the temp changes...</li>
            <li>The lights changing with the temperature is fun to watch although they may not be as accurate as some would wish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it overall.</li>
            <li>For the light effects, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>so it seemed like it would be a good idea to have a shower that visually indicated when the water was warming</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>Another reviewer had mentioned that the entire showerhead felt cheap; when I read that, I agreed that it felt light, but I wasn&#x27;t sure that also meant cheap.</li>
            <li>This one has a nice, tight spray of water, though, and that makes it really nice for quickly rinsing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, though, is those LEDs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The water pressure of the flow also seemed to be adequate.  </li>
            <li>I found the colors to be pretty accurate:  </li>
            <li>When it starts to get very hot, red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Even so, however, it still had more pressure than this new one has.</li>
            <li>You can not adjust the spray from gentle to strong.</li>
            <li>So, I found this feature a plus, but once someone is immersed in the shower, I do not see any useful purpose to be served by the lights.  </li>
            <li>My wife liked this narrow water stream, but I would have preferred a more disbursed flow.  </li>
            <li>I just do not think that the lights are worth the tradeoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hose is a nice quality metal hose, but the sprayer and the connector are low quality plastic.</li>
            <li>for the novelty of this showerhead, the color changing lights, it isn&#x27;t as useful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I know when the water is right temperature as indicated by the color change.</li>
            <li>It only took 10 minutes, very easy to install.  </li>
            <li>would have been a matter of pennies, but for me, the absence of tape required a special trip to the hardware store and a delay of more than a week in installing the device.  </li>
            <li>Installation was unbelievably easy, everything has to be hand tightened (likely because a wrench would break the light weight plastic parts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But there it was, the arm, the invisible washers and the nice long flex hose.</li>
            <li>and it easily weighs twice as much as my old one..</li>
            <li>I would expect that a showerhead would be useful for more than one year and would definitely not recommend this one to anyone.  </li>
            <li>This is a great basic hand-held shower-head with or without the LED novelty.</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made of plastic and the hose is way too short.</li>
            <li>They each serve a different purpose so make sure not to mix them up.  </li>
            <li>The positives are... and the negatives are, first off, everything that looks like chrome is plastic (of course)</li>
            <li>For many months, the LED lights worked only sporadically and, more recently, only a trickle of water would pass through the shower head.  </li>
            <li>and it is REALLY hot</li>
            <li>However, these wouldn&#x27;t have been our first choice if we knew about all the pros and cons ahead of time....</li>
            <li>as well as the parts we&#x27;d have to purchase.wouldn&#x27;t have been our first choice</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Last night, a bit of water even sprayed up toward the ceiling off the top of the showerhead, but that stopped almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Back then, it seemed as if the color was more for ambience than for any practical purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t find the price prohibitive for what it is, maybe it&#x27;s another $10 or so more than a standard handheld shower you&#x27;d use in these spaces.</li>
            <li>We have to run the hot water for about 5 minutes before hot water reaches our bathrooms</li>
            <li>We can tell when the water is getting hot because it starts to steam in the showerstall.</li>
            <li>Lumatemp LED showerhead is a novel sort of gadget, but we didn&#x27;t find it to be useful or very</li>
            <li>the colors are pretty strong and the flashing red truly does warn of HOT water</li>
            <li>and while I didn&#x27;t get the cool effects of taking a shower in the dark, it was still very helpful that I was able to just glance at the shower and know that it was heated up but not too hot.  </li>
            <li>so we were fine with getting the exact same function...but not with the lack of lights (as noted above)&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too new, so I am holding on to our old shower head which still works fine \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>the way, the packaging was adequate and the instructions were clear.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough for us, even though it can&#x27;t be adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new one works just right.</li>
            <li>I really like the ability to change up the water flow to get shampoo out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>very simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Materials, especially the mount, are cheap, low-grade plastic  </li>
            <li>so you do need to be gentle when putting the parts together.</li>
            <li>We felt that too much pressure might crack the plastic.</li>
            <li>This hose is very flexible.  </li>
            <li>I wish they made a white light shower head.</li>
            <li>And the colors are really pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color changing lights don&#x27;t really tell us anything else that isn&#x27;t already obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>colors are nice but just gimmicky.</li>
            <li>In other words, I see the color as more of a novelty than a safety item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As mention by other reviewers, it is made mostly of plastic</li>
            <li>It is very durable Highly recommended</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been several months and this one is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is convenient, when first turning the shower on, to keep tabs on the temperature without opening the shower door.  </li>
            <li>I got this simply because it looked cool - and it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hose is also much more flexible than the previous hose and a lot lighter weight.  </li>
            <li>There are many showerheads on the market today for less money than this product, that have adjustable water flows.  </li>
            <li>(I run adult family homes) not much water pressure but the clients love the lights</li>
            <li>Just as with our older shower heads, I have to wait, test the water with my hand, and then step into the shower .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is what our older units did</li>
            <li>While they are cool and work as promised, the range of \\&quot;comfortable\\&quot; water is pretty wide.</li>
            <li>This is a clever shower head: lights that change color with the water temperature.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me look like the Jolly Green Giant, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>The LED colors are supposed to change based on the water temperature with flashing red indicating dangerously hot water, it flashes red for water I consider to be a comfortable temperature.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The installation was easy but it seems like most of it is made from plastic, so I&#x27;m not sure how long this is going to hold up.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this little shower head provides a little extra light, which is helpful for night time showers.</li>
            <li>I like that feature because our shower takes a long time to warm up plus the temperature controls we have are not consistent.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have a new shower since I put this in.  </li>
            <li>really like that the shower heads can  be used in a fixed position or removed to direct the spray where we wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>rest of my review is basically the same as the first one</li>
            <li>Blue for cold/cool, green for warm/comfortably warm, red for hot and pulsing red for VERY hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but that is probably more so because now its easy to tell when it gets cold.</li>
            <li>I replaced a cheap, single shower head that had begun simply wearing out after 10 years on the job.</li>
            <li>: I initially gave this a higher rating because the temperature detecting lights were a major plus to me</li>
            <li>I have also found that the water is not as hard but more soft and soothing.</li>
            <li>But the idea of getting a visual of the temperature, especially when bathing our dogs, was intriguing, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>plus it offers a safety element to showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We picked up a dual head mount from the hardware store and put this in in addition to the old head.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not especially vigorous, it&#x27;s very drenching and that actually was much nicer.  </li>
            <li>On balance,I prefer my old showerhead with an adjustable water flow over this fixed flow with the LED lights -</li>
            <li>so will wait and see how it does with a lot of use by young kids and see if it holds up.</li>
            <li>It detaches so I can direct the spray anywhere</li>
            <li>it required the use of a wrench to remove the old and install this one:  </li>
            <li>&quot; hot long before it turns red.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, however, I would agree completely with that comment.</li>
            <li>We have a tankless water heater in our house and it can take a long time to get hot water to some parts of the house.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite a few gripes, overall I&#x27;m reasonably pleased with this.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that the washers/gaskets are two different colors, one is black and has the screen on it, the other is a clear, much more rubbery plastic.  </li>
            <li>Also, the clear washer/gasket is not in the same bag with the other materials, it would be easy to throw it out with the packaging if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>They are not in a separate small bag like I&#x27;d expect I could see how they could be easy to lose or toss out with the platic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the light it does produce is extremely helpful especially when bathing a infant.</li>
            <li>The colors here - blue for cold, green for warm, and red for hot - has a definite purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say my kids love it, but it has less to do with the water temperature than the pretty colors, and make no mistake, they ARE pretty.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t done it yet, but I&#x27;ll bet it would be fun to shower in the dark.  </li>
            <li>I found it be be a powerful shower head as water does not trickle down as I shower.</li>
            <li>The colors, however, do seem to accurately display the temperature; blue when cold, green when warm, red when hot, and flashing red when scalding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are planning a major bath renovation in the near future and this shower will not survive that.</li>
            <li>The shower head contains the same water pressure as my old shower head.  </li>
            <li>First, the water pressure is not very strong.</li>
            <li>showerhead is made in China with lightweight plastic, so I question how long this product will hold up under frequent use.  </li>
            <li>first head received  was missing washers.</li>
            <li>From a practical standpoint though, I&#x27;m not sure its worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned heads like this on the past and on many the hose is too stiff.  </li>

            <li> mo23CZ51IMEYOQQ]]There are some wonderful reviews here that I can find no fault with so</li>

            <li> The head is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> for safety, this is especially nice for children, the elderly, those with heat sensitivity, or those with skin sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re  bright!  </li>
            <li> A great product.</li>

            <li> (LOL)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li> I thought this sounded like a great idea.</li>
            <li> I can adjust the water before I get in the shower and be confident that it will be perfect when I step in.  </li>
            <li> So nice!  </li>
            <li> The color works well and is reasonably bright.  </li>
            <li> , we&#x27;ll be buying another one for the kids&#x27; bathroom, they loved it.</li>
            <li> I like a fairly vigorous spray.  </li>
            <li> This was very easy to install and works great.</li>
            <li> The flow is okay, nothing great, and is not adjustable at all.</li>
            <li> Having a light to indicate the temperature of the water is incredibly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hose is nice and flexible</li>
            <li> Now they don&#x27;t work and that keeps the safety feature from being effective.</li>
            <li> nice, I now get to shave in the shower with a light!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s nice to know when the water is finally warm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Installation was very easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a visual indicator of when the water has reached the perfect temperature.</li>
            <li> Love the lights.</li>
            <li> This is best suited for children so that they can tell the temperature without having to actually touch the water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flow was lovely.  </li>
            <li> Be sure you have some teflon tape for installation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> to \\&quot;Color\\&quot; up some more dimension to the experience.</li>
            <li> but they can be used while in place or removed for greater flexibility for spraying off soap and suds from a number of angles.</li>
            <li> I love this shower head.  </li>
            <li> I see these popping up in stores more and more now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, this is a fun gadget that will be a good guideline for water temperature.</li>
            <li> However, nothing beats just sticking your hand under the faucet and making sure the water&#x27;s comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kids love</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can also see this as a fun touch for a guest bathroom (your guests will be pleasantly delighted when the color stream starts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would prefer a metal shower head because biofilms grow on plastic more than on metal.</li>
            <li> However, our mixer valve has seen better days and needs replacing soon, so I want to err on the side in favor of the shower</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> and I loved it right away.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to install and the LED light &#x27;no battery needed&#x27; as it runs off the kenetic energy generated by the running water.</li>
            <li> stream is consistent and narrows as it sprays farther, which is actually a good idea in that it doesn&#x27;t splash all over the place.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shower isn&#x27;t adjustable, so the soft stream is what you get, which is why it&#x27;s great for a kid&#x27;s or guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> for aesthetics, this is really cool when the bathrool is dimmed or at night!  </li>
            <li> They seem prone to easy breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was easy to install</li>
            <li> None-the-less, it was easy to install and no leaks</li>
            <li> and it is working fine.</li>
            <li> It is easy to install and even has a feature where the light changes color with the temperature of the water.  </li>
            <li> Our experience was that the water pressure and spray was fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing super fancy (no option to change the intensity of the stream), but I felt like it was more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dog seems to enjoy it too</li>
            <li> I do not know whether the LED light technology prevented HeathSmart from using an adjustable flow, but this would have been a desirable feature.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s not a lot of pressure for me, I would have liked a water saver type of stream as opposed to this gentle 4-inch stream</li>
            <li> We think the kids will really enjoy the lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice chrome-like finish with a modern look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you havekids I&#x27;m sure they will think this is fun.  </li>
            <li> All I know is that I enjoy it</li>
            <li> I must must admit I was intrigued by it...but wondered--an LED light in a shower-head?</li>
            <li> (Feel free to search mycobacteria in plastic shower heads if you don&#x27;t know about this.)</li>
            <li> The pros of this shower head are that it is easy to install and the lights seem accurate and fun.  </li>
            <li> Guess my first reaction, that I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would hold up, was correct.</li>
            <li> I originally rated this product with three stars and have lowered my rating to two stars.  </li>
            <li> My original review is below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> whether the LED illuminated lights in this shower head, showing water temperature, would be of any significant benefit.  </li>
            <li> It is a unique idea, albeit a pricey one.</li>
            <li> to be more consistent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not too soft, and I think most people will like it.  </li>
            <li> The light does change colors but isn&#x27;t very consistent with the temp changes...</li>
            <li> The lights changing with the temperature is fun to watch although they may not be as accurate as some would wish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> For the light effects, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> so it seemed like it would be a good idea to have a shower that visually indicated when the water was warming</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer had mentioned that the entire showerhead felt cheap; when I read that, I agreed that it felt light, but I wasn&#x27;t sure that also meant cheap.</li>
            <li> This one has a nice, tight spray of water, though, and that makes it really nice for quickly rinsing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, though, is those LEDs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The water pressure of the flow also seemed to be adequate.  </li>
            <li> I found the colors to be pretty accurate:  </li>
            <li> When it starts to get very hot, red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Even so, however, it still had more pressure than this new one has.</li>
            <li> You can not adjust the spray from gentle to strong.</li>
            <li> So, I found this feature a plus, but once someone is immersed in the shower, I do not see any useful purpose to be served by the lights.  </li>
            <li> My wife liked this narrow water stream, but I would have preferred a more disbursed flow.  </li>
            <li> I just do not think that the lights are worth the tradeoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hose is a nice quality metal hose, but the sprayer and the connector are low quality plastic.</li>
            <li> for the novelty of this showerhead, the color changing lights, it isn&#x27;t as useful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I know when the water is right temperature as indicated by the color change.</li>
            <li> It only took 10 minutes, very easy to install.  </li>
            <li> would have been a matter of pennies, but for me, the absence of tape required a special trip to the hardware store and a delay of more than a week in installing the device.  </li>
            <li> Installation was unbelievably easy, everything has to be hand tightened (likely because a wrench would break the light weight plastic parts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But there it was, the arm, the invisible washers and the nice long flex hose.</li>
            <li> and it easily weighs twice as much as my old one..</li>
            <li> I would expect that a showerhead would be useful for more than one year and would definitely not recommend this one to anyone.  </li>
            <li> This is a great basic hand-held shower-head with or without the LED novelty.</li>
            <li> It is very cheaply made of plastic and the hose is way too short.</li>
            <li> They each serve a different purpose so make sure not to mix them up.  </li>
            <li> The positives are... and the negatives are, first off, everything that looks like chrome is plastic (of course)</li>
            <li> For many months, the LED lights worked only sporadically and, more recently, only a trickle of water would pass through the shower head.  </li>
            <li> and it is REALLY hot</li>
            <li> However, these wouldn&#x27;t have been our first choice if we knew about all the pros and cons ahead of time....</li>
            <li> as well as the parts we&#x27;d have to purchase.wouldn&#x27;t have been our first choice</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Last night, a bit of water even sprayed up toward the ceiling off the top of the showerhead, but that stopped almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Back then, it seemed as if the color was more for ambience than for any practical purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t find the price prohibitive for what it is, maybe it&#x27;s another $10 or so more than a standard handheld shower you&#x27;d use in these spaces.</li>
            <li> We have to run the hot water for about 5 minutes before hot water reaches our bathrooms</li>
            <li> We can tell when the water is getting hot because it starts to steam in the showerstall.</li>
            <li> Lumatemp LED showerhead is a novel sort of gadget, but we didn&#x27;t find it to be useful or very</li>
            <li> the colors are pretty strong and the flashing red truly does warn of HOT water</li>
            <li> and while I didn&#x27;t get the cool effects of taking a shower in the dark, it was still very helpful that I was able to just glance at the shower and know that it was heated up but not too hot.  </li>
            <li> so we were fine with getting the exact same function...but not with the lack of lights (as noted above)&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too new, so I am holding on to our old shower head which still works fine \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> the way, the packaging was adequate and the instructions were clear.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough for us, even though it can&#x27;t be adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new one works just right.</li>
            <li> I really like the ability to change up the water flow to get shampoo out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> very simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Materials, especially the mount, are cheap, low-grade plastic  </li>
            <li> so you do need to be gentle when putting the parts together.</li>
            <li> We felt that too much pressure might crack the plastic.</li>
            <li> This hose is very flexible.  </li>
            <li> I wish they made a white light shower head.</li>
            <li> And the colors are really pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color changing lights don&#x27;t really tell us anything else that isn&#x27;t already obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> colors are nice but just gimmicky.</li>
            <li> In other words, I see the color as more of a novelty than a safety item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As mention by other reviewers, it is made mostly of plastic</li>
            <li> It is very durable Highly recommended</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been several months and this one is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is convenient, when first turning the shower on, to keep tabs on the temperature without opening the shower door.  </li>
            <li> I got this simply because it looked cool - and it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hose is also much more flexible than the previous hose and a lot lighter weight.  </li>
            <li> There are many showerheads on the market today for less money than this product, that have adjustable water flows.  </li>
            <li> (I run adult family homes) not much water pressure but the clients love the lights</li>
            <li> Just as with our older shower heads, I have to wait, test the water with my hand, and then step into the shower .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is what our older units did</li>
            <li> While they are cool and work as promised, the range of \\&quot;comfortable\\&quot; water is pretty wide.</li>
            <li> This is a clever shower head: lights that change color with the water temperature.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me look like the Jolly Green Giant, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> The LED colors are supposed to change based on the water temperature with flashing red indicating dangerously hot water, it flashes red for water I consider to be a comfortable temperature.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The installation was easy but it seems like most of it is made from plastic, so I&#x27;m not sure how long this is going to hold up.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this little shower head provides a little extra light, which is helpful for night time showers.</li>
            <li> I like that feature because our shower takes a long time to warm up plus the temperature controls we have are not consistent.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have a new shower since I put this in.  </li>
            <li> really like that the shower heads can  be used in a fixed position or removed to direct the spray where we wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rest of my review is basically the same as the first one</li>
            <li> Blue for cold/cool, green for warm/comfortably warm, red for hot and pulsing red for VERY hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but that is probably more so because now its easy to tell when it gets cold.</li>
            <li> I replaced a cheap, single shower head that had begun simply wearing out after 10 years on the job.</li>
            <li> : I initially gave this a higher rating because the temperature detecting lights were a major plus to me</li>
            <li> I have also found that the water is not as hard but more soft and soothing.</li>
            <li> But the idea of getting a visual of the temperature, especially when bathing our dogs, was intriguing, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> plus it offers a safety element to showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We picked up a dual head mount from the hardware store and put this in in addition to the old head.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not especially vigorous, it&#x27;s very drenching and that actually was much nicer.  </li>
            <li> On balance,I prefer my old showerhead with an adjustable water flow over this fixed flow with the LED lights -</li>
            <li> so will wait and see how it does with a lot of use by young kids and see if it holds up.</li>
            <li> It detaches so I can direct the spray anywhere</li>
            <li> it required the use of a wrench to remove the old and install this one:  </li>
            <li> &quot; hot long before it turns red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, however, I would agree completely with that comment.</li>
            <li> We have a tankless water heater in our house and it can take a long time to get hot water to some parts of the house.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite a few gripes, overall I&#x27;m reasonably pleased with this.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that the washers/gaskets are two different colors, one is black and has the screen on it, the other is a clear, much more rubbery plastic.  </li>
            <li> Also, the clear washer/gasket is not in the same bag with the other materials, it would be easy to throw it out with the packaging if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> They are not in a separate small bag like I&#x27;d expect I could see how they could be easy to lose or toss out with the platic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the light it does produce is extremely helpful especially when bathing a infant.</li>
            <li> The colors here - blue for cold, green for warm, and red for hot - has a definite purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say my kids love it, but it has less to do with the water temperature than the pretty colors, and make no mistake, they ARE pretty.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t done it yet, but I&#x27;ll bet it would be fun to shower in the dark.  </li>
            <li> I found it be be a powerful shower head as water does not trickle down as I shower.</li>
            <li> The colors, however, do seem to accurately display the temperature; blue when cold, green when warm, red when hot, and flashing red when scalding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are planning a major bath renovation in the near future and this shower will not survive that.</li>
            <li> The shower head contains the same water pressure as my old shower head.  </li>
            <li> First, the water pressure is not very strong.</li>
            <li> showerhead is made in China with lightweight plastic, so I question how long this product will hold up under frequent use.  </li>
            <li> first head received  was missing washers.</li>
            <li> From a practical standpoint though, I&#x27;m not sure its worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned heads like this on the past and on many the hose is too stiff.  </li>
            <li> We have hard water and half the shower head is clogged, probably from calcium, so the spray is now uncomfortably strong.</li>
            <li> Although it looks like metal, it doesn&#x27;t have the same weight and substantial feel that the real stuff has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell as far as durability goes, but I&#x27;ve used it for a few days without any trouble.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described: when the water is cold, the lights are blue; hot, the lights are red;</li>
            <li> One of our old shower heads was leaking badly so the new one is a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> The lights which are installed directly inside the shower head alert me if the temperature of the water is cold (blue), hot (red) or just right (green)</li>
            <li> far as the shower heads, they perform as well as any average one.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of seconds to change color; long enough to scald or at least irritate the skin if you keep you water that hot.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it will last a long time and I will update the review if it does not.  </li>
            <li> The hose is long enough to even wash off the shower walls!</li>
            <li> I buy a new shower head ever few years</li>
            <li> The metal part broke off from the fitting at the handle and sliced open the rubber, making a big mess and rendering it completely useless.</li>
            <li> The plastic it is made from, especially the bracket, is very thin and seems cheap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the head to sit straight in the holder.  </li>
            <li> cold is cold, hot is really hot and warm (green) is &amp;#34;jus&#x27; Right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with this shower head is that the water stream is fixed in one configuration which focuses the flow into a fairly narrow area.  </li>
            <li> It tends to drip for a long time after its turned off.  </li>
            <li> and I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> In playing with the temp, I can get the water down to a pretty uncomfortable cold before it finally turns blue, and - of far more concern - up to a \\&quot;don&#x27;t-touch-that!\\</li>
            <li> The lights are operated by hydro-power so no batteries or any other installation is necessary.  </li>
            <li> Other times it has switched to red when I wasn&#x27;t bothered by the warmth.  </li>
            <li> If you dry off in the shower stall like I do, its dripping on you while you try to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottom line here is that the LED lights have some, but limited, utility.  </li>
            <li> (???) Obviously something is not right.</li>
            <li> Having switched to this from a Waterpik massage showerhead, this definitely feels like a step down all the way</li>
            <li> product is however, not particularly well made.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered similar items in the past and they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> However, I do want to add that in one shower this did not seem to be needed as the seal was tight enough without it.</li>
            <li> Once I bought the tape, installation took only a few minutes and went without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stream diameter is really narrow (about 2-3 inches) and actually gets narrower once it leaves the showerhead.  </li>
            <li> Blue when cold and green when comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The LEDs start out blue and turn green as the water warms.  </li>
            <li> Considering that it is probably impossible to clean a long hose of all biofilms, I&#x27;m going to consider this a temporary item and replace it within a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My home has a tiled walk in shower with a small glass block window that lets in sunlight during the day, unfortunately, at night the shower is fairly dark since there is no light inside the shower itself (only a bit of light that comes through the shower door&#x27;s opening).</li>
            <li> We had to return the first one because it made a weird noise when we ran water thru it.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re going to spend close to $40 dollars for a shower head, unless you have a person described above, I am not sure I&#x27;m feeling the value.</li>
            <li> In the other shower, it was needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The washers were tricky to find -- one was already installed and the other was lost in the bubble wrap until I dug it out.</li>
            <li> was disappointed that most of the parts are plastic and lightweight at that.</li>
            <li> I find the green to red transition a bit inconsistent in that at times I&#x27;ve had to turn the mixer a bit to the cooler side while the LEDs were still showing green.  </li>
            <li> husband installed this and it took a little longer than expected.</li>
            <li> This is only a problem for those who have hard water</li>
            <li> Something must have cracked on the inside because water is leaking out from the inside and running down the cable.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d return this if I wasn&#x27;t already outside the return window.  This thing leaks out of all 3 threaded connections even with the teflon tape wrapped around the threads according to the instructions.  The water spray is very weak and covers a very small area.  The LED colors are supposed to change based on the water temperature with flashing red indicating dangerously hot water, it flashes red for water I consider to be a comfortable temperature.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I know when the water is right temperature as indicated by the color change.</li>
            <li> After a month, it no longer lights up.&lt;br /&gt;There were leaks at the get go, even after I used teflon tape.</li>
            <li> We had to return the first one because it made a weird noise when we ran water thru it. The new one works just right. The colors even agree with our definitions of the temperature ... cold is cold, hot is really hot and warm (green) is &amp;#34;jus&#x27; Right&amp;#34;. A great product.</li>
            <li> Love the lights. This was very easy to install and works great. My dog seems to enjoy it too but that is probably more so because now its easy to tell when it gets cold.</li>
            <li> The product performs as advertised but the lack of ability to change the spray drops the star rating for this item.  I really like the ability to change up the water flow to get shampoo out of my hair.  This is best suited for children so that they can tell the temperature without having to actually touch the water.</li>
            <li> 2nd one I bought (I run adult family homes) not much water pressure but the clients love the lights</li>
            <li> My home has a tiled walk in shower with a small glass block window that lets in sunlight during the day, unfortunately, at night the shower is fairly dark since there is no light inside the shower itself (only a bit of light that comes through the shower door&#x27;s opening). Surprisingly, this little shower head provides a little extra light, which is helpful for night time showers. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower-head contains hydro-powered LED lights which means you never have to worry about changing batteries. I felt like the stream was comparable to my previous shower head. It&#x27;s nothing super fancy (no option to change the intensity of the stream), but I felt like it was more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was very easy. It was installed in under five minutes. You will need Teflon tape, which runs between $1-2 at your local hardware store. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s made out of a lightweight plasticky material rather than metal. Although it looks like metal, it doesn&#x27;t have the same weight and substantial feel that the real stuff has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell as far as durability goes, but I&#x27;ve used it for a few days without any trouble. It&#x27;s nice to have a visual indicator of when the water has reached the perfect temperature. In the words of my three-year-old, \\&quot;It&#x27;s cool.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> UPDATE: We&#x27;ve been using this for just about 7 months and today had to replace it. The lights stopped working months ago, they lasted only a couple of months. Then it started leaking because there are no seals in the connectors. Today the inner rubber hose inside the flexible shielded hose broke. The metal part broke off from the fitting at the handle and sliced open the rubber, making a big mess and rendering it completely useless. The rubber was very thin, thinner than a bicycle inner tube. Guess my first reaction, that I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would hold up, was correct. This is a piece of junk, don&#x27;t waste your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Been using this for a few weeks now and it is working fine. The installation was easy but it seems like most of it is made from plastic, so I&#x27;m not sure how long this is going to hold up. The flow is okay, nothing great, and is not adjustable at all. Having switched to this from a Waterpik massage showerhead, this definitely feels like a step down all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are nice but just gimmicky. However, if I had small children I think this would be a plus. They could learn at least three of their colors plus it offers a safety element to showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are planning a major bath renovation in the near future and this shower will not survive that. For now, it&#x27;s inexpensive and it works.</li>
            <li> I needed a handheld shower head to wash my dog, and the house we just bought only had a wall-mount head. We picked up a dual head mount from the hardware store and put this in in addition to the old head. The only reason I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars is because the stream isn&#x27;t adjustable, otherwise we&#x27;d have only this one installed.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> We just received this last night and immediately installed it.  It only took 10 minutes, very easy to install.  We already had the teflon tape in our tool box and it came with everything else needed so it was a painless process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we sent our kids, one by one to take a shower.  Each time the response after turning on the water was \\&quot;Whoa COOL\\&quot; followed by a lot of changing of temperatures to see the different colors.  I found the colors to be pretty accurate:  Blue for cold/cool, green for warm/comfortably warm, red for hot and pulsing red for VERY hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished using it this morning and while I didn&#x27;t get the cool effects of taking a shower in the dark, it was still very helpful that I was able to just glance at the shower and know that it was heated up but not too hot.  The flow was lovely.  While it&#x27;s not especially vigorous, it&#x27;s very drenching and that actually was much nicer.  I had no problems rinsing my hair after shampoo/conditioner and I like the heavy but gentle stream.  Our previous shower head was the massage type, I like this better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hose is also much more flexible than the previous hose and a lot lighter weight.  As I said previously, it came with everything needed to install, though you&#x27;ll have to get teflon tape if you don&#x27;t have any.  Be aware that the washers/gaskets are two different colors, one is black and has the screen on it, the other is a clear, much more rubbery plastic.  They each serve a different purpose so make sure not to mix them up.  Also, the clear washer/gasket is not in the same bag with the other materials, it would be easy to throw it out with the packaging if you&#x27;re not careful.  The lights are operated by hydro-power so no batteries or any other installation is necessary.  We didn&#x27;t even have to turn off the water to install it, very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this holds up well, we&#x27;ll be buying another one for the kids&#x27; bathroom, they loved it.</li>
            <li> The positives are... and the negatives are, first off, everything that looks like chrome is plastic (of course) but, it&#x27;s very thin plastic and doesn&#x27;t look like it would last very long.  The light does change colors but isn&#x27;t very consistent with the temp changes...even the instructions it comes with tells you to check the temp before entering the shower...and it easily weighs twice as much as my old one..</li>
            <li> UPDATE 2/2/2014:  After using this showerhead on a regular basis for about a year, it broke and became completely useless.  For many months, the LED lights worked only sporadically and, more recently, only a trickle of water would pass through the shower head.  I am guessing that the mechanism that powers the LED lights broke and eventually blocked the water flow.  I originally rated this product with three stars and have lowered my rating to two stars.  I would expect that a showerhead would be useful for more than one year and would definitely not recommend this one to anyone.  My original review is below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *  *  *  *  *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had always determined whether shower water is the correct temperature by sticking my hand or foot in the water stream before jumping in.  This procedure always seemed to work well, so I had doubts whether the LED illuminated lights in this shower head, showing water temperature, would be of any significant benefit.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is convenient, when first turning the shower on, to keep tabs on the temperature without opening the shower door.  So, I found this feature a plus, but once someone is immersed in the shower, I do not see any useful purpose to be served by the lights.  The colors, however, do seem to accurately display the temperature; blue when cold, green when warm, red when hot, and flashing red when scalding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water pressure of the flow also seemed to be adequate.  My biggest problem with this shower head is that the water stream is fixed in one configuration which focuses the flow into a fairly narrow area.  My wife liked this narrow water stream, but I would have preferred a more disbursed flow.  There are many showerheads on the market today for less money than this product, that have adjustable water flows.  I do not know whether the LED light technology prevented HeathSmart from using an adjustable flow, but this would have been a desirable feature.  On balance,I prefer my old showerhead with an adjustable water flow over this fixed flow with the LED lights - I just do not think that the lights are worth the tradeoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This showerhead is made in China with lightweight plastic, so I question how long this product will hold up under frequent use.  The plastic has a metallic appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation instructions state that a short strip of Teflon tape is needed to wrap around the shower stem, but no Teflon tape was included in the box.  To make matters worse, neither the box nor the Amazon product description (as of the date of this review) state that Teflon tape is required for installation, but not included in the box.  The cost of including the tape to HealthSmart would have been a matter of pennies, but for me, the absence of tape required a special trip to the hardware store and a delay of more than a week in installing the device.  Once I bought the tape, installation took only a few minutes and went without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line here is that the LED lights have some, but limited, utility.  However, from my viewpoint, the lack of any adjustment to the water flow makes this showerhead less desirable than less expensive adjustable models.</li>
            <li> Buy this NOW!  Do not pass Go, do not collect $100!  You are going to be so happy that you did.  This sprayer for your shower has everything you could possibly want.  It is easy to install and even has a feature where the light changes color with the temperature of the water.  We haven&#x27;t done it yet, but I&#x27;ll bet it would be fun to shower in the dark.  (LOL)  The hose is nice and flexible too.&lt;br /&gt;One note: Be sure you have some teflon tape for installation.&lt;br /&gt;I think you&#x27;ll like this one and want one for every bathroom.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo23CZ51IMEYOQQ]]There are some wonderful reviews here that I can find no fault with so I&#x27;ll add what I can to \\&quot;Color\\&quot; up some more dimension to the experience. There is a definite disappointment in the weight of this shower arm. When the box arrived I thought, \\&quot;Oh I thought this was going to be the shower head but it&#x27;s way too light\\&quot;.  But there it was, the arm, the invisible washers and the nice long flex hose. Installation was unbelievably easy, everything has to be hand tightened (likely because a wrench would break the light weight plastic parts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait to see the colors emerge and they did not disappoint. They&#x27;re  bright!  I can see where an elderly or handi-capable individual could use this, even (or and especially) children who may not consider testing the water before jumping in. the colors are pretty strong and the flashing red truly does warn of HOT water and it is REALLY hot when it flashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not a lot of pressure for me, I would have liked a water saver type of stream as opposed to this gentle 4-inch stream but I have to say, if this was in a guest room at a place I was staying, it would NOT make my complaint list.  But if you&#x27;re going to spend close to $40 dollars for a shower head, unless you have a person described above, I am not sure I&#x27;m feeling the value.</li>
            <li> I received this item over a month ago and wanted to wait to write the review based on its performance. The lights which are installed directly inside the shower head alert me if the temperature of the water is cold (blue), hot (red) or just right (green) I found it be be a powerful shower head as water does not trickle down as I shower. I have also found that the water is not as hard but more soft and soothing. Given that there are 5 people in this home taking 5 showers a day and with two teenage boys taking another shower at night this shower head does the job It is very durable Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The pros of this shower head are that it is easy to install and the lights seem accurate and fun.  We think the kids will really enjoy the lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is however, not particularly well made.  Materials, especially the mount, are cheap, low-grade plastic  They seem prone to easy breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stream diameter is really narrow (about 2-3 inches) and actually gets narrower once it leaves the showerhead.  It&#x27;s also not adjustable.  Big disappointment with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just installed this so will wait and see how it does with a lot of use by young kids and see if it holds up.</li>
            <li> Updated review: I initially gave this a higher rating because the temperature detecting lights were a major plus to me Now they don&#x27;t work and that keeps the safety feature from being effective. Just as with our older shower heads, I have to wait, test the water with my hand, and then step into the shower .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shower heads, they perform as well as any average one.No special bells or whistles but they can be used while in place or removed for greater flexibility for spraying off soap and suds from a number of angles. This is what our older units did so we were fine with getting the exact same function...but not with the lack of lights (as noted above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of my review is basically the same as the first one I wrote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first head received  was missing washers. The second came with all washers needed. Neither came with the suggested Teflon tapes. However, I do want to add that in one shower this did not seem to be needed as the seal was tight enough without it. In the other shower, it was needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic shower head and shower connector is made of plastic so you do need to be gentle when putting the parts together. We felt that too much pressure might crack the plastic. That never happened to us, though, on either shower tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LumaTemp instructions do caution users that water pressures and temperatures can vary from one shower to another. Our experience was that the water pressure and spray was fine. You can not adjust the spray from gentle to strong. It is a set spray. It is strong enough for us, even though it can&#x27;t be adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really like that the shower heads can  be used in a fixed position or removed to direct the spray where we wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we have all the parts, we will continue to use the Healthsmart. One of our old shower heads was leaking badly so the new one is a significant improvement. They work  well enough for basic shower heads.. However, these wouldn&#x27;t have been our first choice if we knew about all the pros and cons ahead of time....as well as the parts we&#x27;d have to purchase.wouldn&#x27;t have been our first choice if we knew about all the pros and cons ahead of time....as well as the parts we&#x27;d have to purchase.</li>
            <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;* I like the fact that it does not need batteries.  It says it is hydro-powered.&lt;br /&gt;* It has a nice chrome-like finish with a modern look.&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve owned heads like this on the past and on many the hose is too stiff.  It&#x27;s hard to get the head to sit straight in the holder.  This hose is very flexible.  One of the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;* The color works well and is reasonably bright.  Blue when cold and green when comfortable.  When it starts to get very hot, red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes&lt;br /&gt;* The plastic it is made from, especially the bracket, is very thin and seems cheap.  I will give it the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it will last a long time and I will update the review if it does not.  However, I was a little disappointed by it.&lt;br /&gt;* It says to use plumbing (\\&quot;Teflon\\&quot;) tape, but none was enclosed.  If you are the, or have a, handyman in your household you probably have some.  If not, that is a trip to the hardware store.  Plumbing tape keep joints from leaking.&lt;br /&gt;* The washers are just tossed in the bag with the larger parts. They are not in a separate small bag like I&#x27;d expect I could see how they could be easy to lose or toss out with the platic.&lt;br /&gt;* I like a fairly vigorous spray.  This is a little softer, somewhat like a water saving head.  It&#x27;s OK, not too soft, and I think most people will like it.  For me though I wish it was harder.&lt;br /&gt;*  It tends to drip for a long time after its turned off.  If you dry off in the shower stall like I do, its dripping on you while you try to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are already under the shower,  I would not rely on the red color alone to warn you of a sudden temp change.  It takes a couple of seconds to change color; long enough to scald or at least irritate the skin if you keep you water that hot.  In other words, I see the color as more of a novelty than a safety item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite a few gripes, overall I&#x27;m reasonably pleased with this.  It is a unique idea, albeit a pricey one. If you havekids I&#x27;m sure they will think this is fun.  From a practical standpoint though, I&#x27;m not sure its worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this shower head.  You can tell by the color what the approximate temperature of the water is.  I can adjust the water before I get in the shower and be confident that it will be perfect when I step in.  It detaches so I can direct the spray anywhere I want it to or I can leave it up on the wall and have the shower stationary.  So nice!  I feel like I have a new shower since I put this in.  Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An addition to this review:  I got this in February 2013.  In December 2013, the tube inside the shower head exploded (Popped like an aneurysm) and broke the metal sheathing over it so now the entire thing is toast.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible shower head. It is very cheaply made of plastic and the hose is way too short. The lights almost all went out after the third week of trial and the clear head holds a puddle of water all the time that looks terrible. The spray is very narrow from what I&#x27;m use too, you have to move around to get wet. No pressure adjustment or shut off button. Can&#x27;t wait to reinstall my Delta!</li>
            <li> I buy a new shower head ever few years and it was almost time as our Michigan water seems to shorten their life span. When I saw this Lumatemp LED handheld shower head I knew I had to have it. It was easy to install and I loved it right away. As mention by other reviewers, it is made mostly of plastic but if you go out to the store and look, almost ever showerhead these days IS plastic. The hose is long enough to even wash off the shower walls! The lights changing with the temperature is fun to watch although they may not be as accurate as some would wish. The spray is not adjustable, but I never adjust mine anyway. All I know is that I enjoy it and I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great basic hand-held shower-head with or without the LED novelty. The head is the perfect size. The LED lighting? I must must admit I was intrigued by it...but wondered--an LED light in a shower-head? Now I don&#x27;t think I could to back to a boring old unlighted head. I see these popping up in stores more and more now. It&#x27;s a great idea. This is very easy to install and the LED light &#x27;no battery needed&#x27; as it runs off the kenetic energy generated by the running water. You can hear an &#x27;ever-so-slight&#x27; hum has the water is flowing through the head. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered similar items in the past and they don&#x27;t last.  So far, it&#x27;s been several months and this one is still going strong.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> The shower head contains the same water pressure as my old shower head.  it required the use of a wrench to remove the old and install this one:  i could do it so it&#x27;s pretty easy.  the different temperatures actually do register different colors.  for aesthetics, this is really cool when the bathrool is dimmed or at night!  for safety, this is especially nice for children, the elderly, those with heat sensitivity, or those with skin sensitivity.  I give everything that i review a grade, and i believe that this merits a B+ / A-.  I recommend it for use with children, elderly, or those with medical conditions for which water temperature might be a factor.  I really like it!</li>
            <li> I got this simply because it looked cool - and it is. It works exactly as described: when the water is cold, the lights are blue; hot, the lights are red; \\&quot;comfortable,\\&quot; and the lights are green. It&#x27;s self-powered, so you turn on the water, and the lights come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two issues with it. First, the water pressure is not very strong. I replaced a cheap, single shower head that had begun simply wearing out after 10 years on the job. Even so, however, it still had more pressure than this new one has. This one has a nice, tight spray of water, though, and that makes it really nice for quickly rinsing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, though, is those LEDs. While they are cool and work as promised, the range of \\&quot;comfortable\\&quot; water is pretty wide. In playing with the temp, I can get the water down to a pretty uncomfortable cold before it finally turns blue, and - of far more concern - up to a \\&quot;don&#x27;t-touch-that!\\&quot; hot long before it turns red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this is a fun gadget that will be a good guideline for water temperature. However, nothing beats just sticking your hand under the faucet and making sure the water&#x27;s comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***March 20 update&lt;br /&gt;I have changed my review from a 4-star to a 1-star. While everything I wrote before is still valid, the showerhead is already leaking - after only a month on the job. Something must have cracked on the inside because water is leaking out from the inside and running down the cable. Last night, a bit of water even sprayed up toward the ceiling off the top of the showerhead, but that stopped almost immediately. (???) Obviously something is not right. Another reviewer had mentioned that the entire showerhead felt cheap; when I read that, I agreed that it felt light, but I wasn&#x27;t sure that also meant cheap. Now, however, I would agree completely with that comment. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I received this product thinking, \\&quot;Oh nice, I now get to shave in the shower with a light!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t that type of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the light it does produce is extremely helpful especially when bathing a infant. Having a light to indicate the temperature of the water is incredibly useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I wish they made a white light shower head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been intrigued with these colored shower lights when they made their debut about 10 years ago. Back then, it seemed as if the color was more for ambience than for any practical purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that, the Healthsmart Lunatemp differs. The colors here - blue for cold, green for warm, and red for hot - has a definite purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say my kids love it, but it has less to do with the water temperature than the pretty colors, and make no mistake, they ARE pretty. My kids love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also see this as a fun touch for a guest bathroom (your guests will be pleasantly delighted when the color stream starts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower isn&#x27;t adjustable, so the soft stream is what you get, which is why it&#x27;s great for a kid&#x27;s or guest bathroom. For the one I use everyday? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the price prohibitive for what it is, maybe it&#x27;s another $10 or so more than a standard handheld shower you&#x27;d use in these spaces. For the light effects, I think it&#x27;s worth it. The kids definitely agree!</li>
            <li> This is a clever shower head: lights that change color with the water temperature. I like that feature because our shower takes a long time to warm up plus the temperature controls we have are not consistent. So it&#x27;s nice to know when the water is finally warm.  And the colors are really pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband installed this and it took a little longer than expected. We had to hunt for the plumber&#x27;s tape, which we had left over from another project. The washers were tricky to find -- one was already installed and the other was lost in the bubble wrap until I dug it out. Even after we found everything we had to experiment a little to eliminate leaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that most of the parts are plastic and lightweight at that. I would prefer a metal shower head because biofilms grow on plastic more than on metal. These have been shown to cause disease. (Feel free to search mycobacteria in plastic shower heads if you don&#x27;t know about this.) But metal shower heads are hard to find. Considering that it is probably impossible to clean a long hose of all biofilms, I&#x27;m going to consider this a temporary item and replace it within a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband immediately noticed that the shower stream is not adjustable. However, the water pressure seemed good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the packaging was adequate and the instructions were clear. I was disappointed that the plastic part of the packaging was not marked recyclable.  But all in all we like the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum, Sept. 2013: The lights have stopped working! We have hard water and half the shower head is clogged, probably from calcium, so the spray is now uncomfortably strong. Last month I improved it somewhat by soaking the device in vinegar but it is clogging up again already. This is only a problem for those who have hard water but I thought I would mention it.</li>
            <li> I thought this sounded like a great idea. We have a tankless water heater in our house and it can take a long time to get hot water to some parts of the house. We have to run the hot water for about 5 minutes before hot water reaches our bathrooms so it seemed like it would be a good idea to have a shower that visually indicated when the water was warming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practically speaking, this showerhead is a mix of quality metal parts and flimsy plastic parts. The hose is a nice quality metal hose, but the sprayer and the connector are low quality plastic. None-the-less, it was easy to install and no leaks presented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the novelty of this showerhead, the color changing lights, it isn&#x27;t as useful as I thought it would be. We can tell when the water is getting hot because it starts to steam in the showerstall. The color changing lights don&#x27;t really tell us anything else that isn&#x27;t already obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We uninstalled this and reinstalled our pre-existing showerhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Lumatemp LED showerhead is a novel sort of gadget, but we didn&#x27;t find it to be useful or very attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical about this shower head.  LED lights?  Sounded funky.  But the idea of getting a visual of the temperature, especially when bathing our dogs, was intriguing, so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stream is consistent and narrows as it sprays farther, which is actually a good idea in that it doesn&#x27;t splash all over the place.  The LEDs start out blue and turn green as the water warms.  I find the green to red transition a bit inconsistent in that at times I&#x27;ve had to turn the mixer a bit to the cooler side while the LEDs were still showing green.  Other times it has switched to red when I wasn&#x27;t bothered by the warmth.  Hence one star subtraction, I would like that to be more consistent.  However, our mixer valve has seen better days and needs replacing soon, so I want to err on the side in favor of the shower head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m glad I ordered it. It doesn&#x27;t make me look like the Jolly Green Giant, which is a good thing. Will it hold up the test of time?  I can&#x27;t say, it&#x27;s too new, so I am holding on to our old shower head which still works fine \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;...</li>
