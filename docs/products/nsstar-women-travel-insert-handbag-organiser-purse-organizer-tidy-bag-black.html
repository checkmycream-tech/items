            <li>very flimsy material.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but wow—this insert is a great tool for optimizing the space in a larger handbag!</li>
            <li>Now I can easily transition from one purse to the other.</li>
            <li>The inside handles fell of quickly but other than that it has held up very well for the cost.</li>
            <li>Lots of handy pockets on the outside, 2 roomy areas that zip with an open center area to handle all of your belongings.</li>
            <li>In general I really like this product though the one I received was defective.</li>
            <li>When it is full, it&#x27;s a little too &#x27;squishy&#x27; to be really portable from one handbag to another.</li>
            <li>I change my bags frequently.  </li>
            <li>bought it for a present and as far as I know she likes it.</li>
            <li>On this one, one of the little handles pulled out the first time I used it.</li>

            <li> it was much bigger than I anticipated and there&#x27;s no real structure to it. When it is full, it&#x27;s a little too &#x27;squishy&#x27; to be really portable from one handbag to another. I have a organizer from another company that is sturdier and it is much easier to use for quick changes.</li>
            <li> I love this purse organizer. Lots of handy pockets on the outside, 2 roomy areas that zip with an open center area to handle all of your belongings. Makes finding things in a larger purse easy with no fumbling. Two loops on the top if you want to pick the whole thing up and move it another purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice accessory</li>
            <li> In general I really like this product though the one I received was defective. This is the second of these I have bought. The first one was great. On this one, one of the little handles pulled out the first time I used it. I think it was not sewn in well. I have asked the seller to replace it and will update/revise this review if that happens.</li>
            <li> Very useful, love all the compartments, the zipped enclosures and seems to be durable. Now I can easily transition from one purse to the other.</li>
            <li> Feel apart after only 2 months.</li>
            <li> I change my bags frequently.  This is one of the best things I&#x27;ve every purchased.  Has enough room and organizes more than it looks like in picture.  It is small, yet so much fits in it!</li>
            <li> The inside handles fell of quickly but other than that it has held up very well for the cost.</li>
            <li> This is just right for my sack purse. I can fill this up and still have room for my phone and wallet outside of the organizer. Some think it&#x27;s too small but I like the size. They must have a lot more in their purses than I do.</li>
            <li> This is awesome for keeping stuff organized in your purse.  I do not like having everything without a place in my handbags and this gives me a place for everything and makes it very easy to switch out purses.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but wow—this insert is a great tool for optimizing the space in a larger handbag! I can now find my phone and wallet consistently and quickly, which is a rare quality for anything that&#x27;s not an open tote bag. Very cool.</li>
            <li> bought it for a present and as far as I know she likes it.</li>

            <li> More like another purse</li>
            <li> I can finally find all the &amp;#34;little things&amp;#34; in my purse.Light weight. Just bought a second one!</li>
            <li> Needs a more solid base, but I like that I can make it larger/smaller via side snaps</li>
            <li> I use it to organize my Filofax and supplies in my purse. Works great!</li>
            <li> I love this so much! I switch purses all the time and it makes it so easy! I&#x27;ve actually ordered another one for my mom and one for my gym bag!</li>
            <li> luv it.. wanna get more so I can share them with family..</li>
            <li> looks just as expected</li>
            <li> Lots of compartments. Lightweight.</li>
            <li> If you looking for a super high quality organizer, this not it. That being established, this is great for organization and if it falls apart, that is okay because it wasn&#x27;t that expensive. Does the job, but may only last for a couple years before it rips.</li>
            <li> This thing is genius! it is the perfect way to organize a large purse! shipped fast and exactly as described!</li>
            <li> very flimsy material.  seam on one side pulled out the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> this is so cheap , it reaped just as i took it out of the package. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> Great organizer for a backpack.</li>
            <li> After one use the handles started to come apart from he bag.  Not a very good quality.</li>
