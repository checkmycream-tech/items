            <li>product was fantastic!</li>
            <li>so I have many skincare concerns and goals.</li>
            <li>best facial cream ever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m exceptionally pleased to try this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it more time but from the way it makes my skin feel at this point</li>
            <li>, even I have dry skin, this creme works perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Looking at the texture of her skin alone, I could easily take off 20</li>
            <li>A very good product for chronic dry skin problems.</li>
            <li>but if you are not oily it works fantastic under make up and used as a daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is just as radiance, smooth and wrinkle-free as it&#x27;s always been.</li>
            <li>It absorbs cleanly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li>It was a shot in the dark, but I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>I used to work in the cosmetic and skincare world and was privvy to many high end products (I used to own $300 face cream that was only 2 oz).</li>
            <li>Luckily, I bought it through amazone and it was delivered fast.</li>
            <li>I typically do not write reviews but this particular cream deserves a fantastic review!</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for years now and I am glad I  found it in amazon, because I had to travel to some Latin American country to find it again.  </li>
            <li>This Stiefel cream is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>And I remember one of  dermatologist years ago told me that most of those Lancombe and Elisabeth Arden and so on creams are pointless, better get your cream from a farmacy.</li>
            <li>I really suggest give this one a try!</li>
            <li>the cream was gentle on sensitive skin,  free from harmful chemicals, additives, perfumes etc why can&#x27;t they make products like this?</li>
            <li>but this particular cream deserves a review!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper overseas.  </li>
            <li>I use a lighter hydro-gel during the day under my make up and use this only for the night as it is still too rich for the day.</li>
            <li>No breakouts, no oiliness, very firm, supple, everything great you can possibly imagine.</li>
            <li>And unlike many high end products, this one actually works deep in the tissue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product, though I took off one star because its so expensive.</li>
            <li>Just realized that the price is much more reasonable at other places, such as ebay.</li>
            <li>I live in humid Miami, FL</li>
            <li>, I think I have found my new go-to product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I first discover it when working with a group of latin american dermathologist 10 years ago, and I still using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is combination/oily, sensitive and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I wish they distributed it here directly.</li>
            <li>It really works deep in the skin.</li>
            <li>typically do not write reviews</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin at least as well as La Prairie Cellular Radiance, but Stiefel seems to last better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>(I am currently using Olay Regenerist Serum fragrance free--this is another miracle product that I was shocked was so great.</li>

            <li> If anyone knows La Prairie, you know they&#x27;re outrageously expensive</li>
            <li> But those two have a bad habit of containing (not all but some creams) mineral oil/paraffinum/petrolatum.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product. But misleading description ***** BUYER BEWARE *****  item sold by Frauenland Pharmacy is a single tube, not a two-pack as &amp;#34;75ml x 2&amp;#34; in the description.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 and received only one !!&lt;br /&gt;Dont know how to get the another missing.</li>
            <li> product was fantastic! the cream was gentle on sensitive skin,  free from harmful chemicals, additives, perfumes etc why can&#x27;t they make products like this? hope it comes in a bigger tube</li>
            <li> Very good. It works well.</li>
            <li> I typically do not write reviews but this particular cream deserves a fantastic review! My skin is combination/oily, sensitive and prone to breakouts. I live in humid Miami, FL and I am in my late twenties so I have many skincare concerns and goals. I used to work in the cosmetic and skincare world and was privvy to many high end products (I used to own $300 face cream that was only 2 oz). I heard of Physiogel from a friend of mine who is from Spain and this is all she and her mother and sisters use on their faces. After reading tons of reviews on this product I decided to get it since it was so inexpensive in comparison to my previous skin care purchases. I was skeptical because of how much of a bargain it was but I tried it anyway. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for over a month now and my skin is literally flawless. No breakouts, no oiliness, very firm, supple, everything great you can possibly imagine. I cannot recommend this cream enough. Anybody with any type of skin will benefit from this. I do use an anti-aging serum before applying the Physiogel at night (I am currently using Olay Regenerist Serum fragrance free--this is another miracle product that I was shocked was so great. Again, my previous serums ran about $150-$200 per ounce)then I use the Olay again in the am followed by a sunblock. So I only use Physiogel at night but if you are not oily it works fantastic under make up and used as a daytime moisturizer. Buy this, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years now and it is really good. I&#x27;ve tried some other facial cream and always return to this one. best facial cream ever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product we have used it for 5 years the Amaozon price is the best we have seen</li>
            <li> I tend to get break out s when I put cream on my face, even I have dry skin, this creme works perfect for me. I use a lighter hydro-gel during the day under my make up and use this only for the night as it is still too rich for the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for years.  It absorbs cleanly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  Very gentle and non irritating product.  This is the only non &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product I use because it&#x27;s so effective.  It&#x27;s much cheaper overseas.  I think around $5-6 a bottle compared to $20 from the sellers on Amazon.  I wish they distributed it here directly.</li>
            <li> A very good product for chronic dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> My baby is 2months and had trouble on his face. I was recommended this cream by my friend and decided to purchase it. However, I coudln&#x27;t find it in stores. Luckily, I bought it through amazone and it was delivered fast. Now, my baby recovered his beautiful skin after applying it for 2days.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Highly recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, though I took off one star because its so expensive. After using this cream for about a week I noticed that my  skin became softer. Would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this cream for three months, I started feeling like it was leaving residue on my skin. my skin felt heavier, and stuff comes off after using it. That&#x27;s the reason why I stopped using it, even though I have half of this bottle left. switched to Bio-oil before I go to bed (its an oil - leaves a sheen) and neutrogena Norwegian formula hand cream (yes it&#x27;s a hand cream, but it says you can use it for face body even lips. a little goes a long way in moisturizing). Happy with my skin care moisturizing routine now.</li>
            <li> Best face cream ever!&lt;br /&gt;I typically do not write reviews but this particular cream deserves a review! I have been using this cream for years now and I am glad I  found it in amazon, because I had to travel to some Latin American country to find it again.  I first discover it when working with a group of latin american dermathologist 10 years ago, and I still using it. Is a great product. My skin is combination/oily, so I just usit at night. Buy this, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exceptionally pleased to try this. It was a shot in the dark, but I&#x27;m happy. Here&#x27;s why: I&#x27;ve been using some form of La Prairie Cellular face cream for over 12 years. If anyone knows La Prairie, you know they&#x27;re outrageously expensive but, every time I tried something to take it&#x27;s place so I could save some money, my face would break out. Sometimes very badly. This Stiefel cream is exactly what I have been looking for. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for at least a week now. It moisturizes my skin at least as well as La Prairie Cellular Radiance, but Stiefel seems to last better throughout the day. My skin is just as radiance, smooth and wrinkle-free as it&#x27;s always been. I&#x27;ll give it more time but from the way it makes my skin feel at this point, I think I have found my new go-to product. Maybe now I can start saving for that trip to Hawaii!</li>
            <li> This must be one of the cheapest creams I have used. And unlike many high end products, this one actually works deep in the tissue.&lt;br /&gt;My mom has used it for a year now, and she is in her mid 60s. The texture of her skin is incredible. At that age not only should one have deep wrinkles, but also the skin itself should look tired, the texture should be off. Looking at the texture of her skin alone, I could easily take off 20 and then some years.&lt;br /&gt;This cream don&#x27;t look flashy, it is not high end products that one can buy from a mall and feel spoiled and special. This is a cream that you can get from a farmacy. And I remember one of  dermatologist years ago told me that most of those Lancombe and Elisabeth Arden and so on creams are pointless, better get your cream from a farmacy. After using this cream for few months I have to agree. It really works deep in the skin. So don&#x27;t be fooled by fancy prices and packages, and celebrities who claim to use those creams. If you don&#x27;t want to go with this one then other ones I can suggest are Eucerin and Vichy. But those two have a bad habit of containing (not all but some creams) mineral oil/paraffinum/petrolatum. Skip those.&lt;br /&gt;But I really suggest give this one a try!</li>
            <li> Just realized that the price is much more reasonable at other places, such as ebay. Will update after using the product.</li>
