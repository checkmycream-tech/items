            <li>For the price this works wonderful!!</li>
            <li>At this price point, this balm is excellent.</li>
            <li>Moreover, because of these ingredients, the product is probably best used as recommended on the package, that is, use after a shampoo, apply for 3-5 minutes, rinse well.</li>

            <li>I used it before and loved it</li>
            <li>I think this balm will gives good protein as well as fiber to hairs</li>
            <li>I repeated the process, this time leaving the balm in for a good 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Smells really good, but it did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>The package was not enclosed in a cartoon box, it was sent in a beautifully designed package from Seller, (great marketing plan, I would state), and the L’Oreal Total Repair 5 Damage Eraser Balm was enclosed in another impressive plastic container, beautifully sealed and protected from any damage to the product or through transportation.  </li>

            <li>My hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>A seriously amazing product.</li>
            <li>It works great and made a huge difference in the condition and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>Which is amazing, because ever since I chopped it off, the ends curl upwards</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, it was sitting in my mother in laws house</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, smells great</li>
            <li>it looked amazing.</li>
            <li>OMG this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It really is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and my hair volume and frizzies are much reduced...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m LOVING the results.</li>
            <li>Thanks loreal for these wonderful products</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look great and has really brought my hair into great quality since my hair has been treated with color a lot</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t do my whole head for fear of causing an imbalance but I&#x27;m very happy with the results I have seen.</li>
            <li>He said it was a million times better and asked if he could sleep with his face in my hair because he loved the smell.</li>
            <li>I own the Shampoo, Conditioner, and the repair balm.</li>
            <li>Thanks Seller and Amazon for a great product!</li>
            <li>there are so many good things about this conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this as a mask (followed the directions to a T) but it honestly didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular to it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the “scent” a very light and pleasant scent, noticeable when applied, then not a long-lasting and overpowering “scent” that others would be able to smell and ask “what do you have it your hair?”  </li>
            <li>arrived totally new and perfect</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and great packaging.</li>
            <li>I could comb through my hair very easily to ensure that itwas all over.</li>
            <li>And this product smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li>Nice  smell and make my hair looks  much better</li>
            <li>It was much more sleek, and I had nice waves too.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product on the marker.  </li>
            <li>which makes my hair tangle easily!</li>
            <li>I should also mention that I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it, easy to use !,</li>
            <li>and it was very smooth</li>
            <li>This is way much more affordable and works better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of the L&#x27;oreal balms and treatments.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This works better than all of the over priced hair products I used to pay tons of money for.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, just not the price, nor the silicone.</li>
            <li>that the ingredients contain many things people are trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>* leave this on my hair longer, like I might do with a deep-conditioning treatment or a masque (20 or more</li>
            <li>Note that the ingredients contain many things people are trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>* leave this on my hair longer, like I might do with a deep-conditioning treatment or a masque (20 or more minutes).</li>
            <li>Absolutely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say is that it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t take away all the damage, it makes my hair much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so shiny and feels so much better than before .</li>
            <li>None really make me happy.</li>
            <li>So... it&#x27;s a conditioner like most others and unless the effect is cumulative</li>
            <li>If you are a consumer considering this product, please keep it in a safe location.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>; Friend, &amp;#34;Those things never work&amp;#34; I had heard so many times that it wouldn&#x27;t that I started to get nervous ...</li>
            <li>It felt lighter to me and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Love love love, this is what I always use as conditioner.</li>
            <li>Also didn&#x27;t love the</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products to help my hair after it got severly damaged.</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t 100% magic, it felt close to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I tried it because it really helped give me hope again that my hair will continue to get better.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I used it the 1st time today &amp; my hair is silky &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li>My hair has never been better .</li>
            <li>And despite my hair being color treated it has always been healthy until this happened.</li>
            <li>They were more affordable than the ones at the salon</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Immediately, I started getting comments about how silky my hair looked and how healthy it appeared.  </li>
            <li>THAT I LOVE.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU L&#x27;Oreal! :)</li>
            <li>i REALLY Recommend You to buy this, trust me its worth it . :D</li>
            <li>really love this product, it locks moisture to my hair and leaves it shiny and glowing..</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>one of my all time favorite products.</li>
            <li>My hair needed love, and LOT of moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with my hair now.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>so I had decided to try the damage erasing balm and love it.</li>
            <li>This is the best deep conditioner i have ever used</li>
            <li>While CD&#x27;s Monoi Oil Hair Mask was the best deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever used, the $32 price tag was just too steep.</li>
            <li>I love this product, despite the fact that it contains silicone (which some curly &amp; kinky haired friends should note).</li>
            <li>After hearing rave reviews on this product from one of my Youtube subscribtions (who has the more beeeautiful hair), I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>(LOVE IT)</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels BETTER than it did before I changed my hair color.  </li>
            <li>Recommend it for everyone with all hair types :)</li>
            <li>but this stuff is the best deep conditioner/mask I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>To be a rinse after 3-5 minutes treatment, I hoped that my hair would have looked healthy.</li>
            <li>Thanks Seller and Amazon for a great product!others as well as Amazon</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>later, i&#x27;m still really impressed.</li>
            <li>it works better than Kerastase, Wen, and</li>
            <li>My hair is  now more manageable.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than $30 treatments I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li>It repaired my hair, gives it a shine, and it has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>It looks FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>I love this damage erasing balm.</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picking up a couple more bottles of erasing balm because I dont want to be without</li>
            <li>We love this product .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll describe this in categories :)</li>
            <li>Tons of body, no greasy feeling, not limp, swingy gorgeous hair like when I was a teenager!</li>
            <li>Based on the great reviews it normally gets and the price I&#x27;d say go for it</li>
            <li>Smells good and it is not expensive..</li>
            <li>This made my ends noticably softer and healthier, and the smell is pretty good, too.</li>
            <li>It has a really strong smell and although it does seem to condition ok, my hair seemed frizzier when I used it.</li>
            <li>I am VERY IMPRESSED with L’Oreal Total Repair 5 Damage-Erasing Balm – Advanced Hair Care.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon, I was able to find it at Target - very reasonable price, it&#x27;s worth WAYYY more!!</li>
            <li>I already use a good shampoo and an excellent salon conditioner - Redken butter treat, love it -  and my hair was worse after using this product than before.</li>
            <li>the jar is light weight plastic elegant jar arrived fast and smells good</li>
            <li>Since using this I have gotten so many compliments on how shiny and smooth my hair is.</li>
            <li>This product is definately worth it, it has a nice creamy texture that isn&#x27;t sticky or oily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned, strawberry blonde with sensitive skin and after using this product, yes my hair was beautiful!  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job detangling - after a shower, my brush runs right through my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure the Candelilla Wax has something to do with how well this stuff locks in moisture, but I don&#x27;t care - wax it up, baby!</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair isn&#x27;t any softer, and my hair breaks and splits just as easily.</li>
            <li>Holy cow this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>It also found it easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>It has a strong, chemical-like fragrance.</li>
            <li>To be fair it was also extremely soft and more manageable</li>
            <li>It it very creamy and doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell, which i love.</li>
            <li>I have frizzy, fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I use this once or twice a week on my frizzy but fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I put this on after a shampoo and leave it for 20 minutes, it makes a huge difference in the quality of my colored hair - softer, shinier, less frizzy - great stuff!</li>
            <li>and I liked that actually better than the Damage Erasing Balm because it made my hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>Its super nice and thick and smells awesome too!  </li>
            <li>So I picked up this product and after the very first wash, didn&#x27;t have to use mousse at all!</li>
            <li>the smell was very nice and it also live a nice smooth soft shiny on my hair hair using these product my hair feel and looks healthier .........</li>
            <li>HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li>The Seller has described this product accurately.  </li>
            <li>The Seller has described this product accurately.  </li>
            <li>then enjoy the softness and sheen to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this hair balm.  </li>
            <li>also tried the Advanced Haircare Power Moisture Moisture Rush Mask</li>
            <li>This is a great longterm product to put moisture back into hair.</li>
            <li>I used this along with the L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 shampoo and got great results.</li>
            <li>Definately worth $6. :)</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this product can be used as a stand-alone damager eraser product, I have chosen to use it with Garnier Fructis Damager Eraser, as well as my Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this product can be used as a stand-alone damager eraser product, I have chosen to use it with Garnier Fructis Damager Eraser, as well as my Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap as i</li>
            <li>But, the Total Repair 5 added moisture and provided great slip for detangling.</li>
            <li>that is I loved it up until early July.</li>
            <li>The damaged area to the ends are so much softer, and look so much more healthy.</li>
            <li>It left my hair beautifully shiny and full of volume without frizz.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and couldn&#x27;t like it any more!</li>
            <li>Keratase Oleo-Relax most definitely is the better product, but the Total Repair balm is a very good, price-friend substitute.</li>
            <li>It smells great and left my hair feeling much more soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Container is quite user friendly.  </li>
            <li>BUT after the first use, I myself was able to feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a deal, IT WORKS, and it smells so nice too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s maybe not as healthy as it was before the bleaching, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close--smooth, moisturized, and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty healthy already, since I cut off five inches of it a week ago, after attempting to bleach it.</li>
            <li>you might not have a significant change the 1st time like i did, but i would say give it a shot.</li>
            <li>First use it looked way better and lived up to it&#x27;s claims for me.  </li>
            <li>great did wonders for my damaged dry hair</li>
            <li>, i did notice it got rid of my split ends and am happy about that, i just feel it leaves my hair feeling like straw and dry and</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my own hair last night...</li>
            <li>Made my dry damaged hair feel great.</li>
            <li>yeah right!  </li>
            <li>The itching started out pretty mild, but as time went on, it got more and more intense.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product after seeing so many positive reviews but it was just too much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice mask but nothing extraordinary, if you have very dry hair it probably won&#x27;t save the situation but good for normal and fine hair</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this could make the hair feel good but think I get better results with the stuff I have been using for the last 15 years or so.</li>
            <li>They love this product so much.</li>
            <li>I wondered if this could be the true culprit.</li>
            <li>This looked like a good product at the drug store, low price, so I tried it out, and</li>
            <li>This container arrived 3/4 full and was not sealed</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li>Bought this at target much cheaper, but am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I think that the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>It was $6 at Target, not bad at all.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>hair is really dry on the ends, and has lots of split ends, and this product made most of them disappear as well as it looks shinny and feels super nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this package design is great for a salon (where it can sit next to the sink and the lid doesn&#x27;t really need to be seated), but I really wish this product came in a squeeze bottle or hand pump for at-home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 2 uses, my hair looks healthy and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be a super product...</li>
            <li>,it moisture soo much and has a really nice smell ,it also leaves the hair really manegeable</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll die if they discontinue it ever, which most likely they will, because someone always changes or discontinues favorite products, don&#x27;t they??</li>
            <li>No because there are many more conditioners,such as the ones you can buy at the 99 cent stores, which have name brand shampoo and conditioners only for $1.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Barring exceptional circumstances, this one is the one I&#x27;m likely to return to in the future -- the price is right, it&#x27;s readily available, and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>still have some additional deep conditioners in my stash to work through, but I&#x27;m very pleased to have found this one.</li>
            <li>The very first thing she said as soon as she got into my car was &amp;#34;Your</li>
            <li>My hair was softer, less frizz and smelled great.</li>
            <li>I tried using Wen for a time (good at first), but the honeymoon didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>Okay first of all I have dyed and bleached my hair for 3 years straight</li>
            <li>I saw pretty immediate improvement!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product, from the first time I used it I felt the difference, my hair was soft and it was much easier to style it, also it looks healthier</li>
            <li>I repeated this process the next day and the results were even better!  </li>
            <li>My husband even asked if I got my hair done (&amp; that was after the first treatment)!</li>
            <li>Exactly what my hair needed!  </li>
            <li>:) it&#x27;s a good bargain brand to use if you want to nourish dry hair after dyeing it and want hard/sticky to become soft</li>
            <li>I have started a new regime with my hair, not only conditioning, also trying to avoid further damage to my hair based on over-processing, dying, blow-drying, and all the other wonderful things we do to our hair to look our best, although our hair is “actually being over processed at times” we continue to give our hair a thorough treatment of becoming at risk of being damaged from all the products/processes we use as “enhancements” to our hair.  </li>
            <li>quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use it after the total repair shampoo/conditioner, leave on for 3-5 minutes then rinse, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to follow this with my fine hair (</li>
            <li>is that it really does live your hair soft and shiny and it smell very nice</li>
            <li>I can not express how amazing your Total Repair 5 Balm and Oil Spray is!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This us an amazing deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a quality product to help mitigate some of the damage, this really helps remoisturize and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I am a big-time &amp;#34;product hopper&amp;#34; and rarely pass any hair aisle without buying something.</li>
            <li>All in all, I would definetely recommend and is worth the $6.</li>
            <li>and this is worth for every penny.  </li>
            <li>and Wow I love my hair</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner do a good job of making my hair feel very coated and soft (the additives, of course) and with these products, the L&#x27;oreal Total 5 balm performed much better.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s nice to find a treatment that&#x27;s actually in my price</li>
            <li>Worth it alone for that.</li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>hair right now is soft, more manageable, shiny, and uniform in color.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time during the week to do this, so I put some on my hair at night (it dries pretty quick) and slept with it on my hair and washed it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>my hair was dull and dry and I am happy I finally found one that works great!!</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down at all.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower right after my shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I did a Google search and found a link that said that allergic reactions to this product don&#x27;t happen right away.</li>
            <li>After styling from the first application, my hair feels soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I actually do better making my own conditioner so back to that and back to saving money.</li>
            <li>It provides good nourishment without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, and I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>My hair gets kind of crazy in the winter, and this balm has not only exceeded my expectations, but is by far the best hair repair treatment I&#x27;ve tried (and believe me, there have been many).</li>
            <li>It could be doing absolutely nothing to ACTUALLY repair damage, but my hair feels and looks sooo nice after using it that I don&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li>I only bought it last week, but after two washes (I wash my hair every three days) I can already tell a great difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I also use their smoothing serum for my current fly aways, both products I found at my local CVS.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it out, I couldn&#x27;t believe the new texture!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This very easily seems to be only a conditioner and that they just called it something different to just make more money.</li>
            <li>I kept the product on for about 2 hours then washed it out and shampooed with Pantene&#x27;s new Age Defy shampoo (which I love and highly recommend).  </li>
            <li>Not only did it not condition or repair, it appeared to make my hair more dry and more frizzy!  </li>
            <li>I cut my hair short during pregnancy to kind of give it a restart chance to grow fresh and new.  </li>
            <li>After one use, my hair was soft and the color more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I am impressed by how shiny and soft my hair is, My hair is very thick and heavy, but now it feels light and clean, if it smelled better, i would give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li>I think L&#x27;Oreal tried to make their product look different and special by putting it in a jar, but a normal conditioner bottle would have worked much better.</li>
            <li>I was a big fan of WEN, Enjoy and Pureology but no longer!  </li>
            <li>fell in love with Total Repair balm after using a sample that came with a cosmetics order.</li>
            <li>At first I used the shampoo and the balm</li>
            <li>First of all, this is conditioner in a jar.</li>
            <li>My regular conditioner does a better job than this....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like taking your hair back to better days.</li>
            <li>Not only is this a great deep conditioner, it really does help damaged hair.</li>
            <li>, the ends have become brassy and looked like bizarre old outgrowth.  </li>
            <li>and I used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>At that time, here in Boston, it was humid and HOT.</li>
            <li>I think after a few more uses AND a good trim my hair will be back to where it was before the beginning of July.</li>
            <li>have bleached hair with fried ends and this balm just turned it back to shiny and healthy</li>
            <li>I have tried so so so many products, and this is the only one that has truly wowed me.</li>
            <li>and I was left with flowy healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li>I got it yesterday in the mail, used it last night, and this morning, my hair was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the shampoo and conditioner and it has absolutely saved my hair!</li>
            <li>And, this doesn&#x27;t even do a better job than the basic Pureology conditioner I use.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m glad I tried it but will not be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li>have used many different types of hair treatments that I can state</li>
            <li>Then I tried it overnight, wetting my hair first</li>
            <li>My roots were a bit oily probably because it was one of the my no shampoo days, but my ends were still pretty poofy (by the way</li>
            <li>When i woke up my hair will still soft and knot free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had thick, healthy, soft and long hair that had wonderful volume and would hold curl or straighten.  </li>
            <li>My volume is back and so is my healthy shine.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>, then bumps, then ears itching, then face swelling and hot, etc.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li>When I read the reviews my first thought was,</li>
            <li>used this for the first time today and at lunch was greated with, \\&quot;did you just get your hair done?\\</li>
            <li>My hair for the first time in years no longer looks like hay,</li>
            <li>I have been getting blonde highlights and although they look great, my hair has been so brittle and extremely dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this jar right before Christmas and used it for about a week straight.  </li>
            <li>MY HAIR FEELS LIKE NORMAL HAIR AGAIN!!</li>
            <li>Really makes my hair soft, smooth, and silky!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, barely holds a pony-tail holder</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok though ...and a big high 5 to L&#x27;Oreal for making it!</li>
            <li>My hair feels stronger, it&#x27;s actually bouncy, it is very silky and  has a lot more shine.</li>
            <li>I really paid attention to what she did and started to mimic that at home, mostly blow-drying on hot (not warm) and because of this my hair started to feel drier more</li>
            <li>and it was super soft and no knots!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other deep conditioners and while they work decently, my hair feels so much better after using this, and it has a nice smell to it, as well.</li>
            <li>But even after the first time, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I wish the scent was more subtle and the package was more user-friendly, but this stuff works</li>
            <li>My hair has not looked this healthy in a long time!  </li>
            <li>Those parts of my hair that were almost completely dry after towel drying are more moisturized and no longer</li>
            <li>and my hair came out super lite and soft.</li>
            <li>I must say i have tried dozens of products looking for something that will make my dry, brittle, damaged hair look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>so well I will certainly be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t to happy with the shampoo I felt like my hair was very hard</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally coarse, frizzy, and fine.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but after trying the whole line-up, all hope is gone!</li>
            <li>A rather disturbingly large and colorful bruise has since developed.</li>
            <li>it on my hair: For about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;price: reasonable, but kind of a waste considering</li>
            <li>It even works better than some brands that hair salon tries to sell you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 hair line and for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have been using this conditioner for about a month and my hair is so much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have that much damage on my hair as I don&#x27;t dye it or use heat often.</li>
            <li>Conditions damaged hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I really did notice a difference in my hair after one use.  </li>
            <li>and it really helped.</li>
            <li>and this product really helps it feel softer and healthier</li>
            <li>Fast forward to</li>
            <li>I found when I used it for the recommended 5 minutes on the instructions it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I&#x27;ve tried to treat it gingerly and condition it  </li>
            <li>Even my stylist said my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>(my hair is in between curly and straight )</li>
            <li>This really works to give your hair the feel and look of being repaired.</li>
            <li>I oftentimes mix this product with the L&#x27;Oreal Power Moisture Rush Mask, and I&#x27;ve liked the results so much that I now use the entire Total Repair 5 line.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been very damaged since I&#x27;m very indecisive with my hair color and length.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t ready to chop it all off yet.</li>
            <li>As for spit ends, I didn&#x27;t really except it to work miracles...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>This time around it wasn&#x27;t as greasy but it was still too much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried it just in the shower and didn&#x27;t see much results</li>
            <li>This really does moisturize my hair well.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim not expecting much</li>
            <li>Really really like it.  </li>
            <li>really do anything to my split ends as said.</li>
            <li>and we find that our hair is growing much faster.</li>
            <li>it getting that much conditioner in one jar.</li>
            <li>My hair - damaged from color and a daily flat iron - has never felt better!  </li>
            <li>I will be using them more off thin  :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s even better than getting a professional deep condition treatment.</li>
            <li>I used this daily for the first week to jump start hydration, now I leave it on for about an hour a week as a true mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to blow dry my hair on High heat setting.  </li>
            <li>And its just as soft as it was before the faulty curling iron incident!!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, color treated hair that has a tendency to frizz in certain spots.  </li>
            <li>It was soft, easy to comb through, smooth, and a lot less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Lots of other reviewers seem to love it, but I cannot give it my stamp of approval.</li>
            <li>When the package first arrived at my door, I assumed that surely my order had been mixed up and someone had shipped me a brick rather than a simple hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>So first I&#x27;ll start with the fact that I am 26 years old and that I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 14, so you can imagine the damage!</li>
            <li>It was quite easy to apply throughout my hair (which is waist-length, color-treated, and rather dry).</li>
            <li>also wanted to mention that packaging is great and the jar arrived full and new not missing half of it as I saw in other ppl reviews mine</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended for over-processed and very damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is greatttttt product specially when used together with loreal total 5 repair shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is still soft and easy to brush, and I only use mask once a week.</li>
            <li>I have very long over-processed fine hair.</li>
            <li>Then you read the fine print: when used in conjunction with their shampoo, conditioner and dry oil, and as compared to using a non-conditioning shampoo.  </li>
            <li>, I have fine, dry, frizzy, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I am in complete awe after the first use.</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and liked it.</li>
            <li>It was crunchy, more split ends, my head smelled sour for two days, it was terrible!&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t expect a $6 drugstore product to perform the same or better, I&#x27;d at least like it to do more than a</li>
            <li>It was amazing the first time , but in the following weeks it started to weigh my hair down and over moisturize it to the point where I was looking oily and pasty</li>
            <li>, I noticed as soon as I brushed it that it felt more smooth and less tangled!</li>
            <li>The down side to the curling iron being faulty was that my hair was already color treated on top of it.</li>
            <li>I even chopped it off and then my new, much shorter ends started to break.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many deep conditioners , ,,, Ausie 10 min, morracon deep conditioner all kinds</li>
            <li>especially when wet), the container is smooth and easy to drop, and it is hard plastic, so it can crack when dropped (and if you drop it while it is open, a good portion of the contents will spill out).  </li>
            <li>a few months later, this tub of lead apparently slid off of the shelf on my shower (where it has been stationary for quite some time) and the edge of it landed on the nail bed of my great toe.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who colors their hair, or has a lot of damage.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anybody who is struggling with split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works better than All Soft or any other salon product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s curly naturally and flowy, sleek, and smooth when flat ironed...</li>
            <li>But I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to add a little more moisture.</li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>In as little as 5 minutes my hair felt softer, more manageable, moist, and healthier.  </li>
            <li>After using this balm my hair was so much easier to brush through and feels really soft.</li>
            <li>Direct dyes are usually very nourishing to your hair and you can leave them on for hours</li>
            <li>The only con was I found that it left my natural curls with more frizz.</li>
            <li>I will use this a few more times and see how this does.</li>
            <li>* WORTH OF DAMAGE INSTANTLY!</li>
            <li>I use the total repair extreme line and it helped better than most other products.</li>
            <li>My normal routine consisted of a lot of blow drying and scrunching with mousse</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and had very little damage before this (no dye, bleach, straightening, etc)</li>
            <li>I have long hair so use a generous scoop (1/4 cup?), and find that it leaves my hair feeling very soft, clean, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>: Smells exactly like you made a cup of plain tea,  exactly like the smell of a freshly brewed tea bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More was less!</li>
            <li>It was so much smoother, I didn&#x27;t need to flat iron much!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s SO easy to rinse out, and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of greasy residue (normally i have to rinse and re-rinse and stand with my head under the shower for 3 minutes to get all conditioner out, this comes out in less than a</li>
            <li>and I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>I started using a new foundation as well</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t have any reviews to go on since this was a new product</li>
            <li>My hair is almost 3 feet from root to tip, and its hard to find good products that actually repair and keep improving your hair.</li>
            <li>It is silky and went right through my flat iron.......</li>
            <li>It makes their hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Today was the first day I went back to using conditioner</li>
            <li>Soft!</li>
            <li>this morning was my firs time using this product and WOW!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>It seems to act exactly the same as the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I used this last night for the first time and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the damage removal but makes it softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>beware if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s soft, shiny and vibrant and picks up the natural highlights in my hair.</li>
            <li>I think the small bumps were actually tiny hives or an allergic rash of some kind.</li>
            <li>It did not weigh down my hair at all and did not make it greasy or crunchy like most deep conditioners do to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin, straight, virgin hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to grow.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that tends to look as flat as a pancake, and this, though rich, did not weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that i have less breakage on top, all those short flyaway bits seem to have reduced.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this one because I had read somewhere else that a 3-5 minute hair mask wasn&#x27;t strong enough (compared to 15-20 minute hair masks), but I figured with such a low price I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s big and bulky and has a large lid.</li>
            <li>I have a coarse thick very damaged dry hair, and still looking for a good product for my hair.</li>
            <li>hair is platinum blonde, and I have a hard time keeping up with the color and keeping my hair feeling healthy, but this product really helps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft that even if you put rollers over night you will still have straight hair next day!!</li>
            <li>product is clearly made for use in a salon.  </li>
            <li>, well, just so we&#x27;re clear,</li>
            <li>This balm was clearly the cause of my all problems, so it went in the garbage.</li>
            <li>For the price, th L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair really can&#x27;t be beat and it would get 5* from from me</li>
            <li>My husband even said it was extremely soft.</li>
            <li>(I was an early gray bloomer and have been dying my hair since I was 18)..</li>
            <li>Actually I used this product sample initially and after third use only there were no hair falls as well as hairs are growing and split ends becomes much more stronger so that hairs can grow well from ends too.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Just need 3 minutes and Hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li>I use this Balm once a week, and it completely repairs my hair.</li>
            <li>I end up with soft, shiny hair after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a newsflash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and manageable again.</li>
            <li>So I was quite surprised and amazed when this one arrived</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>plus I always straighten and curl my hair like non-stop, and I&#x27;m just a 14 year old.</li>
            <li>my hair&#x27;s texture is anything but soft.</li>
            <li>I just purchase this item last week and I truly have to say it really does work</li>
            <li>and it was really damaged from the last time I dyed it</li>
            <li>My skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and allergy prone.</li>
            <li>I found another review on this site from someone else with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin, I DO NOT recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair so soft and manageable like Joico does but way cheaper....</li>
            <li>Looooved this product, made my hair really soft</li>
            <li>and I need to readjust and tighten bobby pins frequently if I ever wear them.</li>
            <li>and she was surprised.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft and stays untangle even after days of treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair was completely fried.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to use with my Garnier Fructis Damage Eraser Strength Reconstructing Butter (which states when hair needs intense reconstruction to bring back strength, vitality &amp; shine to damaged hair) to help give my hair the reconstruction needed based on over-processed treatments.  </li>
            <li>but my hair was soft.</li>
            <li>Then next day I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference, in the shower I rinsed, then rinsed with apple cider vinegar, then rinsed again.</li>
            <li>Wow, i am amazed at how well this worked for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft</li>
            <li>i noticed my hair was silky an so soft.</li>
            <li>so I bought this on a whim and it has completely restored faith in my hair.  </li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughther is bi-racial.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair soft, silky, shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and I find that it makes your hair grow.</li>
            <li>Applying this to wet hair (not sopping wet) and leaving it in for five minutes made my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have curly, thin, damaged hair and really liked this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately there can be too much of a good thing</li>
            <li>Admittedly it was still very frizzy, but normally when I let my hair air dry it curls and poofs wildly.</li>
            <li>Hair feels softer, has a really nice shine, and I don&#x27;t lose any volume due to heavy residue.  </li>
            <li>Use it a few times and see if there is a significant change...</li>
            <li>Basically I can only blow dry my hair straight with a round brush and call it a day, on top of that I have an oily scalp which inhibits my use of any products like mousse, serums and heat-protectors.</li>
            <li>The container may look small, but I have been using the same container for I think around 2 or more months</li>
            <li>The first week, I didn&#x27;t have any problems, but during the second week, I noticed that my face was itching, especially on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it&#x27;s supposed to be exactly the same ingredients as a kerastase product( same company).</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I did not purchase the conditioner, only the balm) and when I used it for the first time, later that day I went to lunch with a friend.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to the birth of my 1st child and my hormones and the typical after pregnancy lack luster hair was really bothering me.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, if you&#x27;re scouring Amazon trying to find the best hair mask for dry, dull, damaged, frizzy hair (like I did), give this one a shot before you splurge on a pricier option.</li>
            <li>Though I cannot personally justify its claim of repairing 1 year of damage in 1 use, I will say that you definitely notice a positive and noticeable difference after using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine, wavy and greasy at the scalp but dry at the ends due to hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>At first, while my hair was still wet and while I combed it out</li>
            <li>my hair was exactly like it was before, also the container was closed</li>
            <li>I was using dermorganic deep repair masque but it made my hair so sticky and hard that I went out and found this for 4-5 bucks and wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>Pregnancy and a newborn are hard enough and your body goes through so many changes as it is</li>
            <li>While I was at work, I realized I&#x27;d started using this balm around the same time as the new foundation.</li>
            <li>My hair was so dry before having been color treated and abused with heat styling, but this stuff really did correct it as promised.</li>
            <li>Lots of breakage, some really fried sections that snapped off, and just so dry.</li>
            <li>something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has helped my dry ends as much as this has.  </li>
            <li>I have highlights and my hair is normally dry, this really helped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly using 40 volume developer to get my hair the lightest shade possible in order to maintain a snowy-white color, and there are times where my hair feels very brittle and falls out while combing or washing it.</li>
            <li>The last few years I&#x27;ve been a fan of Loreal&#x27;s sulfate free everstrong line</li>
            <li>And a few days later an aunt &amp;#34;your hair looks so healthy what are you doing?&amp;#34; I have long hair</li>
            <li>I noticed a major difference in the conditon of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products from this line now, and they consistently amaze me -- they have a level of performance I&#x27;d expect from a much more expensive product.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair that is damaged, and I have used this multiple times to treat, and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>At night, before bed, I used about a nickel-sized amount, smoothed it into my hair mid-shaft to ends, gently combed it through then tied it into a loose pony tail with an ouchless elastic band and</li>
            <li>This saved me, put it on after shampooing last night, can&#x27;t see any split ends at all, my hair is super soft and bouncy and I just styled and little to no hair</li>
            <li>but I figure what the hell it was on sale plus my hair  was very dry and damage with so much color and bleach</li>
            <li>It was soft and silky, but not flat.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I have tried everything from cheap shampoos and conditioners to expensive $30 cleansing conditioners and have seen dry ends and healthy hair from using my many hair products.</li>
            <li>If your skin is not sensitive, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Ladies ( and gents) if you want healthy hair, I have learned that you should only use heat on it once a week (if any), never blow dry your hair, let it air dry and don&#x27;t comb your hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>but it definitely saved me and now my hair feels soft</li>
            <li>but if your hair is like mine be careful with how much you use.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly long hair and my curls have become much more defined after just one wash</li>
            <li>loved the shampoo and conditioner, so this was disappointing</li>
            <li>At 46 my hair tends to be dry and dull-- this product leaves me with hair that reminds me more of the texture of my 20-something hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was dry and damaged from the Japanese straight perm.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get their dry and brittle hair back to almost like-new condition.</li>
            <li>I use the Total Repair Extreme 5 for a few heating tool split ends and am satisfied with that system.</li>
            <li>Towel dry as normal</li>
            <li>I leave this product in for half an hour wrapped in a shower cap then a hot towel wrapped around that</li>
            <li>I stopped using my flat iron and after TWO uses my ends are 75% fixed and my hair almost feels like it used to.</li>
            <li>It is very fine, thin, and to about the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the items that go along with it including: Shampoo and Total Repair 5 Multi-Restorative Dry Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A few Conditioning treatments I have used in the past have worked ok, but they have weighed my hair down so much that the little bit they helped, wasn&#x27;t worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>Now mind you, I am due for my cut and color next week, so that really says a lot about this product.</li>
            <li>Her hair was breaking pretty badly due to weekly blow drying and flat ironing, so she tried the the L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Line (shampoo, conditioner, erasing balm)  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and is dry and frizzy looking.  </li>
            <li>Her hair was very noticeably shinier and softer, less breakage too.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and frequent dyeing to cover grays makes it dry.</li>
            <li>and i mean NON of them has made my hair so soft and Shinny and silky and pretty</li>
            <li>It felt like a normal condioner and worked like any other conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was noticing my hair getting dry rough what I really like about this product</li>
            <li>After rinsing it and blowing it out, I did notice it was much smoother and the texture seemed much less coarse.</li>
            <li>I have pretty heavy highlights and was flat ironing every day.</li>
            <li>I am a platinum blonde, naturally a very very dark brunette, and after bleaching and toning, this stuff really helps to control the damage my hair is subjected to each month.</li>

            <li> For the price this works wonderful!!</li>
            <li> At this price point, this balm is excellent.</li>
            <li> Moreover, because of these ingredients, the product is probably best used as recommended on the package, that is, use after a shampoo, apply for 3-5 minutes, rinse well.</li>

            <li> This started about a week ago when I decided to wash my hair with apple cider vinegar; I kept reading how it was great for hair</li>
            <li> So happy with the outcome</li>

            <li> My hair has never felt better!!</li>

            <li> I used it before and loved it</li>
            <li> I think this balm will gives good protein as well as fiber to hairs</li>
            <li> I repeated the process, this time leaving the balm in for a good 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, but it did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> The package was not enclosed in a cartoon box, it was sent in a beautifully designed package from Seller, (great marketing plan, I would state), and the L’Oreal Total Repair 5 Damage Eraser Balm was enclosed in another impressive plastic container, beautifully sealed and protected from any damage to the product or through transportation.  </li>

            <li> My hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li> A seriously amazing product.</li>
            <li> It works great and made a huge difference in the condition and texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Which is amazing, because ever since I chopped it off, the ends curl upwards</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it was sitting in my mother in laws house</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m LOVING the results.</li>
            <li> Thanks loreal for these wonderful products</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look great and has really brought my hair into great quality since my hair has been treated with color a lot</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t do my whole head for fear of causing an imbalance but I&#x27;m very happy with the results I have seen.</li>
            <li> He said it was a million times better and asked if he could sleep with his face in my hair because he loved the smell.</li>
            <li> I own the Shampoo, Conditioner, and the repair balm.</li>
            <li> Thanks Seller and Amazon for a great product!</li>
            <li> there are so many good things about this conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this as a mask (followed the directions to a T) but it honestly didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular to it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the “scent” a very light and pleasant scent, noticeable when applied, then not a long-lasting and overpowering “scent” that others would be able to smell and ask “what do you have it your hair?”  </li>
            <li> arrived totally new and perfect</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great packaging.</li>
            <li> I could comb through my hair very easily to ensure that itwas all over.</li>
            <li> And this product smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> Nice  smell and make my hair looks  much better</li>
            <li> It was much more sleek, and I had nice waves too.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product on the marker.  </li>
            <li> which makes my hair tangle easily!</li>
            <li> I should also mention that I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to use !,</li>
            <li> and it was very smooth</li>
            <li> This is way much more affordable and works better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the L&#x27;oreal balms and treatments.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This works better than all of the over priced hair products I used to pay tons of money for.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, just not the price, nor the silicone.</li>
            <li> that the ingredients contain many things people are trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> * leave this on my hair longer, like I might do with a deep-conditioning treatment or a masque (20 or more</li>
            <li> Note that the ingredients contain many things people are trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> * leave this on my hair longer, like I might do with a deep-conditioning treatment or a masque (20 or more minutes).</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say is that it smells great.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t take away all the damage, it makes my hair much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so shiny and feels so much better than before .</li>
            <li> None really make me happy.</li>
            <li> So... it&#x27;s a conditioner like most others and unless the effect is cumulative</li>
            <li> If you are a consumer considering this product, please keep it in a safe location.</li>
            <li> but I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> ; Friend, &amp;#34;Those things never work&amp;#34; I had heard so many times that it wouldn&#x27;t that I started to get nervous ...</li>
            <li> It felt lighter to me and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Love love love, this is what I always use as conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also didn&#x27;t love the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to help my hair after it got severly damaged.</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t 100% magic, it felt close to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I tried it because it really helped give me hope again that my hair will continue to get better.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I used it the 1st time today &amp; my hair is silky &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li> My hair has never been better .</li>
            <li> And despite my hair being color treated it has always been healthy until this happened.</li>
            <li> They were more affordable than the ones at the salon</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Immediately, I started getting comments about how silky my hair looked and how healthy it appeared.  </li>
            <li> THAT I LOVE.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU L&#x27;Oreal! :)</li>
            <li> i REALLY Recommend You to buy this, trust me its worth it . :D</li>
            <li> really love this product, it locks moisture to my hair and leaves it shiny and glowing..</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> one of my all time favorite products.</li>
            <li> My hair needed love, and LOT of moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with my hair now.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> so I had decided to try the damage erasing balm and love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner i have ever used</li>
            <li> While CD&#x27;s Monoi Oil Hair Mask was the best deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever used, the $32 price tag was just too steep.</li>
            <li> I love this product, despite the fact that it contains silicone (which some curly &amp; kinky haired friends should note).</li>
            <li> After hearing rave reviews on this product from one of my Youtube subscribtions (who has the more beeeautiful hair), I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> (LOVE IT)</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels BETTER than it did before I changed my hair color.  </li>
            <li> Recommend it for everyone with all hair types :)</li>
            <li> but this stuff is the best deep conditioner/mask I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> To be a rinse after 3-5 minutes treatment, I hoped that my hair would have looked healthy.</li>
            <li> Thanks Seller and Amazon for a great product!others as well as Amazon</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> later, i&#x27;m still really impressed.</li>
            <li> it works better than Kerastase, Wen, and</li>
            <li> My hair is  now more manageable.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than $30 treatments I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li> It repaired my hair, gives it a shine, and it has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> It looks FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> I love this damage erasing balm.</li>
            <li> After blow drying my hair looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picking up a couple more bottles of erasing balm because I dont want to be without</li>
            <li> We love this product .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll describe this in categories :)</li>
            <li> Tons of body, no greasy feeling, not limp, swingy gorgeous hair like when I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> Based on the great reviews it normally gets and the price I&#x27;d say go for it</li>
            <li> Smells good and it is not expensive..</li>
            <li> This made my ends noticably softer and healthier, and the smell is pretty good, too.</li>
            <li> It has a really strong smell and although it does seem to condition ok, my hair seemed frizzier when I used it.</li>
            <li> I am VERY IMPRESSED with L’Oreal Total Repair 5 Damage-Erasing Balm – Advanced Hair Care.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon, I was able to find it at Target - very reasonable price, it&#x27;s worth WAYYY more!!</li>
            <li> I already use a good shampoo and an excellent salon conditioner - Redken butter treat, love it -  and my hair was worse after using this product than before.</li>
            <li> the jar is light weight plastic elegant jar arrived fast and smells good</li>
            <li> Since using this I have gotten so many compliments on how shiny and smooth my hair is.</li>
            <li> This product is definately worth it, it has a nice creamy texture that isn&#x27;t sticky or oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned, strawberry blonde with sensitive skin and after using this product, yes my hair was beautiful!  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job detangling - after a shower, my brush runs right through my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure the Candelilla Wax has something to do with how well this stuff locks in moisture, but I don&#x27;t care - wax it up, baby!</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair isn&#x27;t any softer, and my hair breaks and splits just as easily.</li>
            <li> Holy cow this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> It also found it easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> It has a strong, chemical-like fragrance.</li>
            <li> To be fair it was also extremely soft and more manageable</li>
            <li> It it very creamy and doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell, which i love.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a week on my frizzy but fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I put this on after a shampoo and leave it for 20 minutes, it makes a huge difference in the quality of my colored hair - softer, shinier, less frizzy - great stuff!</li>
            <li> and I liked that actually better than the Damage Erasing Balm because it made my hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> Its super nice and thick and smells awesome too!  </li>
            <li> So I picked up this product and after the very first wash, didn&#x27;t have to use mousse at all!</li>
            <li> the smell was very nice and it also live a nice smooth soft shiny on my hair hair using these product my hair feel and looks healthier .........</li>
            <li> HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li> The Seller has described this product accurately.  </li>
            <li> The Seller has described this product accurately.  </li>
            <li> then enjoy the softness and sheen to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this hair balm.  </li>
            <li> also tried the Advanced Haircare Power Moisture Moisture Rush Mask</li>
            <li> This is a great longterm product to put moisture back into hair.</li>
            <li> I used this along with the L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 shampoo and got great results.</li>
            <li> Definately worth $6. :)</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this product can be used as a stand-alone damager eraser product, I have chosen to use it with Garnier Fructis Damager Eraser, as well as my Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this product can be used as a stand-alone damager eraser product, I have chosen to use it with Garnier Fructis Damager Eraser, as well as my Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap as i</li>
            <li> But, the Total Repair 5 added moisture and provided great slip for detangling.</li>
            <li> that is I loved it up until early July.</li>
            <li> The damaged area to the ends are so much softer, and look so much more healthy.</li>
            <li> It left my hair beautifully shiny and full of volume without frizz.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and couldn&#x27;t like it any more!</li>
            <li> Keratase Oleo-Relax most definitely is the better product, but the Total Repair balm is a very good, price-friend substitute.</li>
            <li> It smells great and left my hair feeling much more soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Container is quite user friendly.  </li>
            <li> BUT after the first use, I myself was able to feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a deal, IT WORKS, and it smells so nice too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s maybe not as healthy as it was before the bleaching, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close--smooth, moisturized, and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty healthy already, since I cut off five inches of it a week ago, after attempting to bleach it.</li>
            <li> you might not have a significant change the 1st time like i did, but i would say give it a shot.</li>
            <li> First use it looked way better and lived up to it&#x27;s claims for me.  </li>
            <li> great did wonders for my damaged dry hair</li>
            <li> , i did notice it got rid of my split ends and am happy about that, i just feel it leaves my hair feeling like straw and dry and</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my own hair last night...</li>
            <li> Made my dry damaged hair feel great.</li>
            <li> yeah right!  </li>
            <li> The itching started out pretty mild, but as time went on, it got more and more intense.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product after seeing so many positive reviews but it was just too much for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice mask but nothing extraordinary, if you have very dry hair it probably won&#x27;t save the situation but good for normal and fine hair</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this could make the hair feel good but think I get better results with the stuff I have been using for the last 15 years or so.</li>
            <li> They love this product so much.</li>
            <li> I wondered if this could be the true culprit.</li>
            <li> This looked like a good product at the drug store, low price, so I tried it out, and</li>
            <li> This container arrived 3/4 full and was not sealed</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li> Bought this at target much cheaper, but am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I think that the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> It was $6 at Target, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> hair is really dry on the ends, and has lots of split ends, and this product made most of them disappear as well as it looks shinny and feels super nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this package design is great for a salon (where it can sit next to the sink and the lid doesn&#x27;t really need to be seated), but I really wish this product came in a squeeze bottle or hand pump for at-home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 2 uses, my hair looks healthy and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a super product...</li>
            <li> ,it moisture soo much and has a really nice smell ,it also leaves the hair really manegeable</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll die if they discontinue it ever, which most likely they will, because someone always changes or discontinues favorite products, don&#x27;t they??</li>
            <li> No because there are many more conditioners,such as the ones you can buy at the 99 cent stores, which have name brand shampoo and conditioners only for $1.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Barring exceptional circumstances, this one is the one I&#x27;m likely to return to in the future -- the price is right, it&#x27;s readily available, and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> still have some additional deep conditioners in my stash to work through, but I&#x27;m very pleased to have found this one.</li>
            <li> The very first thing she said as soon as she got into my car was &amp;#34;Your</li>
            <li> My hair was softer, less frizz and smelled great.</li>
            <li> I tried using Wen for a time (good at first), but the honeymoon didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> Okay first of all I have dyed and bleached my hair for 3 years straight</li>
            <li> I saw pretty immediate improvement!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product, from the first time I used it I felt the difference, my hair was soft and it was much easier to style it, also it looks healthier</li>
            <li> I repeated this process the next day and the results were even better!  </li>
            <li> My husband even asked if I got my hair done (&amp; that was after the first treatment)!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my hair needed!  </li>
            <li> :) it&#x27;s a good bargain brand to use if you want to nourish dry hair after dyeing it and want hard/sticky to become soft</li>
            <li> I have started a new regime with my hair, not only conditioning, also trying to avoid further damage to my hair based on over-processing, dying, blow-drying, and all the other wonderful things we do to our hair to look our best, although our hair is “actually being over processed at times” we continue to give our hair a thorough treatment of becoming at risk of being damaged from all the products/processes we use as “enhancements” to our hair.  </li>
            <li> quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use it after the total repair shampoo/conditioner, leave on for 3-5 minutes then rinse, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to follow this with my fine hair (</li>
            <li> is that it really does live your hair soft and shiny and it smell very nice</li>
            <li> I can not express how amazing your Total Repair 5 Balm and Oil Spray is!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This us an amazing deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for a quality product to help mitigate some of the damage, this really helps remoisturize and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I am a big-time &amp;#34;product hopper&amp;#34; and rarely pass any hair aisle without buying something.</li>
            <li> All in all, I would definetely recommend and is worth the $6.</li>
            <li> and this is worth for every penny.  </li>
            <li> and Wow I love my hair</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner do a good job of making my hair feel very coated and soft (the additives, of course) and with these products, the L&#x27;oreal Total 5 balm performed much better.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s nice to find a treatment that&#x27;s actually in my price</li>
            <li> Worth it alone for that.</li>
            <li> Totally worth</li>
            <li> hair right now is soft, more manageable, shiny, and uniform in color.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time during the week to do this, so I put some on my hair at night (it dries pretty quick) and slept with it on my hair and washed it in the morning.  </li>
            <li> my hair was dull and dry and I am happy I finally found one that works great!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down at all.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower right after my shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I did a Google search and found a link that said that allergic reactions to this product don&#x27;t happen right away.</li>
            <li> After styling from the first application, my hair feels soft and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I actually do better making my own conditioner so back to that and back to saving money.</li>
            <li> It provides good nourishment without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, and I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> My hair gets kind of crazy in the winter, and this balm has not only exceeded my expectations, but is by far the best hair repair treatment I&#x27;ve tried (and believe me, there have been many).</li>
            <li> It could be doing absolutely nothing to ACTUALLY repair damage, but my hair feels and looks sooo nice after using it that I don&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li> I only bought it last week, but after two washes (I wash my hair every three days) I can already tell a great difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I also use their smoothing serum for my current fly aways, both products I found at my local CVS.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it out, I couldn&#x27;t believe the new texture!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This very easily seems to be only a conditioner and that they just called it something different to just make more money.</li>
            <li> I kept the product on for about 2 hours then washed it out and shampooed with Pantene&#x27;s new Age Defy shampoo (which I love and highly recommend).  </li>
            <li> Not only did it not condition or repair, it appeared to make my hair more dry and more frizzy!  </li>
            <li> I cut my hair short during pregnancy to kind of give it a restart chance to grow fresh and new.  </li>
            <li> After one use, my hair was soft and the color more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I am impressed by how shiny and soft my hair is, My hair is very thick and heavy, but now it feels light and clean, if it smelled better, i would give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> I think L&#x27;Oreal tried to make their product look different and special by putting it in a jar, but a normal conditioner bottle would have worked much better.</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of WEN, Enjoy and Pureology but no longer!  </li>
            <li> fell in love with Total Repair balm after using a sample that came with a cosmetics order.</li>
            <li> At first I used the shampoo and the balm</li>
            <li> First of all, this is conditioner in a jar.</li>
            <li> My regular conditioner does a better job than this....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like taking your hair back to better days.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great deep conditioner, it really does help damaged hair.</li>
            <li> , the ends have become brassy and looked like bizarre old outgrowth.  </li>
            <li> and I used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> At that time, here in Boston, it was humid and HOT.</li>
            <li> I think after a few more uses AND a good trim my hair will be back to where it was before the beginning of July.</li>
            <li> have bleached hair with fried ends and this balm just turned it back to shiny and healthy</li>
            <li> I have tried so so so many products, and this is the only one that has truly wowed me.</li>
            <li> and I was left with flowy healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li> I got it yesterday in the mail, used it last night, and this morning, my hair was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the shampoo and conditioner and it has absolutely saved my hair!</li>
            <li> And, this doesn&#x27;t even do a better job than the basic Pureology conditioner I use.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m glad I tried it but will not be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> have used many different types of hair treatments that I can state</li>
            <li> Then I tried it overnight, wetting my hair first</li>
            <li> My roots were a bit oily probably because it was one of the my no shampoo days, but my ends were still pretty poofy (by the way</li>
            <li> When i woke up my hair will still soft and knot free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick, healthy, soft and long hair that had wonderful volume and would hold curl or straighten.  </li>
            <li> My volume is back and so is my healthy shine.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> , then bumps, then ears itching, then face swelling and hot, etc.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews my first thought was,</li>
            <li> used this for the first time today and at lunch was greated with, \\&quot;did you just get your hair done?\\</li>
            <li> My hair for the first time in years no longer looks like hay,</li>
            <li> I have been getting blonde highlights and although they look great, my hair has been so brittle and extremely dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this jar right before Christmas and used it for about a week straight.  </li>
            <li> MY HAIR FEELS LIKE NORMAL HAIR AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> Really makes my hair soft, smooth, and silky!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, barely holds a pony-tail holder</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok though ...and a big high 5 to L&#x27;Oreal for making it!</li>
            <li> My hair feels stronger, it&#x27;s actually bouncy, it is very silky and  has a lot more shine.</li>
            <li> I really paid attention to what she did and started to mimic that at home, mostly blow-drying on hot (not warm) and because of this my hair started to feel drier more</li>
            <li> and it was super soft and no knots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other deep conditioners and while they work decently, my hair feels so much better after using this, and it has a nice smell to it, as well.</li>
            <li> But even after the first time, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I wish the scent was more subtle and the package was more user-friendly, but this stuff works</li>
            <li> My hair has not looked this healthy in a long time!  </li>
            <li> Those parts of my hair that were almost completely dry after towel drying are more moisturized and no longer</li>
            <li> and my hair came out super lite and soft.</li>
            <li> I must say i have tried dozens of products looking for something that will make my dry, brittle, damaged hair look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> so well I will certainly be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to happy with the shampoo I felt like my hair was very hard</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally coarse, frizzy, and fine.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but after trying the whole line-up, all hope is gone!</li>
            <li> A rather disturbingly large and colorful bruise has since developed.</li>
            <li> it on my hair: For about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;price: reasonable, but kind of a waste considering</li>
            <li> It even works better than some brands that hair salon tries to sell you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 hair line and for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for about a month and my hair is so much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have that much damage on my hair as I don&#x27;t dye it or use heat often.</li>
            <li> Conditions damaged hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I really did notice a difference in my hair after one use.  </li>
            <li> and it really helped.</li>
            <li> and this product really helps it feel softer and healthier</li>
            <li> Fast forward to</li>
            <li> I found when I used it for the recommended 5 minutes on the instructions it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I&#x27;ve tried to treat it gingerly and condition it  </li>
            <li> Even my stylist said my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> (my hair is in between curly and straight )</li>
            <li> This really works to give your hair the feel and look of being repaired.</li>
            <li> I oftentimes mix this product with the L&#x27;Oreal Power Moisture Rush Mask, and I&#x27;ve liked the results so much that I now use the entire Total Repair 5 line.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been very damaged since I&#x27;m very indecisive with my hair color and length.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t ready to chop it all off yet.</li>
            <li> As for spit ends, I didn&#x27;t really except it to work miracles...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> This time around it wasn&#x27;t as greasy but it was still too much for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried it just in the shower and didn&#x27;t see much results</li>
            <li> This really does moisturize my hair well.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim not expecting much</li>
            <li> Really really like it.  </li>
            <li> really do anything to my split ends as said.</li>
            <li> and we find that our hair is growing much faster.</li>
            <li> it getting that much conditioner in one jar.</li>
            <li> My hair - damaged from color and a daily flat iron - has never felt better!  </li>
            <li> I will be using them more off thin  :)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s even better than getting a professional deep condition treatment.</li>
            <li> I used this daily for the first week to jump start hydration, now I leave it on for about an hour a week as a true mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to blow dry my hair on High heat setting.  </li>
            <li> And its just as soft as it was before the faulty curling iron incident!!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, color treated hair that has a tendency to frizz in certain spots.  </li>
            <li> It was soft, easy to comb through, smooth, and a lot less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Lots of other reviewers seem to love it, but I cannot give it my stamp of approval.</li>
            <li> When the package first arrived at my door, I assumed that surely my order had been mixed up and someone had shipped me a brick rather than a simple hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> So first I&#x27;ll start with the fact that I am 26 years old and that I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 14, so you can imagine the damage!</li>
            <li> It was quite easy to apply throughout my hair (which is waist-length, color-treated, and rather dry).</li>
            <li> also wanted to mention that packaging is great and the jar arrived full and new not missing half of it as I saw in other ppl reviews mine</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended for over-processed and very damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is greatttttt product specially when used together with loreal total 5 repair shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is still soft and easy to brush, and I only use mask once a week.</li>
            <li> I have very long over-processed fine hair.</li>
            <li> Then you read the fine print: when used in conjunction with their shampoo, conditioner and dry oil, and as compared to using a non-conditioning shampoo.  </li>
            <li> , I have fine, dry, frizzy, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I am in complete awe after the first use.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and liked it.</li>
            <li> It was crunchy, more split ends, my head smelled sour for two days, it was terrible!&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t expect a $6 drugstore product to perform the same or better, I&#x27;d at least like it to do more than a</li>
            <li> It was amazing the first time , but in the following weeks it started to weigh my hair down and over moisturize it to the point where I was looking oily and pasty</li>
            <li> , I noticed as soon as I brushed it that it felt more smooth and less tangled!</li>
            <li> The down side to the curling iron being faulty was that my hair was already color treated on top of it.</li>
            <li> I even chopped it off and then my new, much shorter ends started to break.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many deep conditioners , ,,, Ausie 10 min, morracon deep conditioner all kinds</li>
            <li> especially when wet), the container is smooth and easy to drop, and it is hard plastic, so it can crack when dropped (and if you drop it while it is open, a good portion of the contents will spill out).  </li>
            <li> a few months later, this tub of lead apparently slid off of the shelf on my shower (where it has been stationary for quite some time) and the edge of it landed on the nail bed of my great toe.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who colors their hair, or has a lot of damage.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anybody who is struggling with split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works better than All Soft or any other salon product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s curly naturally and flowy, sleek, and smooth when flat ironed...</li>
            <li> But I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to add a little more moisture.</li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> In as little as 5 minutes my hair felt softer, more manageable, moist, and healthier.  </li>
            <li> After using this balm my hair was so much easier to brush through and feels really soft.</li>
            <li> Direct dyes are usually very nourishing to your hair and you can leave them on for hours</li>
            <li> The only con was I found that it left my natural curls with more frizz.</li>
            <li> I will use this a few more times and see how this does.</li>
            <li> * WORTH OF DAMAGE INSTANTLY!</li>
            <li> I use the total repair extreme line and it helped better than most other products.</li>
            <li> My normal routine consisted of a lot of blow drying and scrunching with mousse</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and had very little damage before this (no dye, bleach, straightening, etc)</li>
            <li> I have long hair so use a generous scoop (1/4 cup?), and find that it leaves my hair feeling very soft, clean, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> : Smells exactly like you made a cup of plain tea,  exactly like the smell of a freshly brewed tea bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> More was less!</li>
            <li> It was so much smoother, I didn&#x27;t need to flat iron much!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s SO easy to rinse out, and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of greasy residue (normally i have to rinse and re-rinse and stand with my head under the shower for 3 minutes to get all conditioner out, this comes out in less than a</li>
            <li> and I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> I started using a new foundation as well</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t have any reviews to go on since this was a new product</li>
            <li> My hair is almost 3 feet from root to tip, and its hard to find good products that actually repair and keep improving your hair.</li>
            <li> It is silky and went right through my flat iron.......</li>
            <li> It makes their hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Today was the first day I went back to using conditioner</li>
            <li> Soft!</li>
            <li> this morning was my firs time using this product and WOW!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> It seems to act exactly the same as the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used this last night for the first time and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the damage removal but makes it softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> beware if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s soft, shiny and vibrant and picks up the natural highlights in my hair.</li>
            <li> I think the small bumps were actually tiny hives or an allergic rash of some kind.</li>
            <li> It did not weigh down my hair at all and did not make it greasy or crunchy like most deep conditioners do to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, straight, virgin hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to grow.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that tends to look as flat as a pancake, and this, though rich, did not weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that i have less breakage on top, all those short flyaway bits seem to have reduced.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this one because I had read somewhere else that a 3-5 minute hair mask wasn&#x27;t strong enough (compared to 15-20 minute hair masks), but I figured with such a low price I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s big and bulky and has a large lid.</li>
            <li> I have a coarse thick very damaged dry hair, and still looking for a good product for my hair.</li>
            <li> hair is platinum blonde, and I have a hard time keeping up with the color and keeping my hair feeling healthy, but this product really helps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft that even if you put rollers over night you will still have straight hair next day!!</li>
            <li> product is clearly made for use in a salon.  </li>
            <li> , well, just so we&#x27;re clear,</li>
            <li> This balm was clearly the cause of my all problems, so it went in the garbage.</li>
            <li> For the price, th L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair really can&#x27;t be beat and it would get 5* from from me</li>
            <li> My husband even said it was extremely soft.</li>
            <li> (I was an early gray bloomer and have been dying my hair since I was 18)..</li>
            <li> Actually I used this product sample initially and after third use only there were no hair falls as well as hairs are growing and split ends becomes much more stronger so that hairs can grow well from ends too.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Just need 3 minutes and Hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li> I use this Balm once a week, and it completely repairs my hair.</li>
            <li> I end up with soft, shiny hair after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a newsflash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and manageable again.</li>
            <li> So I was quite surprised and amazed when this one arrived</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li> plus I always straighten and curl my hair like non-stop, and I&#x27;m just a 14 year old.</li>
            <li> my hair&#x27;s texture is anything but soft.</li>
            <li> I just purchase this item last week and I truly have to say it really does work</li>
            <li> and it was really damaged from the last time I dyed it</li>
            <li> My skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and allergy prone.</li>
            <li> I found another review on this site from someone else with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin, I DO NOT recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair so soft and manageable like Joico does but way cheaper....</li>
            <li> Looooved this product, made my hair really soft</li>
            <li> and I need to readjust and tighten bobby pins frequently if I ever wear them.</li>
            <li> and she was surprised.</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft and stays untangle even after days of treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair was completely fried.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use with my Garnier Fructis Damage Eraser Strength Reconstructing Butter (which states when hair needs intense reconstruction to bring back strength, vitality &amp; shine to damaged hair) to help give my hair the reconstruction needed based on over-processed treatments.  </li>
            <li> but my hair was soft.</li>
            <li> Then next day I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference, in the shower I rinsed, then rinsed with apple cider vinegar, then rinsed again.</li>
            <li> Wow, i am amazed at how well this worked for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft</li>
            <li> i noticed my hair was silky an so soft.</li>
            <li> so I bought this on a whim and it has completely restored faith in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughther is bi-racial.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair soft, silky, shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and I find that it makes your hair grow.</li>
            <li> Applying this to wet hair (not sopping wet) and leaving it in for five minutes made my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have curly, thin, damaged hair and really liked this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately there can be too much of a good thing</li>
            <li> Admittedly it was still very frizzy, but normally when I let my hair air dry it curls and poofs wildly.</li>
            <li> Hair feels softer, has a really nice shine, and I don&#x27;t lose any volume due to heavy residue.  </li>
            <li> Use it a few times and see if there is a significant change...</li>
            <li> Basically I can only blow dry my hair straight with a round brush and call it a day, on top of that I have an oily scalp which inhibits my use of any products like mousse, serums and heat-protectors.</li>
            <li> The container may look small, but I have been using the same container for I think around 2 or more months</li>
            <li> The first week, I didn&#x27;t have any problems, but during the second week, I noticed that my face was itching, especially on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s supposed to be exactly the same ingredients as a kerastase product( same company).</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I did not purchase the conditioner, only the balm) and when I used it for the first time, later that day I went to lunch with a friend.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to the birth of my 1st child and my hormones and the typical after pregnancy lack luster hair was really bothering me.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;re scouring Amazon trying to find the best hair mask for dry, dull, damaged, frizzy hair (like I did), give this one a shot before you splurge on a pricier option.</li>
            <li> Though I cannot personally justify its claim of repairing 1 year of damage in 1 use, I will say that you definitely notice a positive and noticeable difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine, wavy and greasy at the scalp but dry at the ends due to hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> At first, while my hair was still wet and while I combed it out</li>
            <li> my hair was exactly like it was before, also the container was closed</li>
            <li> I was using dermorganic deep repair masque but it made my hair so sticky and hard that I went out and found this for 4-5 bucks and wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> Pregnancy and a newborn are hard enough and your body goes through so many changes as it is</li>
            <li> While I was at work, I realized I&#x27;d started using this balm around the same time as the new foundation.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry before having been color treated and abused with heat styling, but this stuff really did correct it as promised.</li>
            <li> Lots of breakage, some really fried sections that snapped off, and just so dry.</li>
            <li> something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has helped my dry ends as much as this has.  </li>
            <li> I have highlights and my hair is normally dry, this really helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly using 40 volume developer to get my hair the lightest shade possible in order to maintain a snowy-white color, and there are times where my hair feels very brittle and falls out while combing or washing it.</li>
            <li> The last few years I&#x27;ve been a fan of Loreal&#x27;s sulfate free everstrong line</li>
            <li> And a few days later an aunt &amp;#34;your hair looks so healthy what are you doing?&amp;#34; I have long hair</li>
            <li> I noticed a major difference in the conditon of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products from this line now, and they consistently amaze me -- they have a level of performance I&#x27;d expect from a much more expensive product.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that is damaged, and I have used this multiple times to treat, and it works nicely.</li>
            <li> At night, before bed, I used about a nickel-sized amount, smoothed it into my hair mid-shaft to ends, gently combed it through then tied it into a loose pony tail with an ouchless elastic band and</li>
            <li> This saved me, put it on after shampooing last night, can&#x27;t see any split ends at all, my hair is super soft and bouncy and I just styled and little to no hair</li>
            <li> but I figure what the hell it was on sale plus my hair  was very dry and damage with so much color and bleach</li>
            <li> It was soft and silky, but not flat.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have tried everything from cheap shampoos and conditioners to expensive $30 cleansing conditioners and have seen dry ends and healthy hair from using my many hair products.</li>
            <li> If your skin is not sensitive, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ladies ( and gents) if you want healthy hair, I have learned that you should only use heat on it once a week (if any), never blow dry your hair, let it air dry and don&#x27;t comb your hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> but it definitely saved me and now my hair feels soft</li>
            <li> but if your hair is like mine be careful with how much you use.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly long hair and my curls have become much more defined after just one wash</li>
            <li> loved the shampoo and conditioner, so this was disappointing</li>
            <li> At 46 my hair tends to be dry and dull-- this product leaves me with hair that reminds me more of the texture of my 20-something hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry and damaged from the Japanese straight perm.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get their dry and brittle hair back to almost like-new condition.</li>
            <li> I use the Total Repair Extreme 5 for a few heating tool split ends and am satisfied with that system.</li>
            <li> Towel dry as normal</li>
            <li> I leave this product in for half an hour wrapped in a shower cap then a hot towel wrapped around that</li>
            <li> I stopped using my flat iron and after TWO uses my ends are 75% fixed and my hair almost feels like it used to.</li>
            <li> It is very fine, thin, and to about the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and the items that go along with it including: Shampoo and Total Repair 5 Multi-Restorative Dry Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A few Conditioning treatments I have used in the past have worked ok, but they have weighed my hair down so much that the little bit they helped, wasn&#x27;t worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> Now mind you, I am due for my cut and color next week, so that really says a lot about this product.</li>
            <li> Her hair was breaking pretty badly due to weekly blow drying and flat ironing, so she tried the the L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Line (shampoo, conditioner, erasing balm)  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and is dry and frizzy looking.  </li>
            <li> Her hair was very noticeably shinier and softer, less breakage too.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and frequent dyeing to cover grays makes it dry.</li>
            <li> and i mean NON of them has made my hair so soft and Shinny and silky and pretty</li>
            <li> It felt like a normal condioner and worked like any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was noticing my hair getting dry rough what I really like about this product</li>
            <li> After rinsing it and blowing it out, I did notice it was much smoother and the texture seemed much less coarse.</li>
            <li> I have pretty heavy highlights and was flat ironing every day.</li>
            <li> I am a platinum blonde, naturally a very very dark brunette, and after bleaching and toning, this stuff really helps to control the damage my hair is subjected to each month.</li>
            <li> I have super thick long hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick but fine, and although I only used a hair dryer daily, no straighteners or curling irons, it was really dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> I was completely heart broken to find myself past the 3 months post partum period where you experience the most hair loss and to still have thick, full hair but for it to be dry and just look mousy in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I normally do not use conditioner because it weighs my hair down too much ( even the ones for fine,thin hair).  </li>
            <li> I let my hair dry 90% naturally, blew it dry</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t notice that I had changed products but he commented the other night on the glossy/sheen of my hair and how soft and silky it was.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair was starting to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to my flat iron........</li>
            <li> Every time she washes, blow drys, flat irons her hair, she looks like she just got back from the salon.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, so in just the past year I&#x27;ve gotten it my hair to feel some what healthy again, but still it was just really dull all of the time.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse, damaged, over-processed from relaxers, coloring and hot styling tools.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or cause it to become crispy and &#x27;poofy&#x27; and fly away as bad conditioners sometimes do</li>
            <li> Silky, vibrant, manageable, weigh less brakage!</li>
            <li> A couple of things to note is that  am Black American and I have natural hair that I do straigthen.</li>
            <li> I used this with the total repair shampoo and then the dry hair oil from the same line!</li>
            <li> , I had to go back to my regular conditioner and blow dry my hair all over again.</li>
            <li> used it again the next night, shampooing and conditioning the next day, then let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I always wear it straight though, and I usually buy conditioner 4 times the price of this.</li>
            <li> I left it on my hair all night long, and when I woke up and rinsed it out, it felt like another person&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> and then flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow it out as long as I can, and before it only grew maybe 3-4 inches a year.</li>
            <li> For starters I am mixed with half African American while the rest is Native American and English.</li>
            <li> By that point my hair was breaking off and was dry and frizzy and my curls were almost completely gone due to the damage.</li>
            <li> Only down fall is that the actual condition from this line is the same in this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is a masque so treat it as such and give it time to work and don&#x27;t let it dry out on your hair</li>
            <li> so it left it dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> The product states “repairs up to 1 year of damage use – deeply repairs and reconstructs dry chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I went heatless 11 weeks and one day ago and started using the entire product line (aside from the dry oil)</li>
            <li> It has started to feel so dry and constantly breaking.</li>
            <li> I simply do not have the capacity to fathom why this product insists on arriving in a tub that weighs a ton, rather than a tube like literally every single one of its competitors.</li>
            <li> it has a large screw lid, which is hard to seat (</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is some silicone and alcohol in the product, although not as much as in many other products.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch back to any other deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> I color, highlight, blow dry, flat iron AND curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and use my flat iron to curl my hair every day........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just ok...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of some of the ingredients, as I try to use alcohol/silicone/sulfate (et cetera) free products but figured why not.</li>
            <li> and it turned my awful hair into soft, very resilient hair and took most of the split ends away.</li>
            <li> My hair has a long history...from coloring to styling.  </li>
            <li> I had been hesitant to cut my long locks.</li>
            <li> my hair is almost three feet long and has damaged ends from highlights.</li>
            <li> My hair was always my pride and joy and then it broke off very badly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because lately my hair has become very brittle, damaged, and dry.</li>
            <li> I use heat protection and deep condition regularly, but my hair was just so damamged from a previous color/bleach mishap.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my long, dry, frizzy hair in hopes that it would help repair all of the straightening I put it through over the years</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine, thin, frizzy and is cut a few inches below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> It is totally unlike the other conditioner.  </li>
            <li> only if you buy these twenty other products as well.&amp;#34; Anyway, so I&amp;#34;m about to move on when I see this jar of erasing balm, I still don&#x27;t know what possessed me to pick it up</li>
            <li> After the second was though, other people began to notice.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged by a faulty curling iron (had to even send it back to the company to get it tested, my money refunded etc).</li>
            <li> (I only condition every other day).</li>
            <li> Since I only use this at night and in such small amounts I suspect this could easily last me a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 and numerous other conditioning treatments i&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Condition it left my hair: Soft,but so would any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> The next time I used it I was very careful to just use it sparingly and through the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this because my hair is always so dry</li>
            <li> My hair is oily but it starts to get dry on the ends, breaks off and</li>
            <li> I rinsed it out - blew dry it</li>
            <li> I checked with my stylist and she said that was because my hair was DRY........</li>
            <li> Then it was time to blow dry my hair...... and while blow drying</li>
            <li> I have dry hair an</li>
            <li> leave-in spray, my hair has had issues with dry ends that tangle and split and split and split.  </li>
            <li> My hair use to be so dry from all the coloring and the heat from styling.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair</li>
            <li> I had REALLY dry hair</li>
            <li> I recently went blonde and had dyed my hair quite a few times before</li>
            <li> (my hair comes down past the middle of my back, and I generally use it on the hair below my shoulders)</li>
            <li> I having very dry damaged bleached long hair and this product saved my hair!</li>
            <li> Hair is unbelievable soft.</li>
            <li> I also developed 5 or 6 small, raised bumps.</li>
            <li> I have dry dyed processed hair!</li>
            <li> It was less frizzy and even softer on the second day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted a hair treatment since my hair started to feel dry and look a little frizzy only a couple weeks after my trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is basically loose curls and is somewhat thick.</li>
            <li> I wash, blow dry and flat iron my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> It did completely rinse out without leaving any residue (at least, nothing that I could</li>
            <li> I use it daily as my everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a product junky and have spent a ton of money on salaon products.</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking off every time I brushed it, and I stopped trying to work with it, and just started tucking it up everyday.  </li>
            <li> I immediately washed or wet ( i didn&#x27;t need shampoo) and put in the goods.</li>
            <li> This says that it helps hair that &#x27;looks like straw&#x27;: but it does nothing to my hair that a basic everyday conditioner can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> so I expected my hair to fix itself.</li>
            <li> Even when my hair was wet I could tell that my hair felt softer.</li>
            <li> No more dry brittle ends, no more singed bangs (yep - they were so dry they would actually singe at the ends from my flat iron), and now... when I brush my hair, dry ends aren&#x27;t breaking off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally blonde but at age 57, my blonde color is getting a little lighter with a small amount of gray.</li>
            <li> Just after one use my hair was noticeably less dry and didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;mushy\\&quot; when wet.</li>
            <li> started to see results after about three days, my hair was less frizzy and dry where I treated it</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed, I expected more from this product based on the hype.</li>
            <li> After using the expensive stuff that did absolutely nothing for my hair, I can&#x27;t believe the answer to my locks&#x27; troubles cost me less than ten dollars.</li>
            <li> At least it is a major improvement.</li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been under major stress lately, so I thought maybe my skin was freaking out from that.</li>
            <li> , frizzy, dry, it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> After my hair dried, I realized it was rough and dry.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse dry damaged hair BTW</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I also am not using other products in the line due to the use of silicone ingredients.</li>
            <li> I also use it about once every other shampoo, and you&#x27;d never tell my hair was damaged by the bleaching at all.</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t come this empty!</li>
            <li> I used with the same brand shampoo and conditioner and I am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> MY hair, which extends past my cleavage, gets big in humidity making it 10x hotter.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the sheer mass of foamy bubbles and then realized it&#x27;s that way because of additives that my usual shampoo does not have.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with the above mentioned and was not satisfied at all.   </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day using the shampoo and conditioner and every couple of washes I&#x27;ll switch the conditioner with the Balm.  </li>
            <li> like I said you can use any other conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair down to my lower back.</li>
            <li> I am constantly lightening my hair, and that can make it extremely rough and hard to style.  </li>
            <li> My ends are especially dry</li>
            <li> I kept the product away from my roots hoping not to have completely flat lifeless hair (like in the past).  </li>
            <li> BUT now the last few times I used it, its left my hair hard and straw-like!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update later about the quality of the product, but the quantity sucks.</li>
            <li> I would put tons of argan oil on my hair in the morning to make it shiny, but it would wear off my the end of the day, when usually it would make my hair greasy looking after a long day.</li>
            <li> This does not improve my hair at all and paying shipping is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with my hair.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick which I actually like a lot because it wasn&#x27;t dripping everywhere</li>
            <li> left this on for at least an hour and a half under a shower cap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> also, it does not leave residue, weigh down your hair, or cause breakouts or irritation.</li>
            <li> Does not weight down hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it oily.</li>
            <li> My hair became brittle and my ends looked like little branches due to me over ombré-ing my hair, using boxed color and using a curling iron 3x a week.</li>
            <li> I have used these products 3 times in the last few weeks, and my hair feels awsome!!</li>
            <li> I bought 4 jars before other people discovered it by using a sample like I did!</li>
            <li> This product made it silky, my split ends less noticeable, and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> With all other conditioners, I could tell little to little to no difference even if leave it on for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for less than $6.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH LESS FRIZZ.</li>
            <li> my hair was soft and smooth and shiny, with much less frizz (even though we&#x27;ve been having some awful winter weather</li>
            <li> but maybe it was less oz than this one.  </li>
            <li> It is truly an amazing product and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My hair was flat, oily looking, felt waxy, heavy, dull with a matte appearance  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a mess.</li>
            <li> Then ends were crunchy and really hard to blow dry.</li>
            <li> it was dry, dull, and so tangle-prone</li>
            <li> but it looked used because it was missing almost half of the product.</li>
            <li> I took it off because it started to irritate my scalp and make it itch, which was weird, but my scalp is probably very sensitive after the bleaching.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made to be used in the shower, but the lid makes it a little tricky to use.</li>
            <li> My go-to repair balm is Pureology---at $50 for a little jar.</li>
            <li> As I applied a little of this product to my hair, I could feel the product processing and working through my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> and my shoulders were always covered in little purple ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week in conjunction with the matching shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product as my hair needs repair badly from dyes and flat irons.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down at all!</li>
            <li> I use Oleo-Relax when I want a &amp;#34;good hair day,&amp;#34; but at about 50-bucks a tub that can&#x27;t be everyday.</li>
            <li> For home use, this means putting it in your hair while in the shower, leaving it in a few minutes, then rinsing it out.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few times a week for two weeks just to give it the benefit of the doubt, but nothing about my hair changed.</li>
            <li> Maybe this needs to be used a few times to see some sort of difference.</li>
            <li> So I was at Target a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too heavy after use like some treatments seem to.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so heavy, I&#x27;ve begun using it in conjunction with Lee Stafford&#x27;s Hair Growth Treatment (just on the scalp), and sometimes mix in with Garnier Triple Nutrition</li>
            <li> After I dried my hair, my hair was SO SILKY without any additional product...</li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair and</li>
            <li> After i dried and straightened my hair (eek i know heat is harmful, but i cant stop)</li>
            <li> I must have spent at least twenty minutes browsing the wall of hair products, trying to decide which &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> product I should buy in one of my last resorts to save my poor</li>
            <li> dried it</li>
            <li> Power Moisture dried out my hair and it became matted.</li>
            <li> and I think it works just as well at half the cost!</li>
            <li> product smells exactly like a hair salon (which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad smell), but I do feel a little self-conscious walking around smelling</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is usually incredibly dry, and after all the processing - my hair was in BAD shape.  </li>
            <li> Parts of my hair - front, ends, and behind my ears -  were also fuzzy and almost completely dry after washing and putting it up in a towel for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many products over the years (some expensive ones) that have been disappointing to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair duller and limp, not liek my usual products that i usually use.</li>
            <li> my hair is awful, over processed, fried, blonde, with a naturally absurd wavy texture that causes it to poof out like a giant yield sign - i had major doubts about this product because of the low price point, but i decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t the only one who was skeptical though, my Mother, who was with me at the time</li>
            <li> When I do, it&#x27;s usually just one pimple.</li>
            <li> But this was a small cluster.</li>
            <li> The itching stopped and the small, raised bumps on my forehead went away.</li>
            <li> in the morning I did my routine as usual.</li>
            <li> I probably went overboard and applied it all over my head and through the strands.</li>
            <li> Usually when i sleep on my hair it gets so knotty by the morning.</li>
            <li> &quot; so it usually air dries.</li>
            <li> If you are a representative for L&#x27;Oreal, please consider a less dangerous vessel for your product in the future.</li>
            <li> Basically not any real issues unless there was awful humidity outside.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for at least 30 min</li>
            <li> I would look down in the sink or wherever I was and there would be broken pieces of hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to salvage my hair after a combination of heat damage, hard water, and silicone-based products eventually took their toll.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say whether or not I can recommend this too anyone else.</li>
            <li> Once done my hair was so hard</li>
            <li> &quot; I don&#x27;t know about a year, but in the last six months, I&#x27;ve demolished my hair to the point where I was considering cutting it off.</li>
            <li> The package for this product is probably the least shower-friendly package for a hair care product I have seen-</li>
            <li> it looked like straw lately an that had to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s insanely thick and wavy--kind of curly and always frizzy.</li>
            <li> It makes wet hair very slick - it&#x27;s difficult to wash out of hair and wash off of skin.</li>
            <li> It was so bad I could no longer run my fingers through my hair and if I did there would be MAJOR breakage.</li>
            <li> Crispy, broken, dry &amp; with a weird residue.</li>
            <li> No more fly-aways or broken ends sticking out.</li>
            <li> product is thick like a custard, and because of the jar size it&#x27;s hard to juggle the lid and a palmful of product as you try to replace the lid in the shower!</li>
            <li> and I was seriously amazed.  </li>
            <li> then my hair dried... and ta da, it&#x27;s still dry :(  </li>
            <li> As for the smell, it&#x27;s not particularly pleasant</li>
            <li> I have badly damaged long hair from bleaching and dying it.</li>
            <li> Definitely, you would not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Definitely, you would not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I just am not happy.</li>
            <li> my hair is now is worse condition than I started with.</li>
            <li> It was frustrating.</li>
            <li> I had about 5 layers of henna in my hair and after getting tired of the color I had to bleach it out.</li>
            <li> This is seriously a miracle balm and spray!</li>
            <li> Not really :(  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to apply as is very thick and pasty.  </li>
            <li> however it dried my hair out really badly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dry dull hair for as long as I can remember, from product and treatment and dyes and peroxides and bleaches, and worst of all, bad shampoos and conditioners!</li>
            <li> I have thick naturaly curly, impossible to brush through hair.</li>
            <li> No more breakage!!!</li>
            <li> I can say that I am not impressed</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve always been extremely skeptical of hair products that claim to repair damage.</li>
            <li> You know that freaky weird consequence of menopause where your hormones shift and your hair turns to straw?</li>
            <li> This is a lower-cost product that works like an expensive one.  </li>
            <li> I bleached my hair twice, and my hair was NOT happy!</li>
            <li> Needless to say it was a ponytail week.</li>
            <li> though so I&#x27;m not that selfish.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> To the point where you&#x27;re afraid to let anyone touch it &#x27;cause you feel like the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was still so desperate for the locks I used to have.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the erasing balms fault or not, but my hair is falling out like crazy.</li>
            <li> Awkward.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cure all, it does not exist anywhere, with the exception of never using heat or chemicals on your hair ever again and cutting off all the damage.</li>
            <li> somehow my hair would always be greasy or poofy or crazy but this product did wonders taming it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product itself isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I had a baby four months ago, and I do believe this was nearly as painful.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> so I was a bit disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately just so greasy it looked horrible.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked!</li>
            <li> I used this after a very bad run in with bleach.</li>
            <li> Having a bad hair day then this is your savior !!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this mask just once, I&#x27;ve seen an insane improvement in the texture of my hair!</li>
            <li> The gray has a horrible texture!</li>

            <li> It is totally unlike the other conditioner.  With all other conditioners, I could tell little to little to no difference even if leave it on for 5 minutes.  But with this one from Loreal, I can actually feel the difference.  It even works better than some brands that hair salon tries to sell you.  This is way much more affordable and works better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been spending double digit $$ on name brand hair conditioners, you should give this a try.</li>
            <li> For the price this works wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the L&#x27;oreal balms and treatments. Though I cannot personally justify its claim of repairing 1 year of damage in 1 use, I will say that you definitely notice a positive and noticeable difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and frequent dyeing to cover grays makes it dry. I have tried everything out there. This even beats the It&#x27;s a 10 hair line and for much cheaper. A little goes a long way! I use it daily as my everyday conditioner. Love it. I buy out the entire stock when I&#x27;m in the store.</li>
            <li> I have thick naturaly curly, impossible to brush through hair. This works better than all of the over priced hair products I used to pay tons of money for.  I was a big fan of WEN, Enjoy and Pureology but no longer!  This product worked just as well with the same results so now I am switching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to salvage my hair after a combination of heat damage, hard water, and silicone-based products eventually took their toll. I have tried a lot of products, and I had settled on using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Keratase Oleo-Relax, in spite of some silicone in the product. I use Oleo-Relax when I want a &amp;#34;good hair day,&amp;#34; but at about 50-bucks a tub that can&#x27;t be everyday. I love the product, just not the price, nor the silicone. In addition, the effects of the Oleo-Relax treatment don&#x27;t last from shampoo to shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair Balm ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with Total Repair balm after using a sample that came with a cosmetics order. After the next shampoo, I still could tell that the balm had made a difference. I immediately set out to find it, and I purchased it at a bricks-n-mortar store at an excellent price, a price much better than available here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total Repair balm calms the frizzies, reduces volume, and creates manageability ... with only 3-5 minutes on the hair! At this price point, this balm is excellent. Unfortunately, there is some silicone and alcohol in the product, although not as much as in many other products. I am using it in spite of those ingredients, but I don&#x27;t use it as often as I would like to ... which would be every time I shampoo my hair. I also am not using other products in the line due to the use of silicone ingredients. But this balm ... I&#x27;m making an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try. Keratase Oleo-Relax most definitely is the better product, but the Total Repair balm is a very good, price-friend substitute. For the price, th L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair really can&#x27;t be beat and it would get 5* from from me it was not for the silicone in ingredients. So, it&#x27;s getting 3* instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM-LINE: The recommended treatment time is 3-5 minutes FOR A REASON. Use cautiously and infrequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Here are the ingredients on my tub ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AQUA / WATER / EAU * CETEARYL ALCOHOL * BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE * AMODIMETHICONE * CANDELILLA CERA / CANDELILLA WAX / CIRE DE CANDELILLA * CETYL ESTERS * GLYCERIN * ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL * PARFUM / FRAGRANCE * PHENOXYETHANOL * TRIDECETH-6 * HYDROXYPROPYL GUAR * ARGININE * GLUTAMIC ACID * LINALOOL * HEXYL CINNAMAL * CETRIMONIUM CHLORIDE * SERINE * CHLORHEXIDINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE * BENZYL SALICYLATE * HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN * BENZYL ALCOHOL * LIMONENE * AMYL CINNAMAL * CITRONELLOL * 2-OLEAMIDO-1,3-OCTADECANEDIOL * ALPHA-ISOMETHYL IONONE * CI 19140 / YELLOW 5 * CI 15985 / YELLOW 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the ingredients contain many things people are trying to avoid.

Because of the ingredients, I would *not* leave this on my hair longer, like I might do with a deep-conditioning treatment or a masque (20 or more minutes).HICONE * CANDELILLA CERA / CANDELILLA WAX / CIRE DE CANDELILLA * CETYL ESTERS * GLYCERIN * ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL * PARFUM / FRAGRANCE * PHENOXYETHANOL * TRIDECETH-6 * HYDROXYPROPYL GUAR * ARGININE * GLUTAMIC ACID * LINALOOL * HEXYL CINNAMAL * CETRIMONIUM CHLORIDE * SERINE * CHLORHEXIDINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE * BENZYL SALICYLATE * HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN * BENZYL ALCOHOL * LIMONENE * AMYL CINNAMAL * CITRONELLOL * 2-OLEAMIDO-1,3-OCTADECANEDIOL * ALPHA-ISOMETHYL IONONE * CI 19140 / YELLOW 5 * CI 15985 / YELLOW 6  Note that the ingredients contain many things people are trying to avoid.

            <li> I have frizzy, fine curly hair. A lot of it. I always wear it straight though, and I usually buy conditioner 4 times the price of this. This stuff works just as well. Amazing for the price. The only con was I found that it left my natural curls with more frizz. Not a problem for me though because I straighten it. I have been using this conditioner for about a month and my hair is so much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim. I&#x27;m a sucker for words like, \\&quot;repairs a year&#x27;s worth of damage in one treatment.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t know about a year, but in the last six months, I&#x27;ve demolished my hair to the point where I was considering cutting it off. So it definitely has helped repair six months of damage. I used it once in place of my regular conditioner. I was so amazed, the next time I left it in for an hour with a shower cap over my hair for deep conditioning. I use it about once a week now. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. Try it!</li>
            <li> I picked this up because I needed something to stave off the horrors of winter hair and to try to repair the damage I&#x27;ve already got. It was cheap, and I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and it&#x27;s really improved the texture and glossiness of my hair, as well as mending/preventing split ends. My hair gets kind of crazy in the winter, and this balm has not only exceeded my expectations, but is by far the best hair repair treatment I&#x27;ve tried (and believe me, there have been many). And it&#x27;s available at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on the ends of my hair  (my hair comes down past the middle of my back, and I generally use it on the hair below my shoulders) every time I shower, and on all my hair 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I used it before and loved it and I&#x27;m using it again. it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I am a platinum blonde, naturally a very very dark brunette, and after bleaching and toning, this stuff really helps to control the damage my hair is subjected to each month. I also use it about once every other shampoo, and you&#x27;d never tell my hair was damaged by the bleaching at all. Great value and good results</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!! I usually leave it on for at least 30 min and then I washed it out. Hair is unbelievable soft. It&#x27;s so soft that even if you put rollers over night you will still have straight hair next day!! It doesn&#x27;t stay!! It also smell great and it smells on your hair for 2 days. Absolutely amazing. Will buy it again. Definitely better than bunch expensive masks out there.</li>
            <li> I have had color in my hair for years. After one use, my hair was soft and the color more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in the mail. And after one use, I&#x27;m very pleased! I don&#x27;t really have that much damage on my hair as I don&#x27;t dye it or use heat often. But my hair is noticeably softer! It was less frizzy and even softer on the second day. My husband even said it was extremely soft. And this product smells pretty good too! Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied.  Conditions damaged hair very well.  Container is quite user friendly.  I would recommend this product to any woman with damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo Powers Baragona</li>
            <li> I used it once and didn&#x27;t care for it.  Maybe I should give it another chance, but I did not notice any difference in my hair.  The only good thing I can say is that it smells great.  Lots of other reviewers seem to love it, but I cannot give it my stamp of approval.</li>
            <li> It did help my hair but I think it is over priced. Next time I will investigate what my local salon has to offer.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice.  I use it in the shower right after my shampoo.  Leave it on for two or three minutes while I finish everything else (LOL).  Then rinse it out of my hair.  Towel dry as normal then enjoy the softness and sheen to my hair.  My husband didn&#x27;t notice that I had changed products but he commented the other night on the glossy/sheen of my hair and how soft and silky it was.&lt;br /&gt;My crowning glory ladies....Recommend to buy.  Enjoy</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this hair balm.  My hair has a long history...from coloring to styling.  Although it doesn&#x27;t take away all the damage, it makes my hair much more manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and damaged from the Japanese straight perm. After 2 uses, my hair looks healthy and feels soft and smooth. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> The bottom line is this stuff works.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product- I really did notice a difference in my hair after one use.  After using this product, my hair feels lighter, bouncier (and in one word, healthier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells exactly like a hair salon (which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad smell), but I do feel a little self-conscious walking around smelling like I just came from a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is clearly made for use in a salon.  The instructions suggest massaging the product into the hair and rinsing out after 3-5 minutes.  For home use, this means putting it in your hair while in the shower, leaving it in a few minutes, then rinsing it out.  The package for this product is probably the least shower-friendly package for a hair care product I have seen- it has a large screw lid, which is hard to seat (especially when wet), the container is smooth and easy to drop, and it is hard plastic, so it can crack when dropped (and if you drop it while it is open, a good portion of the contents will spill out).  I&#x27;m sure this package design is great for a salon (where it can sit next to the sink and the lid doesn&#x27;t really need to be seated), but I really wish this product came in a squeeze bottle or hand pump for at-home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wish the scent was more subtle and the package was more user-friendly, but this stuff works so well I will certainly be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!! I have brown hair but because of the gray I bleach my hair so I look 32 instead of 82 (I was an early gray bloomer and have been dying my hair since I was 18).. The last time I went to get my hair done it got over processed and felt like Barbie hair. I seen this line of Shampoo, conditioner and balm and decided to purchase and use... MY HAIR FEELS LIKE NORMAL HAIR AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t come this empty! Was it only mine that arrived like this?&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll update later about the quality of the product, but the quantity sucks.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have used on my&lt;br /&gt;colored hair. I use this daily and my hair no longer feels&lt;br /&gt;like straw. Beats anything I have purchased at the salon!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this off amazon, but I though I would write a review because I totally recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is platinum blonde, and I have a hard time keeping up with the color and keeping my hair feeling healthy, but this product really helps. I used this after a very bad run in with bleach. Just after one use my hair was noticeably less dry and didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;mushy\\&quot; when wet. I left it in my hair for an hour and it really helped. If you bleach/dye your hair, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so shiny and feels so much better than before . I used this because my hair is always so dry no matter what I do and this product really helps it feel softer and healthier</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with my hair. It&#x27;s insanely thick and wavy--kind of curly and always frizzy. I have pretty heavy highlights and was flat ironing every day. I&#x27;m a bit of a product junky and have spent a ton of money on salaon products. None really make me happy. I bought this at the supermarket one day and I am so glad I did! It&#x27;s amazing! Works better than All Soft or any other salon product. Smells awesome and my hair volume and frizzies are much reduced...For 5 bucks, I am very impressed...</li>
            <li> Actually I used this product sample initially and after third use only there were no hair falls as well as hairs are growing and split ends becomes much more stronger so that hairs can grow well from ends too. I think this balm will gives good protein as well as fiber to hairs and I definitely recommend the product to my friends</li>
            <li> Miracle balm!  I&#x27;ve tried even the most expensive Caviar products to try to get rid of my straw like hair.  Nothing has ever worked except for this. My hair looks amazing and youthful again!</li>
            <li> At first I used the shampoo and the balm and it worked great. My hair was soft and manageable. BUT now the last few times I used it, its left my hair hard and straw-like! What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Nice mask but nothing extraordinary, if you have very dry hair it probably won&#x27;t save the situation but good for normal and fine hair</li>
            <li> I love this! Having a bad hair day then this is your savior !!</li>
            <li> I bought this &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; to help reduce breaking and splitting. First of all, this is conditioner in a jar. There isn&#x27;t anything about it that makes it different from regular conditioner. I think L&#x27;Oreal tried to make their product look different and special by putting it in a jar, but a normal conditioner bottle would have worked much better. The jar is a hassle in the shower - it&#x27;s big and bulky and has a large lid. You have to unscrew the lid, hold the lid and the jar, scoop the conditioner out with your fingers, and try not to get any water in the jar. It has a strong, chemical-like fragrance. It makes wet hair very slick - it&#x27;s difficult to wash out of hair and wash off of skin. It does a nice job detangling - after a shower, my brush runs right through my hair. However, that&#x27;s about all it does. After using it, my hair isn&#x27;t any softer, and my hair breaks and splits just as easily. I used it a few times a week for two weeks just to give it the benefit of the doubt, but nothing about my hair changed. Save your money and continue using your regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> Well let&#x27;s just say with what the product says it does I was looking forward to amazing hair... did I get it???  Not really :(  At first, while my hair was still wet and while I combed it out I thought this was going to be a super product... then my hair dried... and ta da, it&#x27;s still dry :(  So... it&#x27;s a conditioner like most others and unless the effect is cumulative I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just ok... I actually do better making my own conditioner so back to that and back to saving money.</li>
            <li> The product itself isn&#x27;t bad. I suppose my split ends have improved. But my disdain for the packaging cannot be overstated. I simply do not have the capacity to fathom why this product insists on arriving in a tub that weighs a ton, rather than a tube like literally every single one of its competitors. When the package first arrived at my door, I assumed that surely my order had been mixed up and someone had shipped me a brick rather than a simple hair conditioner. I opened the box, and stood corrected. Fast forward to a few months later, this tub of lead apparently slid off of the shelf on my shower (where it has been stationary for quite some time) and the edge of it landed on the nail bed of my great toe. I had a baby four months ago, and I do believe this was nearly as painful. A rather disturbingly large and colorful bruise has since developed. If you are a consumer considering this product, please keep it in a safe location. If you are a representative for L&#x27;Oreal, please consider a less dangerous vessel for your product in the future.</li>
            <li> I have curly, thin, damaged hair and really liked this mascara.  Just need 3 minutes and Hair feels really soft. Smells good and it is not expensive..</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product as my hair needs repair badly from dyes and flat irons.  It is difficult to apply as is very thick and pasty.  I left it on my hair for five minutes, two longer than the directions say, and then rinsed it out.  Not only did it not condition or repair, it appeared to make my hair more dry and more frizzy!  My regular conditioner does a better job than this....</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today and then used this as the directions say. I can say that I am not impressed but it does feel some softer( I think). I was really hoping that this could make the hair feel good but think I get better results with the stuff I have been using for the last 15 years or so. I think that the smell is not bad. I will use this a few more times and see how this does. Maybe this needs to be used a few times to see some sort of difference.</li>
            <li> So first I&#x27;ll start with the fact that I am 26 years old and that I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 14, so you can imagine the damage! I&#x27;ve suffered from dry dull hair for as long as I can remember, from product and treatment and dyes and peroxides and bleaches, and worst of all, bad shampoos and conditioners! Ugh. Anyway, so in just the past year I&#x27;ve gotten it my hair to feel some what healthy again, but still it was just really dull all of the time. So I was at Target a few weeks ago and I&#x27;d decided it was time to change shampoo and conditioner, well, just so we&#x27;re clear, anytime I see anything needed beyond shampoo and conditioner, I automatically move on because it&#x27;s basically a red flag for me. &amp;#34;TOTALLY REPAIRS UP TO **insert years here** WORTH OF DAMAGE INSTANTLY! -but only if you buy these twenty other products as well.&amp;#34; Anyway, so I&amp;#34;m about to move on when I see this jar of erasing balm, I still don&#x27;t know what possessed me to pick it up but I am so glad that I did. I wasn&#x27;t the only one who was skeptical though, my Mother, who was with me at the time was like :it&#x27;s not going to work, you&#x27;re wasting money&amp;#34; . My cousin &amp;#34;That&#x27;s !@##$%^&amp; it&#x27;s not going to work, I probably would have bought it too though just to try.&amp;#34; Friend, &amp;#34;Those things never work&amp;#34; I had heard so many times that it wouldn&#x27;t that I started to get nervous ... BUT after the first use, I myself was able to feel a difference in my hair. It felt lighter to me and more manageable. After the second was though, other people began to notice. My grandma was like you&#x27;re hair looks shiny today. And a few days later an aunt &amp;#34;your hair looks so healthy what are you doing?&amp;#34; I have long hair so I only got a handful of washes out of it maybe six? But I am so happy with the results. Today was the first day I went back to using conditioner and I just am not happy. I would totally recommend this product to others!!!</li>
            <li> Holy cow this stuff is great! It&#x27;s like taking your hair back to better days. I dye and bleach my hair fairly regularly, and there are times when a deep conditioner afterwards doesn&#x27;t do the trick. I use this Balm once a week, and it completely repairs my hair. I end up with soft, shiny hair after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Holy hell I love this stuff! I used to work in a salon so I&#x27;ve always been extremely skeptical of hair products that claim to repair damage. The way I understood it is as soon as you see breakage you need a trim. But honestly I&#x27;ve only used this once and I&#x27;m LOVING the results. I&#x27;m shocked! My hair became brittle and my ends looked like little branches due to me over ombré-ing my hair, using boxed color and using a curling iron 3x a week. I even chopped it off and then my new, much shorter ends started to break. This saved me, put it on after shampooing last night, can&#x27;t see any split ends at all, my hair is super soft and bouncy and I just styled and little to no hair fell out which is unheard of. I&#x27;m a believer! Where has this stuff been?!</li>
            <li> I leave this product in for half an hour wrapped in a shower cap then a hot towel wrapped around that or i use a hair steamer to help it penetrait. I found when I used it for the recommended 5 minutes on the instructions it didn&#x27;t do much. It is a masque so treat it as such and give it time to work and don&#x27;t let it dry out on your hair or I found it can feel a bit brittle. It is a very good product in my opinion. it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too heavy after use like some treatments seem to. I have noticed that i have less breakage on top, all those short flyaway bits seem to have reduced.</li>
            <li> great did wonders for my damaged dry hair</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and nieces. They love this product so much. It makes their hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Love love love, this is what I always use as conditioner. Really makes my hair soft, smooth, and silky!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: A year later and I just ran out so I thought I&#x27;d follow up. Not only is this a great deep conditioner, it really does help damaged hair. My hair has never felt better!!</li>
            <li> Ok.  The claim is it repairs up to a year of damage.  Woo hoo!  Then you read the fine print: when used in conjunction with their shampoo, conditioner and dry oil, and as compared to using a non-conditioning shampoo.  That&#x27;s like saying using hand cream makes your hands softer than washing them with laundry soap.  Really?  No kidding?  Wow, what a newsflash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I were washing my hair with dish detergent, switching to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s four-product regimen would have made a noticeable difference.  I already use a good shampoo and an excellent salon conditioner - Redken butter treat, love it -  and my hair was worse after using this product than before.</li>
            <li> The product do nothing in my hair my hair was exactly like it was before, also the container was closed but it looked used because it was missing almost half of the product. I did not recomend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost to my waist and I cannot live without this product. It is the only way I can get a brush through my hair and I haven&#x27;t had split ends in over a year since I&#x27;ve been using it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but after trying the whole line-up, all hope is gone! my hair is now is worse condition than I started with. Crispy, broken, dry &amp; with a weird residue. Also didn&#x27;t love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;My hairstylist mentioned that oftentimes overuse of these types of products can cause breakage like this, as they do change the hair&#x27;s structure. Unfortunately there can be too much of a good thing-wish I knew this beforehand. More was less! But even after the first time, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change... which is why I kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely do not recommend this or any of the products in the series. Such a bust!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to help my hair after it got severly damaged. While this isn&#x27;t 100% magic, it felt close to it. It made my hair soft and manageable again. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I use the total repair extreme line and it helped better than most other products. My hair was always my pride and joy and then it broke off very badly. Before this loreal line I thought my hair was a lost cause. I&#x27;m so happy I tried it because it really helped give me hope again that my hair will continue to get better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I have very fine, thin, straight, virgin hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to grow.  No matter how much I&#x27;ve tried to treat it gingerly and condition it  (wash scalp only, condition all over - especially mid to ends), the ends have become brassy and looked like bizarre old outgrowth.  Parts of my hair - front, ends, and behind my ears -  were also fuzzy and almost completely dry after washing and putting it up in a towel for a few minutes. I tried using Wen for a time (good at first), but the honeymoon didn&#x27;t last.  I knew I either had to find something to help moisturize my hair, or I&#x27;d have to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this jar right before Christmas and used it for about a week straight.  I saw pretty immediate improvement! Because it&#x27;s so heavy, I&#x27;ve begun using it in conjunction with Lee Stafford&#x27;s Hair Growth Treatment (just on the scalp), and sometimes mix in with Garnier Triple Nutrition Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair right now is soft, more manageable, shiny, and uniform in color.  Those parts of my hair that were almost completely dry after towel drying are more moisturized and no longer fuzzy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure the Candelilla Wax has something to do with how well this stuff locks in moisture, but I don&#x27;t care - wax it up, baby!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a LOT. I am a big-time &amp;#34;product hopper&amp;#34; and rarely pass any hair aisle without buying something. Needless to say, I have tried everything from cheap shampoos and conditioners to expensive $30 cleansing conditioners and have seen dry ends and healthy hair from using my many hair products. I recently bought this from Target for $5.99 and have used it about 4 or 5 times. Before this, my hair was damaged and fried from constant hair dryer and straightening iron use (every day, with no protectant spray, What was I thinking?!), frizzy, dry, it was just a mess. This made my ends noticably softer and healthier, and the smell is pretty good, too. All in all, I would definetely recommend and is worth the $6.</li>
            <li> I put this on after a shampoo and leave it for 20 minutes, it makes a huge difference in the quality of my colored hair - softer, shinier, less frizzy - great stuff!</li>
            <li> I am constantly lightening my hair, and that can make it extremely rough and hard to style.  My hair was breaking off every time I brushed it, and I stopped trying to work with it, and just started tucking it up everyday.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products to revive my hair, and had even considered going to the salon to have it cut, but then I tried this stuff and I was seriously amazed.  I left it on my hair all night long, and when I woke up and rinsed it out, it felt like another person&#x27;s hair.  It was soft, easy to comb through, smooth, and a lot less frizzy.  I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who colors their hair, or has a lot of damage.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this one because I had read somewhere else that a 3-5 minute hair mask wasn&#x27;t strong enough (compared to 15-20 minute hair masks), but I figured with such a low price I had nothing to lose. I washed my hair with the shampoo of this same line (which I already had on hand), and combed this through in the shower after ringing the excess water out... I let it soak into my hair for the duration of the shower. After I dried my hair, my hair was SO SILKY without any additional product... No serums, argan oil, etc. My hair was so dry before having been color treated and abused with heat styling, but this stuff really did correct it as promised. Seriously, if you&#x27;re scouring Amazon trying to find the best hair mask for dry, dull, damaged, frizzy hair (like I did), give this one a shot before you splurge on a pricier option. It&#x27;s such a deal, IT WORKS, and it smells so nice too! Good luck!</li>
            <li> Ladies! You know that freaky weird consequence of menopause where your hormones shift and your hair turns to straw? And even after you go see the doctor and start taking thyroid supplements, your hair STILL feels like straw? To the point where you&#x27;re afraid to let anyone touch it &#x27;cause you feel like the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR FEELS LIKE HAIR AGAIN!!! Soft! Silky! Manageable!  It&#x27;s a miracle!!! Coupled with the daily conditioner, the texture changes with just one treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, L&#x27;Oreal--NEVER stop making this stuff. And THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> Great, great stuff!  This is a lower-cost product that works like an expensive one.  I have long hair so use a generous scoop (1/4 cup?), and find that it leaves my hair feeling very soft, clean, and manageable.  At 46 my hair tends to be dry and dull-- this product leaves me with hair that reminds me more of the texture of my 20-something hair.  At least it is a major improvement. :)  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have dry dyed processed hair! My ends are especially dry which makes my hair tangle easily! I picked this up after seeing reviews. I used it the 1st time today &amp; my hair is silky &amp; smooth! I only left it on about 3m but it did its job! I recommend this!</li>
            <li> This us great I don&#x27;t use often but it has repaired my damaged ends</li>
            <li> My hair has never been better . I have thick curly long hair and my curls have become much more defined after just one wash</li>
            <li> I have a coarse thick very damaged dry hair, and still looking for a good product for my hair. I tried this Balm and it simply did not moisture my hair at all. it just did nothing. I used with the same brand shampoo and conditioner and I am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I actually just wrote this to Loreal which I think sums up how I feel about this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRAVO!!!!!!! I can not express how amazing your Total Repair 5 Balm and Oil Spray is!!!!!! My hair was extremely damaged by a faulty curling iron (had to even send it back to the company to get it tested, my money refunded etc). It FRIED my hair. It was so bad I could no longer run my fingers through my hair and if I did there would be MAJOR breakage. I would look down in the sink or wherever I was and there would be broken pieces of hair everywhere. The down side to the curling iron being faulty was that my hair was already color treated on top of it. And despite my hair being color treated it has always been healthy until this happened. Last night I decided to give your Total Repair 5 Balm and oil spray treatments a try. They were more affordable than the ones at the salon so I decided to take a chance. I am so glad that I did. I am in complete awe after the first use. It sealed the cuticles of my hair!! No more breakage!!! I can run my hands through my hair again!! And its just as soft as it was before the faulty curling iron incident!!! This is seriously a miracle balm and spray! I could not be happier that I found it and that you make it so affordable for us!!!! Thank you Loreal! You rock!</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years my hair has been so worked. Then ends were crunchy and really hard to blow dry. I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner and shampoo for about 2 months and have been really impressed with the results. Even my stylist said my hair looks so much healthier. I&#x27;m a salon product girl and have used everything from Paul Mitchell to Alterna. I highly recommend this product and the items that go along with it including: Shampoo and Total Repair 5 Multi-Restorative Dry Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Advanced Haircare Power Moisture Moisture Rush Mask and I liked that actually better than the Damage Erasing Balm because it made my hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product, from the first time I used it I felt the difference, my hair was soft and it was much easier to style it, also it looks healthier</li>
            <li> I was dubious about buying a non-salon hair repair thinking it would \\&quot;never work.\\&quot; So I was quite surprised and amazed when this one arrived and I used it for the first time.  My hair - damaged from color and a daily flat iron - has never felt better!  Immediately, I started getting comments about how silky my hair looked and how healthy it appeared.  No more fly-aways or broken ends sticking out. Although I don&#x27;t use it every day, I do use it a lot.  And my hair always looks good now!  Great Product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I&#x27;m biracial (African American and Mixed Western European). I have a LOT of hair... THAT I LOVE. It&#x27;s curly naturally and flowy, sleek, and smooth when flat ironed... that is I loved it up until early July. At that time, here in Boston, it was humid and HOT. MY hair, which extends past my cleavage, gets big in humidity making it 10x hotter. I thought the solution was to go to the ethnic part of my local drug stores hair selection and buying a relaxer. BIG MISTAKE. The product left my ends FRIED. It was as if the ends of my hair were made of tumble weed that had been baking in the Sahara for years. I was MORTIFIED. I had been hesitant to cut my long locks. I thought THERE MUST BE A WAY.&lt;br /&gt;Here are a list of things i tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot oil tubes&lt;br /&gt;Mayo treatments&lt;br /&gt;Olive Oil/Avocado&lt;br /&gt;CONDITION CONDITION CONDITION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some or maybe all got me away from the ledge... but I was still so desperate for the locks I used to have. Last night I was feeling crummy about my hair (again) and decided to go to the drugstore (again). I picked up a tub of L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Erasing Balm. I immediately washed or wet ( i didn&#x27;t need shampoo) and put in the goods. I waited about 10 minutes and rinsed. This morning I could tell things were LOOKING UP. I repeated the process, this time leaving the balm in for a good 30 to 40 minutes. I let my hair dry 90% naturally, blew it dry and then flat ironed. All I can say is WOW. My hair feels amazing. The root to just where the damage starts are flawless. The damaged area to the ends are so much softer, and look so much more healthy. I&#x27;m SOLD. I think after a few more uses AND a good trim my hair will be back to where it was before the beginning of July. I keep on thinking about if I had never relaxed my hair and had picked up this product my hair would have been OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Well, it will be because I think I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, it smells great and leaves a nice healthy shine.THANK YOU L&#x27;Oreal! :)</li>
            <li> Great! I recently went blonde and had dyed my hair quite a few times before so it left it dry and damaged. I was using dermorganic deep repair masque but it made my hair so sticky and hard that I went out and found this for 4-5 bucks and wasn&#x27;t sure but it definitely saved me and now my hair feels soft :) it&#x27;s a good bargain brand to use if you want to nourish dry hair after dyeing it and want hard/sticky to become soft</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a week on my frizzy but fine hair. It provides good nourishment without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product...though it&#x27;s not gonna erase the damage that they say it will..but works great on my hair..and smells great..loving it..</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse, damaged, over-processed from relaxers, coloring and hot styling tools. I decided to try the products after clipping coupons from the newspaper and online. I went to WalMart where the shampoo and conditioner was $3.97 each ($1.97 after $2.00 off coupons) and the Balm sold for $5.97($3.97 after coupon) Tried it and now I&#x27;M IN LOVE!!!!!! After styling from the first application, my hair feels soft and looks healthy. I put a plastic cap over my head after applying the Erasing Balm and let it stay on for 30 minutes. As of now, I&#x27;m going to continue using it.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product under the sun. I royally screwed my hair from dying it, color oops-ing it, redying it and re-color oops-ing it. Now it&#x27;s soft, shiny and vibrant and picks up the natural highlights in my hair. I would highly recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Okay first of all I have dyed and bleached my hair for 3 years straight plus I always straighten and curl my hair like non-stop, and I&#x27;m just a 14 year old. I had buyed a lot of deep conditioner that even some of them cost up to 50$ and let me tell you, non of them and i mean NON of them has made my hair so soft and Shinny and silky and pretty and this is just my second time i have used it and this is worth for every penny.  plus i have like dyed my hair like 70 times and bleach it so yeah i REALLY Recommend You to buy this, trust me its worth it . :D</li>
            <li> I like it, i did notice it got rid of my split ends and am happy about that, i just feel it leaves my hair feeling like straw and dry and my hair&#x27;s texture is anything but soft.</li>
            <li> really love this product, it locks moisture to my hair and leaves it shiny and glowing..i will try to use this weekly to maintain my desired results</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to use !, Nice  smell and make my hair looks  much better , I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I just purchase this item last week and I truly have to say it really does work I was hesitant on not buying it but I figure what the hell it was on sale plus my hair  was very dry and damage with so much color and bleach I&#x27;ve done over the years I was noticing my hair getting dry rough what I really like about this product is that it really does live your hair soft and shiny and it smell very nice I also use the shampoo and conditioner I wasn&#x27;t to happy with the shampoo I felt like my hair was very hard but I did use the conditioner and it was very smooth so  what I did was purchase the loreal everpure shampoo and I love it I also purchase the therapy oil the smell was very nice and it also live a nice smooth soft shiny on my hair hair using these product my hair feel and looks healthier .........

            <li> This is amazinggg i would definitely buy it again ,it moisture soo much and has a really nice smell ,it also leaves the hair really manegeable (my hair is in between curly and straight )</li>
            <li> best conditioner ever. i use it every day, not just for deep treatments. my hair is almost three feet long and has damaged ends from highlights. nothing i&#x27;ve tried works as well as this at conditioning and repairing it. also, it does not leave residue, weigh down your hair, or cause breakouts or irritation. one of my all time favorite products. i&#x27;ll die if they discontinue it ever, which most likely they will, because someone always changes or discontinues favorite products, don&#x27;t they??? anyway, yes, awesome product and best price you can get it for.</li>
            <li> A seriously amazing product. I color, highlight, blow dry, flat iron AND curl my hair. I use heat protection and deep condition regularly, but my hair was just so damamged from a previous color/bleach mishap. My hair needed love, and LOT of moisture. I have tried so so so many products, and this is the only one that has truly wowed me. I&#x27;m absolutely in love with my hair now. No more dry brittle ends, no more singed bangs (yep - they were so dry they would actually singe at the ends from my flat iron), and now... when I brush my hair, dry ends aren&#x27;t breaking off. I cannot wait to use it again!!</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie!  I have bought so many products over the years (some expensive ones) that have been disappointing to say the least.  I bought this on a whim.  I have long, fine, color treated hair that has a tendency to frizz in certain spots.  I wash, blow dry and flat iron my hair everyday.  I normally do not use conditioner because it weighs my hair down too much ( even the ones for fine,thin hair).  My hair is oily but it starts to get dry on the ends, breaks off and the split ends look noticeable.  A few Conditioning treatments I have used in the past have worked ok, but they have weighed my hair down so much that the little bit they helped, wasn&#x27;t worth it to me.  I saw Loreal damage erasing balm and decided to give it a try over the weekend.  I decided to use it differently than the directions on the jar.  I put my hair in a ponytail and slathered it on all the hair that came out of the ponytail.  I kept the product away from my roots hoping not to have completely flat lifeless hair (like in the past).  I kept the product on for about 2 hours then washed it out and shampooed with Pantene&#x27;s new Age Defy shampoo (which I love and highly recommend).  I blow dried my hair and WOW!!! My hair looked so good!  It was soft and silky, but not flat.  It was shiny, and healthy looking! It was so much smoother, I didn&#x27;t need to flat iron much! I repeated this process the next day and the results were even better!  I don&#x27;t have time during the week to do this, so I put some on my hair at night (it dries pretty quick) and slept with it on my hair and washed it in the morning.  The results are amazing!!!  My husband even asked if I got my hair done (&amp; that was after the first treatment)! My hair has not looked this healthy in a long time!  I am so happy with this product!!  I will definitely keep using this!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this off amazon, but this stuff is amazing!  I have super thick long hair and it was really damaged from the last time I dyed it, I noticed as soon as I brushed it that it felt more smooth and less tangled!</li>
            <li> Used for the first time and my hair feels great! I have been getting blonde highlights and although they look great, my hair has been so brittle and extremely dry. After using this balm my hair was so much easier to brush through and feels really soft. Not giving it a 5 star rating just yet, want to keep using it to see how it goes</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect my hair to feel and look so good!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really dry on the ends, and has lots of split ends, and this product made most of them disappear as well as it looks shinny and feels super nice. Best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am not a person who writes review..but this stuff is amazing!! I am constantly on the hunt for something that will make my hair look and feel healthier and I came across this gem.  A couple of things to note is that  am Black American and I have natural hair that I do straigthen. I am probably a 4a/4b.  Hope that helps someone who reads this review.  The consistency is thick which I actually like a lot because it wasn&#x27;t dripping everywhere once I slathered it onto my hair.  I could comb through my hair very easily to ensure that itwas all over. I rinsed it out - blew dry it and I was left with flowy healthy looking hair.  It&#x27;s worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. It makes my hair look great and has really brought my hair into great quality since my hair has been treated with color a lot and I also dye it a lot! This is a great longterm product to put moisture back into hair. Also a little goes a long way. The container may look small, but I have been using the same container for I think around 2 or more months (I only condition every other day).</li>
            <li> This really works to give your hair the feel and look of being repaired. My hair was softer, less frizz and smelled great. Love it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about the shampoo and conditioner so I had decided to try the damage erasing balm and love it. This is the best deep conditioner i have ever used and it&#x27;s even better than getting a professional deep condition treatment. I should also mention that I have very fine hair and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down at all!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because lately my hair has become very brittle, damaged, and dry. I purchased this for less than $6. You also get a lot of product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging for this product isn&#x27;t the greatest. It&#x27;s made to be used in the shower, but the lid makes it a little tricky to use. I would prefer it came in a squeeze bottle or with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this product, I was very impressed. I noticed a major difference in the conditon of my hair. It smells great and left my hair feeling much more soft and healthy. It also found it easy to rinse out. I bought this product 2 weeks ago and used it every day. The first week, I didn&#x27;t have any problems, but during the second week, I noticed that my face was itching, especially on my forehead and cheeks. I started using a new foundation as well, I assumed that was the culprit. So I returned it. I thought that would take care of the problem, but it didn&#x27;t. The itching started out pretty mild, but as time went on, it got more and more intense. It was frustrating. My skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and allergy prone. It was obvious to me that I was having an allergic reaction to something. I also developed 5 or 6 small, raised bumps. They looked like tiny blisters. I&#x27;ve been under major stress lately, so I thought maybe my skin was freaking out from that. But I almost never get acne. When I do, it&#x27;s usually just one pimple. But this was a small cluster. I think the small bumps were actually tiny hives or an allergic rash of some kind. I found another review on this site from someone else with sensitive skin. She said that it made her itch and caused raised bumps as well.  It obviously wasn&#x27;t the foundation, and I hadn&#x27;t changed anything else in my beauty routine. My primer, foundation, facial cleanser, and makeup remover wipes are all hypoallergenic. So I couldn&#x27;t figure it out. While I was at work, I realized I&#x27;d started using this balm around the same time as the new foundation. I wondered if this could be the true culprit. I decide to stop using it and see what happened. The itching stopped and the small, raised bumps on my forehead went away. I did a Google search and found a link that said that allergic reactions to this product don&#x27;t happen right away. It takes several days for the allergic reaction to appear. This balm was clearly the cause of my all problems, so it went in the garbage. If your skin is not sensitive, I highly recommend this product. It works great and made a huge difference in the condition and texture of my hair. But if you have sensitive skin, I DO NOT recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair twice, and my hair was NOT happy! Lots of breakage, some really fried sections that snapped off, and just so dry. I would put tons of argan oil on my hair in the morning to make it shiny, but it would wear off my the end of the day, when usually it would make my hair greasy looking after a long day. I began shopping around for hair masks but was unwilling to drop $20+ on salon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this mask just once, I&#x27;ve seen an insane improvement in the texture of my hair! It&#x27;s maybe not as healthy as it was before the bleaching, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close--smooth, moisturized, and shiny. HIGHLY recommended for over-processed and very damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left this on for at least an hour and a half under a shower cap. I took it off because it started to irritate my scalp and make it itch, which was weird, but my scalp is probably very sensitive after the bleaching.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal for creating this product! As a gal with curly/kinky hair, my search for the perfect product was over when I used Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Oil line. While CD&#x27;s Monoi Oil Hair Mask was the best deep conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever used, the $32 price tag was just too steep. Going on an obsessive hunt for a deep conditioning product that gave me similar results led me to the L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Damage Erasing Balm as a cheaper alternative. I love this product, despite the fact that it contains silicone (which some curly &amp; kinky haired friends should note). I oftentimes mix this product with the L&#x27;Oreal Power Moisture Rush Mask, and I&#x27;ve liked the results so much that I now use the entire Total Repair 5 line.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many deep conditioners , ,,, Ausie 10 min, morracon deep conditioner all kinds I always go back to JOICO but it&#x27;s pricey and I had heard good reviews on this one and LET ME TELL YOU it WORKS!!!! leaves my hair so soft and manageable like Joico does but way cheaper.... my hair was dull and dry and I am happy I finally found one that works great!!</li>
            <li> After hearing rave reviews on this product from one of my Youtube subscribtions (who has the more beeeautiful hair), I decided to give it a try. I was skeptical because of some of the ingredients, as I try to use alcohol/silicone/sulfate (et cetera) free products but figured why not. It made my hair feel so amazing!&lt;br /&gt;After only one use I could tell the difference. My hair is naturally coarse, frizzy, and fine. This product made it silky, my split ends less noticeable, and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It could be doing absolutely nothing to ACTUALLY repair damage, but my hair feels and looks sooo nice after using it that I don&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li> Looooved this product, made my hair really soft</li>
            <li> Bought this for my long, dry, frizzy hair in hopes that it would help repair all of the straightening I put it through over the years and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This stuff is like magic and it smells great. I got it yesterday in the mail, used it last night, and this morning, my hair was noticeably better. I would definitely give this a shot if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive solution. I used this along with the L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 shampoo and got great results.</li>
            <li> This us an amazing deep conditioner. I had damaged hair like you wouldn&#x27;t believe-it was dry, dull, and so tangle-prone I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through it. Applying this to wet hair (not sopping wet) and leaving it in for five minutes made my hair look shiny and healthy. I have long, fine hair that tends to look as flat as a pancake, and this, though rich, did not weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> After one use I can tell the difference in my hair! I blow dry and use my flat iron to curl my hair every day........I noticed that my hair was starting to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to my flat iron........I checked with my stylist and she said that was because my hair was DRY........this morning was my firs time using this product and WOW! It is silky and went right through my flat iron.......I used this with the total repair shampoo and then the dry hair oil from the same line! AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and liked it. I used it yesterday and still works well. My hair is pretty healthy already, since I cut off five inches of it a week ago, after attempting to bleach it. But I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to add a little more moisture. I used this yesterday and my hair felt pretty silky in the shower, which was impressive becuse I only left it on for two minutes. I then deep conditioned with Sebastian Penetraitt. (LOVE IT) In the morning, my short hair seemed like I had straightened it! Which is amazing, because ever since I chopped it off, the ends curl upwards and it&#x27;s a mess. xD I also don&#x27;t comb my hair after the shower anymore. Just put in leave in conditioner and comb with my fingers. This helps the damage a lot! It was $6 at Target, not bad at all. I would definately reccomend this. Ladies ( and gents) if you want healthy hair, I have learned that you should only use heat on it once a week (if any), never blow dry your hair, let it air dry and don&#x27;t comb your hair when it&#x27;s wet. Also, only brush your hair once or twice a day starting from the bottom up. I have used this methods and my hair has grown already 2 inches in one week. Plus use Mane n Tail. But definately add this masque to your routine, use once a week. Definately worth $6. :)</li>
            <li> left on for 30min wit a heating cap and it did wonders for my hair ...... will repurchase,did not buy off amazon</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted a hair treatment since my hair started to feel dry and look a little frizzy only a couple weeks after my trip to the salon. I didn&#x27;t want to go back to get a trim because it wasn&#x27;t necessary so I started to look for damage repair treatments. I bought this after reading the label and the directions, I didn&#x27;t have any reviews to go on since this was a new product and I&#x27;m happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, barely holds a pony-tail holder and I need to readjust and tighten bobby pins frequently if I ever wear them. Basically I can only blow dry my hair straight with a round brush and call it a day, on top of that I have an oily scalp which inhibits my use of any products like mousse, serums and heat-protectors. My last trip to my stylist I really paid attention to what she did and started to mimic that at home, mostly blow-drying on hot (not warm) and because of this my hair started to feel drier more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use it after the total repair shampoo/conditioner, leave on for 3-5 minutes then rinse, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to follow this with my fine hair (plus I didn&#x27;t buy the same shampoo/conditioner, I worship [[ASIN:B009AVFFWI Yes To Carrots Scalp Relief Shampoo, 11.5 Fluid Ounce]]) so I decided to try it as an overnight treatment and that&#x27;s where I saw my results. At night, before bed, I used about a nickel-sized amount, smoothed it into my hair mid-shaft to ends, gently combed it through then tied it into a loose pony tail with an ouchless elastic band and in the morning I did my routine as usual. It washed out and didn&#x27;t leave residue or extra weight to my finicky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to see results after about three days, my hair was less frizzy and dry where I treated it and it looked a tad shinier as well so I started to inch up closer to my scalp and saw the same results. I still don&#x27;t do my whole head for fear of causing an imbalance but I&#x27;m very happy with the results I have seen. It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell, it dissipates after a while and I&#x27;ve seen no damage to any pillows or any cloth products that have come in contact with my hair while the product is in it. Since I only use this at night and in such small amounts I suspect this could easily last me a year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the erasing balms fault or not, but my hair is falling out like crazy. And only in the parts that I&#x27;ve been putting a lot of it on. I don&#x27;t know what to do....</li>
            <li> When applying this product I noticed my hair started to feel plumper and thicker. After rinsing it and blowing it out, I did notice it was much smoother and the texture seemed much less coarse.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been very damaged since I&#x27;m very indecisive with my hair color and length. Back in October I ended up bleaching my hair 4 times in two days and also doing a color stripper. About a month later, I had my hair bleached twice and did a color stripper and followed with two box dyes. My hair was a nightmare and I wasn&#x27;t ready to chop it all off yet. I started using this product and noticed quite a difference. My hair didn&#x27;t look fried and started looking like it used to with lots of shine and it was super soft and no knots! In January I started using the Its a 10 Plus Keratin Deep Conditioner and I recently ran out and switched back to this product and I think it works just as well at half the cost! I use this conditioner every time after I shampoo and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch back to any other deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> This started about a week ago when I decided to wash my hair with apple cider vinegar; I kept reading how it was great for hair so I decided to give it a try. HUGE mistake. I have very fine hair and had very little damage before this (no dye, bleach, straightening, etc) , I only left the cider and water in for about 5 minutes then washed it out. After my hair dried, I realized it was rough and dry. It was crunchy, more split ends, my head smelled sour for two days, it was terrible!&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to buy a deep conditioner yesterday. I never have before. This looked like a good product at the drug store, low price, so I tried it out, and wow! My hair is silky smooth again. I even asked my fiancé what he thought without giving any hint of my opinion. He said it was a million times better and asked if he could sleep with his face in my hair because he loved the smell. Haha.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this balm again! ... Don&#x27;t ever wash with apple cider vinegar!!</li>
            <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
            <li> Love this product - my hair feels like silk! Quick delivery and great packaging. Try this you will love it! My hair was like straw b-4 I used it.</li>
            <li> I am impressed by how shiny and soft my hair is, My hair is very thick and heavy, but now it feels light and clean, if it smelled better, i would give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> It seems to act exactly the same as the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I having very dry damaged bleached long hair and this product saved my hair! I don&#x27;t get to the salon often actually not in a couple years so my hair needs help! I bought this along with the shampoo and conditioner and it has absolutely saved my hair!</li>
            <li> I own the Shampoo, Conditioner, and the repair balm. I shampoo throughly, and leave the conditioner in for about 10 min. Then i go back through with the repair balm and let that sit for 10-15 minutes. I have used these products 3 times in the last few weeks, and my hair feels awsome!! Silky, vibrant, manageable, weigh less brakage! and just overall loveable!! My hair is almost 3 feet from root to tip, and its hard to find good products that actually repair and keep improving your hair. But this product does! My butician asked me what i was using, and gave me muliple comments on the changes of my hair. I told her what i was using and she was surprised. you might not have a significant change the 1st time like i did, but i would say give it a shot. Use it a few times and see if there is a significant change...</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  I recently went from a reddish brown color to blond....in the last week my hair has been bleached twice, toned 3 times, and colored twice.  I have naturally curly hair that is usually incredibly dry, and after all the processing - my hair was in BAD shape.  I used this last night for the first time and WOW!!  My hair looks and feels BETTER than it did before I changed my hair color.  Its super nice and thick and smells awesome too!  Exactly what my hair needed!  I didn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon, I was able to find it at Target - very reasonable price, it&#x27;s worth WAYYY more!!</li>
            <li> Does not weight down hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it oily. Hair feels soft and stays untangle even after days of treatment. My hair is still soft and easy to brush, and I only use mask once a week. As for spit ends, I didn&#x27;t really except it to work miracles... So I still have spit ends. This container arrived 3/4 full and was not sealed so I was a bit disappointed about that. As for the smell, it&#x27;s not particularly pleasant but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it was sitting in my mother in laws house so I used it. It&#x27;s fantastic, smells great and my hair came out super lite and soft. I am on here now looking to buy it! I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my own hair last night... I felt like I had been at the salon.</li>
            <li> For starters I am mixed with half African American while the rest is Native American and English. My natural hair is basically loose curls and is somewhat thick. My normal routine consisted of a lot of blow drying and scrunching with mousse however it dried my hair out really badly and I wanted a way to get shiny, defined curls without the mousse. So I picked up this product and after the very first wash, didn&#x27;t have to use mousse at all! So happy with the outcome and it&#x27;s very affordable. Recommend it for everyone with all hair types :)</li>
            <li> My go-to repair balm is Pureology---at $50 for a little jar. While I don&#x27;t expect a $6 drugstore product to perform the same or better, I&#x27;d at least like it to do more than a basic conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is thick like a custard, and because of the jar size it&#x27;s hard to juggle the lid and a palmful of product as you try to replace the lid in the shower! Awkward. And, this doesn&#x27;t even do a better job than the basic Pureology conditioner I use. This says that it helps hair that &#x27;looks like straw&#x27;: but it does nothing to my hair that a basic everyday conditioner can&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed, I expected more from this product based on the hype. Maybe I have special-needs hair that is simply pickier?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I received a sample pack in the mail with the matching shampoo L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Restoring Shampoo 12.6 FL OZ and conditioner L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Restoring Conditioner 12.6 FL OZ. The shampoo I currently use (Pureology) is sulfate-free, but the L&#x27;oreal is not. I was amazed at the sheer mass of foamy bubbles and then realized it&#x27;s that way because of additives that my usual shampoo does not have. The shampoo and conditioner do a good job of making my hair feel very coated and soft (the additives, of course) and with these products, the L&#x27;oreal Total 5 balm performed much better. I did still get tangles at the ends of my hair while trying to comb it out for straighening, something I don&#x27;t get with my Pureology hair mask. So, for a drugstore trio, maybe you might like the L&#x27;Oreal products together.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.  My hair is already softer.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, but it did nothing for my hair. I have thick, coarse dry damaged hair BTW</li>
            <li> I have very long over-processed fine hair. I had been using Neutrogena deep moisturizing treatment for years, but received this as a sample. It was amazing! I now use it 1-2 times a week and leave it in the length of my shower- probably 15-20 minutes. My hair feels amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down at all.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product after seeing so many positive reviews but it was just too much for my hair.  My hair is extremely fine, thin, frizzy and is cut a few inches below my shoulders. I was hoping to find something that might make it a bit healthier and give it some volume. The first time I used it I probably went overboard and applied it all over my head and through the strands. The result was greasy hair that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. I washed my hair everyday for a week and it still remained really, really greasy. To be fair it was also extremely soft and more manageable but unfortunately just so greasy it looked horrible. Needless to say it was a ponytail week. The next time I used it I was very careful to just use it sparingly and through the ends of my hair. This time around it wasn&#x27;t as greasy but it was still too much for my hair.  It&#x27;s hard to say whether or not I can recommend this too anyone else. Based on the great reviews it normally gets and the price I&#x27;d say go for it but if your hair is like mine be careful with how much you use. Overall I&#x27;m glad I tried it but will not be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from amazon, I bought it from Publix but this stuff is the best deep conditioner/mask I have ever tried! I have a lot of fine curly hair. I had about 5 layers of henna in my hair and after getting tired of the color I had to bleach it out. My hair was completely fried. I had to go dye over the bleach to even out the color. By that point my hair was breaking off and was dry and frizzy and my curls were almost completely gone due to the damage. Then I found this product. I used it once and it turned my awful hair into soft, very resilient hair and took most of the split ends away. It did not weigh down my hair at all and did not make it greasy or crunchy like most deep conditioners do to my hair. My curls are back and bouncy. This product is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the name alone. I use the Total Repair Extreme 5 for a few heating tool split ends and am satisfied with that system. My ends are moisturized and not so damaged looking. I used this in conjunction with the above mentioned and was not satisfied at all.   My hair was flat, oily looking, felt waxy, heavy, dull with a matte appearance  To be a rinse after 3-5 minutes treatment, I hoped that my hair would have looked healthy. The jar was so cumbersome especially if using in the shower. I returned this after (2) uses. $8 Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that is damaged, and I have used this multiple times to treat, and it works nicely. If you are looking for a cure all, it does not exist anywhere, with the exception of never using heat or chemicals on your hair ever again and cutting off all the damage. But if you are looking for a quality product to help mitigate some of the damage, this really helps remoisturize and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of conditioners over the years, and this is right up there as one of the best.  It smells devine and works even better!  My hair is naturally curly and is dry and frizzy looking.  First use it looked way better and lived up to it&#x27;s claims for me.  I use it about 1-2 times a week, almost my regular conditioner, for a couple of months now.  I highly recommend this and couldn&#x27;t like it any more!</li>
            <li> I have started a new regime with my hair, not only conditioning, also trying to avoid further damage to my hair based on over-processing, dying, blow-drying, and all the other wonderful things we do to our hair to look our best, although our hair is “actually being over processed at times” we continue to give our hair a thorough treatment of becoming at risk of being damaged from all the products/processes we use as “enhancements” to our hair.  For this reason, companies have created damage eraser, deep conditioning, and strengthening reconstructing products to help repair our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different types of hair treatments that I can state are very good.  I am VERY IMPRESSED with L’Oreal Total Repair 5 Damage-Erasing Balm – Advanced Hair Care.  I purchased this product to use with my Garnier Fructis Damage Eraser Strength Reconstructing Butter (which states when hair needs intense reconstruction to bring back strength, vitality &amp; shine to damaged hair) to help give my hair the reconstruction needed based on over-processed treatments.  I would not state that my hair is damaged.  I would state it is necessary to give your hair the process of strength, vitality, shine, and reconstruction from products/techniques we use daily that may over-process our hair.  I was amazed at the “scent” a very light and pleasant scent, noticeable when applied, then not a long-lasting and overpowering “scent” that others would be able to smell and ask “what do you have it your hair?”  It comes in a beautifully designed plastic container, 8.5 oz. The product states “repairs up to 1 year of damage use – deeply repairs and reconstructs dry chemically treated hair.  As I applied a little of this product to my hair, I could feel the product processing and working through my hair and scalp.  In as little as 5 minutes my hair felt softer, more manageable, moist, and healthier.  I am so impressed with the results from this product, I would definitely purchase again, refer to others as well as Amazon Customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product can be used as a stand-alone damager eraser product, I have chosen to use it with Garnier Fructis Damager Eraser, as well as my Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth Leave-In Conditioning Cream.  For those that would like to have manageable hair, shinier, moisturized hair that shows vitality, and well as healthier hair this product would be great for you.  Definitely, you would not be disappointed.  The Seller has described this product accurately.  The IMPRESSIVE and EXCELLENT packaging from the Seller was GREAT. The package was not enclosed in a cartoon box, it was sent in a beautifully designed package from Seller, (great marketing plan, I would state), and the L’Oreal Total Repair 5 Damage Eraser Balm was enclosed in another impressive plastic container, beautifully sealed and protected from any damage to the product or through transportation.  I am very happy with the product, the packaging design, and delivery of this product.  I have not seen this type of packaging in years.

            <li> Love this product. It strengthens and puts shine into my hair.</li>
            <li> I saw a review about this product on a blog. The very next week it was on sale at CVS. I put it on my hair, then waited about 10 to 15 minutes. Then it was time to blow dry my hair...... and while blow drying I noticed that my hair was hair. Once done my hair was so hard, I had to go back to my regular conditioner and blow dry my hair all over again.</li>
            <li> Since using this I have gotten so many compliments on how shiny and smooth my hair is. It&#x27;s truly works.</li>
            <li> this is greatttttt product specially when used together with loreal total 5 repair shampoo and conditioner. gooood stuffff righttttt hereeeeeeeeee. go get it!</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair four times because I wanted it to be platinum/grayish. I eventually gave up and dyed it purple. Direct dyes are usually very nourishing to your hair and you can leave them on for hours so I expected my hair to fix itself. Surprise, it didn&#x27;t. My ends were breaking off every time I brushed it or ran my fingers through it and my shoulders were always covered in little purple ends. Trimming it was not an option because my hair is short and I wanted to let it grow out. I used it for about three weeks(once a week) and didn&#x27;t notice a difference because I didn&#x27;t stop straightening it. I stopped using my flat iron and after TWO uses my ends are 75% fixed and my hair almost feels like it used to. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again if my hair needs it after one jar. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with any type of hair damage.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize I had samples of this product before I bought it (from Target). I tried it just in the shower and didn&#x27;t see much results but my hair was soft. Then I tried it overnight, wetting my hair first and I put the product all throughout then braided and wrapped my hair. Then next day I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference, in the shower I rinsed, then rinsed with apple cider vinegar, then rinsed again. My roots were a bit oily probably because it was one of the my no shampoo days, but my ends were still pretty poofy (by the way, I have fine, dry, frizzy, wavy hair. Not color treated or heat damaged, just dry).&lt;br /&gt;I used it again the next night, shampooing and conditioning the next day, then let my hair air dry. Admittedly it was still very frizzy, but normally when I let my hair air dry it curls and poofs wildly. It was much more sleek, and I had nice waves too. I&#x27;m going to continue using this and hopefully I&#x27;ll see more improvement!</li>
            <li> It was amazing the first time , but in the following weeks it started to weigh my hair down and over moisturize it to the point where I was looking oily and pasty</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the shampoo and conditioner, so this was disappointing</li>
            <li> I must say i have tried dozens of products looking for something that will make my dry, brittle, damaged hair look and feel healthy. When i saw this product that claimed to repair damage i figured i would give it a shot. Wow, i am amazed at how well this worked for my hair. It it very creamy and doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell, which i love. I coated my hair with this and covered with a shower cap. I left this on my hair for 30 minutes than rinsed it off in the shower. Even when my hair was wet I could tell that my hair felt softer. After i dried and straightened my hair (eek i know heat is harmful, but i cant stop) it looked amazing. I could not stop running my hands through it. Usually when i sleep on my hair it gets so knotty by the morning. When i woke up my hair will still soft and knot free. This has become a staple in my hair care routine and would recommed this to someone who has tried everything under the sun with no results.</li>
            <li> So ive been looking for a hair mask that would fix my hair problems. I have dry hair an it looked like straw lately an that had to go. So i went to the store to look for some hair mask&#x27;s, i found this an it smelled really good an having used loreal products before i decided to giv it a try. OMG this product is amazing. My hair is so soft an silky i love it. I let it stay in my hair over night even tho it only recommended 5 mins. This product is definately worth it, it has a nice creamy texture that isn&#x27;t sticky or oily it kinda reminds me of butter. Ladies i definatly recomend this product to you for your hair after one use i noticed my hair was silky an so soft. I will definatly be repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> I tried a generous sample I got in the mail and left it in my hair for 30 minutes. When I rinsed it out, I couldn&#x27;t believe the new texture!!! Tons of body, no greasy feeling, not limp, swingy gorgeous hair like when I was a teenager! I&#x27;m naturally blonde but at age 57, my blonde color is getting a little lighter with a small amount of gray. The gray has a horrible texture! I bought 4 jars before other people discovered it by using a sample like I did! I gave 2 away as gifts though so I&#x27;m not that selfish. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this and I&#x27;ll never be without it. I love it but the repair is temporary for me - until I shampoo and wash it out. That&#x27;s ok though ...and a big high 5 to L&#x27;Oreal for making it!</li>
            <li> Very good product and price! :)</li>
            <li> Bought this at target much cheaper, but am in love with this product. My hair is very thick but fine, and although I only used a hair dryer daily, no straighteners or curling irons, it was really dry and damaged. I went heatless 11 weeks and one day ago and started using the entire product line (aside from the dry oil) and I have never had healthier and shinier hair. I&#x27;m trying to grow it out as long as I can, and before it only grew maybe 3-4 inches a year. After 11 weeks, it has grown about 3 inches. Everyone has noticed the difference in my hair! Will definitely keep using this product line! I used this daily for the first week to jump start hydration, now I leave it on for about an hour a week as a true mask. I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends and they&#x27;ve started using it as well!</li>
            <li> my hair is awful, over processed, fried, blonde, with a naturally absurd wavy texture that causes it to poof out like a giant yield sign - i had major doubts about this product because of the low price point, but i decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weeks later, i&#x27;m still really impressed. there are so many good things about this conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. it&#x27;s cheap as i mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;2. it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;3. it&#x27;s SO easy to rinse out, and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of greasy residue (normally i have to rinse and re-rinse and stand with my head under the shower for 3 minutes to get all conditioner out, this comes out in less than a minute)&lt;br /&gt;4. it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or cause it to become crispy and &#x27;poofy&#x27; and fly away as bad conditioners sometimes do&lt;br /&gt;5. SO MUCH LESS FRIZZ. somehow my hair would always be greasy or poofy or crazy but this product did wonders taming it.&lt;br /&gt;6. basically does a good job of taming the frizz and removing all the unwanted craziness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;honestly it works better than Kerastase, Wen, and It&#x27;s a 10 and numerous other conditioning treatments i&#x27;ve tried... i will be repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> Great for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at my local grocery store.  I must have spent at least twenty minutes browsing the wall of hair products, trying to decide which &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product I should buy in one of my last resorts to save my poor hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you about my hair.  It is very fine, thin, and to about the middle of my back.  Despite NEVER using heating appliances on it, regular trims, and even after a year of using that fancy schmancy It&#x27;s a 10!  leave-in spray, my hair has had issues with dry ends that tangle and split and split and split.  Neither my stylist nor I understand it, and I&#x27;ve decided I must be genetically disposed or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has helped my dry ends as much as this has.  I only bought it last week, but after two washes (I wash my hair every three days) I can already tell a great difference in my hair.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what prolonged usage will do for me.  After using the expensive stuff that did absolutely nothing for my hair, I can&#x27;t believe the answer to my locks&#x27; troubles cost me less than ten dollars.</li>
            <li> Definitely made my hair softer and it feels like my split ends are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anybody who is struggling with split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My hair probably hates me from all the bleaching and dying I put it through...I&#x27;m constantly using 40 volume developer to get my hair the lightest shade possible in order to maintain a snowy-white color, and there are times where my hair feels very brittle and falls out while combing or washing it. I&#x27;ve tried other deep conditioners and while they work decently, my hair feels so much better after using this, and it has a nice smell to it, as well. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get their dry and brittle hair back to almost like-new condition.</li>
            <li> This really does moisturize my hair well. I&#x27;m not sure about the damage removal but makes it softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Good product to have in the shower...I use it about once a week.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal repair balm does works on my hair best,I put it on before blowing it out my hair after my hair is blown out the finishing touch is the L&#x27;oreal Oleo Relax Serum,my hair looks great shinny and so beautifull.I do recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products from this line now, and they consistently amaze me -- they have a level of performance I&#x27;d expect from a much more expensive product. (It&#x27;s nice to find a treatment that&#x27;s actually in my price range.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampooed my hair and then applied this deep conditioner. It was quite easy to apply throughout my hair (which is waist-length, color-treated, and rather dry). I left it in for about five minutes and then rinsed it out. It did completely rinse out without leaving any residue (at least, nothing that I could feel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first benefit I noticed was that it was even easier than usual to detangle my hair. Benefits continued into the next day -- my hair was soft and smooth and shiny, with much less frizz (even though we&#x27;ve been having some awful winter weather lately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have some additional deep conditioners in my stash to work through, but I&#x27;m very pleased to have found this one. Barring exceptional circumstances, this one is the one I&#x27;m likely to return to in the future -- the price is right, it&#x27;s readily available, and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week in conjunction with the matching shampoo and conditioner. I wash my hair every other day using the shampoo and conditioner and every couple of washes I&#x27;ll switch the conditioner with the Balm.  I keep the shampoo concentrated around my scalp and the conditioner or Balm concentrated on my ends. I&#x27;ve always had thick, healthy, soft and long hair that had wonderful volume and would hold curl or straighten.  Basically not any real issues unless there was awful humidity outside.  Fast forward to the birth of my 1st child and my hormones and the typical after pregnancy lack luster hair was really bothering me.  My hair felt like straw and looked blah to me. Mind you I cut my hair short during pregnancy to kind of give it a restart chance to grow fresh and new.  It&#x27;s currently to my shoulders and I have been keeping up with trims and a newborn limits your \\&quot;me time\\&quot; so it usually air dries. I was completely heart broken to find myself past the 3 months post partum period where you experience the most hair loss and to still have thick, full hair but for it to be dry and just look mousy in my opinion.  The last few years I&#x27;ve been a fan of Loreal&#x27;s sulfate free everstrong line so I bought this on a whim and it has completely restored faith in my hair.  Pregnancy and a newborn are hard enough and your body goes through so many changes as it is but this product has given my hair back the softness and manageability I had before. My volume is back and so is my healthy shine. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so so many expensive products for conditioner that help colored, damaged hair.  This is by far the best product on the marker.  Target has it for $5.99!  I still use a salon product for shampoo and use this every day as my conditioner.  It is truly an amazing product and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This does not improve my hair at all and paying shipping is not worth it. Makes my hair duller and limp, not liek my usual products that i usually use.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! I left it on my hair for 30 minutes, after I rinsed it and blow dried it my hair was silky and shiny. I have highlights and my hair is normally dry, this really helped. My hair is  now more manageable.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s supposed to be exactly the same ingredients as a kerastase product( same company). It has a really strong smell and although it does seem to condition ok, my hair seemed frizzier when I used it. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> We are in Hilton Head and I got a sample of the shampoo, conditioner and repair 5 balm. The sun has totally destroyed my hair, I was scouring through the yellow pages trying to find a salon to try, and remembered I had this sample. It does exactly what it says it does. My hair feels stronger, it&#x27;s actually bouncy, it is very silky and  has a lot more shine. I am on my way to the drug store to get a jar for the rest of this trip, and as soon as I get home will order it here. It really is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughther is bi-racial.  She relaxes her hair twice a year - a simple Mizani comb through and rinse.  Her hair was breaking pretty badly due to weekly blow drying and flat ironing, so she tried the the L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Line (shampoo, conditioner, erasing balm)  Her hair was very noticeably shinier and softer, less breakage too.  Every time she washes, blow drys, flat irons her hair, she looks like she just got back from the salon.  She is very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a try.  My hair is baby fine, wavy and greasy at the scalp but dry at the ends due to hair coloring.  I didn&#x27;t think I would get the same type of results.  I was wrong.  I use the balm only as a leave in conditioner while I shower.  I rinse the excess off.  I&#x27;m able to blow dry my hair on High heat setting.  Hair feels softer, has a really nice shine, and I don&#x27;t lose any volume due to heavy residue.  I too am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned, strawberry blonde with sensitive skin and after using this product, yes my hair was beautiful!  And then the itching began on my scalp, then bumps, then ears itching, then face swelling and hot, etc.  I threw it in the trash, beware if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often review products but I was so blown away by this stuff that I decided to. I have badly damaged long hair from bleaching and dying it. I bought this on a whim not expecting much but this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used in years. It left my hair beautifully shiny and full of volume without frizz. I leave it on for 5-10 minutes while I shave every day and it&#x27;s better than $30 treatments I&#x27;ve used before, not even my salon gets my hair looking so good. Try it!</li>
            <li> I used this as a mask (followed the directions to a T) but it honestly didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular to it. It felt like a normal condioner and worked like any other conditioner. As a hair repair mask it didn&#x27;t work for me. I wish it did. I didn&#x27;t hate it but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Really really like it.  So good I bought another kne as a gift</li>
            <li> Super hydrating, and smells wonderful... Only down fall is that the actual condition from this line is the same in this deep conditioner. Save yourself some money and buy the actual condition.</li>
            <li> Great product. Made my dry damaged hair feel great. Found it cheaper in the supermarket though so won&#x27;t be buying from Amazon again unless price drops!</li>
            <li> Definitely works. My hair use to be so dry from all the coloring and the heat from styling. Although the product says to use it once or twice a week, I use it every time I shower. It repaired my hair, gives it a shine, and it has a lovely scent. I am definitely ordering more.</li>
            <li> I tried this along with the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;(I did not purchase the conditioner, only the balm) and when I used it for the first time, later that day I went to lunch with a friend. The very first thing she said as soon as she got into my car was &amp;#34;Your hair looks amazing! It looks really healthy! Did you just get it done?&amp;#34; Now mind you, I am due for my cut and color next week, so that really says a lot about this product. I also purchased the Power Moisture shampoo and moisture mask, but haven&#x27;t had to use it yet. Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and I&#x27;m always looking for products that will put moisture in my hair. I saw this along with the Power Moisture at my store and decided to buy both. Power Moisture dried out my hair and it became matted. But, the Total Repair 5 added moisture and provided great slip for detangling. And it&#x27;s an affordable price. I will definitely replace this when I run out.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews my first thought was, yeah right!  Especially the one where the lady needed to get to the beauty shop for cut and color and used this instead.  Her lunch friend raved about her hair!&lt;br /&gt;I used this for the first time today and at lunch was greated with, \\&quot;did you just get your hair done?\\&quot;  It looks FANTASTIC!  So there you go.  My hair for the first time in years no longer looks like hay, oh joy!  Now I, too, am a convert!  Oh by the way I think it smells terrific.  Similiar to Caress soap.</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft, silky, shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t really do anything to my split ends as said.</li>
            <li> I love this damage erasing balm. It will literally produce the most beautiful hair you have ever seen on yourself. Buy it and you will see the gorgeous results!</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair down to my lower back. It has started to feel so dry and constantly breaking. I want to cry after brushing my hair out and looking at my brush. After shampoo and conditioner I apply this balm generously and do my shaving needs then rinse out. There was no breakage after brushing! Worth it alone for that. After blow drying my hair looks so healthy. I also use their smoothing serum for my current fly aways, both products I found at my local CVS. Next time I go I&#x27;m picking up a couple more bottles of erasing balm because I dont want to be without and it&#x27;s cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li> We love this product . Can&#x27;t say enough about it. It makes your hair soft and I find that it makes your hair grow. My mother and I leave it in  and we find that our hair is growing much faster.</li>
            <li> Ahhh my hair needed that.  I had REALLY dry hair and today I feel like the lady in the sasoon commercial!  Got mine at Duane Reade for 6 dollars- but maybe it was less oz than this one.  Totally worth it getting that much conditioner in one jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll describe this in categories :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Smells exactly like you made a cup of plain tea,  exactly like the smell of a freshly brewed tea bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condition it left my hair: Soft,but so would any other conditioner.You can use a regular conditioner as a deep conditioning treatment.I don&#x27;t know why they called it a balm it seems like regular conditioner to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left it on my hair: For about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;price: reasonable, but kind of a waste considering like I said you can use any other conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again: No because there are many more conditioners,such as the ones you can buy at the 99 cent stores, which have name brand shampoo and conditioners only for $1.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This very easily seems to be only a conditioner and that they just called it something different to just make more money.</li>
