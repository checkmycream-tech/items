    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It was THE best purchase I made that day!</li>
            <li>The non-greasy texture and SPF 15 makes this lotion perfect for daytime.</li>
            <li>Very good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I also bought a shampoo from this company and also very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>I can bet anyone using this will also be very pleased with this and with the price!</li>
            <li>but all in all in great lotion.</li>
            <li>Great face lotion.</li>
            <li>but since I don&#x27;t, I am happy to have found this  product via Amazon.</li>
            <li>Best cheap day cream there is.</li>
            <li>I have paid $80 for &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; moisturizer and none has been any better than this one!</li>
            <li>love that!</li>
            <li>Seeing that Trader Joe&#x27;s has a great reputation, I was excited to see this moisturizer available for my face!</li>
            <li>because it provides a good balance--some type of sun protection without causing acne and stinging my eyes and importantly, does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>Best light SPF lotion for sensitive skin EVER!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown out so many hypoallergenic lotions that caused rashes and stinging</li>
            <li>Love, love this lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pop top</li>
            <li>And most of all does not burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li>so I guess it qualifies as being able to block UBV and UVA rays  Cons</li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick....</li>
            <li>The cream is light on the face, moisturizes well and also has SPF of 15.</li>
            <li>Some relevant background: -I have oily skin prone to acne.  </li>
            <li>: higher SPF would be nice, but I have a suspicion that higher SPF might cause more eye stinging?</li>
            <li>In addition, a lot of natural ingredients (with minimum chemicals) packed into this lotion for a good price (at TJ&#x27;s stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s good value because it&#x27;s cheap.   </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s been great and keeps my skin moisturized during the winter.</li>
            <li>Undoubtedly this stuff is good, the only stuff I could find with free shipping on Amazon that was paraben free, all natural, all that jazz and also had the SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion to wear over night while sleeping, as it does leave you with a little bit of shine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny- -</li>
            <li>On my first trip to Trader Joe&#x27;s I was looking for all the organic products I could find.</li>
            <li>fits exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>Overall: For me this my most used sunscreen</li>
            <li>Highly recommended -- just go to a Trader Joe&#x27;s store and purchase it for MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely seen a huge difference when I started using it.</li>
            <li>I get a feeling of alcohol or something else that is very drying on my skin.  </li>
            <li>my skin is very combination and very acne prone</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>this lotion never stings, never causes a rash and is just the right level of moisturizer and SPF that I need for daily use.</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight anymore, and it looks a lot more clear.</li>
            <li>-I live in San Francisco</li>
            <li>Unlike hand or body lotions (which this kind of dispenser is acceptable), you only require a small amount for face application.</li>
            <li>this stuff may be a little more rich/thick, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that big of a bump for the price.</li>
            <li>but I suppose people who buy on Amazon don&#x27;t have a TJs nearby); I use this product when I run/exercise and seems to hold up reasonably well; has combination of chemical and physical (zinc oxide) sunblock</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever bought to use, I have dry skin</li>
            <li>Really works on my dry skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I have particularly sensitive eyes, but for some reason, sunblocks seem to sting my eyes and make them look red.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena (sting&#x27;s my eyes, feels greasy), Avalon Organics (feels chalky and dry), Biore (nice Japanese brand with SPF 50, but can feel greasy after a few hours, I use this only when going to beach or something like that).  </li>

            <li> I get a feeling of alcohol or something else that is very drying on my skin.  I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, however the spf makes my skin break out. This is a great lotion to wear over night while sleeping, as it does leave you with a little bit of shine.</li>
            <li> my skin is very combination and very acne prone so I was hoping I would like this. I used about half the bottle. this definitely burns my skin a lot upon application, not unbearably, but its there. i also feel that it breaks me out  so I stopped using it :(</li>
            <li> Best light SPF lotion for sensitive skin EVER! I&#x27;ve thrown out so many hypoallergenic lotions that caused rashes and stinging it&#x27;s not even funny- - this lotion never stings, never causes a rash and is just the right level of moisturizer and SPF that I need for daily use.</li>
            <li> The cream is light on the face, moisturizes well and also has SPF of 15. I wish it had SPF30 but all in all in great lotion.</li>
            <li> Love, love this lotion</li>
            <li> On my first trip to Trader Joe&#x27;s I was looking for all the organic products I could find. I found this moisturizer. I paid aprox $4. It was THE best purchase I made that day! I have paid $80 for &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; moisturizer and none has been any better than this one! I will be an Amazon customer for life for this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Best cheap day cream there is.</li>
            <li> Seeing that Trader Joe&#x27;s has a great reputation, I was excited to see this moisturizer available for my face! I do not like a lot of unknown added ingrediants to what I put on my face or in my hair. I also bought a shampoo from this company and also very pleased with it! I can bet anyone using this will also be very pleased with this and with the price! The shipping was very quick....love that! Thank you...Laurie</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever bought to use, I have dry skin and this has helped me out alot. I&#x27;ve definitely seen a huge difference when I started using it. My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight anymore, and it looks a lot more clear.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion for my face. It is very light so it moisterizes without clogging pores.</li>
            <li> This is a quality lotion. It loses a star only because I don&#x27;t care for the dispensing method. It&#x27;s a pop top so towards the end of the bottle, I&#x27;ll need to keep it upside-down and/or find something thin to dig out the lotion.</li>
            <li> You can can get this same bottle at Trader Joe&#x27;s for four bucks. Why is it fourteen here... Rip-off alert.</li>
            <li> Great face lotion. I wish I lived close by to a Trader Joe&#x27;s but since I don&#x27;t, I am happy to have found this  product via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Made me breakout..don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Really works on my dry skin on my face.  Not greasy. And most of all does not burn my eyes.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The non-greasy texture and SPF 15 makes this lotion perfect for daytime. I have oily skin and the lightness of this lotion fits exactly what I need. In addition, a lot of natural ingredients (with minimum chemicals) packed into this lotion for a good price (at TJ&#x27;s stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is my first experience that a facial lotion comes with such an inconvenient dispenser. Unlike hand or body lotions (which this kind of dispenser is acceptable), you only require a small amount for face application. With this dispenser, it takes several shakes for the lotion to come out, and the opening can get a bit messy. I hope TJ&#x27;s will re-package this lotion into a pump dispenser, as the other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend this lotion in despite of the bottle issue.</li>
            <li> Undoubtedly this stuff is good, the only stuff I could find with free shipping on Amazon that was paraben free, all natural, all that jazz and also had the SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, at $2-something an ounce, the price is a bit steep. I&#x27;ll probably just stick to Lubriderm in the future... this stuff may be a little more rich/thick, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that big of a bump for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time and I&#x27;ve never had problems with it. Just be careful that it does not get too close to your eye. I put in on my eyelids once to help with dry eyes during the night and it made them burn a bit. Other than that it&#x27;s been great and keeps my skin moisturized during the winter.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. Highly recommended -- just go to a Trader Joe&#x27;s store and purchase it for MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li> Some relevant background: -I have oily skin prone to acne.  -I don&#x27;t think I have particularly sensitive eyes, but for some reason, sunblocks seem to sting my eyes and make them look red.  -I live in San Francisco so there&#x27;s not a lot of sun here, but I am outdoors a lot, about 2-3 hours per day and maybe 6 hours on weekends.  Overall: For me this my most used sunscreen because it provides a good balance--some type of sun protection without causing acne and stinging my eyes and importantly, does not feel greasy. In the past, I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena (sting&#x27;s my eyes, feels greasy), Avalon Organics (feels chalky and dry), Biore (nice Japanese brand with SPF 50, but can feel greasy after a few hours, I use this only when going to beach or something like that).  Overall, it&#x27;s good value because it&#x27;s cheap.   Pros: (sorry to repeat) feels non greasy, does not sting my eyes, no scent, cheap (I got this for $4 at local TJ&#x27;s but I suppose people who buy on Amazon don&#x27;t have a TJs nearby); I use this product when I run/exercise and seems to hold up reasonably well; has combination of chemical and physical (zinc oxide) sunblock so I guess it qualifies as being able to block UBV and UVA rays  Cons: higher SPF would be nice, but I have a suspicion that higher SPF might cause more eye stinging?</li>
