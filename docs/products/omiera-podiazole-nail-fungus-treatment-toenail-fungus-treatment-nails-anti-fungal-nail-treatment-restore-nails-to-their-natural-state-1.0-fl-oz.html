            <li>I am very happy I did!</li>
            <li>After doing some research, I decided that the prescription may not be the best option for me, so I searched out this product.  </li>
            <li>Understanding that there is no &amp;#34;quick-fix&amp;#34; to a nail fungus issue, I was impressed with how well this product worked, even if it did take months.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product!!</li>

            <li>but welcome.  </li>
            <li>Happy customer</li>
            <li>I was offered this Nail Fungus Treatment from Omiera Labs for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li>The good thing is there are no side effects.</li>
            <li>Having to paint your toe nails takes time specially since I&#x27;m not the best toe nail painter.</li>
            <li>(And my liver is happy too) :-)</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was chosen to receive this at a great, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  </li>
            <li>This Nail Fungus Treatment was delivered in protective packaging as well as in a nice product box.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lika a flaking kind of fungus, I believe.</li>
            <li>The scent is VERY strong.  </li>
            <li>really love to use it that way..</li>
            <li>I will say that this product seemed to nearly kill off the good skin around the nail as well, as from time to time you could just peel what seemed to be good skin away.  </li>
            <li>What it did do was manage to kill the skin around my toes and leave me with a lovely pastime of peeling the skin off.</li>
            <li>I love the Podiazole and would recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love to used this because my hand was itchy ,  </li>
            <li>It has been over 6 months since I stopped using it, and most of my toenails look like everyone else&#x27;s now.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen many cases of fungus on fingers and toes.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the Dr. Scholes</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and definitely recommend it as a successful treatment of nail fungus.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll have some shiny toe nails!</li>
            <li>My nail is now back to its healthy and happy state.</li>
            <li>Others have stated it works very quickly but not on me.  </li>
            <li>Too strong for me sometimes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, one must be prepared for the strong smell.</li>
            <li>This formula also whitens the nails and surprisingly, it smells quite pleasant, which is odd,</li>
            <li>This is the best way to store it, since it keeps light from penetrating the treatment, which can break down the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>so far so good, easy to use, seems to be helping</li>
            <li>The smell at first is very strong, but one gets used to it.</li>
            <li>Be aware it has a very strong odor which in the beginning almost made me stop using it.  </li>
            <li>There are detailed directions for using this Podiazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does smell pretty strong and potent.</li>
            <li>Always looking for a natural treatment for my ailments, but this toenail rot is tough stuff, so I was happy to get a great deal on this Nail Fungus Treatment, Toenail Fungus for my honest review.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I got toe fungus from going to the gym or something.</li>
            <li>Neither sound appealing, and this is why fungus can get really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The treatment is a combination of the best fungal natural treatments, including Tea Tree and acids and oils of various plants.</li>
            <li>The yellow isn&#x27;t as bright as it was and with continued use</li>
            <li>At $90/bottle, they should be full.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to try the nail fungus treatment on several of my toenails.  </li>
            <li>It is very oily based making it easy to apply on the toes with ease.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it remove unwanted fungus, but restored my nails to be healthy looking!</li>
            <li>My nails are white again and getting thinner, and looking so much better!  </li>
            <li>Save yourself the expense &amp; order Podiazole FIRST!</li>
            <li>I received this at a super low price for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>But what was funny is that one of my previously clean toes now has fungus.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They offer a 100% money back guarantee, so you are not risking anything to try this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, with the month lay-off, I could clearly see healthy tissue under the nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered another bottle and will continue treatment based on this success.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li>I was embarrassed by this and wanted it gone right away.</li>
            <li>specially since it&#x27;s not too much stronger than finger nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>This is a really cool product because you just put it on the toenail and it dries pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>So far it seems to already be working very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, seems very similar to much cheaper products.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many topical medications for my toe and none of them help</li>
            <li>Now my nail is growing back to healthy.</li>
            <li>I had toenail fungus on most of my toes, including the two big ones, for over 30 years.  </li>
            <li>My big toes are better.  </li>
            <li>At first I used the OTC treatment and eventually my nail fell off, and I thought the problem was over.  </li>
            <li>The glass dropper allows me to get the precise amount I need with no waste.  </li>
            <li>Then I purchased this amazing stuff and a month and a half later, my nails are healthy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have an odor as well that didnt bother me too much (because my nose and my toes dont spend that much time together!)  </li>
            <li>cleared them right up and is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Patience is key, you will see changes slowly so they are harder to notice.&lt;br /&gt;Apply twice a day, took almost a month for me to have perfect results!&lt;br /&gt;Patience and watchful eye, read reviews, it takes time but works!</li>
            <li>I will certainly edit this review to let you know how it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>the right is new bottle</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,just hope the product works as well as the price did.</li>
            <li>It is very overpowering and</li>
            <li>But I had tried another product and used it for months with very unsatisfactory results.  </li>
            <li>podiazole,worked very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Podiazole about 2-3 times a week for about a month and the transformation is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>No one wants to admit they have toenail fungus, but regardless of how you feel about it, you have to treat it or it can become a nightmare.  </li>
            <li>The bottle comes with a dropper and the treatment is very oily.</li>
            <li>I love wearing flip flops and will only do so when my toes are painted so that no one can see the yellow on my toes.</li>
            <li>New bottle just arrived and it is not full, dust all over the top and appears to be a returned item.</li>
            <li>Within a few days, my foot was looking better</li>
            <li>Pretty gross, I absolutely had to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but only for a short time</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong</li>
            <li>(I had lost nearly the entire nail on my big toe, and wasnt sure it would ever come back).</li>
            <li>I also,have been getting regular laser treatments,from Miricle laser.at Mercy medical Center,in Miami,and the technian,was super pleased,with the results.</li>
            <li>I have just started using this and can see a lighter nail color and less yellow in just a few days, It is going to be nice to be able to go bare foot this summer, as it has been a long time!!</li>
            <li>I like this product but after using it for several weeks I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping it will completely work with longer use.</li>
            <li>My big toes look like they are ready to fall off and my infection hasn&#x27;t gone anywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from the natural remedies to Jublia &amp; this out performs all of them...</li>
            <li>Now that my nail has grown back in, the fungus is still there, and I needed something to really knock it out.  </li>
            <li>my nail was back to healthy within a few weeks</li>
            <li>Most of the fungus on my nail is gone and there is only slight discoloration left.</li>
            <li>: Really file down your nails to start it will make the process go much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>still have a long way to go, but the results look promising.</li>
            <li>It did take me close to 4 months of applications to keep the fungus away and for the nail to grow back clear...</li>
            <li>But, with patience, its nearly all grown back in now.  </li>
            <li>The main listed ingredient is Undecylenic acid which is in medications for skin infections so this makes sense it would work against the super tough fungus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, or remember how often I was supposed to apply this, one time a day was all I could fit into my schedule, and I did it usually after a long soak in a bathtub, which probably reduced its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>I took a photo of a previously empty bottle that I added 30ml (1oz) of water to next to the new bottle.</li>

            <li> The main listed ingredient is Undecylenic acid which is in medications for skin infections so this makes sense it would work against the super tough fungus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, or remember how often I was supposed to apply this, one time a day was all I could fit into my schedule, and I did it usually after a long soak in a bathtub, which probably reduced its effectiveness.  </li>

            <li> It has some strong ingredients but the smell is not too bad.  </li>
            <li> While the price tag might seem a little steep up front, my large bottle got me through nearly 5 months of treatments, which isnt so bad once you break the cost down per month.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast shipping,just hope the product works as well as the price did.</li>
            <li> I swim, and I think from using the local pool I got some sort of fungus on the bottom of my foot.  My friend had used the Acdue product for acne before and suggested I look into Omiera Products for something to use.  I am very happy I did! Within a few days, my foot was looking better and I no longer feel like I need to hide it.</li>
            <li> Help get rid your self of any nail fungus and then to keep it in check..also helps keeps nails white..great to use before a pedicure and after..really love to use it that way..great product..would buy again..</li>
            <li> With patience and diligence, this product worked for me. I had received a prescription that I was leary of taking due to its side effects on the liver. After doing some research, I decided that the prescription may not be the best option for me, so I searched out this product.  While the price tag might seem a little steep up front, my large bottle got me through nearly 5 months of treatments, which isnt so bad once you break the cost down per month.  I will say this, you do have to be DILIGENT with this product.  You must use it twice daily while you still have ANY yellowing of the nail or nailbed.  If you skip it for a day or two, I believe it sets you back for awhile.  It does have an odor as well that didnt bother me too much (because my nose and my toes dont spend that much time together!)  I was careful to trim back the dead/infected nail frequently.  I will say that this product seemed to nearly kill off the good skin around the nail as well, as from time to time you could just peel what seemed to be good skin away.  It did take me close to 4 months of applications to keep the fungus away and for the nail to grow back clear... (I had lost nearly the entire nail on my big toe, and wasnt sure it would ever come back). But, with patience, its nearly all grown back in now.  Understanding that there is no &amp;#34;quick-fix&amp;#34; to a nail fungus issue, I was impressed with how well this product worked, even if it did take months.  (And my liver is happy too) :-)</li>
            <li> This Nail Fungus Treatment was delivered in protective packaging as well as in a nice product box.  The bottle had leaked a bit during shipping, but not a significant amount to bother with.  We purchased the Podiazole in a promotion for testing and review.  I was very pleased to try the nail fungus treatment on several of my toenails.  I have only been using for several weeks, but the treatment seems to be working.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> This nail treatment is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;My nails were bumpy and had a yellow tinge to them.&lt;br /&gt;This cleared them right up and is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Patience is key, you will see changes slowly so they are harder to notice.&lt;br /&gt;Apply twice a day, took almost a month for me to have perfect results!&lt;br /&gt;Patience and watchful eye, read reviews, it takes time but works!</li>
            <li> After using 2 bottles over a four month period, I was ready to give up and write a corresponding negative review. I recently went for a month without applying the product and paid little attention to my toe nails during that time. The product whitens the nails to a degree but also caused (in my case anyway) a chalky appearance on the surface of the nail so it was difficult to see what was really going on underneath. To my surprise, with the month lay-off, I could clearly see healthy tissue under the nails. I&#x27;ve been fighting nail fungus since the mid-&#x27;90&#x27;s, tried the oral anti-fugal with no real success. Have gone through countless home remedies such as Vicks Vaporub and tea-tree oil with no success. I&#x27;ve just ordered another bottle and will continue treatment based on this success.  4/22/15 update:  New bottle just arrived and it is not full, dust all over the top and appears to be a returned item. Very frustrating. At $90/bottle, they should be full. I took a photo of a previously empty bottle that I added 30ml (1oz) of water to next to the new bottle. Bottle on  the right is new bottle just arrived. Clearly short of the 1oz mark.</li>
            <li> This treatment also works as a preventative.  I decided to try it even though I had no noticeable fungus.  After a few uses I noticed that my toenails looked much healthier.  This is a great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I got toe fungus from going to the gym or something. Pretty gross, I absolutely had to get rid of it. Podiazole worked like a charm. My nail is now back to its healthy and happy state. Never gonna let this happen to me again.</li>
            <li> Oh my god it works! You just have to keep at it. I can feel it under the nail medicating the fungus. It&#x27;s been 6 months and such a big improvement. No more thick big toe nails.</li>
            <li> I like this product but after using it for several weeks I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  Others have stated it works very quickly but not on me.  The scent is VERY strong.  Too strong for me sometimes.  I am hoping it will completely work with longer use.</li>
            <li> Always looking for a natural treatment for my ailments, but this toenail rot is tough stuff, so I was happy to get a great deal on this Nail Fungus Treatment, Toenail Fungus for my honest review.  This is a really cool product because you just put it on the toenail and it dries pretty fast.  It has some strong ingredients but the smell is not too bad.  Since this product will take months to fully work, this is my initial review.  So far it seems to already be working very quickly.  The main listed ingredient is Undecylenic acid which is in medications for skin infections so this makes sense it would work against the super tough fungus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Really file down your nails to start it will make the process go much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updates to follow</li>
            <li> so far so good, easy to use, seems to be helping</li>
            <li> Is this product suppose to kill the skin all around the nail? My big toes look like they are ready to fall off and my infection hasn&#x27;t gone anywhere.</li>
            <li> After I got a pedicure, I noticed I was having a breakout on my foot from probably sharing the same cleaning utensils as others. I was embarrassed by this and wanted it gone right away. I read online about this product and decided to give it a shot. Not only did it remove unwanted fungus, but restored my nails to be healthy looking!</li>
            <li> I have had this for over 20 years, tried everything, and this product is working on a problem that has been getting worse over the years.  My nails are white again and getting thinner, and looking so much better!  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this and can see a lighter nail color and less yellow in just a few days, It is going to be nice to be able to go bare foot this summer, as it has been a long time!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several others without success.&lt;br /&gt;This has caused some changes already in the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and the results are good.&lt;br /&gt;My toenails had gotten quite bad over a period of several years.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing that I had tried had much effect until trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;I still have a long way to go, but the results look promising.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I&#x27;ve wasted quite a bit of money on these supposed cures. However since using this my nail appears whiter seems to be clearing it up.</li>
            <li> I have toe fungus on my 2 big toes. For the longest time I couldn&#x27;t find anything to get rid of it. Desperate, I looked on here if anything would work. Then I purchased this amazing stuff and a month and a half later, my nails are healthy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one must be prepared for the strong smell. It is very overpowering and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I bought this, it was $40. I thought that was a bit expensive for only 1 fl.oz but I should not complain - its working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to get rid of nail fungus. It takes a while to get rid of, but thats expected of these types of medications.</li>
            <li> Maybe I bought the wrong solution to my problem.  I don&#x27;t think this did anything for me but I used it about a month.</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping time. And great product. Look forward to using this every day</li>
            <li> It did not work for me at all. What it did do was manage to kill the skin around my toes and leave me with a lovely pastime of peeling the skin off. The smell at first is very strong, but one gets used to it. I have not gotten used to how it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many topical medications for my toe and none of them help but Podiazole actually helped and I now have a healthier looking toe nail.</li>
            <li> Honestly, seems very similar to much cheaper products. Have used for 6 weeks, will see if any change.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I actually have &amp;#34;nail fungus&amp;#34; but when I was younger and was playing sports I did end up at one point and time with athletes feet and had done made some issues with my toes. I did end up getting rid of the athletes feet problem but my nails are not as white as I would like them to be. I love wearing flip flops and will only do so when my toes are painted so that no one can see the yellow on my toes. Having to paint your toe nails takes time specially since I&#x27;m not the best toe nail painter. However since I&#x27;ve been using the Podiazole I&#x27;ve noticed some difference in my toe nails. The yellow isn&#x27;t as bright as it was and with continued use I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll have some shiny toe nails! The smell is a little strong but it&#x27;s totally worth it specially since it&#x27;s not too much stronger than finger nail polish remover. I love the Podiazole and would recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I used it once each day for several weeks and the fungus is now gone.  Be aware it has a very strong odor which in the beginning almost made me stop using it.  But I had tried another product and used it for months with very unsatisfactory results.  It would seem to have cured the problem but  as soon as I stopped using the drops the fungus would reappear within a day or two.  This Podiazole treatment is different in that it actually cured it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend if you can get past the odor.  The smell is strong but only for a short time and then it dissipates.</li>
            <li> I love to used this because my hand was itchy ,  i have an allergy everytime im eating any seafoods . and this is really great!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 months. The directions was to cut the nail but I&#x27;d didn&#x27;t. Over the usage of time the nail softened so I could cut it down.  Now my nail is growing back to healthy. I&#x27;m very happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I was offered this Nail Fungus Treatment from Omiera Labs for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. I ordered a bottle because I have this weird whitness on my big toe nails under the nail polish. It&#x27;s lika a flaking kind of fungus, I believe. So I took my polish off and have been applying this Fungus Treatment for almost 2 weeks now and the white is literally gone. I definitely recommend this Nail Fungus reatment from Omiera Labs if you think that you have a fungus on your nails.</li>
            <li> works but have to be dedicated to applying it at least twice a day</li>
            <li> excellent. my nail was back to healthy within a few weeks</li>
            <li> My expensive bottle broke into a million pieces after one day of using it. I would recommend this bottle NOT be made out of glass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from the natural remedies to Jublia &amp; this out performs all of them... COMBINED. Save yourself the expense &amp; order Podiazole FIRST!</li>
            <li> I had toenail fungus on most of my toes, including the two big ones, for over 30 years.  I tried it for 6 months.  2 bottles.  I would apply with an artists paint brush once a day.  It cleared up half of my toes.  My big toes are better.  But what was funny is that one of my previously clean toes now has fungus.  It has been over 6 months since I stopped using it, and most of my toenails look like everyone else&#x27;s now.  I don&#x27;t know, or remember how often I was supposed to apply this, one time a day was all I could fit into my schedule, and I did it usually after a long soak in a bathtub, which probably reduced its effectiveness.  I am going to buy a third bottle and finish the rest of my toes. ----------- I am adding to this review a couple of years later.  The second bottle did not help in the least.   I am starting to think that the only cure would be systemic, which means a pill that I hear hurts the liver.  This method works for a short time, but at least for me, after 2 bottles, it was a failure.</li>
            <li> podiazole,worked very well. I also,have been getting regular laser treatments,from Miricle laser.at Mercy medical Center,in Miami,and the technian,was super pleased,with the results. SO,it has certainly,been worth,the investment,because,it WORKS !!</li>
            <li> Omiera Labs Nail Fungus Treatment is incredible. I&#x27;ve tried the over-the-counter nail fungus treatments but never saw the results like I did with Podiazole Nail Fungus Treatment. I was diagnosed with diabetes earlier this year, and developed nail fungus making my toenails look terrible. I usually did a foot soak and dried my feet and applied Podiazole Nail Fungus Treatment.  It is very oily based making it easy to apply on the toes with ease.  Then, I rested up to wait for it to absorb and dry. My pinky toes nail looked so terrible with its darkened look and very thick nail growth.  I&#x27;ve used Podiazole about 2-3 times a week for about a month and the transformation is very noticeable. My toe nails are looking a healthier color and the shrek-looking nail thickness is totally gone.  I received this at a super low price for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment I have found.  I wish it would work faster but it is working.  The good thing is there are no side effects.</li>
            <li> No one wants to admit they have toenail fungus, but regardless of how you feel about it, you have to treat it or it can become a nightmare.  I worked as a licensed cosmetologist for almost a decade and I have seen many cases of fungus on fingers and toes.  Back in the day, there were only 2 options, an OTC treatment, that works poorly, or going to the doctor and taking a prescription for many months that is bad for your liver.  Neither sound appealing, and this is why fungus can get really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year or so ago, I damaged my toenail and it separated, slightly, from my nail bed.  Somehow, I manged to pick up a bit of fungus, myself.  At first I used the OTC treatment and eventually my nail fell off, and I thought the problem was over.  Now that my nail has grown back in, the fungus is still there, and I needed something to really knock it out.  When I saw this, by Omiera Labs, I had to try it, because they have wonderful products.  It arrived in retail packaging.  The treatment is stored in a cobalt blue bottle with glass dropper.  This is the best way to store it, since it keeps light from penetrating the treatment, which can break down the ingredients.  The glass dropper allows me to get the precise amount I need with no waste.  This formula also whitens the nails and surprisingly, it smells quite pleasant, which is odd, but welcome.  There are detailed directions for using this Podiazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They offer a 100% money back guarantee, so you are not risking anything to try this amazing product.  Just be sure to follow the directions and within a few weeks there should be a dramatic increase in the appearance of the nail, but remember this has to be used for 6 to 12 months to completely rid yourself of fungus.  I am very pleased with this product and definitely recommend it as a successful treatment of nail fungus.  I am so glad I was chosen to receive this at a great, promotional price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.  I would give this 10 stars if I could, 1 for each toenail!uld give this 10 stars if I could, 1 for each toenail!</li>
            <li> The treatment is a combination of the best fungal natural treatments, including Tea Tree and acids and oils of various plants. I have a persistent nail fungus from working out on Judo mats for years, so I am thinking this will cure the fungus. The bottle comes with a dropper and the treatment is very oily. I usually drop the treatment over my nails while I hang me foot in the bathtub. The treatment stings a little which I interpret as working. Its been a few weeks and I expect to see result in perhaps a month once my nails grow out. It does smell pretty strong and potent. It takes some getting used to. I will certainly edit this review to let you know how it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Lousy. Leaked from the bottle, all inside the package. ...</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works. Most of the fungus on my nail is gone and there is only slight discoloration left. Much better than the Dr. Scholes I purchased a while back. The only drawback is the medicine smell.</li>
            <li> Bottle broke and they gave me a discount on my next bottle. Happy customer</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference. For the price.........Oh well</li>
