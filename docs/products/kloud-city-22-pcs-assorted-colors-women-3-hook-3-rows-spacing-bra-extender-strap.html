            <li>I received the item pretty quick</li>
            <li>price was right.</li>
            <li>I sewed them right onto my bras.  </li>
            <li>Not quite right sizes for bras i needed them for</li>
            <li>Everything was as described and shipped quickly, but one of the extenders was missing its hooks, and it&#x27;s my favorite color!</li>
            <li>More than I could possibly need.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These do exactly that</li>
            <li>Normally I buy a whole new set of bras when I&#x27;m pregnant, but with these hooks, I&#x27;m comfortable despite my rib cage expanding.  </li>
            <li>I Love them because you never know when may buy a bra that is not exactly the right size.</li>
            <li>super soft.</li>
            <li>and I didn’t even think to tell him that the piece with the clasps needed to be a certain width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>Have worn several and they held up just fine.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Made very well.</li>
            <li>The Colors are way off and very close to one another....  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much....</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very useful, well made and lots of colors to match all my bras and some I&#x27;ll have in the future</li>
            <li>works great for those extra small bras</li>
            <li>They work great, haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them slipping off or coming undone.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed being pregnant and needing extra room in the ribcage.</li>
            <li>Useful assortment of colors but could use more of the basics of black, white and tan, as well.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and wanted to postpone buying a nursing bra or bigger bra, but I needed an extra inch or two right now.</li>
            <li>one thing I’m not crazy about is that the entire piece is almost twice the size of my bra strap.</li>
            <li>I just needed a little bit more space and instead of buy new bra, the extensions were cheaper.</li>
            <li>I checked all of the other ones and they were all fine.</li>
            <li>Good value, does what they&#x27;re needed for, odd color assortment, but not really bothered by that.</li>
            <li>started swimming and bra size increased, didn&#x27;t want to by new bras, these solved the problem</li>
            <li>Not sure if I used too many though...</li>
            <li>I gained some weight recently and didn&#x27;t want to have to spend a ton of money on a whole new set of bras.</li>
            <li>The clips can be a little tight to put on or take off, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing, as it keeps the extenders in place.</li>
            <li>if you have a favorite 3 hook bra (or several) and the reach to the furthest row has slightly exceeded its grasp (grins)</li>
            <li>although sometimes I find they release unexpectedly....</li>
            <li>In other words how about getting rid of some of the many variations of pink and adding maybe a coral or orange tone.</li>
            <li>I think at least a bright red and a deep red would be much better than green, but I didn&#x27;t receive any red.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;ll dye the green ones black or brown. :)</li>
            <li>Price was right, but the width of these does not fit my bras exactly - these are slightly wider than my bras.  </li>
            <li>It really depends on the little guys, because each hook and loop package is individual and different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Useful assortment of colors but could use more of the basics of black, white and tan, as well.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and wanted to postpone buying a nursing bra or bigger bra, but I needed an extra inch or two right now.</li>
            <li> one thing I’m not crazy about is that the entire piece is almost twice the size of my bra strap.</li>
            <li> I just needed a little bit more space and instead of buy new bra, the extensions were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I checked all of the other ones and they were all fine.</li>
            <li> Good value, does what they&#x27;re needed for, odd color assortment, but not really bothered by that.</li>
            <li> started swimming and bra size increased, didn&#x27;t want to by new bras, these solved the problem</li>
            <li> Not sure if I used too many though...</li>
            <li> I gained some weight recently and didn&#x27;t want to have to spend a ton of money on a whole new set of bras.</li>
            <li> The clips can be a little tight to put on or take off, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing, as it keeps the extenders in place.</li>
            <li> if you have a favorite 3 hook bra (or several) and the reach to the furthest row has slightly exceeded its grasp (grins)</li>
            <li> although sometimes I find they release unexpectedly....</li>
            <li> In other words how about getting rid of some of the many variations of pink and adding maybe a coral or orange tone.</li>
            <li> I think at least a bright red and a deep red would be much better than green, but I didn&#x27;t receive any red.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ll dye the green ones black or brown. :)</li>
            <li> Price was right, but the width of these does not fit my bras exactly - these are slightly wider than my bras.  </li>
            <li> It really depends on the little guys, because each hook and loop package is individual and different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hot pink one is the only one missing its hooks.</li>
            <li> I use them for extending tight back but also for replaced damaged hooks.</li>
            <li> I definitley recommend if your bra is just a tad bit too tight, this will definitley give you the little bit of extra room and prevent that back fat oozing out from the sides!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount and quality for such little cost.</li>
            <li> However the quality is as expected, I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> There are several shades of green, which I found odd.</li>
            <li> I thought the width was supposed to be standard, but I guess there are subtle differences.  </li>
            <li> Odd,</li>
            <li> Came on time but they are slightly wider set than any bra I have</li>
            <li> All my bras are 3 clasp, but they’re on about 1” of fabric – these are almost twice that size so I have to do a little bit of twisting to get them on there.</li>
            <li> just wish they were a little longer by one hook, as I have to go in 2 hooks so the hooks don&#x27;t press into my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it bunches up a little. .</li>
            <li> The hooks are a little farther spaced, but it still works.  </li>
            <li> Saved my bras that were a little to small.</li>
            <li> These are poorly made and do not fit any of my bras.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, they can get a little itchy or twisted.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, as I had ordered the two-hook version of these and they were all different.</li>
            <li> It is usable, but not perfect.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed.</li>

            <li> Works good with my adore me bras colors go good with there colors</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, was as described and fit the bras….pleased with purchase and seller.</li>
            <li> every color that could match my current bras. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> Nice to have the color choices</li>
            <li> Lots and lots of colors! I have enough to go with every bra I own and every bra I may own in the future! They work great. Glad I bought them. My bras feel so much better now when I wear them. I wish I would have ordered them sooner!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. Any colors work with any bra. I just needed a little bit more space and instead of buy new bra, the extensions were cheaper.</li>
            <li> NEEDS MORE COLOR SELECTIONS IN PACK</li>
            <li> Just what I needed being pregnant and needing extra room in the ribcage. Great price and I LOVE THE COLORS!!!!</li>
            <li> Tremendous assortment of colors. Work great. More than I could possibly need.</li>
            <li> Never knew these existed. Glad I got them.</li>
            <li> works well and love that there are so many color choices too.</li>
            <li> Plenty of colors and shades to match everything I need</li>
            <li> Great product works with all my bras and washes well.</li>
            <li> This works like you would expect them to.  You get a variety of colors at a really good price.  It takes awhile to get the product, but for the price and quantity...you can&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
            <li> There is just about any color of bra extender you will ever need and they are good quality!</li>
            <li> I received the item pretty quick and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase. The price was great and the quality is good. They&#x27;re perfect for my needs! Now I can wear all my bras!</li>
            <li> not too many I can use but price was right.</li>
            <li> Great. Can ear all my bras again.</li>
            <li> They do their job well. Very well made and comes in many colors so you won&#x27;t have a problem with matching up your bras with them.</li>
            <li> started swimming and bra size increased, didn&#x27;t want to by new bras, these solved the problem</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I sewed them right onto my bras.  Seeings how I have colored bras, I found a close color match for each one.  Gave me about 2&amp;#34; more of circumference.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and wanted to postpone buying a nursing bra or bigger bra, but I needed an extra inch or two right now. These do exactly that – give me the extra room I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I’m not crazy about is that the entire piece is almost twice the size of my bra strap. All my bras are 3 clasp, but they’re on about 1” of fabric – these are almost twice that size so I have to do a little bit of twisting to get them on there. I also have to clasp from the front now because there’s no way I’ll line these up without looking. My husband got these for me and I didn’t even think to tell him that the piece with the clasps needed to be a certain width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than $10 for a bunch of these is totally worth it. They’re not the perfect solution but they do what I need them to do.</li>
            <li> What genius thought of this? They work great, haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them slipping off or coming undone. And so many colors! Sturdy, functional, just a brilliant product.</li>
            <li> These bra extension are awesome. The quality and the variety of colors are a great price. I Love them because you never know when may buy a bra that is not exactly the right size. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love the variety of colors. Made very well.</li>
            <li> I definitley recommend if your bra is just a tad bit too tight, this will definitley give you the little bit of extra room and prevent that back fat oozing out from the sides!</li>
            <li> Useful assortment of colors but could use more of the basics of black, white and tan, as well. Items in packet aren&#x27;t standard but most could be made to hook.</li>
            <li> Bought a set of these for both myself and my sister. wow we are in love with these and the hook ups have been used and washed time after time and they hold up. what a sensational price for so many items and you can have one to match each of your bras. fantastic.</li>
            <li> These are perfect, make sure to measure your bra. So many colors so cheap arrived on time and as ordered</li>
            <li> Fits all my bras at a great price. Also very cute stocking stuffers and great for pregnancy and post pregnancy</li>
            <li> Nice variety of colors; plus gave me the added length I needed/</li>
            <li> I am a chunky person and these are great when that perfect bra almost fits and dosnt come One size bigger</li>
            <li> Received very fast and in perfect condition.  The colors shown are not the colors received.  Multiples of one color received.</li>
            <li> Saved my bras that were a little to small.</li>
            <li> Great colors, matches all my bras, comfortable fit as well. I would recommend this product to any woman who needs bra extenders</li>
            <li> The Colors are way off and very close to one another....  In other words how about getting rid of some of the many variations of pink and adding maybe a coral or orange tone. I&#x27;m still left having to find the colors I though I ordered with this collection. However the quality is as expected, I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last but they seem to be sturdy enough....although I haven&#x27;t had time to wash yet.</li>
            <li> the assortment given was great, for every bra that I have, I was able to find a matching extender. Great!</li>
            <li> Everything was as described and shipped quickly, but one of the extenders was missing its hooks, and it&#x27;s my favorite color! Was really disappointed. I checked all of the other ones and they were all fine. The hot pink one is the only one missing its hooks.</li>
            <li> I simply love these bra extenders. Also the colors are wonderful. Shipment arrived quickly too! Thank you so much....</li>
            <li> if you have a favorite 3 hook bra (or several) and the reach to the furthest row has slightly exceeded its grasp (grins) don&#x27;t toss it/them away or take it/them out and just sigh, this is a fantastic collection of extenders in just about every color under the sun.&lt;br /&gt;It will extend the hook/eyes by 3 more rows. Giving you that breathing room you need.</li>
            <li> Work AMAZING - tons of colors - arrived quickly</li>
            <li> what can I say. they have no stretch to them, but the price and colour selection is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Works as described and lots of colors to choose from!  Also a great bargain.  Received enough pieces to share with my daughter!</li>
            <li> These are poorly made and do not fit any of my bras.  Would never purchase again.  Uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great collection of extensions, work well</li>
            <li> Snaps tend to come undone on these really easy</li>
            <li> I ordered these to extend all my bras because I had gained weight! They, like the 4 snap design have many colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> The colors are great and match most of my bras! I will be buying the 4-hook ones too!!</li>
            <li> These worked for my girl friend.  She liked the product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product. The fabric is amazing. Fast shipping. lots to work with.</li>
            <li> like them. just wish they were a little longer by one hook, as I have to go in 2 hooks so the hooks don&#x27;t press into my back.&lt;br /&gt;as described. prompt delivery. would recommend them. Great while your waiting to lose that weight,.</li>
            <li> Really Great, works well!</li>
            <li> I now have an extender for any color bra I own!</li>
            <li> Good assortment. I don&#x27;t even have any purple bras, but I think more shades of purple would be a good idea. There are several shades of green, which I found odd. I think at least a bright red and a deep red would be much better than green, but I didn&#x27;t receive any red. I did like that there were three different shades of nude in the assortment I received. Think I&#x27;ll dye the green ones black or brown. :)</li>
            <li> And when did I got from a 44 to a 46?  Agggh!  While I diet, I guess these will keep me from buying more bras.  Do need to get some that are 4 hook.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love These for all My Bras!!</li>
            <li> Thanks, a lot of color for sure</li>
            <li> Not quite right sizes for bras i needed them for</li>
            <li> works great for those extra small bras</li>
            <li> Perfect assortment of colors. They work great. Much better than paying 2.99 for one. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great quality &amp; the verity of colors in the 22pcs pack is pretty much endless.</li>
            <li> this was a very good buy, with some extra to give away, now that my friends tried the product they want to but too,  GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> Awesome! I have sets of these in 3-hook and 2-hook in my lingerie drawer and in my luggage in case I ever need them. Got all of the colors shown and no duplicates. Have worn several and they held up just fine. Seriously great purchase for the price and now I&#x27;m not hunting for one when I need it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Nothing really special about them but they do their job.</li>
            <li> This was a very good buy for the product offered. I save a lot on these and will not have to purchase any additional at all.</li>
            <li> So needed and so helpful....although sometimes I find they release unexpectedly....Not sure if I used too many though...</li>
            <li> Excellent. Well sewn. I like the variety of colors. Perhaps one should be able to choose between pastel and bright colors.</li>
            <li> These are not the best quality, but pretty amazing considering the price.</li>
            <li> This color assortment worked well for me.  For the price and amount of extenders available, you couldn&#x27;t beat the offer!</li>
            <li> Very happy with them. They work and look great.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for people who cant find the right bra size ( not cup wise ). They are very easy to put on. You can hook multiple together if you need to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they can get a little itchy or twisted. It really depends on the little guys, because each hook and loop package is individual and different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came with a glasses/screen wipe. Odd, but i actually needed it.</li>
            <li> Came on time but they are slightly wider set than any bra I have so it bunches up a little. .</li>
            <li> The clips can be a little tight to put on or take off, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing, as it keeps the extenders in place.</li>
            <li> love the colors and fit!</li>
            <li> Good value, does what they&#x27;re needed for, odd color assortment, but not really bothered by that.</li>
            <li> Exactly how it was described arrived on time , items work perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount and quality for such little cost. I will be getting the two loop also.</li>
            <li> Very useful, well made and lots of colors to match all my bras and some I&#x27;ll have in the future</li>
            <li> I bought these to make my bra more comfortable during pregnancy.  Normally I buy a whole new set of bras when I&#x27;m pregnant, but with these hooks, I&#x27;m comfortable despite my rib cage expanding.  Such a blessing!</li>
            <li> I use these on my Comexim bras (a Polish brand).  The hooks are a little farther spaced, but it still works.  It helps prolong the life of my bras, and means I don&#x27;t have to pay to send them back for the next band size up!</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed.  A great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Great product and they were shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> Great colors and fit all of my 3hook bras</li>
            <li> this is problem solved very good qualityi love these</li>
            <li> Assorted colors? Not really. I got about five colors total - lot of multiples of the same color. Disappointed, as I had ordered the two-hook version of these and they were all different. If I hadn&#x27;t just has surgery and needed them now, I would have returned them and asked for a replacement. I suspect the fault lies with the seller.</li>
            <li> These are a well worth their weight. I use them for extending tight back but also for replaced damaged hooks. The fact there are an assortment of colors is perfect.  Pricing is great,</li>
