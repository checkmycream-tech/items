            <li>Would love it if it could be made a bit stronger</li>

            <li>It is a good price and exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I love the scent but this is just a bit too light for me.</li>
            <li>I think the  amount will last for a long time too, because it down&#x27;t take much to smell wonderful :)</li>

            <li>I was better off theowing baby oil on and calling if  Amber white!!!</li>

            <li>And the cost is relatively reasonable.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Fragrance is better turned out versus an amber that has to be mixed with other scents.  </li>
            <li>This Amber White is very well turned out.  </li>
            <li>But anyways sadly sadly sadly, not what I expected at all.</li>

            <li> This oil is very watered down.</li>
            <li> I received the oil earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time, is soft and subtle, musky and can be worn for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I will be hesitant before I order an unknown through Amazon.</li>
            <li> its very minimal and too soft, almost watered down :/ .</li>
            <li> Most boring scent I&#x27;ve ever come across..</li>
            <li> If you are not sure about this oil, well let me say this.</li>
            <li> after you put it still is too subtle to even tell that you have it on.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Very faint scent...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am disappointed because the smell just isn&#x27;t there.  </li>
            <li> Horrible!!!! Don&#x27;t order</li>

            <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with this oil. Only took 2 days for me to receive it. Very high quality &amp; isn&#x27;t watered down. The scent will last all day. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> This oil is very watered down. The scent is very light. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine was wearing it and asked her where she got it. Reminded me of a similar scent I used to wear. Smells great and lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for several months and I always get compliments when I wear it. For those who say that they can&#x27;t smell it on themselves  but others do...sign of an excellent fragrance. The more you put on the stronger the scent but never overpowering. You have to remember body chemistry is diff for every person and if this fragrance doesn&#x27;t work try same fragrance made by another manufacturer. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I Love it I will be ordering from them again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using oils for many years.  I am so impressed with this oil. The fragrance is wonderful. This is the type oil that will last until you shower or could easily mix with lotions.  Quality product!</li>
            <li> Lovely..... I first read about this in a magazine. The Australian actress Toni Collette  wears it  and it just sounded like a nice fragrance to try. It lasts a very long time, is soft and subtle, musky and can be worn for any occasion. I think the  amount will last for a long time too, because it down&#x27;t take much to smell wonderful :)</li>
            <li> I received the oil earlier than I expected. Which I believe is because it ships from Nj and I&#x27;m in Philly. But anyways sadly sadly sadly, not what I expected at all. I can barely smell the scent its very minimal and too soft, almost watered down :/ . I wish I could know if this was a one time mistake but it&#x27;s my first order from this company</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. It is a good price and exactly what I was expecting. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This oil is high quality. Smells wonderful. Exactly what I was looking for. Will definitely order this perfume oil again.</li>
            <li> This Amber White is very well turned out.  It came with a matching blue drawstring pouch.  It smells great and silage is excellent.  The type of Amber White that can be worn on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is better turned out versus an amber that has to be mixed with other scents.  All in all it&#x27;s very tasteful.  I definetely recommend this amber.  And the cost is relatively reasonable.</li>
            <li> is this the same amber white made with akims oil?</li>
            <li> Most boring scent I&#x27;ve ever come across..</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!  I have never gotten so many compliments on my scent before.</li>
            <li> If you are not sure about this oil, well let me say this. I get so many compliments about how good I smell at least twice a day. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> If I could give it no stars I would... They steal ur money!!!! I was better off theowing baby oil on and calling if  Amber white!!! This stuff they sell smells like nothing at all!!! Horrible!!!! Don&#x27;t order</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and smells like how I remember.</li>
            <li> Very faint scent...after you put it still is too subtle to even tell that you have it on. I love the scent but this is just a bit too light for me. Would love it if it could be made a bit stronger</li>
            <li> I was told that the Amber White Perfume Oil purchased through Scentsational Shoppe was the best.  Unfortunately, I am disappointed because the smell just isn&#x27;t there.  I have had a few people tell me I smell good but I can&#x27;t smell it and half the fun for me is to able to smell what I am wearing.  I will be hesitant before I order an unknown through Amazon.</li>
