            <li>Work great for me with my toddler&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Hold my toddler&#x27;s fine hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>The quality of the elasticity in these bands were not as good as they used to be.</li>
            <li>Great to have so many</li>
            <li>Work great for pigtails in my one-year-old&#x27;s really fine hair.  </li>
            <li>These break so easy!</li>
            <li>I had a pack of these that took us forever to use up, because I was able to use each rubber band more than once.  </li>
            <li>Colors are cute too.</li>
            <li>I bought these because the colors are cute</li>
            <li>Cheap and break easily!</li>
            <li>The two-toned elastics break easily where the colors meet.</li>
            <li>goodproduct but breaks easily</li>
            <li>These things break so easily and pulled my hair.</li>
            <li>These are available at Walmart for $2.96.</li>
            <li>They hold great only if they do not break first.</li>
            <li>Great elastics to give my toddler small ponytails &amp; pigtails.  </li>
            <li>Still, they&#x27;re the perfect size for my little girls&#x27; tiny ponytails.</li>
            <li>I tried these on my two year old&#x27;s rather fine hair.</li>
            <li>They break easily but when you get 500 in a pack, that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>These are so handy for little girls&#x27; hairdos.</li>
            <li>We love them compared to other elastics.  </li>
            <li>They are single-color bands of a completely different material than the original type I used to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these hair elastics for the past two years on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair, so I was excited to see them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They will snap if you stretch them too far, but for the price - it doesn&#x27;t really matter!</li>
            <li>Simple and quick to use and does not pull or tangle their hair.</li>
            <li>These will last a long time as you can use them more than 1 day.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty much single-use though, as they either break or are stretched out when you take them out at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I like that they will break easily as one of my girls has super sensitive hair and the slightest pull sends her to tears, so if it is hard to get out without pulling I will just break it without a second thought.</li>
            <li>My three year old is sensitve and cries &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; for any hair pulling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that they are &amp;#34;ouch less,&amp;#34; but they are also pointless.</li>

            <li> Cheap and break easily!</li>
            <li> These break so easy! Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> The two-toned elastics break easily where the colors meet. I tried these on my two year old&#x27;s rather fine hair. They hold great only if they do not break first. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> My daughter will actually keep these in her hair, unlike every other thing we have tried. They are pretty much single-use though, as they either break or are stretched out when you take them out at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> These are available at Walmart for $2.96. That being said, I like the product. They break easily but when you get 500 in a pack, that&#x27;s not a big deal. I like that they will break easily as one of my girls has super sensitive hair and the slightest pull sends her to tears, so if it is hard to get out without pulling I will just break it without a second thought.</li>
            <li> I had a pack of these that took us forever to use up, because I was able to use each rubber band more than once.  When I got the new pack, I was disappointed to discover that they&#x27;re much more fragile now.  Sometimes they break before I even get them in my girls&#x27; hair!  And forget about using them twice.  They break every time I try.  Still, they&#x27;re the perfect size for my little girls&#x27; tiny ponytails.</li>
            <li> These work well for me. I can get 2-3 uses before they break. Colors are cute too. Hold my toddler&#x27;s fine hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> goodproduct but breaks easily</li>
            <li> My two year old has thin hair and regular hair bands won&#x27;t hold her ponny tails.  These elastics hold her hair in place for a day or two, longer if her hair is in braids.  My three year old is sensitve and cries &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; for any hair pulling.  These elastics break apart after they have done their job.  Often the multiple twists will keep the elastic in place even after is broken.  I like that they break apart at ease when I&#x27;m removing them.  I don&#x27;t have to rip out hair to get them out.  I&#x27;ve had maybe 5 break as I&#x27;m putting them in out of 100 pack.  I&#x27;m buying these again.</li>
            <li> These are so handy for little girls&#x27; hairdos. Simple and quick to use and does not pull or tangle their hair. Great to have so many and we didn&#x27;t have to worry about losing a few here and there.</li>
            <li> Work great for pigtails in my one-year-old&#x27;s really fine hair.  They don&#x27;t pull and they stay in as well as you can expect rubber bands to stay in a toddler&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used these elastics on my daughter who is biracial for a couple years now.  We love them compared to other elastics.  The only bummer was that I ordered the &amp;#34;two-tone&amp;#34;, which is what we had before, and I received the solid colored ones.  No biggie, but was a tad disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great elastics to give my toddler small ponytails &amp; pigtails.  These will last a long time as you can use them more than 1 day.  They will snap if you stretch them too far, but for the price - it doesn&#x27;t really matter!</li>
            <li> The quality of the elasticity in these bands were not as good as they used to be.</li>
            <li> Bands pop throughout the day</li>
            <li> These are the only pony tail holders that I have found that will hold my daughter&#x27;s thin hair.  I do have to use 2-3 at a time because they do break if stretched out.</li>
            <li> Work great for me with my toddler&#x27;s hair. Definitely a one time use band for me because they break whenever I take them out.</li>
            <li> I bought these because the colors are cute and I thought they were somewhat like rubber bands. Rubber bands pull out my hair so I was looking for something easier on my hair. They are not it. These things break so easily and pulled my hair. The only way for them not to bust is to double them. Only problem is somehow, even without using hair products, these fuse together so you have to yank them off of your hair. It&#x27;s really odd. Pretty colors, but crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these hair elastics for the past two years on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair, so I was excited to see them on Amazon. I specifically purchased these because the photo depicts the two-tone bands (half white, half color of rainbow variety). The bands that arrived, however, are not the ones pictured. They are single-color bands of a completely different material than the original type I used to use. These new bands are very slick and slip out of my daughter&#x27;s hair within an hour. It&#x27;s true that they are &amp;#34;ouch less,&amp;#34; but they are also pointless.</li>
