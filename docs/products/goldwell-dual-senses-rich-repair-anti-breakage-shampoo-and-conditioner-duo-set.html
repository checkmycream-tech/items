            <li>Good value, excellent for highlighted dry, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>After 1 wash, it was tangle-free, super easy to comb, leaving my hair shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Both shampoo n conditioner was mild and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li>but i have switched to wen, and its better than anything i have ever used.</li>
            <li>It was a better deal to order it offline than in a store for me</li>
            <li>my hair felt nicer after using it, it isn&#x27;t my favorite smell for a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad she did.</li>
            <li>A much better deal than buying from my salon.</li>
            <li>all that matters... :)</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo,.</li>
            <li>The packaging was ok.  </li>
            <li>I really do love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The conditioner seems okay, so I&#x27;ll probably continue to use that</li>
            <li>Really love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and what it does for my hair</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I found it online</li>
            <li>Its a great product but not this particular bottle.</li>
            <li>She also reports that the fragrance is pleasant, something she was very concerned about when ordering this product online.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The price was much better than elsewhere, and they have free shipping for Prime Members, so I won&#x27;t buy them from any where else.</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean, thicker and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, my hair wasn&#x27;t blow drying easily - it was getting knotted and stuck in my brush, which never happens.</li>
            <li>The Rich Repair is a gentle shampoo/conditioner good for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>re-ordered and still same great</li>
            <li>A salon used this on my hair and l liked it so much that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Great buy on amazon, paid same amount as I would for 1/2 the amount at salon.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this size available at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to find this product online</li>
            <li>This product helps make my highlights last longer and is so good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, love goldwell ptoducts.</li>
            <li>I found myself losing way more hair than normal after using it for just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily on colored hair and the hair looks and feels healthy!</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner was really good at keeping it soft and smooth til my next wash.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and it keeps my hair strong and soft - not coarse (like some repair/strengthening shampoos tend to do).</li>
            <li>I will certainly recommend to all!</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price for the two bottles.</li>
            <li>The pump action allows for precise amounts each time.</li>
            <li>They work great for thick, curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt much softer and smoother the first time I used it, but not only that, the softness lasted for more than one day.</li>
            <li>My hair feels like fresh and new every morning,noon and night.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt SO damaged after the second dye - it would knot so easily</li>
            <li>It feels alot more silky if I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and well worth the value!!</li>
            <li>Never did I think coarse hair could look so shiny and fine...</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I had very damaged hair</li>
            <li>I then purchased this and noticed that the shampoo was very diluted</li>
            <li>- I think it helped as much as it could.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes and repairs</li>
            <li>These came as expected and it more than I bargained for.  </li>
            <li>Really fast shipping/delivery.</li>
            <li>I ordered these based on my hair stylist&#x27;s recommendation and I really like them.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>Gives my hair so much volume and texture.</li>
            <li>My hair feels back to normal and does not knot nearly as easily.</li>
            <li>This is my third time purchasing Goldwell Dual Senses Rich Repair Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Felt like it dried my hair even more than it was.</li>
            <li>I ordered what was on the picture, volumizing shampoo and conditioner, I got what is in the description, which are 2 different items, I want what is in the picture, not description, please mail me the right shampoo</li>
            <li>The item was suppose to be new but arrived used.</li>
            <li>I use this Dual Senses Rich Shampoo and Conditioner daily on curly hair and this product is the only one that keeps the frizz away.</li>
            <li>The large bottles last for quite a while.</li>
            <li>My wife says that within the first few uses of this product she noticed a significant decrease in tangling, increased volume, and healthier hair overall.  </li>
            <li>even my styalist agreed my hair is no where near how her same product is very upsetting</li>
            <li>whose short hair hopefully won&#x27;t mind it so much.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t order again how sad can&#x27;t even get a good product I&#x27;ll get from the salon and pay more at least</li>
            <li>Super watered down too.</li>
            <li>No matter what I&#x27;ve put my hair through chemically, this stuff has kept my hair thick, strong, and soft.</li>
            <li>, I have fine hair, this rich repair shampoo and conditioner is too heavy for my hair type, please right this wrong.</li>
            <li>All day with no loose hairs out of place and just wavy soft curls</li>
            <li>These products have given back my hair a new life.  </li>
            <li>They really handle it if you have a dry scalp and they handle the hair if it is breaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Goldwell before, though not for a few years, When I purchased this, I was excited to give it a try again, but found that the shampoo made my hair extremely knotty.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Goldwell before, though not for a few years, When I purchased this, I was excited to give it a try again, but found that the shampoo made my hair extremely knotty.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and long and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> The problem with this is that my hair would feel fin the day I washed it, then be dry and gross the next.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for her dry hair after it was recommended to her at our local hair salon.  </li>
            <li> The pH balance seemed the same in my hair in other words.  </li>
            <li> It was fairly expensive as compared to the normal shampoo &amp; conditioners that I normally bought.  </li>
            <li> Not only did both containers come slightly unscrewed (so they both leaked all over)</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, it just isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li> My hair is oily long and dark</li>
            <li> I went through hundreds of shampoo tries until I found this one!</li>
            <li> I typically have very dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I live in AZ where te weather is very dry and my hair was very dry thus difficult to comb.</li>
            <li> but on arrival I found both bottles were half empty with content dried in the spouts.  </li>
            <li> She searched all the local stores but was unable to find any Goldwell products locally, but Amazon came to the rescue.  </li>
            <li> I was abit skeptical at initially when buying this product, but just after ONE wash, I can see instant results on my hair!!</li>
            <li> Because my hair is curly, I can&#x27;t wash it everyday, it leaves it way too brittle, so I usually wash every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick delivery, heavy pump therefore doesn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer going to be sold where I usually shop</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much less expensive.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong .</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this product</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> so So SO disappointed!!!! :(</li>

            <li> excellent but i have switched to wen, and its better than anything i have ever used.</li>
            <li> this is one of my fav brands i do hair and i love the richneses and the lather! great buy thanks</li>
            <li> loved loved it! have purchased it over 4 times.  My hair is oily long and dark</li>
            <li> This product helps make my highlights last longer and is so good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser uses this and it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I had very damaged hair so my stylist recommended this brand. I first bought the small bottle and I was very happy with the product. I then purchased this and noticed that the shampoo was very diluted and it wouldn&#x27;t foam or soap up your hair, you can barley smell anything. I started using a lot thinking that that&#x27;s the way it works but I was wrong . I bought the bigger bottle this time and it was really different.. the shampoo smells great and I only needed to use one pump. Its a great product but not this particular bottle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner. It was a better deal to order it offline than in a store for me and it is still that Goldwell quality.&lt;br /&gt;While my hair felt nicer after using it, it isn&#x27;t my favorite smell for a shampoo and conditioner. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, it just isn&#x27;t my favorite and I don&#x27;t notice it at all after my hair dries.  When I run out I will probably look for a different type of Goldwell shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Felt like it dried my hair even more than it was. Couldn&#x27;t brush through hair after showering.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find this product online but on arrival I found both bottles were half empty with content dried in the spouts.  They do not look or smell like Goldwells products either.  Very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I typically have very dry, frizzy hair. My hair stylist recommended this and I&#x27;m really glad she did. My hair felt much softer and smoother the first time I used it, but not only that, the softness lasted for more than one day. Because my hair is curly, I can&#x27;t wash it everyday, it leaves it way too brittle, so I usually wash every other day. The problem with this is that my hair would feel fin the day I washed it, then be dry and gross the next. This shampoo and conditioner was really good at keeping it soft and smooth til my next wash. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Goldwell for twenty years.  I also use the color.  Great colors and great product.</li>
            <li> A much better deal than buying from my salon. Good product!</li>
            <li> I go through a lot of color processes and this is the shampoo my stylist always uses for me. It smells amazing, and it keeps my hair strong and soft - not coarse (like some repair/strengthening shampoos tend to do). It&#x27;s nice smelling like I visit the salon every day. No matter what I&#x27;ve put my hair through chemically, this stuff has kept my hair thick, strong, and soft.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this product</li>
            <li> I do love this product, and for the price, it&#x27;s amazing.  But I was still having issues with my hair breaking off and getting split ends - I know it&#x27;s not because of the product itself - I think it helped as much as it could.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was the best I&#x27;ve ever tried on my hair.  I could use it again and again and my hair didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;get used to it.&amp;#34;  The pH balance seemed the same in my hair in other words.  My hair felt clean, thicker and healthy.  It really moisturizes and repairs b/c my hair has never felt healthier.</li>
            <li> Good value, excellent for highlighted dry, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;Have re-ordered and still same great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery, heavy pump therefore doesn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!!! It feels great while you use it and just after one use you can feel and see the difference!!! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this Dual Senses Rich Shampoo and Conditioner daily on curly hair and this product is the only one that keeps the frizz away. I use this daily on processed blonde hair and the hair doesn&#x27;t turn brassy over time. I use this product daily on colored hair and the hair looks and feels healthy! Add the 60 minute repair tub and you have the perfect haircare formula !</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s been awhile and now I can say the prouduct I received was not the actual or correct product even my styalist agreed my hair is no where near how her same product is very upsetting won&#x27;t order again how sad can&#x27;t even get a good product I&#x27;ll get from the salon and pay more at least I know I&#x27;m not getting a bottle of who knows what !?? Ugh</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for her dry hair after it was recommended to her at our local hair salon.  She searched all the local stores but was unable to find any Goldwell products locally, but Amazon came to the rescue.  My wife says that within the first few uses of this product she noticed a significant decrease in tangling, increased volume, and healthier hair overall.  She also reports that the fragrance is pleasant, something she was very concerned about when ordering this product online.</li>
            <li> Wife likes ..all that matters... :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great shampoo and a great conditioner, these cover my needs: soft hair, no fragance, excellent results!</li>
            <li> Got my hair dyed balayage and had to get it redone because it was not quite what I wanted. My hair felt SO damaged after the second dye - it would knot so easily, it was like I suddenly had someone else&#x27;s hair! A friend who is a hairdresser recommended this product to me and I could not be happier!! My hair feels back to normal and does not knot nearly as easily. Lasts a long time and well worth the value!!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo,. even though my hair is ombre now I love it!!! I went through hundreds of shampoo tries until I found this one!</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo/conditioner for years.  And this time decided to save some $$ and order it online.  Not only did both containers come slightly unscrewed (so they both leaked all over) It isn&#x27;t even the right product!!!!! I know the smell (and look/color) of both products and it isn&#x27;t even the products I love!! so So SO disappointed!!!! :(</li>
            <li> The packaging was ok.  One of the bottles had leaked.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, love goldwell ptoducts. Very reasonable price for the two bottles.</li>
            <li> I was abit skeptical at initially when buying this product, but just after ONE wash, I can see instant results on my hair!! I live in AZ where te weather is very dry and my hair was very dry thus difficult to comb. After 1 wash, it was tangle-free, super easy to comb, leaving my hair shiny and beautiful. Both shampoo n conditioner was mild and pleasant smelling. I will certainly recommend to all!</li>
            <li> These came as expected and it more than I bargained for.  My hair feels like fresh and new every morning,noon and night.  These products have given back my hair a new life.  Love these!</li>
            <li> I ordered what was on the picture, volumizing shampoo and conditioner, I got what is in the description, which are 2 different items, I want what is in the picture, not description, please mail me the right shampoo, I have fine hair, this rich repair shampoo and conditioner is too heavy for my hair type, please right this wrong.</li>
            <li> A salon used this on my hair and l liked it so much that I purchased it. It was fairly expensive as compared to the normal shampoo &amp; conditioners that I normally bought.  I was thrilled to find this size available at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner! They really handle it if you have a dry scalp and they handle the hair if it is breaking.</li>
            <li> The product sent to me was not the product pictured. Super watered down too.</li>
            <li> I love the way the shampoo makes my hair feel and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is my third time purchasing Goldwell Dual Senses Rich Repair Shampoo and Conditioner. It is cheaper than buying in a salon or salon store. The pump action allows for precise amounts each time. The large bottles last for quite a while. The Rich Repair is a gentle shampoo/conditioner good for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I really do love this shampoo and conditioner. It feels alot more silky if I blow dry my hair. My hair is straight and long and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo and Condtioner arrive used. The Condtioner nozzle was discolor with Brown stuff. The item was suppose to be new but arrived used.</li>
            <li> Great price!  Really fast shipping/delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Goldwell before, though not for a few years, When I purchased this, I was excited to give it a try again, but found that the shampoo made my hair extremely knotty. I found myself losing way more hair than normal after using it for just a couple of days. Additionally, my hair wasn&#x27;t blow drying easily - it was getting knotted and stuck in my brush, which never happens. The conditioner seems okay, so I&#x27;ll probably continue to use that (they both smell amazing), but I&#x27;m pawning the shampoo off on my boyfriend whose short hair hopefully won&#x27;t mind it so much.</li>
            <li> I ordered these based on my hair stylist&#x27;s recommendation and I really like them. The price was much better than elsewhere, and they have free shipping for Prime Members, so I won&#x27;t buy them from any where else. They work great for thick, curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Great selller! Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Never did I think coarse hair could look so shiny and fine... All day with no loose hairs out of place and just wavy soft curls</li>
            <li> Really love this shampoo and conditioner. It works great!</li>
            <li> Great buy on amazon, paid same amount as I would for 1/2 the amount at salon. Love the smell and what it does for my hair</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  Gives my hair so much volume and texture. It&#x27;s no longer going to be sold where I usually shop so I&#x27;m glad I found it online, it&#x27;s much less expensive.</li>
