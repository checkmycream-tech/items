            <li>I&#x27;ve always taken pretty good care of my skin; but after turning 50, I decided to ratchet up the care a bit more.  </li>

            <li>First of all, I love this product and have been using it for 2 years.  </li>
            <li>It really does deminish fine lines, and give your face a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is a miracle worker and Peter truly knows and understands women want the read deal no bs, and this is soft and really makes your face look great.</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>A great product, delivered in an extremely well timed deposition.</li>
            <li>It is important to exfoliate and scrub off the dead skin cells before applying this - or any other kind of - treatment, in order to get the very best results.  </li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean, scrubbed look.</li>
            <li>Although it states its laser-free resurfacing, I&#x27;ve never ever undergone any flakiness or super dryness.</li>
            <li>Super Produkt ich kann nicht mehr ohne</li>

            <li>if you haven&#x27;t tried Peter Thomas Roth products than you are missing out on GREAT stuff.</li>
            <li>I am very upset because it isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m really loving the way it looks later.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m really loving the way it looks later.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to look in the mirror anymore.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased so far with all of his products.</li>
            <li>I love every PTR product I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I used a sample and initially just liked how it made my skin feel</li>
            <li>but I feel it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I always want to try something else, anything, because my skin is super finicky (oily, combination, dry in wintertime) and breaks out very easily.</li>
            <li>The product is a deep reddish orange color and seems to give my skin a healthy glow once it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past 4 months and absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>Let me first start with the details of what this product claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a red resin from the Amazon&#x27;s Croton Lechleri tree (this is the geographical Amazon, not the Amazon of my favorite online shopping place).  </li>
            <li>had some concerns about it after my first two days of use.  </li>
            <li>FAST ship!</li>
            <li>I use my regular moisturizer over top.  </li>
            <li>I am a product junkie and love trying different products for my skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly the item I ordered shipped lightning fast!  </li>
            <li>Use another moisturizer on top after giving the Dragon&#x27;s Blood about ten minutes to soak in.  </li>
            <li>&quot; is the appropriate title for this facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I had to remove the top to get the last of the product.</li>
            <li>(Unwrinkle most recently).</li>
            <li>I doubted this, as I do with pretty much everything, but it totally worth.</li>
            <li>I received to bottles (not boxed....which is a concern) from this seller and used one bottle tonight for the first time...</li>
            <li>After hearing some positive news of this resurfacing serum, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I also use Retinol serum from this brand at night, which I also like so positive results I&#x27;ve noticed</li>
            <li>The product was good, just as good as any other lless expensive serum, nothing special.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I like it to a reasonable degree.</li>
            <li>can be really contributed to both of these products, perhaps not just this one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t follow the prescribed routine, putting it on only at night and oftentimes foregoing moisturizer or night cream altogether, but even so, my skin feels smooth and polished in the morning, and I notice a difference if I don&#x27;t put it on a couple of nights in a row.</li>
            <li>and PTR really helps.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look so dewy fresh and young.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used anything from Peter Thomas Roth that wasn&#x27;t absolutely the bomb.  </li>
            <li>Really helps give y skin some radiance.</li>
            <li>You can really feel and see it.</li>
            <li>With nightly use this makes your skin much smoother and brighter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this formula!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on 69, and this product has worked very well for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 75 and exposed myself to too much sun over the years.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>First time you use it, you notice the difference--skin feels different as well as looking better--guess dragon&#x27;s blood really does work!!</li>
            <li>This is one of my staples I cannot live without!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Now all I need to do is find a coupon to make this just a little more affordable.</li>
            <li>I have real sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So, either this is TERRIBLY old or it is not the real product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and am on my second bottle, and it really works well and as stated!</li>
            <li>It is still a little early, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I am very much enjoying this product, as I have all of the Peter Thomas Roth products I have used in the past</li>
            <li>Maybe for other people is good, but for me,it&#x27;s really waste money...</li>
            <li>In future I will certainly stay away from this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just wish the container was a little bigger so it held more.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Being 54 years old and a rather vain woman (there, I&#x27;ve admitted it)</li>
            <li>Since using it, I have noticed a marked improvement in the clarity and smoothness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>No wonder customers here write that their skin feels soft as silk.</li>
            <li>There are natural skin treatments like Suki and others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few days, but so far, I love it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone even my 23 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles yet, I have begun to develop a few fine lines near my eyes and the squinchy part of my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this new product from Peter Thomas Roth for approximately 6 wks now and love the way it is making my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>and apparently it was a old bottle</li>
            <li>i use it at least daily with a ptr moisturizer on top and unwrinkle serum underneath.  </li>
            <li>I continued using the product, though; and simply avoided applying the serum directly over the bumps.  </li>
            <li>I continued using the product, though; and simply avoided applying the serum directly over the bumps.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to women whose skin is starting to mature</li>
            <li>She had so many wrinkles and thin papery skin.</li>
            <li>This particular formulation is a bit slower in showing its results but I definitely have smother skin as well as a long lasting effect.  </li>
            <li>It was not a good fit for me, it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin also seems very smooth and a lot of the small age spots and small wrinkles are gone.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken pretty good care of my skin; but after turning 50, I decided to ratchet up the care a bit more.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product for the first 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love PTR and glad that this was available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan on buying the full-size of this product very soon and hope to see more good results.</li>
            <li> I was able to buy at a good price on Amazon--thank you so much</li>
            <li> and I love the smooth feeling it leaves</li>
            <li> The product is quite easy to use -</li>
            <li> If you are a person who breaks out easily this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> Love this line-tried the full trial set and was astounded at the improvement in my skin-highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I have tried many, many skin care creams and potions and the PTR line consistently delivers results</li>
            <li> In the morning my skin is smooth and has a glow to it.</li>
            <li> I would even almost consider going make-up free on some days because of this product,</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>

            <li> First of all, I love this product and have been using it for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> It really does deminish fine lines, and give your face a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle worker and Peter truly knows and understands women want the read deal no bs, and this is soft and really makes your face look great.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> A great product, delivered in an extremely well timed deposition.</li>
            <li> It is important to exfoliate and scrub off the dead skin cells before applying this - or any other kind of - treatment, in order to get the very best results.  </li>
            <li> It has a fresh, clean, scrubbed look.</li>
            <li> Although it states its laser-free resurfacing, I&#x27;ve never ever undergone any flakiness or super dryness.</li>
            <li> Super Produkt ich kann nicht mehr ohne</li>
            <li> however, I am very pleased with the overall results.</li>
            <li> Besides the softening of fine lines, my skin tone has evened out and my pores are more refined after several weeks with this serum.&lt;br</li>

            <li> if you haven&#x27;t tried Peter Thomas Roth products than you are missing out on GREAT stuff.</li>
            <li> I am very upset because it isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m really loving the way it looks later.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m really loving the way it looks later.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid to look in the mirror anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased so far with all of his products.</li>
            <li> I love every PTR product I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I used a sample and initially just liked how it made my skin feel</li>
            <li> but I feel it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I always want to try something else, anything, because my skin is super finicky (oily, combination, dry in wintertime) and breaks out very easily.</li>
            <li> The product is a deep reddish orange color and seems to give my skin a healthy glow once it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 4 months and absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Let me first start with the details of what this product claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a red resin from the Amazon&#x27;s Croton Lechleri tree (this is the geographical Amazon, not the Amazon of my favorite online shopping place).  </li>
            <li> had some concerns about it after my first two days of use.  </li>
            <li> FAST ship!</li>
            <li> I use my regular moisturizer over top.  </li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and love trying different products for my skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly the item I ordered shipped lightning fast!  </li>
            <li> Use another moisturizer on top after giving the Dragon&#x27;s Blood about ten minutes to soak in.  </li>
            <li> &quot; is the appropriate title for this facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I had to remove the top to get the last of the product.</li>
            <li> (Unwrinkle most recently).</li>
            <li> I doubted this, as I do with pretty much everything, but it totally worth.</li>
            <li> I received to bottles (not boxed....which is a concern) from this seller and used one bottle tonight for the first time...</li>
            <li> After hearing some positive news of this resurfacing serum, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I also use Retinol serum from this brand at night, which I also like so positive results I&#x27;ve noticed</li>
            <li> The product was good, just as good as any other lless expensive serum, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I like it to a reasonable degree.</li>
            <li> can be really contributed to both of these products, perhaps not just this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t follow the prescribed routine, putting it on only at night and oftentimes foregoing moisturizer or night cream altogether, but even so, my skin feels smooth and polished in the morning, and I notice a difference if I don&#x27;t put it on a couple of nights in a row.</li>
            <li> and PTR really helps.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin look so dewy fresh and young.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used anything from Peter Thomas Roth that wasn&#x27;t absolutely the bomb.  </li>
            <li> Really helps give y skin some radiance.</li>
            <li> You can really feel and see it.</li>
            <li> With nightly use this makes your skin much smoother and brighter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this formula!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on 69, and this product has worked very well for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 75 and exposed myself to too much sun over the years.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li> First time you use it, you notice the difference--skin feels different as well as looking better--guess dragon&#x27;s blood really does work!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my staples I cannot live without!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Now all I need to do is find a coupon to make this just a little more affordable.</li>
            <li> I have real sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So, either this is TERRIBLY old or it is not the real product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and am on my second bottle, and it really works well and as stated!</li>
            <li> It is still a little early, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I am very much enjoying this product, as I have all of the Peter Thomas Roth products I have used in the past</li>
            <li> Maybe for other people is good, but for me,it&#x27;s really waste money...</li>
            <li> In future I will certainly stay away from this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just wish the container was a little bigger so it held more.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Being 54 years old and a rather vain woman (there, I&#x27;ve admitted it)</li>
            <li> Since using it, I have noticed a marked improvement in the clarity and smoothness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> No wonder customers here write that their skin feels soft as silk.</li>
            <li> There are natural skin treatments like Suki and others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few days, but so far, I love it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone even my 23 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles yet, I have begun to develop a few fine lines near my eyes and the squinchy part of my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this new product from Peter Thomas Roth for approximately 6 wks now and love the way it is making my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> and apparently it was a old bottle</li>
            <li> i use it at least daily with a ptr moisturizer on top and unwrinkle serum underneath.  </li>
            <li> I continued using the product, though; and simply avoided applying the serum directly over the bumps.  </li>
            <li> I continued using the product, though; and simply avoided applying the serum directly over the bumps.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to women whose skin is starting to mature</li>
            <li> She had so many wrinkles and thin papery skin.</li>
            <li> This particular formulation is a bit slower in showing its results but I definitely have smother skin as well as a long lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> It was not a good fit for me, it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin also seems very smooth and a lot of the small age spots and small wrinkles are gone.  </li>
            <li> But I was surprised to see that it is dark red color.</li>
            <li> while I like the consistency of this product, I&#x27;m not sure if it does much.</li>
            <li> This is my first negative review.  </li>
            <li> But underneath the silicone, the skin cannot breathe very well.&lt;br /&gt;Silicone is often hidden behind various names ending with &#x27;icone&#x27;, very often dimethicone.</li>
            <li> I developed a couple of small red bumps on my cheeks</li>
            <li> It actually heals your skin from prior sun damage and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> This seems to give my skin a smoother look, which lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> as usual, peter thomas roth products live up to their claims......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I use other than cleanser.</li>
            <li> I may not buy it in the future because I want to try other stuff.</li>
            <li> It smooths out the dry areas and softend the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The serum is a liquid-y gel that comes out of the bottle in a surprisingly strange dark red color.  </li>
            <li> PTR has quite a few products that I like, particularly facial wash, toner, moisturizer, and such.</li>
            <li> This past year I developed rough dry skin on the sides of my face</li>
            <li> My skin would get very dry if I don&#x27;t put anything on it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as the reviews were all so great.  </li>
            <li> However, I am on my fourth bottle of this serum, which is saying a lot, and turned a few of my friends on to it when they tried it on our weekend out of town.</li>
            <li> I did not really like the texture of the product</li>
            <li> so I have spent my life in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I used it careful to not use anything else</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending to anyone to give these a try.</li>
            <li> but it totally cleared my pregnancy-related brown spots and a few acne scars under my chin.  </li>
            <li> , I like it, however based on the fact that I like and prefer to use products as natural as possible, I think they could do without adding unnecessary colors to it, as well as Parabens.</li>
            <li> i wish i could say how long that took, maybe 5-6 months, maybe less.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am not a consistent user of any moisturizer or serum...</li>
            <li> I am now buying other items of their products.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would help with my dark spots and some of the wrinkle issues, but it did not change anything.  </li>
            <li> I think it rolls back the calendar 20 years at least.  </li>
            <li> something I would never have considered before at all because I usually wear makeup every single day.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little steep</li>
            <li> And she uses so little too.</li>
            <li> I allow the serum a few minutes to absorb/dry before applying these moisturizers over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not cheap, one expects immediate results.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap.</li>

            <li> its base of 33.5% dragon&#x27;s blood complex, it&#x27;s supposed to lessen the noticeable signs of aging that are a result of time, UV rays, and other environmental damages while helping to improve the texture, even out skin tones, skin ruddiness, and reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this product shifted in price to $60+ again because I&#x27;ve bought it for $30+ just a few weeks a go....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken pretty good care of my skin; but after turning 50, I decided to ratchet up the care a bit more.  While I don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles yet, I have begun to develop a few fine lines near my eyes and the squinchy part of my forehead.  After hearing some positive news of this resurfacing serum, I decided to give it a try.  Let me first start with the details of what this product claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its base of 33.5% dragon&#x27;s blood complex, it&#x27;s supposed to lessen the noticeable signs of aging that are a result of time, UV rays, and other environmental damages while helping to improve the texture, even out skin tones, skin ruddiness, and reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  Skin should appear smoother, softer, younger, and clearer looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is this dragon&#x27;s blood?  It&#x27;s a red resin from the Amazon&#x27;s Croton Lechleri tree (this is the geographical Amazon, not the Amazon of my favorite online shopping place).  This red substance has been used for centuries for its wound-healing and health-giving properties.  And it&#x27;s now finding its way into some high-end skincare product lines to help promote skin cell regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to get on with my actual experiences with it.  For starters, it arrives in a 1 oz. tall, skinny bottle with a pump dispenser.  The serum is a liquid-y gel that comes out of the bottle in a surprisingly strange dark red color.  This is the dragon&#x27;s blood giving it this color; however, as soon as the gel is smoothed onto the skin, the red color goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day (morning and before bedtime) and apply [[ASIN:B000IVB1G8 Peter Thomas Roth Mega Rich Intensive Anti-Aging Cellular Creme]] over the serum in the morning and [[ASIN:B0013718S2 Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Night Cream]] over it at bedtime.  I allow the serum a few minutes to absorb/dry before applying these moisturizers over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some concerns about it after my first two days of use.  I developed a couple of small red bumps on my cheeks (I tend to be well past the point of breakouts).  I continued using the product, though; and simply avoided applying the serum directly over the bumps.  They went away after a day or two and my skin has remained clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t really like the way my skin looks immediately after using the serum and PTR creams (a bit shiny and uneven in color), I&#x27;m really loving the way it looks later.  My skin is glowing when I awaken in the morning and the serum seems to have fluffed out any fine lines on my face (or perhaps it has just tightened up the skin to make them disappear).  Besides the softening of fine lines, my skin tone has evened out and my pores are more refined after several weeks with this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if not for the fact that it did seem to break out my skin a tad in the beginning.  So, I would say about  4 or 4.5 stars.l red bumps on my cheeks (I tend to be well past the point of breakouts).

            <li> Great value! FAST ship! VERY happy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this new product from Peter Thomas Roth for approximately 6 wks now and love the way it is making my skin glow.  I have 60 yr.old skin that has always been in good condition but this product seems to have reduced or softened the look of the crow&#x27;s feet alongside my eyes and made the rest of my face look younger.  The product is quite easy to use - I use a small portion (1/2 squirt) twice a day after cleansing.  I use my regular moisturizer over top.  The price is a little steep but I am still using the same bottle (6wks) so not as bad as it sounds.  Would recommend this product to women whose skin is starting to mature...wish it had come out 10 yrs. ago.</li>
            <li> It was not a good fit for me, it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle worker and Peter truly knows and understands women want the read deal no bs, and this is soft and really makes your face look great.</li>
            <li> really a good product that help me to relieve redness on my face. I will continue to use it for further treatment.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I am a product junkie. I keep trying to find the next best thing. This may be it. I see a noticeable difference. I put it on at night. My skin instantly feels like silk. In the morning my skin is smooth and has a glow to it. I am 51 and do not have many wrinkles. My skin just hasn&#x27;t had that youthful look to it anymore. This product is helping and I will order it again!</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product shifted in price to $60+ again because I&#x27;ve bought it for $30+ just a few weeks a go.... I guess I snatched a good deal. Anyway, I like it to a reasonable degree.It is of a thick jelly texture. But I was surprised to see that it is dark red color. What is the purpose of that? I have been using it for about 2 weeks and see some improvement in my skin texture and softness. I also use Retinol serum from this brand at night, which I also like so positive results I&#x27;ve noticed can be really contributed to both of these products, perhaps not just this one. All in all, I like it, however based on the fact that I like and prefer to use products as natural as possible, I think they could do without adding unnecessary colors to it, as well as Parabens.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am not a consistent user of any moisturizer or serum... I always want to try something else, anything, because my skin is super finicky (oily, combination, dry in wintertime) and breaks out very easily. However, I am on my fourth bottle of this serum, which is saying a lot, and turned a few of my friends on to it when they tried it on our weekend out of town. I don&#x27;t follow the prescribed routine, putting it on only at night and oftentimes foregoing moisturizer or night cream altogether, but even so, my skin feels smooth and polished in the morning, and I notice a difference if I don&#x27;t put it on a couple of nights in a row.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and love trying different products for my skin. I have been using this for over 2 months now and am not impressed at all. I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference in my skin. Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly the item I ordered shipped lightning fast!  I love PTR and glad that this was available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the item:  This is my second bottle.  It comes with enough quantity that it lasts forever for me.  During the day, I mix it with my face lotion and at night, I use it more generously (2 pumps instead of 1).  My skin would get very dry if I don&#x27;t put anything on it and PTR really helps.  Although it states its laser-free resurfacing, I&#x27;ve never ever undergone any flakiness or super dryness.</li>
            <li> I love all of PTR products. I&#x27;m 51. I have real sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using for one year. I&#x27;m not afraid to look in the mirror anymore.</li>
            <li> as usual, peter thomas roth products live up to their claims......skin feels and looks smoother after just a couple of uses.....used along with the un-wrinkle products, this is a great alternative to office procedures to help minimize wrinkles and create smoother, younger-looking skin.  i love it!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Peter Thomas Roth Laser-Free Resurfacer from a Facebook promotion and have been using it for the last couple of weeks and can I just say that I am quite amazed by the results!  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and my skin is in pretty good shape already, but using this product really stepped it up a notch and made my skin almost glow!  I had some imperfections on my skin from sun damage that I have had a hard time getting rid of, but now I can say that I can hardly even notice that they were there!  I would even almost consider going make-up free on some days because of this product, something I would never have considered before at all because I usually wear makeup every single day.  My skin also seems very smooth and a lot of the small age spots and small wrinkles are gone.  I plan on buying the full-size of this product very soon and hope to see more good results.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, and having used Peter Thomas Roth Cleanser I tried the Laser-Free resurfacer w/Dragon&#x27;s blood.  It really does deminish fine lines, and give your face a more youthful appearance.  It actually heals your skin from prior sun damage and dark spots.  I will continue to use the product and recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would help with my dark spots and some of the wrinkle issues, but it did not change anything.  I did not really like the texture of the product (too sticky) or the smell either.</li>
            <li> a little disappointed about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a great improvement in my mom&#x27;s face. She had so many wrinkles and thin papery skin. After giving this to her on top of the clinique moisturizer she had always used, it truly made a difference. Her skin looks plump, healthier and tone is better. Would buy this for her again. And she uses so little too.</li>
            <li> Use with Murad Intensive wrinkle reducer GREAT COMBO for me</li>
            <li> Product looks good&lt;br /&gt;The moment has no effect, and perhaps to see results after would recommend to a friend  I like</li>
            <li> I loved this product for the first 6 weeks. Then I started experiencing a rash on my cheeks and in my eyebrow area, which then turned into sores. Went to doctor and the only thing we can come up with is the possibility that I am allergic to something in this product. It DID make my skin look better up until the rashes. Now I look like I have chemical burns.</li>
            <li> Love this product, smoothes my lines!  This is one of my staples I cannot live without! My husband also uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference - except that it made me break out.  Very disappointed as the reviews were all so great.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Being 54 years old and a rather vain woman (there, I&#x27;ve admitted it) I have dumped thousands of dollars into skin care.  Peter Thomas Roth is a brand that just simply does not not do you wrong.  I have always experienced a great revitalization of my skin tone, suppleness and diminished wrinkles using this brand.  This particular formulation is a bit slower in showing its results but I definitely have smother skin as well as a long lasting effect.  Use another moisturizer on top after giving the Dragon&#x27;s Blood about ten minutes to soak in.  Again, LOVE Peter Thomas Roth...all of it.  But, shoot, budget for it.  Might be better to just bite the bullet and get surgery.  In the end, you&#x27;ll probably come out the same in terms of money out of pocket.</li>
            <li> This is a non greasy product...which I love!  I use morning and night. Just another awesome product from Peter Thomas Roth!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It makes my skin look so dewy fresh and young.  I think it rolls back the calendar 20 years at least.  Best stuff ever!!!! I haven&#x27;t used anything from Peter Thomas Roth that wasn&#x27;t absolutely the bomb.  I have been pleased so far with all of his products.</li>
            <li> Again, at 70,  miracles are not going to happen.  It is probably a wonderful product for someone younger.&lt;br /&gt;Ruth Ward</li>
            <li> First time you use it, you notice the difference--skin feels different as well as looking better--guess dragon&#x27;s blood really does work!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> Really helps give y skin some radiance. Helps smooth and reduce pore size. I love every PTR product I have tried so far. This is my 3rd bottle and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Since using it, I have noticed a marked improvement in the clarity and smoothness of my skin.  I have always taken good care of my skin, so rarely do products seem to make a difference.  This product is one of the exceptions.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I m sorry to say but I thinks this is a copy. I have bougt it here in sweden before and this product have not the same smell. Colur or effect. The one I bougt earlyier you get a instant tighten up. You can really feel and see it. But this product no. But ofcourse the price says it all</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come in a sealed package. I won&#x27;t purchase makeup that comes without the manufacturers packaging.  It made me wonder if this has been used before or something...</li>
            <li> I regret having bought this product. It contains quite a bit of silicone, and if I had googled a bit before I bought the product, I could have saved the money. No wonder customers here write that their skin feels soft as silk. The silicone patches up all unevenness, and that is why. But underneath the silicone, the skin cannot breathe very well.&lt;br /&gt;Silicone is often hidden behind various names ending with &#x27;icone&#x27;, very often dimethicone. In future I will certainly stay away from this stuff. There are natural skin treatments like Suki and others.</li>
            <li> A great product, delivered in an extremely well timed deposition.</li>
            <li> Not sure \\&quot;Laser Free\\&quot; is the appropriate title for this facial moisturizer however, I am very pleased with the overall results. PTR has quite a few products that I like, particularly facial wash, toner, moisturizer, and such. Now all I need to do is find a coupon to make this just a little more affordable.</li>
            <li> Great product, have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is the closest to a miracle product I&#x27;ve ever come across.  With nightly use this makes your skin much smoother and brighter.  It&#x27;s the only product I use other than cleanser.</li>
            <li> while I like the consistency of this product, I&#x27;m not sure if it does much. Since it&#x27;s not cheap, one expects immediate results.</li>
            <li> I have very bad acne scars and the sales lady at Sephora told me about this product. I used a sample and initially just liked how it made my skin feel so I ordered the bottle from Amazon. I have been using this product for the past 4 months and absolutely love it!! I have had several people ask me what I have been doing because my scars are not as noticeable. I use it at night before my moisturizer and in the morning before I put on my make up. I am 27 but have not started using an anit-aging line yet. I will continue using this and have just purchased the eye serum and moisturizer and can not wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> I will use this over and over not sure whats in it but it makes me look younger or brighter...BUY IT</li>
            <li> I love PTR products. Unfortunately they are very expensive at Sephora &amp; I am thankful for Amazon prices. I am not sure about this product because I don&#x27;t notice what it does. I may not buy it in the future because I want to try other stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few days, but so far, I love it. You pat it on the wrinkles and it soaks into the skin perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Beats a lot of serums I use and I&#x27;ve used them all! Don&#x27;t be afraid by the red color... It&#x27;s a miracle serum.</li>
            <li> This is one of those magical products that smooths wrinkles the moment it&#x27;s on the face. It&#x27;s absolutely the best serum-type product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I got really bad rash and apparently it was a old bottle so im not sure if it was from that or it just gave me a rash??</li>
            <li> The Product is great and so is the service was so fast and easy, price perfect so glad that I bought it online.</li>
            <li> My skin is flawless, best of used with moisturizing gel.</li>
            <li> this product feels great on my skin and I love the smooth feeling it leaves, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Product just as described!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.  Highly recommend this formula!  Expensive, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and am on my second bottle, and it really works well and as stated! I am now buying other items of their products.</li>
            <li> Love this line-tried the full trial set and was astounded at the improvement in my skin-highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product, along with the eye serum for about 3 months. I am pleased, after a month of use, my face glows! It has a fresh, clean, scrubbed look. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how my skin looks. I can&#x27;t say it has reduced my wrinkles though.  My skin is much more smoother and softer.  I&#x27;ll keep using this product!</li>
            <li> I am almost 42, grew up in Miami, now in Southern Cal...so I have spent my life in the sun.  My skin was starting to show it.  I was using NIA 24 (paid $75) being told that Niacin was the latest and greatest for sun damage repair.  It had 5% niacin.  I used it for a few months.  Not bad.  Then my skin broke out really bad and it wouldn&#x27;t go away for months.  I received a tiny sample of the Resurfacer from Sephora.  I used it careful to not use anything else so I could see how it worked for my skin because it had 7% niacin and the dragon blood thing intriged me.  OH MY GOODNESS!  Within 2 days, my skin felt like I just had an oxygen facial and it CLEARED UP!!!  I ran to Sephora to buy the bottle so I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it.  I paid $75 (wish I checked Amazon first):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it now for over a month and my skin has never looked better.  Well, except for when I was 25.  Enjoy it!  It&#x27;s a great deal here.</li>
            <li> If you are a person who breaks out easily this product is not for you.Stings and flushes your face beet red.</li>
            <li> I had tried this before together with the moisturizer, in the sample size. It worked so well,really great. Somehow though I moved on to what seemed to be &amp;#34;the next best thing&amp;#34; which I always seem to be looking for!  Well, lesson learned. My skin ended up being in a really bad condition after trying out various other things over the period of about a year or so. Now I&#x27;ve returned to this product together with the moisturizer and eye serum and what a difference within a few days! My skin is getting better,has a much better texture and is firming up. These are definitely the products that I&#x27;m going to stick with from now on and I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending to anyone to give these a try.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum, which seems to leave a sort of &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; over the skin, smoothing it.  It is important to exfoliate and scrub off the dead skin cells before applying this - or any other kind of - treatment, in order to get the very best results.  Sometimes, I use another serum after exfoliating and scrubbing, then put on moisturizer, and last put on the Resurfacer just before I put on my foundation.  This seems to give my skin a smoother look, which lasts all day long.  I&#x27;m going on 69, and this product has worked very well for my skin.  I don&#x27;t like to be without it.</li>
            <li> Great product for aging skin</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Great great great.  Very good for a serum and resurfacer! Highly recommend. PTR has great products and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I had to remove the top to get the last of the product. There was about 15% of product (expensive product, too) that would have been tossed out and wasted if I hadn&#x27;t checked. The product was good, just as good as any other lless expensive serum, nothing special.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved ever since I started using this products.  It is still a little early, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I am 75 and exposed myself to too much sun over the years.  This past year I developed rough dry skin on the sides of my face so I tried this.  It works great and now I use it every day and night.  It smooths out the dry areas and softend the wrinkles.  I stopped using it over the winter months, but as soon as summer returned I started again.  I was able to buy at a good price on Amazon--thank you so much</li>
            <li> I am very much enjoying this product, as I have all of the Peter Thomas Roth products I have used in the past (Unwrinkle most recently). I do feel that my skin is smoother and tighter.  Being 50, I perhaps am a little hyper-conscious about my skin (and unfortunately now...my jawline). I have tried many, many skin care creams and potions and the PTR line consistently delivers results</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, and like all the Peter Thomas Roth products, it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would buy it again.  I just wish the container was a little bigger so it held more.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the performance of this product. I saw no change at all. It is not cheap. I would not buy it again or recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> ive been using this for about 2 years.  it took me a few months to notice but it totally cleared my pregnancy-related brown spots and a few acne scars under my chin.  i wish i could say how long that took, maybe 5-6 months, maybe less. i wasnt using it for that  i just realized one day that they were all gone and this is the only product i had added to my already ptr routine!!  i use it at least daily with a ptr moisturizer on top and unwrinkle serum underneath.  love this skincare line.</li>
            <li> I doubted this, as I do with pretty much everything, but it totally worth. My skin is more radiant and I no longer have bags underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product, because I don&#x27;t see any different on my face. Maybe for other people is good, but for me,it&#x27;s really waste money...</li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t tried Peter Thomas Roth products than you are missing out on GREAT stuff.</li>
            <li> Super Produkt ich kann nicht mehr ohne</li>
            <li> This is my first negative review.  First of all, I love this product and have been using it for 2 years.  I received to bottles (not boxed....which is a concern) from this seller and used one bottle tonight for the first time... I pumped out chunks of serum.  So, either this is TERRIBLY old or it is not the real product.  The color is off and it has chunks when I pump it out.  I am very upset because it isn&#x27;t cheap and I just bought 2!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! My face absorbs this making me want more! It feels so good and my face glows! Will never use anything else! The Peter Thomas Roth line is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth and flawless.  The product is a deep reddish orange color and seems to give my skin a healthy glow once it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone even my 23 year old daughter. I love the way it makes my skin feel and look. Great price on Amazon compared to the companys website.</li>
            <li> I JUST DIDN;T LIKE THIS PRODUCT.AT ALL.IT COST TO MUCH.AND DIDN;T DO THE JOB. IT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU.BUT NOT FOR ME.</li>
