    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My friends ask how do I get them so good!!</li>
            <li>This is a good ideal to all ladies!!!</li>
            <li>this is great if you are arching the eyebrows of an infant..</li>
            <li>Not unless you used GLUE LOL</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>Great concept but angle of arch is not natural for most.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit wider faces</li>
            <li>This tool doesn&#x27;t exactly fit my face</li>
            <li>some fun for just over a buck!</li>
            <li>But  it&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li>(sometimes I get it right</li>
            <li>When I saw this little simple tool I thought, what a great idea!</li>
            <li>This is made of sturdy plastic and very reasonably priced (gotta get another one for a backup)</li>
            <li>The product I received was opened and used very upset</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really time-saving</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragile and it won&#x27;t fit everybody.</li>
            <li>First off, it was shipped direct USP from Shenzhen, China not Amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li>This is great for those of us that have very thin</li>
            <li>Lastly, although it had a rather cheap price tag I would advise you to look for a different item.</li>
            <li>This device did not work for me, it is more suited for those individuals with a small face.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to make little marks down the side of my nose as a kind of guide for where my brows should line up.</li>
            <li>This was one of the most ridiculous things I ever ordered.</li>
            <li>This little tool is a fun way to make symmetrical eyebrows easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secondly, it is made of cheap, lightweight plastic, is non-adjustable, and does not fit my average size face.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit wider faces</li>
            <li> Piece of garbage. Doesn&#x27;t work and took forever to arrive. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The product I received was opened and used very upset</li>
            <li> to small on my face  will not reorder again</li>
            <li> This device did not work for me, it is more suited for those individuals with a small face. It was hard to maneuver and did not cone close to sitting where my natural brows sit. Could not use this product and is rendered useless.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use, an extra piece came with this, the instructions were in a foreign language. Not easy to use.</li>
            <li> When I saw this little simple tool I thought, what a great idea! I wish I had thought of it! This is great for those of us that have very thin (sparse in my case) eyebrows and have to draw them on with a degree of precision (sometimes I get it right sometimes I don&#x27;t) Now I don&#x27;t have to make little marks down the side of my nose as a kind of guide for where my brows should line up. This is made of sturdy plastic and very reasonably priced (gotta get another one for a backup) I highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> This tool doesn&#x27;t exactly fit my face so I have to use it one side at a time. It&#x27;s really time-saving</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suck...... Really useless. I want back!!!!  I just want to say that s*** is totally  freaking me out!!!! Suck!!!</li>
            <li> And it took forever to get here. I guess you get what you pay for. Too much trouble to send it back.</li>
            <li> It was cumbersome and i had difficulty using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good ideal to all ladies!!! My friends ask how do I get them so good!! They want to know my secret and when I showed they wanted it.</li>
            <li> First off, it was shipped direct USP from Shenzhen, China not Amazon. China now has my address and telephone number.  I am unhappy about this.  Secondly, it is made of cheap, lightweight plastic, is non-adjustable, and does not fit my average size face.  Lastly, although it had a rather cheap price tag I would advise you to look for a different item.</li>
            <li> reason for this star was because when i got it in the mail it was broked into half</li>
            <li> CRAP!!!&lt;br /&gt;FIRST it was broken when i received it.&lt;br /&gt;SECOND it is wayyy too small ðŸ‘Ž</li>
            <li> The item was broken when received, do not order.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it was a softer plastic but it has sufficed.  Because my facial shape is different than the asian female shown, I have to manipulate the device.</li>
            <li> NOT designed for normal average eyebrow line. If you use this item, you will have odd looking&lt;br /&gt;eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Buy a soda instead worthless</li>
            <li> Not.durable enough it broke</li>
            <li> Quite useless. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> this is great if you are arching the eyebrows of an infant.. It is too small not meant for an adult face</li>
            <li> Was not helpful at all</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this. It&#x27;s fragile and it won&#x27;t fit everybody.</li>
            <li> give you oriental eye brows!  wrong shape for normal eye brows----waste of money!</li>
            <li> This little tool is a fun way to make symmetrical eyebrows easy.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived before the expected delivery date and was just as described.&lt;br /&gt;Have some fun for just over a buck!</li>
            <li> When I used it made my eyebrows to wide .  But  it&#x27;s pretty cheap so I  will try to work at it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product I wasted my money on this kobwa plastic shape eyebrow template stencil makeup grooming tool .:O(</li>
            <li> I received this item today and it was completely broken I&#x27;m so unhappy right now</li>
            <li> This was one of the most ridiculous things I ever ordered. For one thing it doesn&#x27;t hold to your face as pictured !!  Not unless you used GLUE LOL&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the D Y I With a brow pencil and it would not fit in the openings. It was,a very thin brow pencil after a couple of tries  I threw it in the&lt;br /&gt;TRASH .</li>
            <li> Its ok.But they&#x27;re are other professional eyebrow markers that is ten time better,&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not good. Not good . We received a broken plastic DIY</li>
            <li> For a lady with small facial features</li>
            <li> WHAT WAS i THINKING?? TOO STIFF FOR FACE</li>
            <li> Great concept but angle of arch is not natural for most.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lay flat on your face so not worth it!</li>
            <li> Horrible... The shape, the size- not for a human face at all.</li>
