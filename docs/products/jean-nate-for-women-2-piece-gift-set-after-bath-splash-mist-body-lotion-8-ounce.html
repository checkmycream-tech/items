            <li> I wanted to  return it to get a refund but could not find a number to call on Amazon  I wanted the cologne --instead I got the body splash and lotion.  They both smelled AWFUL  must have been very old.  I just gave it to the poor. I wont order on Amazon if I can not talk to customer service.  How do people get good service?</li>
            <li> perfect just what I wanted. product is nice. 8oz is pretty big. my sister love it especially all of it.she liked her jean nate&#x60; things for her birthday.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this!! and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I always buy what she wants!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for christmas! I wanted to be formal about it so I didn&#x27;t open it before I wrapped it. I should have because it was so embarassing my mom&#x27;s face when she smelled this awful crap! Not recommended AT ALL!!</li>
            <li> My mother absolutley loves all the Jean nate products, the mist, splash and the powder.&lt;br /&gt;It is an aquired scent, so don&#x27;t totally dismiss it. Jean Nate has been around along time and a lot of people still like it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good holiday gift for that special someone on your list.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift she loved it</li>
            <li> The gift set was well received.  The fragrance is light and refreshing.  This was a xmas gift for someone who has used this product for years.</li>
            <li> Love the product...packaging wasn&#x27;t terrific</li>
            <li> my sister just loved it.  smells good</li>
            <li> Bought for teenage daughter who keeps taking MINE. I believe I&#x27;ve created another generation of Jean Nate lovers!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the fact that I&#x27;m not allergic to it. I&#x27;ve been using the product for 15 years. It&#x27;s not greasy - unlike other,&#x27;heavier&#x27; lotions.</li>
            <li> My friend asked for it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for travel. Even though I have my signature perfume from Paris I still love using the &amp;#34;Splash&amp;#34; in the summer it was my &amp;#34;First&amp;#34; fragrance and a &amp;#34;Girl&amp;#34; never forgets that. I still get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Love the soft smell not to strong. Shipping was quick</li>
            <li> Great buy--Great smell--very fresh--great on shipping too -- will be buying when I get low !!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the scent I remember. They both smell like the plastic of a new dill instead of a fresh scent.</li>
