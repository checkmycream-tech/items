            <li> I am a perfume person!! I have tens of brands... All from well known brands!! I can say that from now on this is one of my top three favorites!! I really love it and it really lasts long time.  I got a lot of complements wherever I go! people actually smell it and notice it. It smells like fresh flower, calming smell as well. I feel it is great for all ages.</li>
            <li> My wife just informed me that this is not the same perfume that is advertised. The bottle is not even the same as the picture.</li>

            <li> This perfume is very, very nice. I like the tones, especially since I&#x27;ve researched them. Coffee? Very nice. It&#x27;s almost as good as Addict. I only buy one bottle of perfume per year. I think next year I will buy Play.</li>
