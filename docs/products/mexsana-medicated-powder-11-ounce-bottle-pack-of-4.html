            <li>I am real happy with this Mexana powder for chafing.  </li>
            <li>The medicated part comes from camphor and eucalyptus - the scent can be best described as &#x27;if Noxzema &amp; Vicks VapoRub had a baby&#x27;.</li>

            <li>So I was pleased to be able to access this product from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>never seen it before, but my wife knew it, and she said go for it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this, and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>When they did, it cost more than Amazon&#x27;s sells it for including shipping.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it here</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My rashes and candida are kept at bay better and for longer while using MEXSANA.</li>
            <li>Love this medicated powder is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find Mexsana powder in Walmart or any orher store in my city for a number of years (I used to always get it at Walmart).  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite powder.</li>
            <li>I am  glad they haven&#x27;t discontinued making it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Mexsana.</li>
            <li>Just want to say I have used Mexsana powder for many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product and always have.</li>
            <li>Its the best to keep your feet dry.</li>
            <li>So happy I was able to locate it once again on this sight as no other product has come even close to Mexana.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find it so cheap.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to those who looking to feel good all over their body.</li>
            <li>Very good quality powder that helps keep you dry and chafe-free.</li>
            <li>When I saw it was available on Amazon</li>
            <li>I was so pleasd to find it readily available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>think this is meant to be a foot powder, and I do use it for that (especially when lifting w/o socks in canvas shoes), but it works great for the bra area, thighs, and yes, your butt.</li>
            <li>This powder is great for all kinds of rashes especially this time of year.</li>
            <li>This product keeps me odor free without any irritation or clogged pores.</li>
            <li>This product is great, shipping is always on time and its the only place where I can get this product (in bulk).</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t find this powder at your local store this is a great place to buy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you wanted a product with a light scent that was an alternative to the baby powder scent, then you should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I was able to find it on-line because I wasn&#x27;t able to find it at any local stores.</li>
            <li>Good old dependable medicated powder that you can use for&lt;br /&gt;different applications.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for many many years, mainly as deodorant, also in shoes as needed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s been using</li>
            <li>Great powder, much better than plain talcum powder.</li>
            <li>This is hard to find and happy to find it through amazon.com my wife and mother in-law have been using it for years!</li>
            <li>i love this product because it really works.</li>
            <li>This is the only powder I have found that works this good.</li>
            <li>Works great for keeping feet dry of perspiration and shoes smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell of eucalyptus actually, but when it is this strong, even a nice scent can be ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon sells Mexana, since I haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and it never fails to stop chaffing, rashes, and so on... ;-)</li>
            <li>Most of my life, I have lived on the gulf coast in a high humidity environment.  </li>
            <li>I used to use normal powder for my son but this works much better.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it as a more general body powder and likes it fine.  </li>
            <li>but it works like magic without the cost of some of the new stuff out there.</li>
            <li>The primary ingredient in this product is corn starch which makes it very absorbant.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and the powder seems more cooling than burning - the more mentholated Gold Bond powders (especially the blue can) can be overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other products but they don&#x27;t feel as good and some of them seem prone to clumping.  </li>
            <li>If they would have I&#x27;m sure there would be more using it instead of the other brand!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years on my feet to absorb moisture and it does a fantastic job while at the same time keeping them odor free.  </li>
            <li>Keeps him nice and dry.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it in local stores anymore</li>
            <li>first I found that it soothed the itching of insect bites.  </li>
            <li>As a female, I&#x27;d prefer a non-talc powder, but most &#x27;medicated&#x27; powders are talc-based.</li>
            <li>I use a smaller amount and achieve better results.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve used it on my grand children with the same results.</li>
            <li>Somehow it works better if you don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li>It worked better than my regular powder.</li>
            <li>I appreciate being able to get it through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon as none of our local department stores or pharmacies&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to say this, not only did it meet my expectations but in the town where i live they don&#x27;t carry this product,and I&#x27;ve used this medicated powder for over fifty years thank you Amazon for carry this amazing product.</li>
            <li>It works great, is non-toxic, and one bottle lasts a long, long time (so, it&#x27;s also economical).On hot days, I toss some on as body powder as well.</li>
            <li>The powder is good to relieve itch of the skin, it absorbs moisture and seems to reduce fungal infections such as the various \\&quot;tinea\\&quot; types.</li>
            <li>Mexsana has been my favorite powder for as long as I can remember - even used it when my baby was still in diapers</li>
            <li>Love this powder and will always continue to purchase as long as it stays on the market</li>
            <li>does help relieve minor skin irritations better than&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought wife 4 large bottles.</li>
            <li>There was ONE Walgreens in our large metropolitan area (pop 1,000,000 or so) that carried it.</li>
            <li>It really helps sooth my sore aching feet.</li>
            <li>When I relocated up north, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere within reasonable driving distance.  </li>
            <li>It stops any itch and is very comforting.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>It was across town from my work/home, and they had 2 whole cans.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Never having heard of this brand I really didn&#x27;t want to buy a 4 pack</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>I am currently rash free.  </li>
            <li>your bottom itch because you&#x27;ve been sitting on it too much?  </li>
            <li>then you should absolutely buy this.</li>
            <li>, IT REALLY  </li>
            <li>MUCH  </li>
            <li>no matter how much I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have my regular powder available and decided to try this one out.</li>
            <li>However, I have returned to using MEXSANA because the other one, while it did seemingly work better in the beginning, over time I noticed that it didn&#x27;t help me as much as MEXSANA does.</li>
            <li>and it is the only thing I have found that will make the rash disappearing quickly and brings me much needed relief.</li>
            <li>If that &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; worries you, I have a very sensitive nose and it only smells lightly of thecamphor and eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>They should have advertised it more like the other brand did!</li>
            <li>I once put a date on a new bottle and it lasted me 10 months!</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re talking about sensitive, personal areas, that is a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>it always keeps me dry and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years, where ever one may start to chafe, this will likely stop it quickly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The bottle is made of lightweight durable plastic that has an adjustable shaker top so that you can pour a little or a lot of powder out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately the product was in a plastic bag and was not as wet as the box it came in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda surprised it isn&#x27;t advertised as deodorant, it really works for me.</li>
            <li>it was even better than going to Wal-Mart, because I didn&#x27;t have to waste my time and gas to find out</li>
            <li>I began changing her diapers in 1977 and struggled along with all the normal issues that happen when someone is in diapers 24/7 all of their life.  </li>
            <li>Brand Prickly Heat Powder\\&quot;, which I thought worked \\&quot;just a tad better\\&quot; - namely because it has essential oils in it, so the powder, while still dry, is a bit thicker and \\&quot;creamier\\&quot;; so it \\&quot;rubs on\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;puff on\\&quot; and stays on a bit better.  </li>
            <li>keeps you cool an dry.</li>
            <li>Since I was in Southamerica, I used Mexana many years , but here in Europe is not easy to find.</li>
            <li>and i was disappointed that Walmart discontinued carrying this awesome product.</li>
            <li>The powder is odorless and it really helps calm and heal rashes, chafing, and other skin</li>
            <li>I actually came across this product in my husband&#x27;s medicine cabinet when we first met.</li>
            <li>So I use both powders, but MEXSANA daily and Snake powder sporadically for special occasions when I sweat an extra amount, or something.</li>
            <li>It keeps you dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have used scented body powders with limited success.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.  </li>
            <li>I live in the hot, humid South, and I work out pretty heavily.</li>
            <li>Have used Mexsana for several years as a deterrent to heat rash and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>and it still working on my 34 year old son.</li>
            <li>Old remedy</li>
            <li>When I developed an allergy to deodorant, once again my trusted Mexana came to the rescue.  </li>
            <li>We really like Mexsana and use it extensively in the summer time so help avoid and treat heat rash.  </li>
            <li>As part of that non-toxic plan, I&#x27;ve been using Mexsana as a deodorant for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li>I am an adult in my fifties who was introduced to Mexsana Medicated Powder by my mother when I was a youngster.</li>
            <li>After trying this product among others over many years it manages very well the occasional negative issues that arise.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, especially in the summer months and have found no other product as quick acting as this one for prickly heat, eczema, mosquito bites, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering with it smell and keeps my feet dry and comfortable all day long.</li>
            <li>By putting a small amount on my feet before I put on my socks every morning, my feet stay dry and warm in the winter because it absorbs the sweat.</li>
            <li>and I mean love the stuff</li>
            <li>Not sure why this powder is so hard to find, great product.</li>
            <li>Since I have sensitive skin in the under arm area and cannot use most deoderants, I experimented cutting Mexsana with a little talc and found it extremely effective.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell form the list of ingredients, it is most likely cornstarch plus essential oils and a few</li>
            <li>Love this product, but having a hard time to find it locally.</li>
            <li>Might last for several years if she doesn&#x27;t spill much.</li>
            <li>I have only positive things to say about this rather simple but in my opinion necessary product.</li>
            <li>All the other powders have too much scent.  </li>
            <li>With Gold Bond, you get half as much for twice the money.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> I am real happy with this Mexana powder for chafing.  </li>
            <li> The medicated part comes from camphor and eucalyptus - the scent can be best described as &#x27;if Noxzema &amp; Vicks VapoRub had a baby&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re out-positioned by almost everyone, but have been the best for over fifty years.</li>

            <li> so was thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li> Over the years we have used Mexana for any kind of a rash and it always works.  </li>
            <li> However, one of the reviewers was so enthusiastic about Mexsana that I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>

            <li> I had four more children, and never had diaper rash again, as I used this every time I changed a diaper.  </li>
            <li> My wife was so glad to find this.  </li>
            <li> Wish we could have gotten more.</li>

            <li> BETTER THAN  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> So I was pleased to be able to access this product from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> never seen it before, but my wife knew it, and she said go for it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this, and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> When they did, it cost more than Amazon&#x27;s sells it for including shipping.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it here</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My rashes and candida are kept at bay better and for longer while using MEXSANA.</li>
            <li> Love this medicated powder is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find Mexsana powder in Walmart or any orher store in my city for a number of years (I used to always get it at Walmart).  </li>
            <li> It is my favorite powder.</li>
            <li> I am  glad they haven&#x27;t discontinued making it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Mexsana.</li>
            <li> Just want to say I have used Mexsana powder for many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the product and always have.</li>
            <li> Its the best to keep your feet dry.</li>
            <li> So happy I was able to locate it once again on this sight as no other product has come even close to Mexana.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find it so cheap.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to those who looking to feel good all over their body.</li>
            <li> Very good quality powder that helps keep you dry and chafe-free.</li>
            <li> When I saw it was available on Amazon</li>
            <li> I was so pleasd to find it readily available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> think this is meant to be a foot powder, and I do use it for that (especially when lifting w/o socks in canvas shoes), but it works great for the bra area, thighs, and yes, your butt.</li>
            <li> This powder is great for all kinds of rashes especially this time of year.</li>
            <li> This product keeps me odor free without any irritation or clogged pores.</li>
            <li> This product is great, shipping is always on time and its the only place where I can get this product (in bulk).</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t find this powder at your local store this is a great place to buy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you wanted a product with a light scent that was an alternative to the baby powder scent, then you should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I was able to find it on-line because I wasn&#x27;t able to find it at any local stores.</li>
            <li> Good old dependable medicated powder that you can use for&lt;br /&gt;different applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for many many years, mainly as deodorant, also in shoes as needed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s been using</li>
            <li> Great powder, much better than plain talcum powder.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find and happy to find it through amazon.com my wife and mother in-law have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> i love this product because it really works.</li>
            <li> This is the only powder I have found that works this good.</li>
            <li> Works great for keeping feet dry of perspiration and shoes smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell of eucalyptus actually, but when it is this strong, even a nice scent can be ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad Amazon sells Mexana, since I haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it and it never fails to stop chaffing, rashes, and so on... ;-)</li>
            <li> Most of my life, I have lived on the gulf coast in a high humidity environment.  </li>
            <li> I used to use normal powder for my son but this works much better.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it as a more general body powder and likes it fine.  </li>
            <li> but it works like magic without the cost of some of the new stuff out there.</li>
            <li> The primary ingredient in this product is corn starch which makes it very absorbant.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and the powder seems more cooling than burning - the more mentholated Gold Bond powders (especially the blue can) can be overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other products but they don&#x27;t feel as good and some of them seem prone to clumping.  </li>
            <li> If they would have I&#x27;m sure there would be more using it instead of the other brand!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years on my feet to absorb moisture and it does a fantastic job while at the same time keeping them odor free.  </li>
            <li> Keeps him nice and dry.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to find it in local stores anymore</li>
            <li> first I found that it soothed the itching of insect bites.  </li>
            <li> As a female, I&#x27;d prefer a non-talc powder, but most &#x27;medicated&#x27; powders are talc-based.</li>
            <li> I use a smaller amount and achieve better results.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve used it on my grand children with the same results.</li>
            <li> Somehow it works better if you don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li> It worked better than my regular powder.</li>
            <li> I appreciate being able to get it through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon as none of our local department stores or pharmacies&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say this, not only did it meet my expectations but in the town where i live they don&#x27;t carry this product,and I&#x27;ve used this medicated powder for over fifty years thank you Amazon for carry this amazing product.</li>
            <li> It works great, is non-toxic, and one bottle lasts a long, long time (so, it&#x27;s also economical).On hot days, I toss some on as body powder as well.</li>
            <li> The powder is good to relieve itch of the skin, it absorbs moisture and seems to reduce fungal infections such as the various \\&quot;tinea\\&quot; types.</li>
            <li> Mexsana has been my favorite powder for as long as I can remember - even used it when my baby was still in diapers</li>
            <li> Love this powder and will always continue to purchase as long as it stays on the market</li>
            <li> does help relieve minor skin irritations better than&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought wife 4 large bottles.</li>
            <li> There was ONE Walgreens in our large metropolitan area (pop 1,000,000 or so) that carried it.</li>
            <li> It really helps sooth my sore aching feet.</li>
            <li> When I relocated up north, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere within reasonable driving distance.  </li>
            <li> It stops any itch and is very comforting.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> It was across town from my work/home, and they had 2 whole cans.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never having heard of this brand I really didn&#x27;t want to buy a 4 pack</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am currently rash free.  </li>
            <li> your bottom itch because you&#x27;ve been sitting on it too much?  </li>
            <li> then you should absolutely buy this.</li>
            <li> , IT REALLY  </li>
            <li> MUCH  </li>
            <li> no matter how much I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have my regular powder available and decided to try this one out.</li>
            <li> However, I have returned to using MEXSANA because the other one, while it did seemingly work better in the beginning, over time I noticed that it didn&#x27;t help me as much as MEXSANA does.</li>
            <li> and it is the only thing I have found that will make the rash disappearing quickly and brings me much needed relief.</li>
            <li> If that &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; worries you, I have a very sensitive nose and it only smells lightly of thecamphor and eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> They should have advertised it more like the other brand did!</li>
            <li> I once put a date on a new bottle and it lasted me 10 months!</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re talking about sensitive, personal areas, that is a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> it always keeps me dry and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, where ever one may start to chafe, this will likely stop it quickly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The bottle is made of lightweight durable plastic that has an adjustable shaker top so that you can pour a little or a lot of powder out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately the product was in a plastic bag and was not as wet as the box it came in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda surprised it isn&#x27;t advertised as deodorant, it really works for me.</li>
            <li> it was even better than going to Wal-Mart, because I didn&#x27;t have to waste my time and gas to find out</li>
            <li> I began changing her diapers in 1977 and struggled along with all the normal issues that happen when someone is in diapers 24/7 all of their life.  </li>
            <li> Brand Prickly Heat Powder\\&quot;, which I thought worked \\&quot;just a tad better\\&quot; - namely because it has essential oils in it, so the powder, while still dry, is a bit thicker and \\&quot;creamier\\&quot;; so it \\&quot;rubs on\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;puff on\\&quot; and stays on a bit better.  </li>
            <li> keeps you cool an dry.</li>
            <li> Since I was in Southamerica, I used Mexana many years , but here in Europe is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> and i was disappointed that Walmart discontinued carrying this awesome product.</li>
            <li> The powder is odorless and it really helps calm and heal rashes, chafing, and other skin</li>
            <li> I actually came across this product in my husband&#x27;s medicine cabinet when we first met.</li>
            <li> So I use both powders, but MEXSANA daily and Snake powder sporadically for special occasions when I sweat an extra amount, or something.</li>
            <li> It keeps you dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have used scented body powders with limited success.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.  </li>
            <li> I live in the hot, humid South, and I work out pretty heavily.</li>
            <li> Have used Mexsana for several years as a deterrent to heat rash and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> and it still working on my 34 year old son.</li>
            <li> Old remedy</li>
            <li> When I developed an allergy to deodorant, once again my trusted Mexana came to the rescue.  </li>
            <li> We really like Mexsana and use it extensively in the summer time so help avoid and treat heat rash.  </li>
            <li> As part of that non-toxic plan, I&#x27;ve been using Mexsana as a deodorant for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li> I am an adult in my fifties who was introduced to Mexsana Medicated Powder by my mother when I was a youngster.</li>
            <li> After trying this product among others over many years it manages very well the occasional negative issues that arise.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, especially in the summer months and have found no other product as quick acting as this one for prickly heat, eczema, mosquito bites, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering with it smell and keeps my feet dry and comfortable all day long.</li>
            <li> By putting a small amount on my feet before I put on my socks every morning, my feet stay dry and warm in the winter because it absorbs the sweat.</li>
            <li> and I mean love the stuff</li>
            <li> Not sure why this powder is so hard to find, great product.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin in the under arm area and cannot use most deoderants, I experimented cutting Mexsana with a little talc and found it extremely effective.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell form the list of ingredients, it is most likely cornstarch plus essential oils and a few</li>
            <li> Love this product, but having a hard time to find it locally.</li>
            <li> Might last for several years if she doesn&#x27;t spill much.</li>
            <li> I have only positive things to say about this rather simple but in my opinion necessary product.</li>
            <li> All the other powders have too much scent.  </li>
            <li> With Gold Bond, you get half as much for twice the money.  </li>
            <li> those who need a complete list of ingredients, here they are: active ingredient is topical starch 83.7%.</li>
            <li> Bought plenty to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It dries and kills rashes,keep u dry in those private areas and promotes healing of  minors cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other products, including Gold Bond, Johnson&#x27;s and various store brands - but nothing compares to Mexsana.  </li>
            <li> , your skin is irritated, or you just need a little cooling down because your thighs are creating too much friction in your corduroys, you must try this powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the power for a long time I do like it a lot.                                    </li>
            <li> It goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and types but always come back to Mexsana.</li>
            <li> This powder goes above and beyond any other on the market.</li>
            <li> Absolutely dry and rash</li>
            <li> I started using Mexsana Medicated Powers on him and it has kept him dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s odorless, keeps you incredibly dry; and I haven&#x27;t had B.O. in years --</li>
            <li> Have previously purchased at a local source, but they stopped carrying it for some unknown reason.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that UPS left it on my front porch IN THE SNOW, and I did not know it was there for TWO DAYS.  </li>
            <li> This includes all of the Gold Bond powders (in order of mentholated goodness: orange, green, and the blue foot powder).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gold Bond&#x27;s Baby Powder (cornstarch-based) as well as Lady Anti-Monkey Butt Powder (pink can), but both lack any sort of tingle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ITS  NOT  READILY AVIABLE IN LCAL  STORES ,</li>
            <li> Mexsana is the ONLY product I use in my disabled Daughters diaper.  </li>
            <li> Because the base is cornstarch rather than talc like most of the competitors, Mexsana is absorbent and the inevitable dust is organic, not rock particles.</li>
            <li> Certainly not like the overpowering smell of a menthol rub on your chest.  </li>
            <li> The other brands feel like they leave a film coating on your skin</li>
            <li> Usually diaper rash will be gone by the next day.  </li>
            <li> i began using it as a deoderant because all other deoderants irretated my skin.</li>
            <li> some other medicated powders I have tried.</li>
            <li> other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to buy this from Walmart but they no longer carry it and neither do a number of other discount stores.  </li>
            <li> It does have a &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; menthol type smell but unlike other reviewers I do not find the smell overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li> That other powder I discovered was \\&quot;Snake</li>
            <li> It is one of the very few powders that is actually absorbent and gets rid of moisture on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get local.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores, but inexpensive here.</li>
            <li> I have used this powder continuously for at least the last 20 years!</li>
            <li> only thing that sucks about Mexsana?</li>
            <li> No summer rashes, either under arms or down under.</li>
            <li> Seems as if \\&quot;Gold Bond Powder\\&quot; has knocked it and a few other brands off the shelves.  </li>
            <li> In need of a little TLC for your integumentary system?</li>
            <li> Mexsana is very hard to find for me locally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even checked a few grocery stores, to no avail.</li>
            <li> Also just cornstarch, so no problem with heavy metals, etc.</li>
            <li> Another thing I found with both Gold Bond and Snake Brand powders is that over time they dried me out, whereas Mexsana never has.  </li>
            <li> No more messy sauves.  </li>
            <li> Young clerks just say DUH!!!  </li>
            <li> No more anusitis either .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but it just does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s damn near impossible to find a cornstarch-based powder that is also &#x27;medicated&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to find.  </li>
            <li> hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> It is now hard to find in the stores, so I ordered this online.</li>
            <li> I work and play hard, and sweat a lot.  </li>
            <li> This is a little known secret, but I use this stuff instead of deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy that I can&#x27;t find this item locally.  </li>
            <li> I use it during hunting season in my boots and because it keeps my feet dry it also keeps them from getting cold.</li>
            <li> I had tried a big-name powder a few years ago which failed to help me, so I hadn&#x27;t even thought of powder as the solution to my problem.</li>
            <li> Faint scent is hardly noticeable after application.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone who works outside and suffers from cold feet.</li>
            <li> and it seems like they do a poor job of moisture absorption.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Caution:  Do not use on broken skin.  </li>
            <li> I get horrible rashes during the summer months, mainly on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would have the typical, medicated or slightly menthol-ish scent, but this product smells HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Hard to say anything bad about some foot powder.</li>
            <li> TOO BAD  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re just rashy, itchy, scratchy, or otherwise uncomfortable, use away!!</li>
            <li> My husband had very bad feet</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This powder is excellent for men especially.  I am allergic to stick and spray on deodorants and this does a real good job for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this powder for over 30 years. Its the best to keep your feet dry. Would recommend for every day use.</li>
            <li> I sprinkle Mexsana medicated powder on my feet after applying eucerin cream on them.  It really helps sooth my sore aching feet.</li>
            <li> Great powder, much better than plain talcum powder.</li>
            <li> When I lived in Texas, Mexsana was always stocked at the local Walmart.  When I relocated up north, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere within reasonable driving distance.  God bless the internet and Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other products, including Gold Bond, Johnson&#x27;s and various store brands - but nothing compares to Mexsana.  The other brands feel like they leave a film coating on your skin and it seems like they do a poor job of moisture absorption.  I didn&#x27;t realize how good I had it with Mexsana until I didn&#x27;t have it anymore!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It stops any itch and is very comforting. It smells good too. I use it a lot in the summer to avoid rash and chaffing. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Mexsana is very hard to find for me locally.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon because this to me is the best powder on the market.  I heartily endorse it!</li>
            <li> This is hard to find and happy to find it through amazon.com my wife and mother in-law have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> Mexana is a great product. I used to purchase it from Wal-mart but in their infinite wisdom they have decided to quit selling it. Now I purchase it from amazon.com    I have bought items from amazon for years and have never been dissapointed, keep up the good work Amazon.    Brenda Newberry</li>
            <li> Glad to find this product somewhere.  Seems as if \\&quot;Gold Bond Powder\\&quot; has knocked it and a few other brands off the shelves.  With Gold Bond, you get half as much for twice the money.  Stores I have bought Mexsana at for years now tell me they never heard of it. Young clerks just say DUH!!!  Bought wife 4 large bottles. Might last for several years if she doesn&#x27;t spill much.</li>
            <li> I have used this powder continuously for at least the last 20 years! I can no longer find it in stores and it is no longer listed on the Schering-Plough website! When I saw it was available on Amazon I jumped for joy!!! This powder, in my opinion is sooooo much better than Gold Bond without the mediciney smell to it! I am stocking up in case they have quit making it! They should have advertised it more like the other brand did! If they would have I&#x27;m sure there would be more using it instead of the other brand! One bottle and you will switch brands FOREVER!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure why this powder is so hard to find, great product. No toxic talc in here, just corn starch and camphor, eucalyptus. Good for all kinds of skin irritation and rashes, foot problems.</li>
            <li> I am real happy with this Mexana powder for chafing.  Does the trick just as everyone says, and has a nice cooling feeling when you put it on.  I am allergic to anything with petroleum products in it, so this works well for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Hard to find.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Good price. So glad to have it.</li>
            <li> This powder is outstanding! Gr8 for heat rash and bumps. I have tried many products for this condition and none comes close to this product. VERY effective and when used daily the condition will not even appear. I have not been able to find it in local stores anymore so was thrilled to find it here. The price is cheaper than when I did buy it locally also. Gotta love Amazon.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, WORK, FAST AN ACCURATE INFORMATION  AND THE PRODUCT IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING AND AMAZON  GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITTY  TO GET IT THANKS</li>
            <li> Prompt service and quality product.  My only complaint was that UPS left it on my front porch IN THE SNOW, and I did not know it was there for TWO DAYS.  Fortunately the product was in a plastic bag and was not as wet as the box it came in.</li>
            <li> I was elated to find this product!  None of the drug stores in my area carry it anymore and I have noticed since ordering it from you that some Wal-Mart stores carry it.  I have been using this product for years, especially in the summer months and have found no other product as quick acting as this one for prickly heat, eczema, mosquito bites, etc.  I think the zinc in the ingredients is the key and the fact that it contains no talc.</li>
            <li> I have usedd this product for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I found that it soothed the itching of insect bites.  I also found that Mexsan Powder also relieved chaffing.  I was so pleasd to find it readily available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a search for a good, tingly body powder for a while now. As a female, I&#x27;d prefer a non-talc powder, but most &#x27;medicated&#x27; powders are talc-based. This includes all of the Gold Bond powders (in order of mentholated goodness: orange, green, and the blue foot powder). I&#x27;ve been using Gold Bond&#x27;s Baby Powder (cornstarch-based) as well as Lady Anti-Monkey Butt Powder (pink can), but both lack any sort of tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s damn near impossible to find a cornstarch-based powder that is also &#x27;medicated&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the need for powder? I live in the hot, humid South, and I work out pretty heavily. Even just EXISTING in the spring and summer months can lead to bra sweat and just feeling gross. The BF swears by &#x27;tingly&#x27; powder for his, um, dude parts, but he isn&#x27;t avoiding talc. So, he sticks to Gold Bond, but has recently found my Mexsana and I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Mexsana - it&#x27;s talc-based, with plenty of zinc oxide &amp; kaolin clay to absorb moisture. The medicated part comes from camphor and eucalyptus - the scent can be best described as &#x27;if Noxzema &amp; Vicks VapoRub had a baby&#x27;. Personally, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is meant to be a foot powder, and I do use it for that (especially when lifting w/o socks in canvas shoes), but it works great for the bra area, thighs, and yes, your butt. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and the powder seems more cooling than burning - the more mentholated Gold Bond powders (especially the blue can) can be overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that sucks about Mexsana? Literally nobody stocks it. There was ONE Walgreens in our large metropolitan area (pop 1,000,000 or so) that carried it. It was across town from my work/home, and they had 2 whole cans. I bought both. Don&#x27;t bother checking CVS, Rite Aid, Wal-Mart, K-Mart (yes they still exist) or Target. They don&#x27;t have it. I&#x27;ve even checked a few grocery stores, to no avail. It was $4.99/can at Walgreen&#x27;s, which is about what Amazon charges. So, now I avoid wasting gas and driving around, and get 4 bottles at a time, since I know 2 of them will end up swiped by the BF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Mexsana is like powdered Noxzema/VapoRub, but cornstarch-based instead of talc.t Amazon charges. So, now I avoid wasting gas and driving around, and get 4 bottles at a time, since I know 2 of them will end up swiped by the BF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Mexsana is like powdered Noxzema/VapoRub, but cornstarch-based instead of talc.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Have used Mexsana for several years as a deterrent to heat rash and it works very well.  Have previously purchased at a local source, but they stopped carrying it for some unknown reason.  Found it on Amazon and have been very pleased with their price and speedy shipping.</li>
            <li> I had use it before, but I could not get it in the stores or pharmacies in my area, so I went on  line.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a very good medicated powder.</li>
            <li> Mexsana is the all-purpose body powder. Works for feet, prickly heat and rashes, chafing, and as a deodorant in lieu of chemical sticks or roll-ons. Works great for a quick freshen-up while traveling or working out. Because the base is cornstarch rather than talc like most of the competitors, Mexsana is absorbent and the inevitable dust is organic, not rock particles. They&#x27;re out-positioned by almost everyone, but have been the best for over fifty years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mexsana powder for many years.  I always bought it at Wal-Mart but they stop carrying it, so I search online and found that I could purchase it from Amazon. I order and it was even better than going to Wal-Mart, because I didn&#x27;t have to waste my time and gas to find out they didn&#x27;t it even after I called to check to see if it was in stock. I&#x27;m very pleased with during business at amazom.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found it.  Bought plenty to last a long time.  I think the &amp;#34;inactive&amp;#34; ingredient of camphor is actually what makes this powder a cure all for any type of skin issue especially a fungal type.  It works so well for so many things.</li>
            <li> These are the best powders ever created!!!  They&#x27;re great for babies for diaper rash.  No more messy sauves.  Simply sprinkle on the powders.  Usually diaper rash will be gone by the next day.  Use every time you change a baby to prevent diaper rash.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001EJONSG Mexsana Medicated Powder, 11-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)]]  Appreciate being able to get this product, a it is no longer stocked at the drug store.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have never found a powder that stops sweating and heat rash that worked until trying this one.  Absolutely dry and rash gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern now is Why?  Is there anything in this one that may be harmful if used daily?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never having heard of this brand I really didn&#x27;t want to buy a 4 pack but now I&#x27;m really glad I took a chance.</li>
            <li> Great product!  keeps you cool an dry. Great in the summertime when working!  Would highly recommend to anyone! hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but having a hard time to find it locally.</li>
            <li> This powder is great for all kinds of rashes especially this time of year. I have used it for 50 years and I am so glad to be able to find it.</li>
            <li> I use it every night after I bathe.  I can&#x27;t use deodorant and this works perfectly for me.  I love it.  Also just cornstarch, so no problem with heavy metals, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is the best thing on the market for heat rash. I never leave home on a trip without it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the power for a long time I do like it a lot.                                    Thank you Tom.</li>
            <li> i love this product because it really works. It dries and kills rashes,keep u dry in those private areas and promotes healing of  minors cuts and scrapes.I used this product as a kid and i was disappointed that Walmart discontinued carrying this awesome product.I highly recommend this product to those who looking to feel good all over their body.</li>
            <li> have used this product for many years it seems to work when the corn starch powder doesnt seem to help</li>
            <li> This is the best powder ever for keeping your feet dry healthy and smelling good. I use it during hunting season in my boots and because it keeps my feet dry it also keeps them from getting cold. This is the only powder I have found that works this good.</li>
            <li> When Desitin wouldn&#x27;t work on my son&#x27;s diaper rash, another mom told me about Mexana.  I used it and the rash was gone! I had four more children, and never had diaper rash again, as I used this every time I changed a diaper.  Over the years we have used Mexana for any kind of a rash and it always works.  When all the stores in our town stopped carrying it, I was relieved to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My wife was so glad to find this.  Wish we could have gotten more. Hope you have alot in stock.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy that I can&#x27;t find this item locally.  It is a great product. It keeps you dry and fresh. It prevents chaffing and heat rash.  Most deodorants irritate my skin.  This product keeps me odor free without any irritation or clogged pores.</li>
            <li> This powder is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not overpowering with it smell and keeps my feet dry and comfortable all day long.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but can longer find locally. Great product if you need a medicated powder.</li>
            <li> Very good quality powder that helps keep you dry and chafe-free. I use it regularly and have for years.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and types but always come back to Mexsana.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years &amp; it works great to prevent heat rash. It is now hard to find in the stores, so I ordered this online.</li>
            <li> My Dad used this powder for his feet 50 years ago, and now my husband uses it. Works great for keeping feet dry of perspiration and shoes smelling fresh. Thank you Amazon for carrying this product because I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores in our area.</li>
            <li> This product is great, shipping is always on time and its the only place where I can get this product (in bulk). I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t find this powder at your local store this is a great place to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Walmart quit carrying it in Nevada and now I have another place to buy it with convenience.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this stuff and swears by it.  He says that it is the only powder that will keep him from chaffing.</li>
            <li> I started using Mexsana on all 3 of my babies starting 44 years ago. Ten years ago my son had an accident and was bedridden. I started using Mexsana Medicated Powers on him and it has kept him dry and he has had no bedsores sense his accident. His Doctor does no how I have kept him from having skin breakdown. I know how well Mexsana worked on my babies bottoms and it still working on my 34 year old son.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the store anymore.  It&#x27;s terrific to subscribe to it and automatically get a shipment every quarter.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, works well, I&#x27;ve used it for many years.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best medicated powder on the market.  I have used it for years.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for all needs requiring dryness. It also has a wonderful scent, instead of that just powder smell.</li>
            <li> I get horrible rashes during the summer months, mainly on my legs.  I&#x27;ve tried different products over the years and none have worked, including some prescription creams.  I did a search on Amazon, and found Mexsana.  I had tried a big-name powder a few years ago which failed to help me, so I hadn&#x27;t even thought of powder as the solution to my problem. I figured &amp;#34;powder is powder&amp;#34;.  However, one of the reviewers was so enthusiastic about Mexsana that I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  Well, it seems to be working for me.  I bought the 4-pack, and I have each bottle somewhere; work, bedroom, bathrooms.  I powder in the morning, at bedtime and whenever I feel an itch.  I am currently rash free.  Another benefit that (I think) I&#x27;m seeing is fewer mosquito bites.  Mosquitos think that I&#x27;m delicious, but they haven&#x27;t been going after my legs anymore.</li>
            <li> After trying this product among others over many years it manages very well the occasional negative issues that arise.  Since I have sensitive skin in the under arm area and cannot use most deoderants, I experimented cutting Mexsana with a little talc and found it extremely effective.</li>
            <li> product works much better than all the others I have tried.  I use a smaller amount and achieve better results.</li>
            <li> I love this powder on my sack ! Feels so good. No more anusitis either . Woo Hoo.</li>
            <li> Chafing?  Itching?  In need of a little TLC for your integumentary system? This is the powder for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your feet are aching, your skin is irritated, or you just need a little cooling down because your thighs are creating too much friction in your corduroys, you must try this powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does your bottom itch because you&#x27;ve been sitting on it too much?  Is sweat beneath your breasts (or man boobs) creating a problem for you?  Use Mexsana!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution:  Do not use on broken skin.  It burns like fire!!!  But if you&#x27;re just rashy, itchy, scratchy, or otherwise uncomfortable, use away!!</li>
            <li> i started using mexsana 26 yrs ago when my oldest had a heat rash. i began using it as a deoderant because all other deoderants irretated my skin. it&#x27;s the only thing i can use, especially now that i&#x27;m developing chemical sensitivities. i can&#x27;t find it in stores out here and i&#x27;ve looked all over</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Nothing else on market works as well for me. By putting a small amount on my feet before I put on my socks every morning, my feet stay dry and warm in the winter because it absorbs the sweat. I would recommend this to everyone who works outside and suffers from cold feet. Life is much more bearable when I use the Mexsana medicated powder. Works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say this, not only did it meet my expectations but in the town where i live they don&#x27;t carry this product,and I&#x27;ve used this medicated powder for over fifty years thank you Amazon for carry this amazing product. when i run out i know where to get it again. great job amazon</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product daily.  I was glad to find it in the four pack which saved me time shopping for more when the container was emptied.</li>
            <li> Old remedy but it works like magic without the cost of some of the new stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try to relieve irritation in areas that stay sweaty.  I have used scented body powders with limited success.  The Mexsana powder does not smell very good but it is helping my skin. I cannot comment on the price since I have not looked in stores, and I love the convenience of buying online.</li>
            <li> Good old dependable medicated powder that you can use for&lt;br /&gt;different applications. It does not give you a burning sensation&lt;br /&gt;like some other medicated powders I have tried.</li>
            <li> The product is a standard corn starch powder. I thought it would have the typical, medicated or slightly menthol-ish scent, but this product smells HORRIBLE. Imagine cramming the essential oil extract from 200 eucalyptus plants into 1 bottle. Before I even opened the shipping packaging I could smell bottles. I don&#x27;t mind the smell of eucalyptus actually, but when it is this strong, even a nice scent can be ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like eucalyptus (and I mean love the stuff-like you want to smell it and smell like it for the rest of your life) then you should absolutely buy this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wanted a product with a light scent that was an alternative to the baby powder scent, then you should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my grandmother as the best item to treat heat rashes for babies. It worked like a charm and was a good value for money. The supplier shipped on time and the product came in perfect condition. I would purchase both the product and from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> GREAT POWDER  TOO BAD  ITS  NOT  READILY AVIABLE IN LCAL  STORES ,, IT REALLY  DOES WORK  MUCH  BETTER THAN  ANY  POWDER,, ON ANY( BODY PART )IVE EVER  TRIED  hope they never  change indgrents</li>
            <li> Mexsana is the ONLY product I use in my disabled Daughters diaper.  I began changing her diapers in 1977 and struggled along with all the normal issues that happen when someone is in diapers 24/7 all of their life.  I tried this along the way and NEVER had any skin issues since then (over a decade ago).  I am so grateful to have happened upon a product that preforms well.</li>
            <li> Love it. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Oh! Come on! It&#x27;s just corn starch ,,, how much more can you say? ... How much more can you say?</li>
            <li> love the transaction, great service.  Love mexsana it always keeps me dry and comfortable. Being fat it goes in all my nooks &amp; crannies to keep sweat away.</li>
            <li> This is a little known secret, but I use this stuff instead of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s odorless, keeps you incredibly dry; and I haven&#x27;t had B.O. in years -- no matter how much I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Try it.</li>
            <li> Good product,have used Mexsana for many years.</li>
            <li> My mother used Mexana Powder on my brothers and my self and we never had diaper rash.  Remember using it as a kid in Arizona during the summer to keep heat rash away.  When I had children I also used Mexana and there was never a case of diaper rash.  Now I&#x27;ve used it on my grand children with the same results. When I developed an allergy to deodorant, once again my trusted Mexana came to the rescue.  Can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.  So happy I was able to locate it once again on this sight as no other product has come even close to Mexana.</li>
            <li> I used to use normal powder for my son but this works much better. It keeps away moisture and rash. It also doesn&#x27;t poof clouds of dust at him.</li>
            <li> Hard to say anything bad about some foot powder. It makes my shoes smell good and that is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> We really like Mexsana and use it extensively in the summer time so help avoid and treat heat rash.  A nice old-fashioned product that we have used all our lives.  It works and is not pricey.</li>
            <li> I already knew it.Since I was in Southamerica, I used Mexana many years , but here in Europe is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> And Amazon has the best prices. I use this for rashes, itchy skin. I works well without the harmful chemicals. I&#x27;ve use this  product since I was a child</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for heat rash and razor burn rash and I have used it for years. Hard to get local. This is why I order it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad Amazon sells Mexana, since I haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally. I have been using this powder since college for heat rash and it is the only thing I have found that will make the rash disappearing quickly and brings me much needed relief.</li>
            <li> I like to use non-toxic products as much as possible. As part of that non-toxic plan, I&#x27;ve been using Mexsana as a deodorant for nearly 30 years. It works great, is non-toxic, and one bottle lasts a long, long time (so, it&#x27;s also economical).On hot days, I toss some on as body powder as well. As far as I can tell form the list of ingredients, it is most likely cornstarch plus essential oils and a few other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who need a complete list of ingredients, here they are: active ingredient is topical starch 83.7%. inactive ingredients are benzethonium chloride, camphor, eucalyptus, globulus leaf oil, fragrance, kaolin, lemon oil, and zinc oxide. If that &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; worries you, I have a very sensitive nose and it only smells lightly of thecamphor and eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> Best medicated powder on the market. My husband had very bad feet we tried everything even a precription medication nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;Started useing mexsana cleared up his feet in very short time problem has never returned that was about 40 years ago. It has many uses even healed a sore on my cat. Love it!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this from Walmart but they no longer carry it and neither do a number of other discount stores.  So I was pleased to be able to access this product from Amazon.  I have used this product for years on my feet to absorb moisture and it does a fantastic job while at the same time keeping them odor free.  I have used other products but they don&#x27;t feel as good and some of them seem prone to clumping.  This doesn&#x27;t happen with Mexsana.  My wife uses it as a more general body powder and likes it fine.  The primary ingredient in this product is corn starch which makes it very absorbant.  I have only positive things to say about this rather simple but in my opinion necessary product.</li>
            <li> This is a medicated powder that I used for a number of years, and suddenly in the \\&quot;wisdom\\&quot; of some distributor it became \\&quot;no longer available.\\&quot;  I am very pleased that Amazon still has a source. The powder is good to relieve itch of the skin, it absorbs moisture and seems to reduce fungal infections such as the various \\&quot;tinea\\&quot; types.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;Previously I used gold bond, and this is way cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never seen it before, but my wife knew it, and she said go for it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this, and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great foot powder - absorbs moisture</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find Mexsana locally anymore.  Target and Walmart don&#x27;t carry it.  When they did, it cost more than Amazon&#x27;s sells it for including shipping.  This is a must have product for living in humid south Florida.  Faint scent is hardly noticeable after application.  I keep and apply it in the shower stall to avoid dust everywhere.</li>
            <li> Mexsana has been my favorite powder for as long as I can remember - even used it when my baby was still in diapers and she is in her mid-forties now... I love the smell of it and it never fails to stop chaffing, rashes, and so on... ;-)</li>
            <li> A great all purpose bath powder.  I have been using it for many years and it works!  Just enough medication to help if there is some irritation.</li>
            <li> Great for many uses..primarily baby butt rash.  I have never been able to find it so cheap.  Glad I found it here</li>
            <li> Most of my life, I have lived on the gulf coast in a high humidity environment.  I work and play hard, and sweat a lot.  I have tried almost every type of powder product on the market to relieve the itching effects of fungus.  Mexsana is the \\&quot;best ever medicated powder\\&quot; that I have used.  I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores or pharmacies around here, so, Amazon to the rescue.  I really love it!!</li>
            <li> Great in summertime, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, have used it for many, many years (decades). I was concerned when they stopped carrying locally, I thought Dr. Scholls had stopped making it, but found it here in Amazon, now I just subscribe and receive it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is one of the very few powders that is actually absorbent and gets rid of moisture on the skin.  It does have a &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; menthol type smell but unlike other reviewers I do not find the smell overpowering at all.  Certainly not like the overpowering smell of a menthol rub on your chest.  It&#x27;s a good price, and the stuff works so well against rashes and chafing and &amp;#34;hotspot&amp;#34; areas.  It does NOT have the &amp;#34;baby powder&amp;#34; smell that some powders have.</li>
            <li> Have used this powder for over 24 years now and up until recently I thought it was the only powder that would help me keep my rashes/candida away. That other powder I discovered was \\&quot;Snake Brand Prickly Heat Powder\\&quot;, which I thought worked \\&quot;just a tad better\\&quot; - namely because it has essential oils in it, so the powder, while still dry, is a bit thicker and \\&quot;creamier\\&quot;; so it \\&quot;rubs on\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;puff on\\&quot; and stays on a bit better.  However, I have returned to using MEXSANA because the other one, while it did seemingly work better in the beginning, over time I noticed that it didn&#x27;t help me as much as MEXSANA does. My rashes and candida are kept at bay better and for longer while using MEXSANA. I&#x27;m not sure why, but it just does. So I use both powders, but MEXSANA daily and Snake powder sporadically for special occasions when I sweat an extra amount, or something. Somehow it works better if you don&#x27;t use it daily. MEXSANA is perfect for using daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Another thing I found with both Gold Bond and Snake Brand powders is that over time they dried me out, whereas Mexsana never has.  When you&#x27;re talking about sensitive, personal areas, that is a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, where ever one may start to chafe, this will likely stop it quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this powder all the time and swears by it.  Won&#x27;t go without it.  Keeps him nice and dry.</li>
            <li> Love this medicated powder is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find Mexsana powder in Walmart or any orher store in my city for a number of years (I used to always get it at Walmart).  It is my favorite powder. All the other powders have too much scent.  I am  glad they haven&#x27;t discontinued making it.</li>
            <li> I am an adult in my fifties who was introduced to Mexsana Medicated Powder by my mother when I was a youngster. Of course, mom knows best.  The manufacturers of this time-honored product have not changed their powder formula and bottle design over the decades--THANK GOODNESS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t improve upon perfection.  The bottle is made of lightweight durable plastic that has an adjustable shaker top so that you can pour a little or a lot of powder out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the medicated powder itself is soothing, mild, and very effective.  The powder is odorless and it really helps calm and heal rashes, chafing, and other skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mexsana Medicated Powder is tops!</li>
            <li> Love this powder and will always continue to purchase as long as it stays on the market</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, but because it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; stores have stopped stocking it. Thank goodness for the continuing availability on the internet.</li>
            <li> Cannot find it in the store but it is wonderful powder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months and it works great. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores, but inexpensive here. I&#x27;ve used this stuff for many many years, mainly as deodorant, also in shoes as needed. Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried is as effective. No scent, no allergy.  This isn&#x27;t antiperspirant, you still sweat, but the medicated part controls odor without smelling or acting medicated. No summer rashes, either under arms or down under. Use sparingly or the bathroom will need daily dusting. I&#x27;m kinda surprised it isn&#x27;t advertised as deodorant, it really works for me. It goes a long way too. I once put a date on a new bottle and it lasted me 10 months!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Mexsana. I actually came across this product in my husband&#x27;s medicine cabinet when we first met. I didn&#x27;t have my regular powder available and decided to try this one out. It was the best decision I could have made. It worked better than my regular powder. I was thrilled when I was able to find it on-line because I wasn&#x27;t able to find it at any local stores. Because of the medications that I take, I need to have a product that can tackle moisture control, heat rash and itching. This powder goes above and beyond any other on the market. I can say this because I have tried them all. I would recommend this powder to anyone that has any of the conditions listed....and I do!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best powder I have ever used.  If you are a runner and have chaffed it is excellent.  If you are a runner/triathlete and have chaffed this powder is for you.  If you put it on the chaffed area it will be gone the next day.</li>
            <li> Just want to say I have used Mexsana powder for many years.&lt;br /&gt;It does help relieve minor skin irritations better than&lt;br /&gt;other brand powders and my husband uses it to control his&lt;br /&gt;athletes feet.  I appreciate being able to get it through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon as none of our local department stores or pharmacies&lt;br /&gt;stock it.</li>
            <li> Best foot powder out there for people with athlete&#x27;s foot or who have hyperhydrosis and want to keep your shoes fresh smelling. All the local big stores stopped carrying it, so I now buy from Amazon. Love the product and always have.</li>
