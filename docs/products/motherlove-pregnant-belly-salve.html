            <li>and my wife really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it works, but the container is nice.</li>
            <li>But it still worked as a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked them all</li>
            <li>I liked using it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 weeks into my pregnancy and no stretch marks thanks to this wonderful, inexpensive salve!!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t wonderful, and it feels a bit like petroleum jelly, but i normally take a bath at night and then put it on before bed.</li>
            <li>I am sure the company thought that putting this salve in a cheap piece of glass was a great way to save some money.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant....</li>
            <li>Love Motherlove Belly Salve as it worked better than anything else I tried for moisturizer, comfort and reducing itching!</li>
            <li>the fragrance is very light and nice.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and clean and it&#x27;s a good sized jar.</li>
            <li>and this was the best, by far.</li>
            <li>so far my skin is flawless.</li>
            <li>Liked it better than co co butter.</li>
            <li>Nice selection of oils, smells lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe all the wonderful natural ingredients would help, but it broke me out even more.</li>
            <li>My belly is so beautiful thanks to this</li>
            <li>She loves it and says it feels soooo good on her pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li>Will purchase this again :-)</li>
            <li>i love this salve.  </li>
            <li>the itching is not gone but it is lessened and more controled.  </li>
            <li>I makes it nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>what is in this magic potion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use this even after pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients, the texture and the smell</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Also, I thought it would be more of a lotion consistency, but it&#x27;s more like a balm (which I use as chapstick).</li>
            <li>It was perfect for the time when I was growing rapidly and my stomach was constantly itching.  </li>
            <li>I love the refreshing smell and creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night, and wake with my skin still moisturized and lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to wash my wife&#x27;s favorite pajamas 4 times to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this potion.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love the smell too</li>
            <li>her tummy still is shrinking and still appears really healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be more qualified to review the product toward the end of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>just because that&#x27;s when i seemed to grow the most.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and have used it for two pregnancies.</li>
            <li>I use at night time because I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>A friend may inherit the rest of the jar if I don&#x27;t have any more kids :)</li>
            <li>is so nice, light and clean.</li>
            <li>This salve has kind of a strong smell, although not unpleasant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy this product is natural-</li>
            <li>and I got great peace of mind from knowing the natural contents of the product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the light lavender scent...</li>
            <li>I like it smells sweet and calming !</li>
            <li>For me is kind of grease, but i really dont care.</li>
            <li>The consistency just feels great and moisturizing enough but not too greasy.</li>
            <li>all feel smooth and help with the growing size.  </li>
            <li>and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>and so far so good, no stretch marks yet</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much is genetics, and how much is the product, but it had a nice smell, felt great on my skin, and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark, so I&#x27;m pretty darn happy.  </li>
            <li>I was able to dress right away as it did not stick to my clothes.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well, even on my older skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is very gentle and i love how it melts in my hands.</li>
            <li>so I was pretty sure I was going to get them after the baby.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell of cocoa butter, so I was excited to find this.</li>
            <li>Try it out and see if it works for you, I know its worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also cheaper than most of the others with probably the most natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Boy was I right!  </li>
            <li>I should have know since I tend to like more fruity/citrus/ or tropical scents, but all I really smell is the chamomile.</li>
            <li>and I really do like the smell. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that can really be helpful as most stretch marks appear from rapid shrinking of the skin rather than stretching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this salve.</li>
            <li>Used for the entire 9 months, loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have no stretch marks and can not say enough good things about Motherlove pregnant belly salve.</li>
            <li>The texture of this butter is wonderful and the sent is subtle and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is now what I recommend to all my pregnant friends.  </li>
            <li>I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who is pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Since this is oil based, it makes your hands super oily until washed with soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nine months pregnant with no stretch marks , &amp; the ones I did have are fading away .</li>
            <li>I started using 6 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>and she kept telling me to get it to fight stretch marks while pregnant</li>
            <li>I am 9 months pregnant</li>
            <li>, it was super oily and ruined a lot of my clothes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 weeks pregnant and have not had any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I have been using this every day and am 37 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>I tell all my close pregnant friends about this product.</li>
            <li>A friend bought this for me when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I was pregnant with twins and used this every day.  </li>
            <li>I think this is because of the beeswax (the product also smells great, like a light beeswax herbal scent, not strong at all).</li>
            <li>But I escaped my first pregnancy mark free.  </li>
            <li>Someone gifted this to me when I became pregnant and now I gift this to new moms in my life.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, dries better than the other ones and does more specifically for the itchiness than ANY of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little over 18 weeks pregnant now and haven&#x27;t experienced any stretch marks but will continue to monitor as my pregnancy progresses.  </li>
            <li>I used this throughout my entire pregnancy and love it!</li>
            <li>With my first pregnancy I used Mother&#x27;s Special Blend and while it worked</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to get a nice, light layer smoothed over your entire belly.</li>
            <li>i love that it is all natural</li>
            <li>I just slip on an old tank top or night shirt</li>
            <li>the sore parts with stretch marks) feel better and soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought that it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy and gets on clothes, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I also love the natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s kind of on the pricey side, but it does last a loooooong time.</li>
            <li>As soon as I found out I was pregnant with #2, this was the first product I knew I had to have.</li>
            <li>Feels too waxy, doesn&#x27;t soak in, and it made me break out into a minor rash, making my belly even more itchy!</li>
            <li>It does alleviate some of the itching temporarily right after application</li>
            <li>sometimes three if I need additional moisture right before bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 weeks right now and have been using it since I was 12 weeks along.  </li>
            <li>I cannot attest to it preventing stretch marks (only 18 weeks pregnant), but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks while pregnant, and used this daily most of the pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels great, not greasy or messy at all!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and as my body is beginning to stretch my skin so far is not itchy at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll add more to this review in a few months to let you know if it&#x27;s continued to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priceless, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it helped (I&#x27;m using just a basic shea butter cream now).</li>
            <li>However, from a general standpoint, it seems to be a good subsitute for the Bella B since the price on that item has increased for the same amount.</li>
            <li>so I would recommend rubbing it between your hands first before applying.  </li>
            <li>Not all lotions/salves absorb readily into the skin, but this did!</li>
            <li>I personally think that stretch marks are much more caused by genetics than environment</li>
            <li>Pretty greasy on your skin for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting absorbed very well.</li>
            <li>but this one was definitely the most moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what it states it is: a salve.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Used it in my first pregnancy and using it now too.</li>
            <li>I have been using this several times a day and love it so much i have been smoothing it on my hands and feet too!</li>
            <li>It was exactly like applying vaseline to your skin.</li>
            <li>Okay so I just bought this salve last week.</li>
            <li>The reason being to moisturize and keep more stretch marks from forming during the last month of pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I used Mother Love pregnant belly salve throughout my pregnancy and have not gotten a single stretch mark!  </li>
            <li>Not greasy at all and absorbed quickly but also kept my skin feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a new jar until I got pregnant again 8 months postpartum and am now just over 26 weeks</li>
            <li>I only have 3 weeks left in my pregnancy, so perhaps I should have stayed with what I was using, but the Motherlove had good reviews, so</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, worth the price.  </li>
            <li>At one of my final doctor appointments my nurse told me she had not seen such a beautiful pregnant belly in a long time, if ever</li>
            <li>i love rubbing it on my belly, it is a soothing and calming ritual to do at the end of a long day.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of expensive, but then again it&#x27;s organic and healthy for you, so I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It feels good to be able to use a product without having to worry about any side effects due to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I do not have one single stretch mark:)</li>
            <li>However, it can leave a bit of an oil stain on certain fabrics.</li>
            <li>For me, it felt great, smells great but totally made me break out :(.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light and unoffensive especially for those early pregnancy weeks where every smell turns your stomach.</li>
            <li>It can feel a little greasy, but it does have a nice suttle smell.</li>
            <li>Top notch belly butter, my wife didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li>My order arrived with a huge white barcode label stuck over the front of the Motherlove label.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it&#x27;s very greasy.</li>
            <li>38 weeks into my second pregancy I am still mark free.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell and the consistency.</li>
            <li>I found it off putting until I realized it actually really made my stomach (and</li>
            <li>plus it feels really greasy on me.</li>
            <li>I am very prone to stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I MUCH prefer</li>
            <li>The smell is really nothing.  </li>
            <li>Mornings I rub it in well, in fast circular motions, then wait a couple minutes before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>that is how much I used over the 9 months.</li>
            <li>Very greasy and leaves a chemical smell on your clothes.</li>
            <li>I have used it for both pregnancies, and it has really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>But the bottom line, the relief from the intense itchiness is a G-d send</li>
            <li>I am on my 4th Jar and at the very end of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>This has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>The texture is very greasy, but I like that because it feels like you can really rub it in well.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>very well taken care of&amp;#34</li>
            <li>She really appreciated this product.</li>
            <li>it just stays wet on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>However, I do like the smell and the texture; both are very soothing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It was very calming.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>If you buy anything please buy this product while pregnant, it is worth every single penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Went on easily - soothed dry cracking pregnancy belly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m debating whether to use this again whole pregnant with my second child because while the lavender is organic and gentle-smelling, lavender does have estrogenic properties.</li>
            <li>When she was getting bigger and bigger her skin appeared to be very elastic and healthy and didn&#x27;t show any stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>i am only 21 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>the only drawback I would say is that it is super greasy-like applying vaseline.  </li>
            <li>I bought 4 different types of lotion/oils to rub on my growing pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is more of a mess than anything... would not recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for any expecting mother;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it-</li>
            <li>and I HIGHLY recommend this if you have this issue.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course I realize that does NOT mean I wouldn&#x27;t get any stretch marks</li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;d definitely say this was worth it</li>
            <li>I have so far used 3 other pregnancy lotion/oil/creams and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this nonstop during my pregnancy (2nd) because I was allergic to Palmers Cocoa Butter this time around which I used during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I tried ALL the different kinds of belly creams/lotions/oils that were out there with my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>Unlike the other belly cream I had that was more like a lotion, this has a consistency similar to Carmex.  </li>
            <li>Currently 39 weeks and hoping to have my baby very soon!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also hard to say if a product really prevents stretch marks or if your body just isn&#x27;t the type to get stretch marks easily.  </li>
            <li>but so far no stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>, i am not a freak when it comes to natural and organic products, but i don&#x27;t see the point in rubbing synthetic products into your skin when you have the option not to.</li>
            <li>A friend who is into natural pregnancy treatments recommended this to me.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft when I woke up this morning.</li>
            <li>I like this cream so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still early on for me so just because I don&#x27;t have stretch marks now</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, but not as much as a lotion would, so there is some oily residue that&#x27;s left on your skin.</li>
            <li>but since my husband and I are the only ones who see the sheets it doesn&#x27;t really both me.</li>
            <li>Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil, which I will be using from here on out.  </li>
            <li>At 34 weeks I&#x27;m just starting to REALLY notice some stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it never broke me out</li>
            <li>and I am now 21 weeks so far</li>
            <li>This salve feels like Vaseline and smells like chamomile with soft lavender to me</li>
            <li>I also have really sensitive skin and everything breaks me out, but this does not.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m too sensitive for coconut oil).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for those pregnant in harsh winter climents as I was.</li>
            <li>I used Motherlove belly salve throughout my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t even up with a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li>Even using high quality products for as long as I have, I was still surprised to feel how soft this made my skin.  </li>
            <li>The negitive is that I have super sensitive skin, and due to it being oil based it caused a red itchy rash 8-10 days after use.</li>
            <li>The scent is so mild that even in the early months, I could deal with it while I wouldn&#x27;t dare open up other brands I had purchased.</li>
            <li>It soothed my wife&#x27;s skin when the belly was getting gigantic, and you can barely see any stretch marks, if it all (the baby is 9 months old now)</li>
            <li>This really helped keep my skin moist while it stretched.</li>
            <li>Palmers Cocoa butter (jar) worked well also for less than $5 a jar on my first pregnancy, but if you want natural this is the way to go!</li>
            <li>I tried a few of the other products out there from WholeFoods and Pea in the Pod, but this one is by far better.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, a little goes a LONG way, 4 ounces lasted me my entire pregnancy and could probably take me through 3 or 4 more if I were planning to.  </li>
            <li>ALL the ingredients are organic, and that&#x27;s a major plus in my book.</li>
            <li>I am about to buy another jar because I do not have a SINGLE stretch mark on my belly which is pretty big.</li>
            <li>Its a little greasy in texture and takes a while to soak into your skin but worth it.</li>
            <li>My belly started flaking and was generally scaly.</li>
            <li>I barely used it &amp; ended up buying Bella B Tummy Honey Butter.</li>
            <li>What was red four days ago is now almost completely skin tone.</li>
            <li>I used this throughout my first pregnancy (starting in the beginning of the 2nd trimester), and while they say that stretch marks are genetic, I managed to come out of pregnancy without a single mark on me.</li>
            <li>I applied this twice a day liberally on my belly and after the baby there is not a single stretch mark on my tummy.</li>
            <li>seriously, not a single mark on my belly</li>
            <li>My baby is now eight months old, and I&#x27;ve continued using the belly butter as my sole facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The product is heavy and stays on to make my skin feel very hydrated, it doesn&#x27;t rub in completely and have to be re-applied like a lotion would.</li>
            <li>I first encounted this product as a sample in a little gift bag from my midwife.</li>
            <li>Like all salves, it is oil based making it feel a little greasy at first</li>
            <li>Only minor down side is you&#x27;re a grease ball afterwards, but worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Pregnant Belly Salve is natural and light and was less expensive than some of the other natural products.</li>
            <li>I am in my third trimester of my second pregnancy and as of today, not a single stretch mark.  </li>

            <li> and my wife really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it works, but the container is nice.</li>
            <li> But it still worked as a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked them all</li>
            <li> I liked using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 weeks into my pregnancy and no stretch marks thanks to this wonderful, inexpensive salve!!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t wonderful, and it feels a bit like petroleum jelly, but i normally take a bath at night and then put it on before bed.</li>
            <li> I am sure the company thought that putting this salve in a cheap piece of glass was a great way to save some money.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant....</li>
            <li> Love Motherlove Belly Salve as it worked better than anything else I tried for moisturizer, comfort and reducing itching!</li>
            <li> the fragrance is very light and nice.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and clean and it&#x27;s a good sized jar.</li>
            <li> and this was the best, by far.</li>
            <li> so far my skin is flawless.</li>
            <li> Liked it better than co co butter.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of oils, smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe all the wonderful natural ingredients would help, but it broke me out even more.</li>
            <li> My belly is so beautiful thanks to this</li>
            <li> She loves it and says it feels soooo good on her pregnant belly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> Will purchase this again :-)</li>
            <li> i love this salve.  </li>
            <li> the itching is not gone but it is lessened and more controled.  </li>
            <li> I makes it nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> what is in this magic potion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use this even after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients, the texture and the smell</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Also, I thought it would be more of a lotion consistency, but it&#x27;s more like a balm (which I use as chapstick).</li>
            <li> It was perfect for the time when I was growing rapidly and my stomach was constantly itching.  </li>
            <li> I love the refreshing smell and creamy texture.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night, and wake with my skin still moisturized and lovely.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to wash my wife&#x27;s favorite pajamas 4 times to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this potion.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> love the smell too</li>
            <li> her tummy still is shrinking and still appears really healthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be more qualified to review the product toward the end of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> just because that&#x27;s when i seemed to grow the most.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and have used it for two pregnancies.</li>
            <li> I use at night time because I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> A friend may inherit the rest of the jar if I don&#x27;t have any more kids :)</li>
            <li> is so nice, light and clean.</li>
            <li> This salve has kind of a strong smell, although not unpleasant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy this product is natural-</li>
            <li> and I got great peace of mind from knowing the natural contents of the product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the light lavender scent...</li>
            <li> I like it smells sweet and calming !</li>
            <li> For me is kind of grease, but i really dont care.</li>
            <li> The consistency just feels great and moisturizing enough but not too greasy.</li>
            <li> all feel smooth and help with the growing size.  </li>
            <li> and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> and so far so good, no stretch marks yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much is genetics, and how much is the product, but it had a nice smell, felt great on my skin, and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark, so I&#x27;m pretty darn happy.  </li>
            <li> I was able to dress right away as it did not stick to my clothes.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well, even on my older skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is very gentle and i love how it melts in my hands.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty sure I was going to get them after the baby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell of cocoa butter, so I was excited to find this.</li>
            <li> Try it out and see if it works for you, I know its worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cheaper than most of the others with probably the most natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Boy was I right!  </li>
            <li> I should have know since I tend to like more fruity/citrus/ or tropical scents, but all I really smell is the chamomile.</li>
            <li> and I really do like the smell. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that can really be helpful as most stretch marks appear from rapid shrinking of the skin rather than stretching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this salve.</li>
            <li> Used for the entire 9 months, loved it.  </li>
            <li> I have no stretch marks and can not say enough good things about Motherlove pregnant belly salve.</li>
            <li> The texture of this butter is wonderful and the sent is subtle and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is now what I recommend to all my pregnant friends.  </li>
            <li> I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who is pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Since this is oil based, it makes your hands super oily until washed with soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nine months pregnant with no stretch marks , &amp; the ones I did have are fading away .</li>
            <li> I started using 6 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li> and she kept telling me to get it to fight stretch marks while pregnant</li>
            <li> I am 9 months pregnant</li>
            <li> , it was super oily and ruined a lot of my clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 weeks pregnant and have not had any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I have been using this every day and am 37 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> I tell all my close pregnant friends about this product.</li>
            <li> A friend bought this for me when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I was pregnant with twins and used this every day.  </li>
            <li> I think this is because of the beeswax (the product also smells great, like a light beeswax herbal scent, not strong at all).</li>
            <li> But I escaped my first pregnancy mark free.  </li>
            <li> Someone gifted this to me when I became pregnant and now I gift this to new moms in my life.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, dries better than the other ones and does more specifically for the itchiness than ANY of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little over 18 weeks pregnant now and haven&#x27;t experienced any stretch marks but will continue to monitor as my pregnancy progresses.  </li>
            <li> I used this throughout my entire pregnancy and love it!</li>
            <li> With my first pregnancy I used Mother&#x27;s Special Blend and while it worked</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to get a nice, light layer smoothed over your entire belly.</li>
            <li> i love that it is all natural</li>
            <li> I just slip on an old tank top or night shirt</li>
            <li> the sore parts with stretch marks) feel better and soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought that it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy and gets on clothes, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I also love the natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s kind of on the pricey side, but it does last a loooooong time.</li>
            <li> As soon as I found out I was pregnant with #2, this was the first product I knew I had to have.</li>
            <li> Feels too waxy, doesn&#x27;t soak in, and it made me break out into a minor rash, making my belly even more itchy!</li>
            <li> It does alleviate some of the itching temporarily right after application</li>
            <li> sometimes three if I need additional moisture right before bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 weeks right now and have been using it since I was 12 weeks along.  </li>
            <li> I cannot attest to it preventing stretch marks (only 18 weeks pregnant), but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks while pregnant, and used this daily most of the pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels great, not greasy or messy at all!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and as my body is beginning to stretch my skin so far is not itchy at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll add more to this review in a few months to let you know if it&#x27;s continued to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priceless, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it helped (I&#x27;m using just a basic shea butter cream now).</li>
            <li> However, from a general standpoint, it seems to be a good subsitute for the Bella B since the price on that item has increased for the same amount.</li>
            <li> so I would recommend rubbing it between your hands first before applying.  </li>
            <li> Not all lotions/salves absorb readily into the skin, but this did!</li>
            <li> I personally think that stretch marks are much more caused by genetics than environment</li>
            <li> Pretty greasy on your skin for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting absorbed very well.</li>
            <li> but this one was definitely the most moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what it states it is: a salve.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Used it in my first pregnancy and using it now too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this several times a day and love it so much i have been smoothing it on my hands and feet too!</li>
            <li> It was exactly like applying vaseline to your skin.</li>
            <li> Okay so I just bought this salve last week.</li>
            <li> The reason being to moisturize and keep more stretch marks from forming during the last month of pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I used Mother Love pregnant belly salve throughout my pregnancy and have not gotten a single stretch mark!  </li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and absorbed quickly but also kept my skin feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a new jar until I got pregnant again 8 months postpartum and am now just over 26 weeks</li>
            <li> I only have 3 weeks left in my pregnancy, so perhaps I should have stayed with what I was using, but the Motherlove had good reviews, so</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, worth the price.  </li>
            <li> At one of my final doctor appointments my nurse told me she had not seen such a beautiful pregnant belly in a long time, if ever</li>
            <li> i love rubbing it on my belly, it is a soothing and calming ritual to do at the end of a long day.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of expensive, but then again it&#x27;s organic and healthy for you, so I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It feels good to be able to use a product without having to worry about any side effects due to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I do not have one single stretch mark:)</li>
            <li> However, it can leave a bit of an oil stain on certain fabrics.</li>
            <li> For me, it felt great, smells great but totally made me break out :(.</li>
            <li> The smell is very light and unoffensive especially for those early pregnancy weeks where every smell turns your stomach.</li>
            <li> It can feel a little greasy, but it does have a nice suttle smell.</li>
            <li> Top notch belly butter, my wife didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> My order arrived with a huge white barcode label stuck over the front of the Motherlove label.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it&#x27;s very greasy.</li>
            <li> 38 weeks into my second pregancy I am still mark free.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell and the consistency.</li>
            <li> I found it off putting until I realized it actually really made my stomach (and</li>
            <li> plus it feels really greasy on me.</li>
            <li> I am very prone to stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I MUCH prefer</li>
            <li> The smell is really nothing.  </li>
            <li> Mornings I rub it in well, in fast circular motions, then wait a couple minutes before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> that is how much I used over the 9 months.</li>
            <li> Very greasy and leaves a chemical smell on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I have used it for both pregnancies, and it has really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> But the bottom line, the relief from the intense itchiness is a G-d send</li>
            <li> I am on my 4th Jar and at the very end of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> The texture is very greasy, but I like that because it feels like you can really rub it in well.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> very well taken care of&amp;#34</li>
            <li> She really appreciated this product.</li>
            <li> it just stays wet on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> However, I do like the smell and the texture; both are very soothing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It was very calming.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If you buy anything please buy this product while pregnant, it is worth every single penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went on easily - soothed dry cracking pregnancy belly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m debating whether to use this again whole pregnant with my second child because while the lavender is organic and gentle-smelling, lavender does have estrogenic properties.</li>
            <li> When she was getting bigger and bigger her skin appeared to be very elastic and healthy and didn&#x27;t show any stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> i am only 21 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li> the only drawback I would say is that it is super greasy-like applying vaseline.  </li>
            <li> I bought 4 different types of lotion/oils to rub on my growing pregnant belly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is more of a mess than anything... would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for any expecting mother;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it-</li>
            <li> and I HIGHLY recommend this if you have this issue.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course I realize that does NOT mean I wouldn&#x27;t get any stretch marks</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d definitely say this was worth it</li>
            <li> I have so far used 3 other pregnancy lotion/oil/creams and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this nonstop during my pregnancy (2nd) because I was allergic to Palmers Cocoa Butter this time around which I used during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I tried ALL the different kinds of belly creams/lotions/oils that were out there with my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other belly cream I had that was more like a lotion, this has a consistency similar to Carmex.  </li>
            <li> Currently 39 weeks and hoping to have my baby very soon!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also hard to say if a product really prevents stretch marks or if your body just isn&#x27;t the type to get stretch marks easily.  </li>
            <li> but so far no stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> , i am not a freak when it comes to natural and organic products, but i don&#x27;t see the point in rubbing synthetic products into your skin when you have the option not to.</li>
            <li> A friend who is into natural pregnancy treatments recommended this to me.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft when I woke up this morning.</li>
            <li> I like this cream so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early on for me so just because I don&#x27;t have stretch marks now</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, but not as much as a lotion would, so there is some oily residue that&#x27;s left on your skin.</li>
            <li> but since my husband and I are the only ones who see the sheets it doesn&#x27;t really both me.</li>
            <li> Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil, which I will be using from here on out.  </li>
            <li> At 34 weeks I&#x27;m just starting to REALLY notice some stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it never broke me out</li>
            <li> and I am now 21 weeks so far</li>
            <li> This salve feels like Vaseline and smells like chamomile with soft lavender to me</li>
            <li> I also have really sensitive skin and everything breaks me out, but this does not.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m too sensitive for coconut oil).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for those pregnant in harsh winter climents as I was.</li>
            <li> I used Motherlove belly salve throughout my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t even up with a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> Even using high quality products for as long as I have, I was still surprised to feel how soft this made my skin.  </li>
            <li> The negitive is that I have super sensitive skin, and due to it being oil based it caused a red itchy rash 8-10 days after use.</li>
            <li> The scent is so mild that even in the early months, I could deal with it while I wouldn&#x27;t dare open up other brands I had purchased.</li>
            <li> It soothed my wife&#x27;s skin when the belly was getting gigantic, and you can barely see any stretch marks, if it all (the baby is 9 months old now)</li>
            <li> This really helped keep my skin moist while it stretched.</li>
            <li> Palmers Cocoa butter (jar) worked well also for less than $5 a jar on my first pregnancy, but if you want natural this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I tried a few of the other products out there from WholeFoods and Pea in the Pod, but this one is by far better.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, a little goes a LONG way, 4 ounces lasted me my entire pregnancy and could probably take me through 3 or 4 more if I were planning to.  </li>
            <li> ALL the ingredients are organic, and that&#x27;s a major plus in my book.</li>
            <li> I am about to buy another jar because I do not have a SINGLE stretch mark on my belly which is pretty big.</li>
            <li> Its a little greasy in texture and takes a while to soak into your skin but worth it.</li>
            <li> My belly started flaking and was generally scaly.</li>
            <li> I barely used it &amp; ended up buying Bella B Tummy Honey Butter.</li>
            <li> What was red four days ago is now almost completely skin tone.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my first pregnancy (starting in the beginning of the 2nd trimester), and while they say that stretch marks are genetic, I managed to come out of pregnancy without a single mark on me.</li>
            <li> I applied this twice a day liberally on my belly and after the baby there is not a single stretch mark on my tummy.</li>
            <li> seriously, not a single mark on my belly</li>
            <li> My baby is now eight months old, and I&#x27;ve continued using the belly butter as my sole facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The product is heavy and stays on to make my skin feel very hydrated, it doesn&#x27;t rub in completely and have to be re-applied like a lotion would.</li>
            <li> I first encounted this product as a sample in a little gift bag from my midwife.</li>
            <li> Like all salves, it is oil based making it feel a little greasy at first</li>
            <li> Only minor down side is you&#x27;re a grease ball afterwards, but worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Pregnant Belly Salve is natural and light and was less expensive than some of the other natural products.</li>
            <li> I am in my third trimester of my second pregnancy and as of today, not a single stretch mark.  </li>
            <li> Not good, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly, so you have to wait for at least 20 minutes before putting anything over your stomach/breasts/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> there are a few cons if the oily-ness bothers you, but for the price and the results I really like this product and will continue to use it through the rest of my pregnancy... and for any other future pregnancies.</li>
            <li> First off, the container is really small compared to my other product.</li>
            <li> but it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The moisture lasts that long.  </li>
            <li> The jar goes a surprisingly long way.</li>
            <li> I happened to stumble upon it at a herbal store in Dover, NH.</li>
            <li> it worked till my baby had a big growth spurt and really no stopping those stretch marks and also used it on any dry areas</li>
            <li> I usually purchase Bella B Butter, but they raised their prices quite substantially for the 4 oz container, so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> product is the same size as the other products in this category, so no issue there for the price.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve tried 3 other different products and none of them help with itching at all.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount, so this container should last the entire pregnancy, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I have used it exclusivelly my entire pregnancy, I now have only 4 weeks to go until little man makes his arrival, and I have to say it is so soothing and calming on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very rich and moisturizing but expensive and a small amount - no way I could afford to use this throughout my pregnancy, it only lasted me about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I also like to use it on my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the belly butter, or my skin type (delicate white), but I developed not a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just wish the jar was a little bigger, i use it all over me</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> , there is really no smell.</li>
            <li> The only thing this salve did was stain a few of my shirts.  </li>
            <li> The jar tipped over on my counter and oil had came out of the salve and dripped out of the closed lid all over my makeup kit.  </li>
            <li> I started it back up again, and the rash came back 3 days later and worse.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy, but not nearly so much as vaseline.</li>
            <li> I still got stretch marks, which I expected.</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with it not absorbing or sticking to clothing or leaving any spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be careful when buying this product in here....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helped decrease the amount or appearance of stretch marks, but I feel just using plain coconut oil would be cheaper and give the same outcome.</li>
            <li> I used this with a lot of other lotions and didn&#x27;t get bell stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> even when every other smell has made me nauseous.</li>
            <li> I have never had itching skin that can be associated with pregnancy due to the stretching skin.</li>
            <li> I did have some stretch marks prior to pregnancy just from puberty and so on, but there are no more marks than those on my body.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to all of my friends and will try the other products eventually as well!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> So a bit expensive, but so worth it if you want quality product for yourself and your little one inside your belly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s nothing too crazy as I&#x27;ve been using it on my pregnant belly for over a week.</li>
            <li> With Motherlove it&#x27;s not super oily and it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothes.  </li>
            <li> And when it did run out in my last month, I was sad to have to go back to using something else.</li>
            <li> I have replaced the jar once after having finished the half jar that was given to me.</li>
            <li> (From previous pregnancy).</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes it absorbs leaving skin with a slight oil sheen.</li>
            <li> This salve is a little grainy.</li>
            <li> It is a little slimy to apply, but I think that&#x27;s also what made it so absorbent.  </li>
            <li> Even if you think it feels a little sticky, don&#x27;t worry about wearing clothes over it, it soaks into your skin just like it should.</li>
            <li> I can see how you might consider it a little greasy, but it&#x27;s not like sunscreen greasy, and it won&#x27;t stick to or stain your clothing.</li>
            <li> Goes on almost like a hair gloss &amp; absorbs within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It is a luxurious ritual for everyday.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have too much trouble with all of the itchiness that people talk about.  </li>
            <li> I used this salve everyday during my pregnancy and even after.</li>
            <li> No strong smell.</li>
            <li> I had terrible skin problems (legs, arms etc - awful itching) through my second and third pregnancies but my belly, using this cream, was always great.</li>
            <li> it may be a small amount</li>
            <li> I really have nothing bad to say other than this stuff seriously stinks, and it doesn&#x27;t dry at all</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because my pregnant belly was horribly itchy and a little rashy.</li>
            <li> This makes it hard to get to the salve if you have nails.</li>
            <li> but my skin reacted negatively to it.</li>
            <li> I put it on at least once a day and sometimes twice.  </li>
            <li> The formula is thick but not greasy and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit sticky because it is thick</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t on their way.</li>
            <li> Carefully removing it left a terrible sticky dark residue that won&#x27;t come off, even with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> It smelled a little weird</li>
            <li> It applies very thickly and will soak through any thin layers you have.  </li>
            <li> but it made it even worse.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m at 28 weeks and have no stretch marks at all, have not experienced any itching that some women describe during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it prevented stretch marks because I definitely got some, but didn&#x27;t seems as bad as my cousins who used cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> This was definitely a waste and will be throwing the rest in the trash :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not prevent me from getting stretch marks.</li>
            <li> and it got worse when I started using this salve!</li>
            <li> It is also difficult to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> ;( It stains clothes and smells weird once set in clothes.</li>
            <li> Now to the bad part.  </li>
            <li> My mother got horrible stretch marks and had me terrified.  </li>
            <li> Insane.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t stain my clothes and it helped the awful itching</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Feels too waxy, doesn&#x27;t soak in, and it made me break out into a minor rash, making my belly even more itchy!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF!!! I used it throughout my entire pregnancy on belly and hips (1st pregnancy), and no stretchmarks. Secondly, now that I&#x27;m 2 yrs into motherhood, this is also what I use for my toddlers diaper rash from time to time.   I put it on him at night, and in the morning...gone.  I believe it&#x27;s probably the lavendar and calendula that help in that case. I still order it.  It&#x27;s priceless, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is great and it blends into the skin nicely. However, it can leave a bit of an oil stain on certain fabrics.</li>
            <li> I bought this nonstop during my pregnancy (2nd) because I was allergic to Palmers Cocoa Butter this time around which I used during my first pregnancy. Motherlove Pregnant Belly Salve is natural and light and was less expensive than some of the other natural products. I do not have one single stretch mark:) I kept it on though, my belly was constantly moist, I put it on anywhere between 2-5 times a day. I probably went through 6 jars. Palmers Cocoa butter (jar) worked well also for less than $5 a jar on my first pregnancy, but if you want natural this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Used this every day of my pregnancy and no stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> Very rich and moisturizing but expensive and a small amount - no way I could afford to use this throughout my pregnancy, it only lasted me about 3 weeks. But I&#x27;m in month 7 and no stretch marks yet so I&#x27;m sure it helped (I&#x27;m using just a basic shea butter cream now).</li>
            <li> I used this with a lot of other lotions and didn&#x27;t get bell stretch marks.  Ladies don&#x27;t forget your hips and butt, those get bigger too!</li>
            <li> I tried ALL the different kinds of belly creams/lotions/oils that were out there with my first pregnancy and this was the best, by far. Not greasy at all and absorbed quickly but also kept my skin feeling soft all day. I had terrible skin problems (legs, arms etc - awful itching) through my second and third pregnancies but my belly, using this cream, was always great.</li>
            <li> This product was mentioned to me by a friend who recently had a baby.  I am just coming into my second trimester and so far so good.  The product has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. Goes on easy and as my body is beginning to stretch my skin so far is not itchy at all. Would definately recommend this product</li>
            <li> Feels great, not greasy or messy at all!</li>
            <li> This is a must have maternity product for me.  I highly recommend for any expecting mother; gentle fragrance, soothes dry/itchy/tight belly, absorbs nicely, perfect for any time application (belly, hips, thighs etc)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helped decrease the amount or appearance of stretch marks, but I feel just using plain coconut oil would be cheaper and give the same outcome.</li>
            <li> Goes on almost like a hair gloss &amp; absorbs within a few minutes. Nice scent this is not at all overpowering. Will purchase this again :-)</li>
            <li> I usually purchase Bella B Butter, but they raised their prices quite substantially for the 4 oz container, so I decided to try something new. I only have 3 weeks left in my pregnancy, so perhaps I should have stayed with what I was using, but the Motherlove had good reviews, so I switched.&lt;br /&gt;The product is the same size as the other products in this category, so no issue there for the price. However, the Motherlove Belly Salve is a bit greasy for my taste. First off, the container is really small compared to my other product. This makes it hard to get to the salve if you have nails. Lastly, it&#x27;s very greasy. It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly, so you have to wait for at least 20 minutes before putting anything over your stomach/breasts/etc.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know if it works yet because I just began using the product. However, from a general standpoint, it seems to be a good subsitute for the Bella B since the price on that item has increased for the same amount.</li>
            <li> i love this salve.  the fragrance is very light and nice.  i bought this cream after using a different one that&#x27;s smell began to annoy me.  this one&#x27;s scent is very lovely.  i have been using it for about a month now both morning and night and i am not even halfway through the jar, so it may be a small amount but it goes a long way.  i am only 21 weeks pregnant but so far no stretch marks.  the itching is not gone but it is lessened and more controled.  i love rubbing it on my belly, it is a soothing and calming ritual to do at the end of a long day.  i love that it is all natural, i am not a freak when it comes to natural and organic products, but i don&#x27;t see the point in rubbing synthetic products into your skin when you have the option not to.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  It is now what I recommend to all my pregnant friends.  I tried a few of the other products out there from WholeFoods and Pea in the Pod, but this one is by far better.  It is a salve so I would recommend rubbing it between your hands first before applying.  I makes it nice and smooth.  It also smells really good!</li>
            <li> A friend who is into natural pregnancy treatments recommended this to me. This is a miracle salve. Highly recommended. It soothed my wife&#x27;s skin when the belly was getting gigantic, and you can barely see any stretch marks, if it all (the baby is 9 months old now) It also smells nice too. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The feel of this product is great and easy to apply. No texture problems. It does alleviate some of the itching temporarily right after application but it does not last long. However I&#x27;ve tried 3 other different products and none of them help with itching at all. Based on the product feel and ingredient list I will definitely need to purchase again as I am only 5 months along.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what is in this magic potion but I swear by it.  My mother got horrible stretch marks and had me terrified.  But I escaped my first pregnancy mark free.  I was pretty amazed since I had somehow managed to pack 50 extra lbs on my ordinarily 120lb frame.  38 weeks into my second pregancy I am still mark free.  Keeping my fingers crossed and slathering on the belly salve.  Good luck to all expecting mothers and stock up on the belly rub!</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time last night. Not all lotions/salves absorb readily into the skin, but this did! My skin was so soft when I woke up this morning. I&#x27;ve been a moisturizer snob for years.  Even using high quality products for as long as I have, I was still surprised to feel how soft this made my skin.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use this even after pregnancy. I love the light smell of lavender and chamomile too, perfect for use just before bed.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients, smell and how it feels on my skin! I just wish the jar was a little bigger, i use it all over me and it does seem to disappear in no time. So a bit expensive, but so worth it if you want quality product for yourself and your little one inside your belly.</li>
            <li> I started using this almost immediately after I found out I was pregnant. I&#x27;ve gone through an entire jar and I&#x27;m currently halfway through my second. The smell is very light and unoffensive especially for those early pregnancy weeks where every smell turns your stomach. The formula is thick but not greasy and absorbs well into the skin. I&#x27;m a little over 18 weeks pregnant now and haven&#x27;t experienced any stretch marks but will continue to monitor as my pregnancy progresses.  I use it twice a day, sometimes three if I need additional moisture right before bed.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who is pregnant.  She loves it and says it feels soooo good on her pregnant belly.</li>
            <li> I like this cream so far. It is kind of expensive, but then again it&#x27;s organic and healthy for you, so I think it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s still early on for me so just because I don&#x27;t have stretch marks now doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t on their way. I personally think that stretch marks are much more caused by genetics than environment so although I know this is doing something and will be good for me, I think if I get them it was meant to be. This has a great smell and great ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great for growing belly and thighs. Pretty greasy on your skin for a couple of hours. I just slip on an old tank top or night shirt so it dosen&#x27;t get on my sheets. so far my skin is flawless. Almost 30 weeks preggers.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and the consistency. I used it every day during my pregnancy. Unfortunately it did not prevent me from getting stretch marks. I still got them during the last month of pregnancy.</li>
            <li> This salve has kind of a strong smell, although not unpleasant and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my baby.  Unlike the other belly cream I had that was more like a lotion, this has a consistency similar to Carmex.  I found it off putting until I realized it actually really made my stomach (and the sore parts with stretch marks) feel better and soft.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my first pregnancy (starting in the beginning of the 2nd trimester), and while they say that stretch marks are genetic, I managed to come out of pregnancy without a single mark on me. Hey, even if it&#x27;s genetic, I&#x27;m not going to argue with results -- I ordered a second jar for this time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar lasted for almost all of the 2nd and 3rd trimester last time around with daily applications to my belly. It&#x27;s really pleasant smelling and is a relaxing way to feel connected to your growing baby.</li>
            <li> What is in the glass jar seems very good and my wife really liked it.  Now to the bad part.  I am sure the company thought that putting this salve in a cheap piece of glass was a great way to save some money.  The short version of this story is that we used about 1/3 of this jar and my wife trying to open it and the glass just broke in her hand.  This 15 dollar jar is going to cost us around $300 dollars in co pays.  I will post pictures of what the glass looks like and what it did to my wife&#x27;s finger.  She ended up with two stitches in her left index finger.  I WOULDN&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THEY CHANGE TO PLASTIC.  If you do want this product put it in a different container once you receive it.</li>
            <li> I had a pregnancy rash AKA Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) and it got worse when I started using this salve! OMG I thought that it would help my PUPPPs but it made it even worse. I thought that maybe all the wonderful natural ingredients would help, but it broke me out even more. Total waste of my money. UGH!</li>
            <li> I went to 42 weeks in my last pregnancy and did not get one stretch mark. I also still had plenty leftover to use postpartum. I didn&#x27;t need a new jar until I got pregnant again 8 months postpartum and am now just over 26 weeks and so far so good, no stretch marks yet and hopefully I won&#x27;t get any. I love the ingredients, the texture and the smell is so nice, light and clean. I love this product. Buy it...it&#x27;s worth it and you will not regret it!!</li>
            <li> I got this after running out of my cocoa butter.  I read the reviews and thought that it would be worth it.  Boy was I right!  I&#x27;m 21 weeks right now and have been using it since I was 12 weeks along.  I can&#x27;t guarantee if this prevents or improves stretch marks but it helps with moisturizing and keeping me from itching my belly all day.  I use it every night after I shower so that I don&#x27;t have to use it in the morning.  The moisture lasts that long.  Love it.  I will continue to use this throughout the rest of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and consistency of this salve.  I cannot attest to it preventing stretch marks (only 18 weeks pregnant), but so far, so good.  You only need to use a small amount, so this container should last the entire pregnancy, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks before or after pregnancy thank to mother love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy this product is natural- but I do not like the scent at all plus it feels really greasy on me. The scent seems to stay with me all day and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s getting absorbed very well. I should have know since I tend to like more fruity/citrus/ or tropical scents, but all I really smell is the chamomile. Also, I thought it would be more of a lotion consistency, but it&#x27;s more like a balm (which I use as chapstick). Not for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it works, but the container is nice. I like the texture, there is really no smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to prevent stretch marks... after using it multiple times a day I still started getting stretch marks by 10 weeks and I hadn&#x27;t even gained a pound.  The only thing this salve did was stain a few of my shirts.  It takes a while to rub in and leaves you feeling like you just smeared butter all over.  The jar tipped over on my counter and oil had came out of the salve and dripped out of the closed lid all over my makeup kit.  This stuff is more of a mess than anything... would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this product on day 1 and my itchiness and the streching feeling disappeared. I was able to dress right away as it did not stick to my clothes. Since this is oil based, it makes your hands super oily until washed with soap. It is also difficult to get out of the container. The negitive is that I have super sensitive skin, and due to it being oil based it caused a red itchy rash 8-10 days after use. I discontinued the product for 5 days, and the rash disappeared. I started it back up again, and the rash came back 3 days later and worse. I recently switched to TriLastin which is a lotion base and it has worked great and got rid of some marks that appeared during the time I had to stop this product.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Went on easily - soothed dry cracking pregnancy belly. No strong smell. Only minor down side is you&#x27;re a grease ball afterwards, but worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am very prone to stretch marks. I already had some on my thighs so I was pretty sure I was going to get them after the baby. I thought I would give this a try anyway. I applied this twice a day liberally on my belly and after the baby there is not a single stretch mark on my tummy. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a bit greasy and gets on clothes, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It feels good to be able to use a product without having to worry about any side effects due to harsh chemicals. This really helped keep my skin moist while it stretched. I highly recommend it for those pregnant in harsh winter climents as I was.</li>
            <li> I first encounted this product as a sample in a little gift bag from my midwife. I read all the reviews of this product before I purchased and have been very satisfied. I&#x27;ve been using nightly since about 16 weeks - I&#x27;m at 28 weeks and have no stretch marks at all, have not experienced any itching that some women describe during pregnancy. It smells and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews compared it to vaseline. It is a bit greasy, but not nearly so much as vaseline. In the jar it&#x27;s a semi-solid like vaseline, but when you apply and rub it in with your body heat it turns into an oil almost. It absorbs well, but not as much as a lotion would, so there is some oily residue that&#x27;s left on your skin. I have noticed oily marks on our sheets after using it - but since my husband and I are the only ones who see the sheets it doesn&#x27;t really both me. I haven&#x27;t noticed that the spots remain after the sheets are washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there are a few cons if the oily-ness bothers you, but for the price and the results I really like this product and will continue to use it through the rest of my pregnancy... and for any other future pregnancies.</li>
            <li> I did not like this belly salve at all.  It&#x27;s WAY too oily and didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; to my skin, even after an hour.  I MUCH prefer Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil, which I will be using from here on out.  This was definitely a waste and will be throwing the rest in the trash :(</li>
            <li> This salve is a little grainy. I still got stretch marks, which I expected. But it still worked as a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> During pregnancy I have gone through three jars of belly rub or whatever you want to call it.  I&#x27;ve liked them all but this one was definitely the most moisturizing.  It was perfect for the time when I was growing rapidly and my stomach was constantly itching.  I&#x27;d put it on after my shower every morning.  It is a little slimy to apply, but I think that&#x27;s also what made it so absorbent.  The smell is really nothing.  Not good, but not bad.  For the price, I&#x27;d definitely say this was worth it and I got great peace of mind from knowing the natural contents of the product.</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing smell and creamy texture.  At 34 weeks I&#x27;m just starting to REALLY notice some stretch marks.  This can be used on any stretch mark location, not just the belly!  It does contain lavender essential oil as the last ingredient, so if topical application of essential oils weirds you out, then beware!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! I used it throughout my pregnancy. The jar goes a surprisingly long way. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the belly butter, or my skin type (delicate white), but I developed not a single stretch mark. My baby is now eight months old, and I&#x27;ve continued using the belly butter as my sole facial moisturizer. It works amazingly well, even on my older skin. Mornings I rub it in well, in fast circular motions, then wait a couple minutes before applying makeup. I use it at night, and wake with my skin still moisturized and lovely. The texture of this butter is wonderful and the sent is subtle and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If you&#x27;re buying this as a gift, don&#x27;t get it from MaisonDrake. My order arrived with a huge white barcode label stuck over the front of the Motherlove label. Carefully removing it left a terrible sticky dark residue that won&#x27;t come off, even with rubbing alcohol. I can&#x27;t give this as a gift now and will have to get another from Whole Foods, and I&#x27;ll pay the extra few dollars.)</li>
            <li> I like it smells sweet and calming !</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it states it is: a salve. It applies very thickly and will soak through any thin layers you have.  Recommended to wear under a cotton tank to absorb the excess and not stain your outer clothing!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s very oily so a little goes a long way , it&#x27;s best to let it set on your skin for awhile before putting clothes on over it . I&#x27;m nine months pregnant with no stretch marks , &amp; the ones I did have are fading away . Order it !!</li>
            <li> I still got stretch marks but they were minimized. Liked it better than co co butter. I have sensitive skin and it never broke me out</li>
            <li> This product is great and has a very nice smell. I started using 6 weeks pregnant and I am now 21 weeks so far I did not notice any signs of  stretch marks.</li>
            <li> For me, it felt great, smells great but totally made me break out :(. I have very sensitive skin. Otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Great product! It really works! No stretch marks on my body the entire pregnancy. I recommend this to all expectant mothers.</li>
            <li> The product does seem lovely, it smells great, rubs in well...but my skin reacted negatively to it. My skin actually got drier the longer I used it. My belly started flaking and was generally scaly. As soon as I stopped using it it cleared up. Not for everyone I suppose.</li>
            <li> I liked using it but I couldn&#x27;t tell it helped my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Although i do like this product i think its overpriced. I wouldnt have puechased it at all if it weren&#x27;t for it being what my mom used and she kept telling me to get it to fight stretch marks while pregnant</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks while pregnant, and used this daily most of the pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m debating whether to use this again whole pregnant with my second child because while the lavender is organic and gentle-smelling, lavender does have estrogenic properties.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of oils, smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells nice and clean and it&#x27;s a good sized jar.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I am 9 months pregnant and I have put this on my sides, stomach and breasts every morning. My itching has been virtually non-existent. It&#x27;s so soothing. I would recommend buying 2, 4 oz containers - that is how much I used over the 9 months. I also don&#x27;t have any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stop all stretch marks but I think it does help. It&#x27;s not as sticky as one reviewer said it is and I really do like the smell. :)</li>
            <li> Very greasy and leaves a chemical smell on your clothes. I&#x27;ve had to wash my wife&#x27;s favorite pajamas 4 times to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> I am in my third trimester of my second pregnancy and as of today, not a single stretch mark.  I have used it for both pregnancies, and it has really worked for me.  The scent is light and pleasant....the only drawback I would say is that it is super greasy-like applying vaseline.  However, I guess it is that type of moisturizing you need to prevent the stretch marks.  Since it is so greasy I only apply it at night before I go to bed.  I highly recommend it- seriously, not a single mark on my belly and I am getting really big.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this potion. Used it in my first pregnancy and using it now too. Just can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> I used the balm every night on my belly and no stretch marks with both my pregnancies. It can feel a little greasy, but it does have a nice suttle smell.</li>
            <li> This salve feels like Vaseline and smells like chamomile with soft lavender to me and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit sticky because it is thick but it is great for bedtime and it works great at preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the jar.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture. Helped me not to itch my belly. Still have stretch marks, but I still like using this.</li>
            <li> I´m 7 months and i dont have any strech marks and my skin looks perfect. For me is kind of grease, but i really dont care. The smell is very gentle and i love how it melts in my hands. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I used Mother Love pregnant belly salve throughout my pregnancy and have not gotten a single stretch mark!  I don&#x27;t know how much is genetics, and how much is the product, but it had a nice smell, felt great on my skin, and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark, so I&#x27;m pretty darn happy.  Currently 39 weeks and hoping to have my baby very soon!  Thank you Mother Love,your products have been a daily part of my pregnancy!</li>
            <li> Used it for 3 pregnancies.  I have NO stretch marks at all.  I used Motherlove Belly Salve, drank lot&#x27;s of water and exercised through each pregnancy.  Love Motherlove Belly Salve as it worked better than anything else I tried for moisturizer, comfort and reducing itching!</li>
            <li> I almost never review products but this one definitely deserves an A+. I have so far used 3 other pregnancy lotion/oil/creams and this one is by far my favorite. It smells fantastic, dries better than the other ones and does more specifically for the itchiness than ANY of the others I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s also cheaper than most of the others with probably the most natural ingredients. While I thankfully don&#x27;t have stretch marks (in my 34th week) I&#x27;ve only been using this product a couple days so I can&#x27;t say how it will help with that. But the bottom line, the relief from the intense itchiness is a G-d send and I HIGHLY recommend this if you have this issue.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is amazing. I am on my 4th Jar and at the very end of my pregnancy. I have no stretch marks and can not say enough good things about Motherlove pregnant belly salve. I happened to stumble upon it at a herbal store in Dover, NH. I have been ordering it on Amazon ever since.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because my pregnant belly was horribly itchy and a little rashy. I wanted something that would be both soothing and moisturizing and that is why I choose a salve over a lotion. Like all salves, it is oil based making it feel a little greasy at first but after a few minutes it absorbs leaving skin with a slight oil sheen. I have not had any issues with it not absorbing or sticking to clothing or leaving any spots. I have been using this several times a day and love it so much i have been smoothing it on my hands and feet too! It smells pleasant and I can see myself re-ordering when I run out.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the first one was great! However the 2nd time I ordered it didn&#x27;t have the safety cover and I didn&#x27;t even realize it. Noticed as I was using it was a different consistency- I think this is someonene using the jar and refilling with another product! Yikes! I bought another one from drugstore.com and compared them- it is definitely different and this one came sealed. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s nothing too crazy as I&#x27;ve been using it on my pregnant belly for over a week. I&#x27;d be careful when buying this product in here.... I did get one that was sealed and great but I can&#x27;t take chance again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. I used it exclusively since I was 5 months. I got stretch marks. Tons and very deep;( It stains clothes and smells weird once set in clothes.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my entire pregnancy and love it! This has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> I used Motherlove belly salve throughout my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t even up with a single stretch mark! As soon as I found out I was pregnant with #2, this was the first product I knew I had to have. I LOVE the light lavender scent...even when every other smell has made me nauseous. I also love the natural and organic ingredients. The texture is very greasy, but I like that because it feels like you can really rub it in well. I also like to use it on my dry hands. HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 weeks into my pregnancy and no stretch marks thanks to this wonderful, inexpensive salve!! My belly is so beautiful thanks to this, I&#x27;m planning on keep using it after delivery. Happy customer here!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have used it exclusivelly my entire pregnancy, I now have only 4 weeks to go until little man makes his arrival, and I have to say it is so soothing and calming on my skin. I have never had itching skin that can be associated with pregnancy due to the stretching skin. I have no stretch marks at all, and my skin is in the words of my doctor, &amp;#34;been very well taken care of&amp;#34;. If you buy anything please buy this product while pregnant, it is worth every single penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell too and I look forward to it every morning and night as part of my ritual. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to give it up! Although I do plan on using it while my belly shrinks back after the baby is born too. I&#x27;ve heard that can really be helpful as most stretch marks appear from rapid shrinking of the skin rather than stretching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add more to this review in a few months to let you know if it&#x27;s continued to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> She used this all of the time when she was growing her baby bump.  When she was getting bigger and bigger her skin appeared to be very elastic and healthy and didn&#x27;t show any stretch marks.  Now that it&#x27;s two months after the birth of our boy her tummy still is shrinking and still appears really healthy.  She really appreciated this product.</li>
            <li> With my first pregnancy I used Mother&#x27;s Special Blend and while it worked and I got no stretch marks, it was super oily and ruined a lot of my clothes. I had to use it only at night after a shower and with clothes I didn&#x27;t care about. With Motherlove it&#x27;s not super oily and it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothes.  I also have really sensitive skin and everything breaks me out, but this does not.  There is also no scent, nothing to make you sneeze or bother with pregnancy nose. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also hard to say if a product really prevents stretch marks or if your body just isn&#x27;t the type to get stretch marks easily.  I&#x27;ve had stretch marks on my hips and thighs since I was younger, and not pregnancy related, so maybe what I&#x27;m using is working. Rather be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> I really have nothing bad to say other than this stuff seriously stinks, and it doesn&#x27;t dry at all it just stays wet on top of the skin. I haven&#x27;t experienced any stretch marks but I&#x27;m only 22 weeks so we shall see.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 different types of lotion/oils to rub on my growing pregnant belly. I absolutely loved this one! The scent is so mild that even in the early months, I could deal with it while I wouldn&#x27;t dare open up other brands I had purchased. The consistency just feels great and moisturizing enough but not too greasy. Even if you think it feels a little sticky, don&#x27;t worry about wearing clothes over it, it soaks into your skin just like it should. It almost lasted my entire pregnancy as well. And when it did run out in my last month, I was sad to have to go back to using something else. Loved it! Recommended!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell of cocoa butter, so I was excited to find this. ALL the ingredients are organic, and that&#x27;s a major plus in my book. The smell is very light and pleasant, and it absorbs nicely into the skin. I can see how you might consider it a little greasy, but it&#x27;s not like sunscreen greasy, and it won&#x27;t stick to or stain your clothing. It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need much to get a nice, light layer smoothed over your entire belly. I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> I used it at night starting in month 4; I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks and it helped ease my itchy belly.</li>
            <li> Top notch belly butter, my wife didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> I just began using the salve about a month ago. I&#x27;m 20 weeks pregnant and have not had any stretch marks. Hopefully the salve will keep me from getting them. I&#x27;ll probably be more qualified to review the product toward the end of my pregnancy. However, I do like the smell and the texture; both are very soothing.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me a leftover jar from her last pregnancy to try. She has had 2 children and 0 stretch marks after using this product. Of course I realize that does NOT mean I wouldn&#x27;t get any stretch marks...Anyhow, I have been using this every day and am 37 weeks pregnant. I have replaced the jar once after having finished the half jar that was given to me. I am about to buy another jar because I do not have a SINGLE stretch mark on my belly which is pretty big. I also rubbed this on my breasts which went from a DD to a size G/H depending on the bra...and the same thing. I did have some stretch marks prior to pregnancy just from puberty and so on, but there are no more marks than those on my body. I am going to repurchase in hopes that it will also help postpartum. I&#x27;m not going to say that this is &#x27;the reason&#x27; I don t have stretch marks....but why question it? I know it&#x27;s kind of on the pricey side, but it does last a loooooong time. The smell isn&#x27;t wonderful, and it feels a bit like petroleum jelly, but i normally take a bath at night and then put it on before bed. During the last part of my second trimester to about week 35 I was using it twice a day just because that&#x27;s when i seemed to grow the most. My advice? Try it out and see if it works for you, I know its worth it! Good luck Mommas!!!</li>
            <li> I barely used it &amp; ended up buying Bella B Tummy Honey Butter. It was exactly like applying vaseline to your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and have used it for two pregnancies. Nothing else seemed to keep the itchy skin at bay (I&#x27;m too sensitive for coconut oil). The product is heavy and stays on to make my skin feel very hydrated, it doesn&#x27;t rub in completely and have to be re-applied like a lotion would. I think this is because of the beeswax (the product also smells great, like a light beeswax herbal scent, not strong at all). Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Someone gifted this to me when I became pregnant and now I gift this to new moms in my life. It is a luxurious ritual for everyday. I don&#x27;t know if it prevented stretch marks because I definitely got some, but didn&#x27;t seems as bad as my cousins who used cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I used it my entire pregnancy in the morning and at night before bed. Gained 30lbs without one stretch mark. Its a little greasy in texture and takes a while to soak into your skin but worth it. One bottle lasted me about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Okay so I just bought this salve last week. Ive used it maybe 4 days now, twice a day. The reason being to moisturize and keep more stretch marks from forming during the last month of pregnancy. HOWEVER- tonight when rubbing it on, my husband goes &#x27;it&#x27;s like your stretch marks are going away!&#x27; (From previous pregnancy). I myself noticed this today. What was red four days ago is now almost completely skin tone. He swears the marks themselves are even shrunken or thinner. Insane. I didn&#x27;t think any product could do this. I mean... Four days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this will do the same for you but I had to pass on my amazement.</li>
            <li> it worked till my baby had a big growth spurt and really no stopping those stretch marks and also used it on any dry areas</li>
            <li> From my wife:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I loved the smell of this.  It was very calming.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish it came in a larger jar.  I had to buy about 4 jars of it throughout my entire pregnancy.  I put it on at least once a day and sometimes twice.  I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks and I didn&#x27;t have too much trouble with all of the itchiness that people talk about.  I think it helped alot.  I would recommend it to all of my friends and will try the other products eventually as well!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this salve. At one of my final doctor appointments my nurse told me she had not seen such a beautiful pregnant belly in a long time, if ever and I had gained 50 pounds during the pregnancy. I used this salve everyday during my pregnancy and even after. It just melts into your skin. I tell all my close pregnant friends about this product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A friend bought this for me when I was pregnant.  I was pregnant with twins and used this every day.  I loved the smell.  It didn&#x27;t stain my clothes and it helped the awful itching I was getting prior to using this.  It was wonderful.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on reviews.  I use at night time because I love the smell.  I use along with Burt Bees Motherhood belly butter.  Makes my breast/tummy/love handle area all feel smooth and help with the growing size.  Highly recommend, worth the price.  One jar lasted me from week 7 to week 21.</li>
            <li> It smelled a little weird and I was still itchy. I would rather save my money and just use the Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> Used for the entire 9 months, loved it.  You get a TON of this.  Seriously, a little goes a LONG way, 4 ounces lasted me my entire pregnancy and could probably take me through 3 or 4 more if I were planning to.  A friend may inherit the rest of the jar if I don&#x27;t have any more kids :)</li>
