            <li>Good item for our cruise.</li>
            <li>Great sanitizing spray without strong odor!  </li>
            <li>I love this hand sanitizer!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leak in a bag, and I love that it kills norovirus!</li>
            <li>Great fit in a purse or jean pocket.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, and the product dries quickly.</li>
            <li>but I did not find out what it was or how many passengers were affected</li>
            <li>but we were ok.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m 100% sure it contributed to keeping us healthy.  </li>
            <li>Did not use, too many cautions</li>
            <li>I love knowing that we are safe from Norovirus.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of bouts with the stomach bug we decided to invest in better hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this hand sanitizer because I wanted one that has been proven to kill norovirus, which most sanitizers have not.</li>
            <li>Easy travel size for a product that kills bacteria as well as viruses.  </li>
            <li>It does smell strongly of alcohol - but it dissapates quickly.</li>
            <li>Just 2 quick sprays on my hands, quickly rub your hands together and done!</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean and easily &amp;#34;stashable.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This goes on clean and dries immediatly.</li>
            <li>Great idea and product just needs a bit of refinement on the spray nozzle and maybe not so quick to dry.</li>
            <li>Great to have available when you find yourself shaking hands all day or anytime soap and water are not available.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li>This product dries quickly and it&#x27;s not sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>I am a true germaphobe and this product really makes my hands feel thoroughly sanitized!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it in my opinon.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and family - and I also purchased the large 32 oz pump bottle for work!</li>
            <li>I find that my hands feel more sanitized after using, maybe it is the slight bleach aroma that I love so much.</li>
            <li>I presume that Clorox and/or the Amazon marketer are collecting some pretty hefty value-pricing premiums.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and feel much better about things until I can actually wash my hands.  </li>
            <li>This was our first cruise.  </li>
            <li>Also, I received my order very promptly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Dries instantly so you have to spray alot on your hands to get the feeling they are truly clean.</li>
            <li>I use this faithfully -cannot live without it!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more in the future before I go traveling.</li>
            <li>highly recommend for travelling thru airports and cruise ships,</li>
            <li>My kids love using their &amp;#34;spritzy&amp;#34; when a sink is not available.</li>
            <li>We live by this stuff.</li>
            <li>Leaving you with sticky hands and super dry skin.</li>
            <li>Ordered for health and winter spring germ clean up of virus potential in home - worked as expected - shipment super fast and product worked perfectly as expected.  </li>
            <li>We had accomplished a considerable amount of research regarding ship cruises prior to our trip.  </li>
            <li>We were healthy all winter using this after being around many sick people.</li>
            <li>so definitively something to bring along to places like cruise ships where confined spaces, bad toilet habits, and lots of people come together for the perfect storm re: passing Norovirii from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these the only draw back is the over-spray and the fact they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I found a test on the Web that showed that it killed more germs than other sanitizers too.</li>
            <li>This is one product that claims it can destroy the norovirus (on top of the other germs hand sanitizers take care of).  </li>

            <li> This is one product that claims it can destroy the norovirus (on top of the other germs hand sanitizers take care of).  </li>
            <li> It does not dry my hands out like I expected it to either.</li>
            <li> This sanitizer is straight isopropyl alcohol, so it doesn&#x27;t make your hands sting due to doing strange things to your nerve endings like other harsh sanitizers.</li>
            <li> did deduct one star because it does dry your hands out.  </li>
            <li> I rated the product highly, but the packaging leaves something to be desired, or at least the shipping of the product.</li>
            <li> It lasts a surprisingly long time due to ultra-low viscosity.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s to be expected, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m for anything that helps keep you healthy in an environment where there might be sick individuals.  </li>
            <li> Lemon Tree has been extremely helpful to me in obtaining this product.</li>
            <li> This time when I opened the plastic pouch to access the bottles, half of one of the bottles had leaked out, and was crunched.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for several months and no one has been sick so far!</li>
            <li> But for the right application (cruise ships, daycare with sick kids, and so on)</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past..</li>
            <li> None of that goopy, sloppy stuff that other hand sanitizers cause.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this product was the the only reason we didn&#x27;t get sick</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to prevent us from getting sick from the Norovirus since we were going on a cruise.  </li>
            <li> My mom spends a lot of time in and out of nursing homes and hospitals with sick relatives, and it makes us all feel safer that she carries it with her to kill the germs.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I used this while he was sick with a respiratory infection and kept it from spreading.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No one got sick!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great sanitizing spray without strong odor!  The bottles are the perfect size to stick in your pocket.</li>
            <li> spray is convenient and not at all sticky like some sanitizers.</li>
            <li> Easy travel size for a product that kills bacteria as well as viruses.  Definitely something to keep in stock!</li>
            <li> I love these the only draw back is the over-spray and the fact they don&#x27;t last very long. Dries instantly so you have to spray alot on your hands to get the feeling they are truly clean. Great idea and product just needs a bit of refinement on the spray nozzle and maybe not so quick to dry. Great fit in a purse or jean pocket.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to prevent us from getting sick from the Norovirus since we were going on a cruise.  We found out when we were on the cruise that there was some type of outbreak on the ship but I did not find out what it was or how many passengers were affected but we were ok.  I can&#x27;t say this product was the the only reason we didn&#x27;t get sick but I&#x27;m 100% sure it contributed to keeping us healthy.  I&#x27;m for anything that helps keep you healthy in an environment where there might be sick individuals.  I will definitely purchase more in the future before I go traveling.</li>
            <li> ... AFAIK, it&#x27;s the the only one out there that claims it can kill the Norovirus, so definitively something to bring along to places like cruise ships where confined spaces, bad toilet habits, and lots of people come together for the perfect storm re: passing Norovirii from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of the product re: the Norovirus (knock on wood), as we haven&#x27;t had a case yet. It worked with a case of pink-eye, blocking transmission among the family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism re: this product is the pricing, i.e. $6 per bottle is steep. I presume that Clorox and/or the Amazon marketer are collecting some pretty hefty value-pricing premiums. But for the right application (cruise ships, daycare with sick kids, and so on) the product likely pays for itself.</li>
            <li> I bought the hand sanitizer to take on a cruise.  I read that Clorox Hand Sanitizer was one of the best products to kill germs and viruses.  The product arrived on time and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m around preschoolers and caught the stomach bug 2x this year before finding this product...I use it all the time and feel much better about things until I can actually wash my hands.  They need to sell this in the stores!</li>
            <li> Ordered for health and winter spring germ clean up of virus potential in home - worked as expected - shipment super fast and product worked perfectly as expected.  recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Did not use, too many cautions</li>
            <li> Good item for our cruise.</li>
            <li> highly recommend for travelling thru airports and cruise ships,</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean and easily &amp;#34;stashable.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.. Lemon Tree has been extremely helpful to me in obtaining this product. I will be ordering from Lemon Tree in the future as well.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I love knowing that we are safe from Norovirus.  I use this stuff all of the time. My mom spends a lot of time in and out of nursing homes and hospitals with sick relatives, and it makes us all feel safer that she carries it with her to kill the germs.  We were healthy all winter using this after being around many sick people.</li>
            <li> We live by this stuff. After a couple of bouts with the stomach bug we decided to invest in better hand sanitizer. This goes on clean and dries immediatly. It does smell strongly of alcohol - but it dissapates quickly. We&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and family - and I also purchased the large 32 oz pump bottle for work!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of anything that kills norovirus. The scent is pleasant, and the product dries quickly. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am a true germaphobe and this product really makes my hands feel thoroughly sanitized!</li>
            <li> I bought this hand sanitizer because I wanted one that has been proven to kill norovirus, which most sanitizers have not. I have six kids, so when the stomach flu hits it lasts for weeks! We have been using this product for several months and no one has been sick so far! We even went to and indoor playground birthday party and I sprayed my children&#x27;s hand before they ate. No one got sick! I don&#x27;t ever want to do without this stuff! Also, I received my order very promptly.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across the Clorox brand hand sanitizer while in my doctor&#x27;s office. I find that my hands feel more sanitized after using, maybe it is the slight bleach aroma that I love so much. It does not dry my hands out like I expected it to either. It is perfect for placing in my purse as well as the side pocket of my car door. Just 2 quick sprays on my hands, quickly rub your hands together and done! None of that goopy, sloppy stuff that other hand sanitizers cause. Leaving you with sticky hands and super dry skin. These are perfect! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. My kids love using their &amp;#34;spritzy&amp;#34; when a sink is not available. Being a bit of a germophobe, this is my third time buying this product. I rated the product highly, but the packaging leaves something to be desired, or at least the shipping of the product. This time when I opened the plastic pouch to access the bottles, half of one of the bottles had leaked out, and was crunched.</li>
            <li> We had accomplished a considerable amount of research regarding ship cruises prior to our trip.  This was our first cruise.  I ordered and receive the 4 pack as described above.  I issued 1 each to my family members going on the trip.  We utilized the product as well as used the on-board routine sanitizer and did not have any issues.  This type of product (or similar) was recommended by our Environmental Health inspector to use in addition to the alcohol based sanitizers.</li>
            <li> Great to have available when you find yourself shaking hands all day or anytime soap and water are not available.</li>
            <li> I love this hand sanitizer!  I prefer hand sanitizers in spray form to the ones in gel form.  This product dries quickly and it&#x27;s not sticky at all.  The product arrived quickly and was packaged well.  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it in my opinon.  My boyfriend and I used this while he was sick with a respiratory infection and kept it from spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did deduct one star because it does dry your hands out.  That&#x27;s to be expected, though.</li>
            <li> This sanitizer is straight isopropyl alcohol, so it doesn&#x27;t make your hands sting due to doing strange things to your nerve endings like other harsh sanitizers. It lasts a surprisingly long time due to ultra-low viscosity. I found a test on the Web that showed that it killed more germs than other sanitizers too. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use anything else from now on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leak in a bag, and I love that it kills norovirus!</li>
            <li> This is one product that claims it can destroy the norovirus (on top of the other germs hand sanitizers take care of).  I use this faithfully -cannot live without it!  Great gift for teachers too!!!!</li>
