            <li>ITS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work well in warm and humid time.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most effective moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year or so, and love it.</li>
            <li>i love the way it makes my face feel</li>
            <li>and my wife loves it more .</li>
            <li>And ok..</li>
            <li>What I love about this moisturizer is it truly is MATTE...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many so called &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; moisturizers and this one truly does what is says.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer itself leaves a refreshing feel and wakes me up when I use it.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s not shiny and goes on matte.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>I received this as a sample and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I leaves my face feeling clean and nice.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scent and hydrated my face very well.</li>
            <li>It says no scent added, but it does have a mild and pleasant, almost piney kind of scent that dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>and while the packaging idea is cute, it&#x27;s not practacle and looks cheap</li>
            <li>Not overly oily, and left a great &amp;#34;post conditioning&amp;#34; feel on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE the natural scent..</li>
            <li>Feels so smooth putting it on, and gets rid of forehead wrinkles that can age you.</li>
            <li>Love the citrousy smell, the cool and fresh-piney sensation once you put it on, the light/hydrating texture and how quickly it absorbs.</li>
            <li>Lasts a good amount of time due to you being able to squeeze out every bit from the bag.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve reordered the full size since then.</li>
            <li>pretty much all day oil free forehead and face!</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for dry season.</li>
            <li>What surprised me most is how cooling this stuff feels on the face.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and original design of package.</li>
            <li>right after I apply it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming that all the vitamins, antioxidants, and essential oils are doing a lot to calm inflammation and keep the skin healthy.</li>
            <li>although I would love some extra cash right now, hahaha.</li>
            <li>Lotion works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about straight up, no non-sense, brass tacks moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>It keeps me more matte than anything I&#x27;ve used short of powder (don&#x27;t judge, I&#x27;m bald and the shine is sometimes out of control, especially under overhead lighting).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Refreshing tingling feeling for a few moments.</li>
            <li>I really expected the full size of this to be a bigger pouch.</li>
            <li>I have what I consider to be sensitive skin (gets red/irritated out of the shower) and this stuff has definitely helped.</li>
            <li>I was using Neutrogena oil free moisturizer for a while, and I found it soooo strange that it made me look like an oil slick.</li>

            <li> does the trick.  Makes my husbands skin look teriffic.  Smells and feels great and has a nice tingle.  Good moisturizing effect.  How do I know? I sneak it every once in a while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year or so, and love it. It is truly a matte moisturizer, no shine from this! I use this daily as a moisturizer and after shaving - no sting. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different facial products, and this is one I keep going back to. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> My son uses this and loves that it is not an oily moisturizer.  He has acne and this has been the best moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not overly oily, and left a great &amp;#34;post conditioning&amp;#34; feel on my face and neck. Such a great product.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and original design of package. Love the citrousy smell, the cool and fresh-piney sensation once you put it on, the light/hydrating texture and how quickly it absorbs. I leaves my face feeling clean and nice.  The texture:  It doesn&#x27;t leave your face shiny but it does not help to control or reduce sebum production either. Also, it makes foundation and spf lotion cake up and hard to spread. So it only works for me as a night moisturizer.  Also, keep in mind it says to avoid eye area.</li>
            <li> This works great i love the way it makes my face feel and my wife loves it more . The packaging is the best you can get out every drop and travel with ease also is can go through tsa</li>
            <li> What surprised me most is how cooling this stuff feels on the face. It kind of reminds me of Vapor Rub, lol, but in a good way! I love love LOVE the natural scent.. I usually prefer products that are have no scent at all..but for this, I will happily make an exception! And ok..what a bonus.. This did not break me out!!! I&#x27;m assuming that all the vitamins, antioxidants, and essential oils are doing a lot to calm inflammation and keep the skin healthy. I was using Neutrogena oil free moisturizer for a while, and I found it soooo strange that it made me look like an oil slick. But this product from Ernest Supplies is truly matte. My face looks SO good right after I apply it. And no, I was NOT paid to write this review...although I would love some extra cash right now, hahaha.</li>
            <li> Packaging is great. Lotion works very well. Moisturizes, but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling or any shininess on your face. Refreshing tingling feeling for a few moments. It says no scent added, but it does have a mild and pleasant, almost piney kind of scent that dissipates pretty quickly. It claims vitamins for healthier skin an&amp;#34;anti-aging,&amp;#34; but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything and have been using daily for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Needed a thicker after shower face moisturizer in this winter. Pleasant scent and hydrated my face very well. A small amount goes a long way. Would repurchase again</li>
            <li> What I love about this moisturizer is it truly is MATTE...men don&#x27;t want to shine. I&#x27;ve tried many so called &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; moisturizers and this one truly does what is says. Use it daily. Feels good on the skin. Now if they&#x27;d just make a great mens eyecream.....</li>
            <li> Lasts a good amount of time due to you being able to squeeze out every bit from the bag. It travels well too and doesn&#x27;t burst or rupture. The moisturizer itself leaves a refreshing feel and wakes me up when I use it. After applying, my face feels moisturized but not sticky. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about straight up, no non-sense, brass tacks moisturizing. This stuff fits that bill. It isn&#x27;t overly greasy, nor does it leave any sort of residue. It isn&#x27;t saturated with some migraine-inducing smells, either. Also, whoever decided to package this stuff up into the same convenient container my toddler uses to suck down his applesauce is genius. I have what I consider to be sensitive skin (gets red/irritated out of the shower) and this stuff has definitely helped. I&#x27;ll be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> This arrived as a sample in a Birchbox a couple years ago.  It was so amazing for me, I&#x27;ve reordered the full size since then. It keeps me more matte than anything I&#x27;ve used short of powder (don&#x27;t judge, I&#x27;m bald and the shine is sometimes out of control, especially under overhead lighting).  It hydrates fully, lasts all day, and is packaged sensibly.  I would marry this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful texture, and I love how it&#x27;s not shiny and goes on matte. Too expensive though and while the packaging idea is cute, it&#x27;s not practacle and looks cheap</li>
            <li> This is one of the most effective moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used. Feels so smooth putting it on, and gets rid of forehead wrinkles that can age you. Possible con would be the smell- it&#x27;s not exactly perfumey. Personally, I like that feature. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This stuff has been great. I use it when I get out of the shower and it moisturizes after shaving without the burn of aftershave or a discernible smell. A little goes a long way, too. I really appreciate this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works for my oily skin. ITS AMAZING. pretty much all day oil free forehead and face! LOVE THIS STUFF. But is expensive! I received this as a sample and fell in love. I really expected the full size of this to be a bigger pouch.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for dry season. It doesn&#x27;t work well in warm and humid time.</li>
