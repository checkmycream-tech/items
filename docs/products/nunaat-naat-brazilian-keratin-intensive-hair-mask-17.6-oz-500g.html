            <li>My curls are also more defined until I apply a leave in or disturb them by combing.</li>
            <li>This product worked more like a conditioner on my hair than a Keratin Mask.</li>

            <li>This is a nice, light protein treatment and I use it about twice a month.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair more manageable when I straighten it with the blow dryer.  </li>

            <li>It is a great product, but other things we do to our hair is just as important.</li>
            <li>Works well specially for my highlighted and keratin treated hair.</li>
            <li>This product is not as effective on curly hair with professional keratin applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching everywhere for a product to soften my daughters&#x27; natural hair, and moisturize my own relaxed hair.</li>

            <li> Bought this a few months back so that I could use it for a while and then post a review.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb on my thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe my extra comments in this rating helps others, but I truly recommend this product for anybody who has dry, frizzy, unruly and hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> No more brushing when dry,</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on and of on my unruly, kinky, curly, straight, thick, thin hair</li>
            <li> I meant to order the Keratin Conditioner and was a little upset - with myself.</li>
            <li> But, I have to say a few things, because it may make a difference...</li>
            <li> Shampoo is so harsh on hair,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This one I had a high expectation from it, but it was disappointing for me</li>
            <li> , it was thick and stable to stay on my hair without running down in my face.</li>
            <li> I also use it if I have been in the pool and will just brush in a small amount to leave-in.</li>
            <li> but, it is quite expensive for such a small bottle.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using this my hair broke like crazy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the Caribbean and it was a thick mask.  </li>
            <li> Not recommendable for curly thick hair, like mine.</li>
            <li> Try this if you have weak damaged hair, you&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
            <li> The worst mask I&#x27;ve ever used in my whole life after I rainsed my hair</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I could not comb my hair due to the tangle I hate it</li>
            <li> so I must have had really bad luck.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I have several protein treatments, but this is the one that I reach for time and time again.  This mask makes my chemically treated and dyed hair super strong. In addition to this, the mask   does not dry my hair out like most protein treatments do. I will definitely purchase this treatment   again.</li>
            <li> Great for nourishing and smoothing</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the Caribbean and it was a thick mask.  When I received this order the product was not the same.  It was a watery cheap hair conditioner.  Purchase Suave Keratin conditioner and save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> Love this product .. I have dry and damaged hair and this masque makes my hair super soft. Bought this a few months back so that I could use it for a while and then post a review.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair soft, straight and managable. Reduces frizz and static&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend it</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been going from relaxed to natural this is month 4. No heat no chemicals. I wanted to blow dry and flat iron my hair to see the growth and for the Easter Holiday. I saw this product at Walmart (17.5oz for 5.99) it made my hair feel so soft love the smell. I recommend this it works well!!</li>
            <li> Even my hairdresser was impressed when she saw how silky my hair looked after applying it.</li>
            <li> I severely damaged my hair when I started bleaching out the brown dye in my hair to help me transition to my naturally white hair. I used this once and my hair already feels softer. It has a pleasant scent that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> it did not work for me but maybe works foer someone else its dry my hair thank you anyway good luck</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. WhY? i like it because it was not messy, it was thick and stable to stay on my hair without running down in my face. I left this conditioner on for 6 hours. My hair was soft as cotton. Using this product made detaingling  very easy. I had been using Argan oil conditioner for my conditioner and i wanted to try something different. I had to get use to the smell, it is soft and not overpowering . I expected it to be loud, but it works for my hair. My hair had thinned out fro the chlorine in the pool and i felt like the keratin in this conditioner would help soothe and relax my hair shaft. it did just that.</li>
            <li> Conditioned my hair so silky and soft. I gave up shampoo 1 1/2 years ago and had been using WEN. This is a more affordable alternative and works as well.</li>
            <li> I am about to order this product on Amazon, because my local Wal-Mart ran out of it. I have been using this product on and of on my unruly, kinky, curly, straight, thick, thin hair (yes, with my ancestors, I inherited any type of hair one can imagine), and it has helped me tremendously in getting the upper hand when handling my hair. But, I have to say a few things, because it may make a difference...I DO NOT EVER shampoo my hair. Shampoo is so harsh on hair, that I gave it up 10 years ago (and everybody who is not working in the grease department should do so as well). I only condition my hair with a Marrocan argain oil based conditioner 3x a week, brush my hair UNDER water and that&#x27;s it. No more brushing when dry, no other hair treatment, no dryers, no curlers (I surely don&#x27;t need this), no straightening - just finger combing. At night, I wear a silk scarf/doo-rag around my hair. I use this product when I feel dryness or see frizzies on my hair, and this product &amp;#34;smoothes&amp;#34; it in no time. My hair is almost down to my rear end and this product makes sure it keeps its bounce. It is a great product, but other things we do to our hair is just as important. Maybe my extra comments in this rating helps others, but I truly recommend this product for anybody who has dry, frizzy, unruly and hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> I meant to order the Keratin Conditioner and was a little upset - with myself. This product is nice but more time consuming to apply and rinse out. I love the conditioner and may need to order it when my funds allow.</li>
            <li> This product did a great job on my colored hair.  It gave it the extra moisture it needed, left it soft, it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I generally leave it for several hours, wrapped up in a towel, and then rinse it out. It leaves my hair feeling so healthy, so soft, very shiny, and with a lovely fragrance. I bleach my hair a very white blonde, so I need something with incredible strength to help prevent breakage and to keep it from looking lackluster. This does the trick. I also use it if I have been in the pool and will just brush in a small amount to leave-in. I will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the product in Brazil but there it is in USA! I My hair is colored, I swim and love outdoors, so every &amp;#34;no good activities&amp;#34; for long hair. I&#x27;ve been perceiving my hair to be smoother, hydrated. Is smells good also. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. Prior to using this my hair broke like crazy. Now it&#x27;s much stronger and I can retain my length and it makes my 4b hair feel great.  I am a big fan of this product</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  It smells great!  it leaves my hair with a lot of bounce and shine.  And if you shop around you can find it for a good price.</li>
            <li> The worst mask I&#x27;ve ever used in my whole life after I rainsed my hair I could not comb my hair due to the tangle I hate it</li>
            <li> JUST STARTED USING IT BUT SO FAR IT HAS BEEN GREAT FOR MY HAIR AND I DO PLAN ON ORDERING MORE OF THIS SAME PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE!</li>
            <li> This product is not as effective on curly hair with professional keratin applied. I used this as a hair mask to create softness after shampoo and condition but it leaves hair soft but with no shine. Not recommendable for curly thick hair, like mine.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel soft but that&#x27;s it. It doesn&#x27;t do anything else.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse naturally curly hair. My hair loves this mask along with most Nunaat products. I use this after I&#x27;ve used heat and it makes my hair so soft and manageable. My curls are also more defined until I apply a leave in or disturb them by combing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have dyed blonde hair and I&#x27;ve had it like this for about a year. I am a natural brunette so whenever you hair is under so many chemicals it is very easy for it to get damaged. I take good care of my hair but it tangles easily. This product worked more like a conditioner on my hair than a Keratin Mask. Doesn&#x27;t made my hair feel different or better at all. I&#x27;m sure it worked magic on other customers but not on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching everywhere for a product to soften my daughters&#x27; natural hair, and moisturize my own relaxed hair. I used this product according to directions without heat and it left our hair very soft, and manageable. My youngest daughter is extremely \\&quot;tender-headed\\&quot;, this product made my detangling routine so much easier. Great product. I purchased for 9.99 at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Works well specially for my highlighted and keratin treated hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and soft/smooth :)</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I have thin hair and I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and my is much stronger and thicker! It makes my hair really soft and leaves it with a pleasant scent! I would be ordering this product again!</li>
            <li> This is a second time I buy this! First tried pharmacy but this one here is cheaper! I love how soft my hair is after using it!</li>
            <li> I am almost out of the mask, this is a product you will have to always reorder.  I am planning to order pretty much so quick now.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask hoping to replace the bottle of ApHogee two-step (which I love) but, it is quite expensive for such a small bottle.  This is a nice, light protein treatment and I use it about twice a month. I have relaxed hair past my shoulders, so this is very good for making sure my hair isn&#x27;t too damaged from heat or chemical styling. This is excellent for using when it&#x27;s not quite time for a relaxer. It makes my hair more manageable when I straighten it with the blow dryer.  I&#x27;ve had this since the summer and it still has more than 3/4 left. The size is excellent. I paid about $3.99 for this on Amazon, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending any more than $5-6.Try your local beauty supply store for a lower price. It&#x27;s worth a few bucks to test.</li>
            <li> I use it instead of gel or waxes. I dry my hair off with a towel and then i apply it and style my hair as desired. A little greasy, but it comes off easily. It takes care of your hair and has a natural shine to it too</li>
            <li> This one I had a high expectation from it, but it was disappointing for me becasue I didn&#x27;t feel any noticeable changes while using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb on my thick naturally curly hair. It leaves my hair soft and manageable. Tangle free with minimal shedding. This is the only deep/mask conditioner I use. I stock up every chance I get! Thanks Nunaat!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it. It left my hair soft and manageable. It is easy to use. You will go back for more.</li>
            <li> Its a cool product, but not what I was expecting, looks like my research was not good enough before I got it, probably not an issue with the product, but I got something different than what I was waiting.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get a refund/reorder this hair mask and the second tub came much nicer. It makes my hair very soft and healthy looking which is great since I have been bleaching my hair several times a year for the past 3 years. I will definitely be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard great things about this Keratin mask and am in desperate need of hair repair after bleaching my hair several times. I don&#x27;t know if this mask is supposed to have a seal or what but when I opened it there was mask crusted around the edges and looked used! Ugh where is the quality control? I ordered this with another beauty item and that was damaged as well so I must have had really bad luck. I have contacted Amazon for a refund and to place another order. I hope that this doesn&#x27;t happen again and will write another review when I get the new order.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for over 20 year, this product if used correctly (after bleaching, and coloring), leaves my hair feeling like I never even colored it.  Try this if you have weak damaged hair, you&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
