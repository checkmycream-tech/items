            <li>We both love them.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that you get four Curling Irons in one.</li>

            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>and it helps me do my cute hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t force the heads; they&#x27;ll get easier the more you switch them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident now to upgrade the rating to 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I do agree that it takes some maneuvering to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself or the the person on whom you are using this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to others for sure.</li>
            <li>I admit I&#x27;ve only used one of the sizes, but it turned out great!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curling iron set.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that I most often straighten.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with clipless curling wands and was in the market for a 32mm/1.25-in for looser</li>
            <li>and I thought for $20 and 3 more options, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>One of many hair paraphernalia that my daughter uses.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It looks so much better than when I used my straightener.</li>
            <li>I love my curling wand, although I admit that I&#x27;ve never used all of the barrels.</li>
            <li>good price and so worth the purchase . . .</li>
            <li>I love this wand.</li>
            <li>My clients love the waves I create with is product.</li>

            <li>Honestly I dont think thats true.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>It worked great and the different wand attachments were amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: My wife has used this frequently now for 4 months and still working great.</li>
            <li>Great for professional use in the salon.</li>
            <li>This is a great iron, love the different attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and change barrel sizes.</li>
            <li>Loved BELLEZZA 4 in One Curling Iron Set with Four Ceramic is fantastic, leaves hair all curly fast.</li>
            <li>But WOW, reallly really impressed by this and would highly recommend this wand to all of you!</li>
            <li>This wand was amazing for the first couple of months.</li>
            <li>After sleeping that night I still had beautiful curls the next day!!!</li>
            <li>I used dollar store, winter/knit glove and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>When it worked, it was fine.</li>
            <li>They shipped it quick too!</li>
            <li>Also this was my very first time even using a wand!</li>
            <li>Very hot!</li>
            <li>Which is AWESOME!!)&lt;br /&gt;3.Paper with Important Safety Instructions.</li>
            <li>Overall, the concept is great, but it just doesn&#x27;t curl.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this curling wand until it stopped working a few months in........</li>
            <li>Also the handle feels like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>While it worked it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m pissed that the best curling wand I&#x27;ve used is dead.</li>
            <li>It arrived in great shape and all barrels heated up properly.</li>
            <li>This is a great curling wand and anyone looking for a cheaper alternative to the nume wands should definitely check this one out!</li>
            <li>idk anything about curling irons, but I do know some things about happy women, If youre looking for a lady gift, look no further!</li>
            <li>I get great curls that last all night.</li>
            <li>I used them every single day and had beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>Took kinda long to get here but its great, it heats up fast and does amazing curls.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a quick, easy way to great looking long hair.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and it gives you a nice natural waves result.</li>
            <li>She not only loves doing her own hair but does her moms and mine as well!</li>
            <li>This is so worth it!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better then hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I literally got this wand yesterday and today was the first day I was able to use it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it</li>
            <li>She has very fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>I using this with gorgeous results that last through cheer leading routines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about this versatile product</li>
            <li>I have never been able to use curling irons and recently bought a Le Angelique 25mm/1-in clipless curling wand at the bargain and was amazed at how easy it was!</li>
            <li>First of all because of the changeable barrels (I had read that they broke easily), and the price (</li>
            <li>Gets extremely hot, easy to burn yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I was very reluctant to let my daughter spend this much of her own money on a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>They were super helpful and quick.</li>
            <li>All it took was one time to be burned to learn that pretty quickly!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since purchased the Cortex 4-in-1 and have used it more in the last month than I ever used the Bellezza in a year and love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve posted pictures for comparison in the customer images galleries - I urge you to take a quick look before you purchase in case</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews before purchasing this and some people said that it broke really quick..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, but be prepared to need practice:)</li>
            <li>It reachs high temps and creates sexy curls and waves.</li>
            <li>, ships very fast !</li>
            <li>Very hot and takes time to get used to it,</li>
            <li>The temp gets very hot in just a matter of seconds</li>
            <li>a fantastic mom who takes a lot of time doing my girl&#x27;s hair before school, when really its super easy and pretty fast!!</li>
            <li>Perfect long lasting curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to switch between wands, and it has more than enough heat to make the curls stay (I like setting to 380).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy and fast too.</li>
            <li>Its fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think this curling iron will be fabulous once I really learn how to use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for traveling and everyday basis</li>
            <li>its nice to have interchangeable diff sized barrels especially for me because i wear extensions.</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but so worth it.</li>
            <li>The different sizes are really nice</li>
            <li>I rarely give any product 5 stars but based on cost and ease of use etc</li>
            <li>Heats up way fast and love the 4 differing rods that allow for so much diversity in the way my hair can look.</li>
            <li>I ended returning it only because I realized I didn&#x27;t need it, but liked how you could change the size and had no problem with that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of wands and curling irons and this is by far the BEST.i love the versatility of the attachments.</li>
            <li>Works good, only complain I have is that the biggest barrel wouldn&#x27;t fit after 1 month, other than that is okay</li>
            <li>I love it easy to you quick to do your whole head and curls last all day!  </li>
            <li>The glove is a must because it gets hot quick.</li>
            <li>It gets SO hot so quickly and it HOLDS.</li>
            <li>i dont recomend this just because the original manufacture were very irresponsible.</li>
            <li>Product is great looks good just very very difficult to change out.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>Nicely boxed and lightweight- for as much as you&#x27;ll be curling, plastic wherever possible reduces hand fatigue.</li>
            <li>In addition to being quick (heats up fast AND requires minimum time to get those curls), I see my split ends disappearing.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was in a rush and didn&#x27;t hold the wand on my hair as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair</li>
            <li>It shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I am always receiving complements on how pretty my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I figured this out within the first 60 secs of opening this.</li>
            <li>You definitely with love the curls it gives you.</li>
            <li>I purchased this exactly 3 months ago and now it reads an \\&quot;err\\&quot; on the LCD screen and won&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li>the first time I changed the wand the clip that holds the wand in place</li>
            <li>When I first got my curling wand set</li>
            <li>I have the same style curling iron in a different size, made by a different company, and it works great!  </li>
            <li>First thing I wanted to do was try it, but it took me 15 minutes to try to figure out how to turn it on.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much, Belleza!</li>
            <li>I think what she likes most is the 4 different options.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact size that I needed.</li>
            <li>Curls seem to hold much better than with a regular iron.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of different sizes.</li>
            <li>I love that you can set the temperature on this wand very low.</li>
            <li>This means I can style my costume wigs, even the ones that aren&#x27;t traditionally heat safe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not such a fan of the tapered one, but some girls love the look it gives.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I love how there are four different sized curling irons included so that you can create many different styles.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously I do not need TWO 1-inchers and only 1.25-inch for $20 bucks more.</li>
            <li>when removing the barrel you have to make sure to remove it from the bottom and not the actual barrel itself you might end up breaking it</li>
            <li>I love all the different size attachment.</li>
            <li>so i contacted AMAZON and ofcourse they told me to ship it back immediately with no cost to me :)  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to not have to buy several curling wands and have a bunch of cords I love it.</li>
            <li>It works great heats up fast, and the curls stay in my hair for at least 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I love how it has four different sizes and soo much cheaper than one you buy in the mall.</li>
            <li>and im ready to oder some other things my daughter still needs some more stuff!</li>
            <li>item arrived very quickly, was easy to operate and took just a little while to learn how to handle and achieve desired results.  </li>
            <li>wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;1.The electric cord is long, some people don&#x27;t like the electric cord to be long but for me it&#x27;s excellent because that way I don&#x27;t have to be struggling with the short one.</li>
            <li>The iron gets really hot for fast curls.</li>
            <li>fast!&lt;br /&gt;It has a real temp control so it tells to how hot it</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect to be able to keep all the wands in the box organized for a long amount of time.  </li>
            <li>So far I have only used one size barrell, but I have used it several times, and it works great.</li>
            <li>cheaply made and didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>only 430&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 4 irons , easy to take off and on .</li>
            <li>but by the 3rd time I used it, it was easy.</li>
            <li>I have used my curling iron numerous times, and it doesn&#x27;t take a long time for it to heat up, and I always get good results when I use it.</li>
            <li>and then some, even with the large barrel.</li>
            <li>They come in different sizes so different for many occasions!</li>
            <li>The glove is a nice touch although ironically using it makes me put my fingers a little TOO close</li>
            <li>I dont really know the measurements</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very scared to change the barrels, because I thought that I would break them.</li>
            <li>If you are careful you will be able to change them.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bellezza 4 in one</li>
            <li>it really is a steal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>She went out and bought this very one.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve just not used it that much.</li>
            <li>&amp; I really like that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them often because curling is very time consuming whether with an iron or the wand.</li>
            <li>With that being said, it works very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to buy this curling iron!</li>
            <li>but i dont have much use for it since i cut my hair.</li>
            <li>but the curl does not hold very well for me.</li>
            <li>Still trying to figure out how to style my hair with it, but that&#x27;s not really a product issue :)</li>
            <li>I really thought, since it wasnt hundreds of dollars that it would be a dud.</li>
            <li>I do love the idea of having multiple barrels but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my curl like my old curling iron...</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t complained about it, so this is a good sign.</li>
            <li>I gave my first one to my sister , and ordered myself a new one.</li>
            <li>Love the glove that it comes in because I use it for other heating products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten such good curls and this is an affordable version of other products I&#x27;ve thought of buying!</li>
            <li>I wish the seller disclosed that particular detail.</li>
            <li>I love that each wand has a different effect for a different look.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend a silicone heat mat to place them on since they reach close to 450 degrees.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, they were a little more wavy than curly</li>
            <li>The only thing to watch out for is that it is very easy to burn yourself with this product so BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li>(Everyone should read, because normally nobody ever does.)&lt;br /&gt;4.Registration</li>
            <li>Normally I would take about 30 minutes to curl my hair and using the Bellezza 4</li>
            <li>Meaning you can use it on either your right or left.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use and you only have to hold your hair around the iron for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>if I knew where to send it to get a new product.  </li>
            <li>But I decided to go for it, because I needed a new curling iron/wand.</li>
            <li>so looks like I need to look for a new wand.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, it was a bit difficult to change the wands but other than that it WAS great.</li>
            <li>the product arrived on time, however the material of the iron is low quality, ceramic does not damage your hair and this iron did exactly that to my hair</li>
            <li>I am really excited to try out different styles with the different wand sizes.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I had separately purchased and they were the exact same size.</li>
            <li>what do you know, the exact same size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it got really hot and all of a sudden it just stop working .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of coordination to curl your hair, but once I figured the system, it was easy.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m being cheap, but I&#x27;ve had some hair appliances that have lasted a lot longer than a year that I paid a lot less for.</li>
            <li>It was only at 350 and I was able to achieve beachy waves in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I suggest anyone who has given up on using their life warranty this product promises to just contact Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised.  </li>
            <li>The product was shipped to my doorstep one day early.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my 18 year old daughter and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much of a problem changing the different irons.</li>
            <li>The old ones are slower to heat up.</li>
            <li>My wife is a professional makeup artist/hair stylist and has both sets.  </li>
            <li>and my curls dont last as much like when I use my sultra one</li>
            <li>Couple of things, the ends are difficult to change out, and it does not come with good instructions on how to do this.  </li>
            <li>I had recently tried one other Bellezza curling iron at the mall and that one was very smooth and the curl lasted til the next day.</li>
            <li>$80 seems a high price to pay for a curling iron that only works for 3 months.</li>
            <li>For a small price difference the Cortex in a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>but the two buttons that releases the attachment were hard to press and won&#x27;t release as easily as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Curling Iron Operating Instructions, Features and Benefits, General Safety Instructions, Styling Tips, Care and Maintenance, and Guarantee and Warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the real test was how long it would last.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m past the 30 day period, I can&#x27;t return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I took the broken plastic piece out of the hole and was able to maneuver the iron so it stayed on.  </li>
            <li>so i can do my sexy vic secret hair once again.</li>
            <li>While I do not know what my other curler goes up to, I can say this one did not get hot enough to even curl my hair!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it does what I want it to and other times not so much.</li>
            <li>Hard-to-curl hair is easily curled as long as the layer is not too thick.</li>
            <li>My super thick and long hair was completely curled within twenty minutes, which is never the case.</li>
            <li>It really does heat up in less than 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>A little difficult to get the hang of without burning yourself, but what good is an iron that dies after two uses?</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m confident now to upgrade the rating to 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I do agree that it takes some maneuvering to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself or the the person on whom you are using this.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron set.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that I most often straighten.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with clipless curling wands and was in the market for a 32mm/1.25-in for looser</li>
            <li> and I thought for $20 and 3 more options, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> One of many hair paraphernalia that my daughter uses.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It looks so much better than when I used my straightener.</li>
            <li> I love my curling wand, although I admit that I&#x27;ve never used all of the barrels.</li>

            <li> Overall, the concept is great, but it just doesn&#x27;t curl.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this curling wand until it stopped working a few months in........</li>
            <li> Also the handle feels like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> While it worked it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m pissed that the best curling wand I&#x27;ve used is dead.</li>
            <li> It arrived in great shape and all barrels heated up properly.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling wand and anyone looking for a cheaper alternative to the nume wands should definitely check this one out!</li>
            <li> idk anything about curling irons, but I do know some things about happy women, If youre looking for a lady gift, look no further!</li>
            <li> I get great curls that last all night.</li>
            <li> I used them every single day and had beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> Took kinda long to get here but its great, it heats up fast and does amazing curls.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a quick, easy way to great looking long hair.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and it gives you a nice natural waves result.</li>
            <li> She not only loves doing her own hair but does her moms and mine as well!</li>
            <li> This is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better then hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I literally got this wand yesterday and today was the first day I was able to use it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it</li>
            <li> She has very fine, straight hair</li>
            <li> I using this with gorgeous results that last through cheer leading routines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about this versatile product</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use curling irons and recently bought a Le Angelique 25mm/1-in clipless curling wand at the bargain and was amazed at how easy it was!</li>
            <li> First of all because of the changeable barrels (I had read that they broke easily), and the price (</li>
            <li> Gets extremely hot, easy to burn yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to let my daughter spend this much of her own money on a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> They were super helpful and quick.</li>
            <li> All it took was one time to be burned to learn that pretty quickly!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since purchased the Cortex 4-in-1 and have used it more in the last month than I ever used the Bellezza in a year and love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve posted pictures for comparison in the customer images galleries - I urge you to take a quick look before you purchase in case</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing this and some people said that it broke really quick..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, but be prepared to need practice:)</li>
            <li> It reachs high temps and creates sexy curls and waves.</li>
            <li> , ships very fast !</li>
            <li> Very hot and takes time to get used to it,</li>
            <li> The temp gets very hot in just a matter of seconds</li>
            <li> a fantastic mom who takes a lot of time doing my girl&#x27;s hair before school, when really its super easy and pretty fast!!</li>
            <li> Perfect long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to switch between wands, and it has more than enough heat to make the curls stay (I like setting to 380).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy and fast too.</li>
            <li> Its fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think this curling iron will be fabulous once I really learn how to use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for traveling and everyday basis</li>
            <li> its nice to have interchangeable diff sized barrels especially for me because i wear extensions.</li>
            <li> it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but so worth it.</li>
            <li> The different sizes are really nice</li>
            <li> I rarely give any product 5 stars but based on cost and ease of use etc</li>
            <li> Heats up way fast and love the 4 differing rods that allow for so much diversity in the way my hair can look.</li>
            <li> I ended returning it only because I realized I didn&#x27;t need it, but liked how you could change the size and had no problem with that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of wands and curling irons and this is by far the BEST.i love the versatility of the attachments.</li>
            <li> Works good, only complain I have is that the biggest barrel wouldn&#x27;t fit after 1 month, other than that is okay</li>
            <li> I love it easy to you quick to do your whole head and curls last all day!  </li>
            <li> The glove is a must because it gets hot quick.</li>
            <li> It gets SO hot so quickly and it HOLDS.</li>
            <li> i dont recomend this just because the original manufacture were very irresponsible.</li>
            <li> Product is great looks good just very very difficult to change out.</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> Nicely boxed and lightweight- for as much as you&#x27;ll be curling, plastic wherever possible reduces hand fatigue.</li>
            <li> In addition to being quick (heats up fast AND requires minimum time to get those curls), I see my split ends disappearing.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was in a rush and didn&#x27;t hold the wand on my hair as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair</li>
            <li> It shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> I am always receiving complements on how pretty my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I figured this out within the first 60 secs of opening this.</li>
            <li> You definitely with love the curls it gives you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this exactly 3 months ago and now it reads an \\&quot;err\\&quot; on the LCD screen and won&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> the first time I changed the wand the clip that holds the wand in place</li>
            <li> When I first got my curling wand set</li>
            <li> I have the same style curling iron in a different size, made by a different company, and it works great!  </li>
            <li> First thing I wanted to do was try it, but it took me 15 minutes to try to figure out how to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much, Belleza!</li>
            <li> I think what she likes most is the 4 different options.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact size that I needed.</li>
            <li> Curls seem to hold much better than with a regular iron.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of different sizes.</li>
            <li> I love that you can set the temperature on this wand very low.</li>
            <li> This means I can style my costume wigs, even the ones that aren&#x27;t traditionally heat safe.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not such a fan of the tapered one, but some girls love the look it gives.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I love how there are four different sized curling irons included so that you can create many different styles.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously I do not need TWO 1-inchers and only 1.25-inch for $20 bucks more.</li>
            <li> when removing the barrel you have to make sure to remove it from the bottom and not the actual barrel itself you might end up breaking it</li>
            <li> I love all the different size attachment.</li>
            <li> so i contacted AMAZON and ofcourse they told me to ship it back immediately with no cost to me :)  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to not have to buy several curling wands and have a bunch of cords I love it.</li>
            <li> It works great heats up fast, and the curls stay in my hair for at least 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I love how it has four different sizes and soo much cheaper than one you buy in the mall.</li>
            <li> and im ready to oder some other things my daughter still needs some more stuff!</li>
            <li> item arrived very quickly, was easy to operate and took just a little while to learn how to handle and achieve desired results.  </li>
            <li> wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;1.The electric cord is long, some people don&#x27;t like the electric cord to be long but for me it&#x27;s excellent because that way I don&#x27;t have to be struggling with the short one.</li>
            <li> The iron gets really hot for fast curls.</li>
            <li> fast!&lt;br /&gt;It has a real temp control so it tells to how hot it</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect to be able to keep all the wands in the box organized for a long amount of time.  </li>
            <li> So far I have only used one size barrell, but I have used it several times, and it works great.</li>
            <li> cheaply made and didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> only 430&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 4 irons , easy to take off and on .</li>
            <li> but by the 3rd time I used it, it was easy.</li>
            <li> I have used my curling iron numerous times, and it doesn&#x27;t take a long time for it to heat up, and I always get good results when I use it.</li>
            <li> and then some, even with the large barrel.</li>
            <li> They come in different sizes so different for many occasions!</li>
            <li> The glove is a nice touch although ironically using it makes me put my fingers a little TOO close</li>
            <li> I dont really know the measurements</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very scared to change the barrels, because I thought that I would break them.</li>
            <li> If you are careful you will be able to change them.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bellezza 4 in one</li>
            <li> it really is a steal.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> She went out and bought this very one.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve just not used it that much.</li>
            <li> &amp; I really like that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them often because curling is very time consuming whether with an iron or the wand.</li>
            <li> With that being said, it works very well</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to buy this curling iron!</li>
            <li> but i dont have much use for it since i cut my hair.</li>
            <li> but the curl does not hold very well for me.</li>
            <li> Still trying to figure out how to style my hair with it, but that&#x27;s not really a product issue :)</li>
            <li> I really thought, since it wasnt hundreds of dollars that it would be a dud.</li>
            <li> I do love the idea of having multiple barrels but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my curl like my old curling iron...</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t complained about it, so this is a good sign.</li>
            <li> I gave my first one to my sister , and ordered myself a new one.</li>
            <li> Love the glove that it comes in because I use it for other heating products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten such good curls and this is an affordable version of other products I&#x27;ve thought of buying!</li>
            <li> I wish the seller disclosed that particular detail.</li>
            <li> I love that each wand has a different effect for a different look.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend a silicone heat mat to place them on since they reach close to 450 degrees.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, they were a little more wavy than curly</li>
            <li> The only thing to watch out for is that it is very easy to burn yourself with this product so BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> (Everyone should read, because normally nobody ever does.)&lt;br /&gt;4.Registration</li>
            <li> Normally I would take about 30 minutes to curl my hair and using the Bellezza 4</li>
            <li> Meaning you can use it on either your right or left.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use and you only have to hold your hair around the iron for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> if I knew where to send it to get a new product.  </li>
            <li> But I decided to go for it, because I needed a new curling iron/wand.</li>
            <li> so looks like I need to look for a new wand.</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly, it was a bit difficult to change the wands but other than that it WAS great.</li>
            <li> the product arrived on time, however the material of the iron is low quality, ceramic does not damage your hair and this iron did exactly that to my hair</li>
            <li> I am really excited to try out different styles with the different wand sizes.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I had separately purchased and they were the exact same size.</li>
            <li> what do you know, the exact same size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it got really hot and all of a sudden it just stop working .&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of coordination to curl your hair, but once I figured the system, it was easy.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m being cheap, but I&#x27;ve had some hair appliances that have lasted a lot longer than a year that I paid a lot less for.</li>
            <li> It was only at 350 and I was able to achieve beachy waves in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I suggest anyone who has given up on using their life warranty this product promises to just contact Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised.  </li>
            <li> The product was shipped to my doorstep one day early.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my 18 year old daughter and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much of a problem changing the different irons.</li>
            <li> The old ones are slower to heat up.</li>
            <li> My wife is a professional makeup artist/hair stylist and has both sets.  </li>
            <li> and my curls dont last as much like when I use my sultra one</li>
            <li> Couple of things, the ends are difficult to change out, and it does not come with good instructions on how to do this.  </li>
            <li> I had recently tried one other Bellezza curling iron at the mall and that one was very smooth and the curl lasted til the next day.</li>
            <li> $80 seems a high price to pay for a curling iron that only works for 3 months.</li>
            <li> For a small price difference the Cortex in a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> but the two buttons that releases the attachment were hard to press and won&#x27;t release as easily as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Curling Iron Operating Instructions, Features and Benefits, General Safety Instructions, Styling Tips, Care and Maintenance, and Guarantee and Warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the real test was how long it would last.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m past the 30 day period, I can&#x27;t return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I took the broken plastic piece out of the hole and was able to maneuver the iron so it stayed on.  </li>
            <li> so i can do my sexy vic secret hair once again.</li>
            <li> While I do not know what my other curler goes up to, I can say this one did not get hot enough to even curl my hair!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it does what I want it to and other times not so much.</li>
            <li> Hard-to-curl hair is easily curled as long as the layer is not too thick.</li>
            <li> My super thick and long hair was completely curled within twenty minutes, which is never the case.</li>
            <li> It really does heat up in less than 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get the hang of without burning yourself, but what good is an iron that dies after two uses?</li>
            <li> It takes about 1 min for iron to heat up, and few mins to cool down.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing that gives such a non frizzy and long lasting curl.</li>
            <li> Second of all I have long hair, my hair length is to my butt.</li>
            <li> is that you dont have to wait such a long time to get that perfect,nice curl</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold curl long enough not even 2 hours</li>
            <li> It does not have a clip that will allow to hold hair tips, so it can be used for long hair only.</li>
            <li> First of all the Bellezza 4 came in sooner than expected YAYYY!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a bit of a problem for me because first off, I was only half way done with my hair when it decided to give out, and secondly because even though it&#x27;s not as expensive as some, I thought it would have lasted longer for being a higher end curling</li>
            <li> She tried to use it a few times but with little success.</li>
            <li> One has super thick hair and the other has one has thinner hair.</li>
            <li> They last long too!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 4 in one and received a single wand in a different brand.</li>
            <li> At first when looking at the box it came in, I was a little discourage because of the box was a little beat up.</li>
            <li> I absolutely suggest this curling iron set if you have a hard time keeping curls in your hair.</li>
            <li> Works well on long hair.</li>
            <li> and I get asked if my long waves are extensions all the time.</li>
            <li> if you have long hair do yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> if you have long hair you will LUV this product.  </li>
            <li> and you dont need to hold the hair around the wand for a long time either.</li>
            <li> I also wore long sleeves and was extra careful around the neck, forehead and ears area to avoid burns.  </li>
            <li> took me a little while to figure out how to turn it on, and the different wands are hard to switch in and out at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m going to buy a new one, not sure I&#x27;ll go with the same brand just because I want something that will last me a little longer than a year.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a couple other users had the same problem that I did.</li>
            <li> Mu daughter has very long hair</li>
            <li> was contemplating whether to just buy another single 32mm wand from Le Angelique or this set where I will also get the 1.5-in (I wasn&#x27;t planning on using the 1/2-1-in or 3/4-in</li>
            <li> Loose curls, tit curls, beach curls, etc.</li>
            <li> A day and a half later, my hair was STILL wavy!  </li>
            <li> this was it, it took me less than 30 minutes to curl my entire head.</li>
            <li> Being half asian, my hair DOES NOT curl nor even hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> Never got the glove down, but I think that&#x27;s a personal problem; never really have issues with it.</li>
            <li> It was a little different than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> The barrels are a little bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> , I have A LOT of hair, very thick, and straight.</li>
            <li> but it makes it harder to use.</li>
            <li> All the other ones work but just not the one I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clipless digital set with 4 barrels, ranging from a small barrel to a cone shaped to a jumbo barrel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reserving the other star for longevity of this product.  </li>
            <li> She keeps the Amika in her location bag and the other in the studio.  </li>
            <li> From tight curls, loose curls, and waves this curler</li>
            <li> The only problem with the wand that I&#x27;ve recieved is a small black line where the screen doesn&#x27;t work that overlaps the temperature number, but it won&#x27;t bother me if it stays that size.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Only thing I would say negative is; you need to be very careful, I have burned my hand and fingers and it only takes a second.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the items work, my only issue is switching out the sizes, its really hard to take off..</li>
            <li> However now the wand turns off when ever I turn it upside down.</li>
            <li> I used the glove in the beginning while I was getting the hang of it, now I&#x27;m just careful and know where to put my fingers and how to roll my hair and keep it away for my skin!!</li>
            <li> The only thing to complain about is that it&#x27;s a little hard changing the sizes.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe that it goes to 410 because my flat iron it set to 380 and that works like a champ!  </li>
            <li> Product stopped working less than a month after return window ended.  </li>
            <li> I had it for less than a year.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you are tired of your curls falling out after a couple hours!</li>
            <li> It works really well for long hair,  but its really hard to use on short :(  </li>
            <li> Longer than 20 seconds for tight curls</li>
            <li> Push down the two black buttons while you take it off and hold the same buttons down and align the wand size you want to the pins and groove and secure it to the base!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have very long thick hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s price i didnt want to be left in the dark with a broken wand.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have two little girls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to get off and on the barrels</li>
            <li> A little aggreavated because of</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product and i am not very impressed at all.</li>
            <li> first I was a very skeptical about buying the Bellezza 4 in One.</li>
            <li> It was was imposible to contact the seller or the manufacturer of the wand, not even the customer service on amazon could find the contact info so even though I had bought this back in March of 2013, they refunded me the money for the broken wand.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had trouble curling my hair.  </li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a curling iron with a clamp for a few years now and decided it was time for a change.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $80.00, and since I didn&#x27;t notice that it was a dud until after the 90 day return period, I lost out on my money.</li>
            <li> Bellezza Bza4in1 Curling Iron is half of the price of the Amika Triple (3) Barrel Pro-Curler Set!  </li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;I want to return the item because is not working anymore, or at least change it for other one tht</li>
            <li> Then last month the entire clasp thing that attaches the barrels to the iron base broken entirely so now the whole thing is useless.</li>
            <li> hard to use, not worth the money...</li>
            <li> There are very few days that I HAVEN&#x27;T used this since I got it, and I have owned it for a few months now.</li>
            <li> smallest, small, medium, and big.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and well no more Bellezza 4.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it stopped working properly and whenever the wand was picked up, it would shut itself off.</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable for the quality of this iron.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5 star rating because it appeared to be a quality product at an unbelievable price.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure about the brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if shes used it or not yet.</li>
            <li> Needless to say this one is going back</li>
            <li> The attachment was hard to remove; maybe I have received a defective one</li>
            <li> I have burned myself, but that is just because I am a clumsy person at times.</li>
            <li> Some ppl complained before about no directions.</li>
            <li> and it sucks at turning on .</li>
            <li> it takes FOREVER to heat up and it&#x27;s close to impossible to keep the  entire strand of hair wrapped around it without getting a fish tail ( end not curling).</li>
            <li> but mine came broken returned 😐</li>
            <li> and then i was let down and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of different curling rods, and this is probably the worst I&#x27;ve used so far, but not absoluteky terrible.</li>
            <li> Sorry if there are any grammar or spelling mistakes.</li>
            <li> So it is practically useless.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t anything I could do to make the error message go away and the wand and all of the attachments are now useless.</li>
            <li> Cant believe i waste my money on crap</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have the same boring curls.</li>
            <li> The packaging was wrong but the sticker used to identify the program was the bellezza.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and and wavy</li>
            <li> Awkward to use without holding bar.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy but it was for a client on rush</li>
            <li> I was so afraid I was going to break the pins off by pulling and tugging too hard!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this product and the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> The ceramic rod heats up evenly from base to tip and the box contains every size I would ever use.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that I invested in this product.</li>
            <li> /wand does it all!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!</li>

            <li> Extremely disappointed with this product and the manufacturer.  Product stopped working less than a month after return window ended.  Supposedly has lifetime warranty-- if I knew where to send it to get a new product.  Can&#x27;t figure out where to send it.  The address on the warranty information resulted in me spending $25 to have it returned to me.  So I&#x27;m out $25 and still don&#x27;t have a working curling rod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time and money.  Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> I like reviews that are very detailed. Sorry if there are any grammar or spelling mistakes. Hope my review helps :)&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a very skeptical about buying the Bellezza 4 in One. First of all because of the changeable barrels (I had read that they broke easily), and the price (because I didn&#x27;t know if it was going to be a good buy or not). Second of all I have long hair, my hair length is to my butt. But I decided to go for it, because I needed a new curling iron/wand. First of all the Bellezza 4 came in sooner than expected YAYYY!!!!! Meaning I could use it ASAP!!! I opened it up it up and behold was the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. The curling iron with the four different size barrels. Sizes I dont really know the measurements and it doesn&#x27;t say but here&#x27;s how I can describe them: smallest, small, medium, and big.&lt;br /&gt;2. The Heat Protecting glove. (Which is Ambidextrous!!! Meaning you can use it on either your right or left. Which is AWESOME!!)&lt;br /&gt;3.Paper with Important Safety Instructions. (Everyone should read, because normally nobody ever does.)&lt;br /&gt;4.Registration And Warranty Form. (You have 90 days to mail from date purchased to receive the warranty, plus you have to mail the receipt to show when you bought it. Or you can go to their website and register it online)&lt;br /&gt;5.A Bellezza Pamphlet which provides information on: Curling Iron Operating Instructions, Features and Benefits, General Safety Instructions, Styling Tips, Care and Maintenance, and Guarantee and Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;6. A Bellezza Sticker!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful!!!&lt;br /&gt;1.The electric cord is long, some people don&#x27;t like the electric cord to be long but for me it&#x27;s excellent because that way I don&#x27;t have to be struggling with the short one. It heats up very quickly!!!!&lt;br /&gt;2.It heats up to 410. I have not tried it till 410, the farthest I have done is 390. I have burned myself, but that is just because I am a clumsy person at times. I do use the glove and it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;3.What I love about the Bellezza 4 is that you dont have to wait such a long time to get that perfect,nice curl it&#x27;s just a matter of seconds to get it. Normally I would take about 30 minutes to curl my hair and using the Bellezza 4 it takes me 15 minutes!!! And it has enough space to curl all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;4.Changing the Barrels. In a review I had read that they broke or snapped and well no more Bellezza 4. Honestly I dont think thats true. I was very scared to change the barrels, because I thought that I would break them. So what I did I went on you tube and watched some videos to see how you changed them. If you are careful you will be able to change them. When changing them I do recommend that with one hand you press the two side buttons, you grab the barrel from the end and not from the barrel itself and pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;5. Curls. I&#x27;ve tried every barrel and my results are always beautiful curls!! I am always receiving complements on how pretty my hair looks. From tight curls, loose curls, and waves this curler/wand does it all!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed!! I know I&#x27;m not!! A very good buy!!!</li>
            <li> the product arrived on time, however the material of the iron is low quality, ceramic does not damage your hair and this iron did exactly that to my hair it damaged adn burns your hair! so discusted with it!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing. This is my second one. I gave my first one to my sister , and ordered myself a new one. The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a quick, easy way to great looking long hair. I definitely found it. Thanks Bellezza 4 in one</li>
            <li> I love the versatile nature with the interchangeable wands. How do you switch them? Push down the two black buttons while you take it off and hold the same buttons down and align the wand size you want to the pins and groove and secure it to the base! Some ppl complained before about no directions. I figured this out within the first 60 secs of opening this. The glove is a nice touch although ironically using it makes me put my fingers a little TOO close so I do better without it. You definitely with love the curls it gives you. It&#x27;s not meant to replace a roller set per se but it obviously is a great upgrade for curling iron users! Last I checked they don&#x27;t make those interchangeable! Happy styling everyone!</li>
            <li> Great curling iron!!! Took kinda long to get here but its great, it heats up fast and does amazing curls. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for a year.  Works every time.  Does a nice job.</li>
            <li> this curling iron is awesome!!!  it really is a steal. i saw it on another web site for $250. and that was supposed to be a sale price. its nice to have interchangeable diff sized barrels especially for me because i wear extensions. this product helps me achieve the look I&#x27;m going for everytime!</li>
            <li> I purchased this exactly 3 months ago and now it reads an \\&quot;err\\&quot; on the LCD screen and won&#x27;t heat up. It has never been dropped or damaged. $80 seems a high price to pay for a curling iron that only works for 3 months. Since I&#x27;m past the 30 day period, I can&#x27;t return it for a full refund. I&#x27;ve tried calling their customer service number multiple times with no answer. I tried e-mailing them as well and never heard back. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is really great. Get those same curls the stylists give you at the salon. Works well on long hair. The only thing to watch out for is that it is very easy to burn yourself with this product so BE CAREFUL. As you practice it gets easier to use. Love it!</li>
            <li> heated up Awesome BUT!.. the first time I changed the wand the clip that holds the wand in place broke... PLASTIC???? come on.. this thing works great except the clips should be metal!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! OUT $80.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is very easy to use. If you use the glove u shouldnt burn ur hand as I do often</li>
            <li> I absolutely suggest this curling iron set if you have a hard time keeping curls in your hair. I have tried every type of curling iron and products to try and hold my curls all day, nothing has worked until this. I don&#x27;t have to use any product and the curls stay in while I am jumping around at work with kids.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to let my daughter spend this much of her own money on a curling iron.  She has very fine, straight hair and it never holds a curl, no matter what we have tried.  I thought this would be the same.  I have to say, I am impressed and a bit puzzled as to why this one works!  She will curl it up in the morning and when she gets home from school, it is still adorable and curly as ever.  It works!!</li>
            <li> Works good, only complain I have is that the biggest barrel wouldn&#x27;t fit after 1 month, other than that is okay has lasted almost 2 years now.</li>
            <li> This wand was amazing for the first couple of months. However now the wand turns off when ever I turn it upside down. So it is practically useless. The box says it has a lifetime warranty but I can&#x27;t reach the company.</li>
            <li> When I first got my curling wand set I was ecstatic. It worked great and the different wand attachments were amazing. I used them every single day and had beautiful waves. However, after only 3 months of use, my LED screen read &amp;#34;ERR&amp;#34; and the wand wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all. There wasn&#x27;t anything I could do to make the error message go away and the wand and all of the attachments are now useless. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> once you get this curling wand you will never want to use another curling iron again. i did 6 girls&#x27; hair for a wedding with this, and it was sooo convenient to just slap on a different size wand when i needed it. I ended over-curling a girls hair because the curl held so well. I threw out ALL of my curling irons after getting this wand. :)</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my younger sister. She loved it and used it all the time. Unfortunately, it stopped working properly and whenever the wand was picked up, it would shut itself off. I noticed a couple other users had the same problem that I did. It was was imposible to contact the seller or the manufacturer of the wand, not even the customer service on amazon could find the contact info so even though I had bought this back in March of 2013, they refunded me the money for the broken wand. I suggest anyone who has given up on using their life warranty this product promises to just contact Amazon directly. They were super helpful and quick.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and bought this iron and it is GREAT. Infact I bought two, one for the salon and one for my daughter. The price is unbelievable for the quality of this iron. The iron gets really hot for fast curls. Comes with glove so you will not burn yourself.. Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> cheaply made and didn&#x27;t get hot enough.  it kept turning off and smelled like it was burning.  nice box.  heard about these and wanted to try it but it is tricky with trying not to burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had trouble curling my hair.  Even when I did manage to curl it, it never lasted.  Then my best friend and I heard of these curling wands.  She purchased the identical 4 in One by Fahrenheit and we tried it out.  Without even using any hair products to aid the curls, my hair curled beautifully.  I was so surprised.  But the real test was how long it would last.  A day and a half later, my hair was STILL wavy!  I was immediately sold and found this great deal on the wand from Bellezza.  It just got here about an hour ago and I&#x27;ve already plugged it up and used it!  The only problem with the wand that I&#x27;ve recieved is a small black line where the screen doesn&#x27;t work that overlaps the temperature number, but it won&#x27;t bother me if it stays that size.  I can still read the number.  The wand arrived very quickly and in excellent packaging.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be better. I do love the idea of having multiple barrels but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my curl like my old curling iron... Which kind of disappoints me so  I guess I will just go back to the gold platted iron..</li>
            <li> I have the same style curling iron in a different size, made by a different company, and it works great!  My hair will curl and hold for days!  I bought this to have the larger size.  It says the temperature goes up to 410*.  While I do not know what my other curler goes up to, I can say this one did not get hot enough to even curl my hair!  I find it hard to believe that it goes to 410 because my flat iron it set to 380 and that works like a champ!  Overall, the concept is great, but it just doesn&#x27;t curl.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped to my doorstep one day early.  I was very excited about that.  First thing I wanted to do was try it, but it took me 15 minutes to try to figure out how to turn it on.  Please hold onto the button when turning on!  I didn&#x27;t know this until I logged back onto Amazon and found some helpful reviews.  Anyway, I have very long thick hair and I didn&#x27;t have to set the iron to 410.  It was only at 350 and I was able to achieve beachy waves in less than 10 minutes.  I am really excited to try out different styles with the different wand sizes.  Thank you so much, Belleza!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my niece and she loves it! She not only loves doing her own hair but does her moms and mine as well! I think what she likes most is the 4 different options. Totally recommend.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Be sure to use the glove that comes with it!</li>
            <li> Best curling iron ever! have been satisfied since i purchased the product and recommend that anyone who is hesitant about purchasing it shouldn&#x27;t be.  it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It was a little different than I had anticipated. My hair is a little frizzy. I had recently tried one other Bellezza curling iron at the mall and that one was very smooth and the curl lasted til the next day. My sister loves this one a lot though. She went out and bought this very one.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 18 year old daughter and she loves it.  She likes that she can interchange the barrel size.</li>
            <li> This is so worth it! I have two little girls. One has super thick hair and the other has one has thinner hair. There are very few days that I HAVEN&#x27;T used this since I got it, and I have owned it for a few months now. The curls stay in all day without the aid of any hairspray. It heats up super fast. One of the best investments E-V-E-R! It makes me look like Im a fantastic mom who takes a lot of time doing my girl&#x27;s hair before school, when really its super easy and pretty fast!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ! Great price ! , Great quality ! , ships very fast ! , overall happy ! , but it says it goes up to 450 but only 430&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 4 irons , easy to take off and on . if you worried about buying this cause you think it wont work for you ! dont be ,&lt;br /&gt;it curls beautifully !</li>
            <li> just worked once, and that&#x27;s it. :(&lt;br /&gt;I want to return the item because is not working anymore, or at least change it for other one tht it works</li>
            <li> Awkward to use without holding bar. Gets extremely hot, easy to burn yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will be handy to have the variety of sizes of rod, I&#x27;ve just not used it that much.</li>
            <li> One of the curling iron heads don&#x27;t work at all. It&#x27;s the exact size that I needed. All the other ones work but just not the one I needed.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this curling wand until it stopped working a few months in........It would not heat up. Very disappointed that I invested in this product.</li>
            <li> my FAVORITE curling iron my favorite hair styling tool i love my wand love love love it! makes like the perfect curls for any occasion and SO easy to use, love them love love love :D</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the wands can be changed, however its dificult to remove. Also the handle feels like cheap plastic. When I&#x27;m trying to remove the wand, feels like the handle will break.</li>
            <li> I think this curling iron will be fabulous once I really learn how to use it.  Curls seem to hold much better than with a regular iron.  Highly recommend, but be prepared to need practice:)</li>
            <li> I love this product. The barrels are a little bigger than I thought. But I wear my curls for minimum of 4 days and they always look great. Never got the glove down, but I think that&#x27;s a personal problem; never really have issues with it.</li>
            <li> The temperature doesnt even work at times . It doesnt give me the good curls i want and it sucks at turning on . Cant believe i waste my money on crap</li>
            <li> hard to use, not worth the money...I thought this product would be better... doesn&#x27;t hold curl long enough not even 2 hours</li>
            <li> Best curling iron ever. Love the glove that it comes in because I use it for other heating products. Don&#x27;t regret!</li>
            <li> We purchased 2 of these.  Me and my 15 y.o. Daughter.  We both love them.  Mu daughter has very long hair and it keeps a curl in her hair.  She is a competitive cheerleader, each competition her and her friend are both I using this with gorgeous results that last through cheer leading routines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a cheerleader, my hair is almost to my bra in the back, level in front.  I get beautiful, full curls every time I use the wand.  I admit it is tricky to get used to using a glove instead of a clamp like curling irons have.  But I figured it out, and always get compliments when I curl my hair from perfect strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh!!!!  The shine!!!!  It brings it beautiful shine in the curls as well.  I&#x27;d definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s easy to use! &amp; I really like that I change the size of the curls depending on the look I want!  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is so great! The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe the results. Finally i had achieved the &amp;#34;loose curl&amp;#34; look I had so desired!</li>
            <li> At first when looking at the box it came in, I was a little discourage because of the box was a little beat up. This product is great and it heats up well. I love the fact that you get four Curling Irons in one.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! I was soooooo excited to use it and it works perfectly I haven&#x27;t had any problems yet! It&#x27;s a little tricky to get off and on the barrels but so worth it. It&#x27;s great for traveling and everyday basis</li>
            <li> Works awesome. ..took me a little while to figure out how to turn it on, and the different wands are hard to switch in and out at first. After I figured it out I loved it!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5 star rating because it appeared to be a quality product at an unbelievable price.  However I had to return it because it&#x27;s not for short hair.</li>
            <li> It works great! I love the idea of different sizes. However I wish the smallest one was smaller for when you have a short style. Very convenient to not have to buy several curling wands and have a bunch of cords I love it. The temp gets perfect.</li>
            <li> this is not for me.  I thought it would be better then hot rollers.  But it is good. Maybe if I play with it more.</li>
            <li> Works great! Very hot and takes time to get used to it, but by the 3rd time I used it, it was easy. Hair stays curly all day.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail and it is the most amazing thing ever its nice that it comes with a glove to.In case your just learning how to use it.The different sizes are really nice so you don&#x27;t have the same boring curls.This curling iron is so good it keeps your curls in and it heats up instantly i love it and it helps me do my cute hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use a regular curling iron, so I decided to try this. What a relief it&#x27;s easy and the curls are flawless. I don&#x27;t use them often because curling is very time consuming whether with an iron or the wand. Great product well worth it.</li>
            <li> Product is great looks good just very very difficult to change out. In fact I can&#x27;t get mine apart so looks like I need to look for a new wand.</li>
            <li> Had it for 8 months, was using it this morning and it just turned off and now it&#x27;s dead. I&#x27;ve never dropped it or mishandled it in any way. While it worked it was fantastic. It heated up quickly, it was a bit difficult to change the wands but other than that it WAS great. Now I&#x27;m pissed that the best curling wand I&#x27;ve used is dead.</li>
            <li> This is the only curling iron I have ever used that actually holds curls all day. By the end of the day, they were a little more wavy than curly but they stilled looked great. It is super easy to use and you only have to hold your hair around the iron for a few seconds. I would highly recommend if you are tired of your curls falling out after a couple hours!</li>
            <li> I really loved this curling iron.  It works great heats up fast, and the curls stay in my hair for at least 2 days.  I have very straight hair, that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl with a regular curling iron.  I didn&#x27;t have much of a problem changing the different irons. I did drop it on my carpet one day and the plastic piece on the inside that holds the iron in place, broke.  I took the broken plastic piece out of the hole and was able to maneuver the iron so it stayed on.  It still worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the iron died on me today.  I had it for less than a year.  This was the difference between me giving 4 stars and 5 stars.  This was a bit of a problem for me because first off, I was only half way done with my hair when it decided to give out, and secondly because even though it&#x27;s not as expensive as some, I thought it would have lasted longer for being a higher end curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m going to buy a new one, not sure I&#x27;ll go with the same brand just because I want something that will last me a little longer than a year.  Maybe I&#x27;m being cheap, but I&#x27;ve had some hair appliances that have lasted a lot longer than a year that I paid a lot less for.</li>
            <li> This iron set is great! It&#x27;s a clipless digital set with 4 barrels, ranging from a small barrel to a cone shaped to a jumbo barrel. It arrived in great shape and all barrels heated up properly. Don&#x27;t force the heads; they&#x27;ll get easier the more you switch them. I would highly recommend a silicone heat mat to place them on since they reach close to 450 degrees. Comes with a glove, manual and registration card. Nicely boxed and lightweight- for as much as you&#x27;ll be curling, plastic wherever possible reduces hand fatigue. well built; I&#x27;m looking forward to using it during prom &amp; wedding season. Plus it will take the place of several clip irons, reducing clutter. The old ones are slower to heat up.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I like this product! They shipped it quick too! I would recommend this to everyone! Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> 6/2013 Update:  My daughter has used this for herself and her posse of friends since my 2011 purchase.  I&#x27;m confident now to upgrade the rating to 5 stars.  Happy styling!&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;This item arrived very quickly, was easy to operate and took just a little while to learn how to handle and achieve desired results.  I do agree that it takes some maneuvering to make sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself or the the person on whom you are using this. I used dollar store, winter/knit glove and it worked just fine.  I also wore long sleeves and was extra careful around the neck, forehead and ears area to avoid burns.  All it took was one time to be burned to learn that pretty quickly!  All in all, a really good product.  I rarely give any product 5 stars but based on cost and ease of use etc, it&#x27;s very good.  I&#x27;m reserving the other star for longevity of this product.  It&#x27;s not cheap so I would hope it would last a while.</li>
            <li> Bellezza Bza4in1 Curling Iron is half of the price of the Amika Triple (3) Barrel Pro-Curler Set!  My wife is a professional makeup artist/hair stylist and has both sets.  She keeps the Amika in her location bag and the other in the studio.  If the quality holds up the Bellezza 4 barrel is a \\&quot;steal\\&quot; for only $85.  She is very happy with it.  Now only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My wife has used this frequently now for 4 months and still working great. Still very pleased.</li>
            <li> Was nervous about ordering but turned out to be amazing! I&#x27;ve never gotten such good curls and this is an affordable version of other products I&#x27;ve thought of buying! This is definitely worth the money!! In love!!</li>
            <li> I love that you can set the temperature on this wand very low. This means I can style my costume wigs, even the ones that aren&#x27;t traditionally heat safe.  The ceramic rod heats up evenly from base to tip and the box contains every size I would ever use.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No crimp marks from a traditional iron clamp.  Curls last all day and then some, even with the large barrel. Hard-to-curl hair is easily curled as long as the layer is not too thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a curling iron with a clamp for a few years now and decided it was time for a change. I love these! They come in different sizes so different for many occasions! They last long too! Great curling iron. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great iron, love the different attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change and it heats up fast!&lt;br /&gt;It has a real temp control so it tells to how hot it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I would say negative is; you need to be very careful, I have burned my hand and fingers and it only takes a second.&lt;br /&gt;Please think about this when you are using this on children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the glove works well but it makes it harder to use. I used the glove in the beginning while I was getting the hang of it, now I&#x27;m just careful and know where to put my fingers and how to roll my hair and keep it away for my skin!!</li>
            <li> This is a great curling wand and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who takes is already &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; at doing their hair.  The heat protectant glove is a must for an iron like this.  Couple of things, the ends are difficult to change out, and it does not come with good instructions on how to do this.  Basically you just have to push two end buttons and force it off.  Also, the inside of the box is kinda cheapo so don&#x27;t expect to be able to keep all the wands in the box organized for a long amount of time.  With that being said, it works very well and I get asked if my long waves are extensions all the time.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this product as a gift. She Loves it!! I do not have anything else to say. Bye</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my mom. She tried to use it a few times but with little success. It does not have a clip that will allow to hold hair tips, so it can be used for long hair only. I wish the seller disclosed that particular detail. Money waisted.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! Easy to use, great locks and they may last for 2 days. It takes about 1 min for iron to heat up, and few mins to cool down. Highly recommend to buy this curling iron!</li>
            <li> Perfect long lasting curls. Heats up way fast and love the 4 differing rods that allow for so much diversity in the way my hair can look.</li>
            <li> it takes FOREVER to heat up and it&#x27;s close to impossible to keep the  entire strand of hair wrapped around it without getting a fish tail ( end not curling). if you have long hair do yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T BUY THIS. they don&#x27;t allow you to return it either if it&#x27;s opened, how are you supposed to know if you like it if you can&#x27;t try it?!</li>
            <li> I literally got this wand yesterday and today was the first day I was able to use it. Let me tell you I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Its so great. I am a mother and I wanted something to make my life easier and this was it, it took me less than 30 minutes to curl my entire head. Also this was my very first time even using a wand! I was not sure about the brand but the wand came in this great box with a glove it was amazing! Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 4 in one and received a single wand in a different brand. I was unhappy but it was for a client on rush and she needed to have a wand so i kept it. It was professional but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT! Best curling iron ever! My daughter can do amazing hair styles with this curling iron. She does all her friend&#x27;s Haiti too! Very hot!</li>
            <li> Perfection! I love that each wand has a different effect for a different look. I&#x27;m not such a fan of the tapered one, but some girls love the look it gives. It&#x27;s super easy to switch between wands, and it has more than enough heat to make the curls stay (I like setting to 380). Curls stay for up to two days, and you can always just touch it up if needed. Love it!</li>
            <li> luv this curling rod.  Its my favourite,  but i dont have much use for it since i cut my hair. It works really well for long hair,  but its really hard to use on short :(  I cant wait to grow my hair back so i can do my sexy vic secret hair once again. ;)  if you have long hair you will LUV this product.  tons of heat settings for different hair texture.</li>
            <li> This curling iron set is of exceptional high quality, and it comes in a beautiful keepsake box. I won&#x27;t have to go shopping for curling irons again anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I love how there are four different sized curling irons included so that you can create many different styles.  The curls always look good and stay in for days. This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Works great! It reachs high temps and creates sexy curls and waves. I would recommend this product to others for sure.</li>
            <li> i couldnt be more happy with the bellezza wand. i was just clicks away from purchasing a high-end curling wand with only two attachments for almost 4x the price... SO thankful I went with the bellezza!</li>
            <li> Great but mine came broken returned 😐</li>
            <li> Great product. Its easy to use and change barrel sizes. The glove is a must because it gets hot quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for mothers day. I&#x27;m not sure if shes used it or not yet. She loved it when she seen it. So, i&#x27;ll update you when i here about it.</li>
            <li> The set is really a good one, with many options.  I ended returning it only because I realized I didn&#x27;t need it, but liked how you could change the size and had no problem with that.  Definitely recommended if you are in the market for an iron with size choices!</li>
            <li> I admit I&#x27;ve only used one of the sizes, but it turned out great!  I was pleasantly surprised!  Being half asian, my hair DOES NOT curl nor even hold a curl.  I followed the directions, and then I had something similar to Taylor Swift hair and it lasted all day!  It takes a little bit of coordination to curl your hair, but once I figured the system, it was easy. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> In addition to being quick (heats up fast AND requires minimum time to get those curls), I see my split ends disappearing.  Yippee!</li>
            <li> We ordered the bellezza but received a different iron. The packaging was wrong but the sticker used to identify the program was the bellezza. We will think twice before we order something that may not be mailed to us. Disappointed</li>
            <li> I was scared to buy a curling wand online but after the reviews I went ahead and did it. It came in fast and the packaging was great! This is a great curling wand and anyone looking for a cheaper alternative to the nume wands should definitely check this one out!</li>
            <li> I decided to order the cortex after seeing all the videos on youtube about how great it was. I recently purchased one and it was not working the screen kept saying off and wouldnt turn on after i plugged it in. I attempted this three times by plugging it into different outlets and got the same results. I was so excited to get it and then i was let down and disappointed. This is my second time ordering this product and i am not very impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I like the variety in the rod sizes...but the curl does not hold very well for me. I have used a number of different curling rods, and this is probably the worst I&#x27;ve used so far, but not absoluteky terrible. Its wonderful in comparison to a curling iron, in my opinion, though!</li>
            <li> the items work, my only issue is switching out the sizes, its really hard to take off.. i feel some kind of twist to lock would have worked better.. but they work good, so thats all i ask for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron set.  It help my ends not get fried like a regular curing iron, and I only have to have one curling iron with me instead of 3 full-sized ones. Thanks!</li>
            <li> So far I have only used one size barrell, but I have used it several times, and it works great. I have wavy hair that I most often straighten. After straightening my hair one morning, I decided I wanted curls for the evening, and even on my already straightened hair the curling iron worked, and my waves stayed in tact!</li>
            <li> To be fair, I did not purchase mine from Amazon, however I literally used this TWICE and it never turned on again. What a waste of $80.00, and since I didn&#x27;t notice that it was a dud until after the 90 day return period, I lost out on my money. When it worked, it was fine. A little difficult to get the hang of without burning yourself, but what good is an iron that dies after two uses? I will never buy anything from Belezza again. Total ripoff.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling wand set and loved it...however after only about three uses one of the barrels stopped working and wouldn&#x27;t heat up. Then last month the entire clasp thing that attaches the barrels to the iron base broken entirely so now the whole thing is useless. I&#x27;ve since purchased the Cortex 4-in-1 and have used it more in the last month than I ever used the Bellezza in a year and love it. For a small price difference the Cortex in a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Loved BELLEZZA 4 in One Curling Iron Set with Four Ceramic is fantastic, leaves hair all curly fast. I am very happy and recommend it because it is wonderful. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron thinking that my curls was going to last. I have very thin hair and and wavy and my curls dont last as much like when I use my sultra one</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use curling irons and recently bought a Le Angelique 25mm/1-in clipless curling wand at the bargain and was amazed at how easy it was! I fell in love with clipless curling wands and was in the market for a 32mm/1.25-in for looser curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was contemplating whether to just buy another single 32mm wand from Le Angelique or this set where I will also get the 1.5-in (I wasn&#x27;t planning on using the 1/2-1-in or 3/4-in but always good to have more options!) and I thought for $20 and 3 more options, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I received the set and I was disappointed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The attachment was hard to remove; maybe I have received a defective one but the two buttons that releases the attachment were hard to press and won&#x27;t release as easily as I had hoped. I was so afraid I was going to break the pins off by pulling and tugging too hard!&lt;br /&gt;- The attachments were definitely NOT 1.25 inch and 1.5 inch heads - I compared the \\&quot;1.5 inch\\&quot; head with the 32mm/1.25-in I had separately purchased and they were the exact same size. Compared the \\&quot;1.25 inch\\&quot; head with the 24mm/1-in and what do you know, the exact same size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I do not need TWO 1-inchers and only 1.25-inch for $20 bucks more. Needless to say this one is going back and I will be keeping Le Angelique Curling Iron 32mm (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XQC7AW/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve posted pictures for comparison in the customer images galleries - I urge you to take a quick look before you purchase in case you were looking for big barrels of 1.25-inch and 1.5-inch like me!</li>
            <li> idk anything about curling irons, but I do know some things about happy women, If youre looking for a lady gift, look no further!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews. I have used my curling iron numerous times, and it doesn&#x27;t take a long time for it to heat up, and I always get good results when I use it. I absolutely love this curling iron! The price is the best I could find online. I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> One of many hair paraphernalia that my daughter uses.  I hope she likes it.  She hasn&#x27;t complained about it, so this is a good sign.</li>
            <li> I love it. What can I say apart from that. I went from unruly curly hair to wonderful curls and waves! Everybody comments on it too. I haven&#x27;t felt that it damages my hair either... so, THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> Great price for what you get, comes in a nice box that you can keep the pieces together and organized in.  Still trying to figure out how to style my hair with it, but that&#x27;s not really a product issue :)</li>
            <li> I love it! It gives my hair the perfect curls. It looks so much better than when I used my straightener. It&#x27;s really easy and fast too. I like having the different sized barrels so that I can create different looks. I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!! It fits every need for my hair and I use it all the time! I love how it has four different sizes and soo much cheaper than one you buy in the mall. The only thing to complain about is that it&#x27;s a little hard changing the sizes.</li>
            <li> Ive had this curling iron since before christmas and cannot figure out how to change barrels and it is not shown in instruction manual. Can someone please explain to me how to switch wands to different sizes?</li>
            <li> I love my curling wand, although I admit that I&#x27;ve never used all of the barrels. But they are fairly easy to change and the product itself is very good. It heats up well and retains the same temperature throughout my curling process. I get great curls that last all night.</li>
            <li> i got what i oder on time, good service thank you for everything and im ready to oder some other things my daughter still needs some more stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it easy to you quick to do your whole head and curls last all day!  Dont know how I lived without it before.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever come across!! Just so you know what I am working with, I have A LOT of hair, very thick, and straight. I have used curing irons of all brands and nothing will hold and lock in curls. This is the ONLY thing that gives such a non frizzy and long lasting curl. I cant believe the deal I got for all of this. I really thought, since it wasnt hundreds of dollars that it would be a dud. But WOW, reallly really impressed by this and would highly recommend this wand to all of you! The temp gets very hot in just a matter of seconds and you dont need to hold the hair around the wand for a long time either. Its fast and easy to use. I love love love it!</li>
            <li> works so well . the curls come out perf . good price and so worth the purchase . . .</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing this and some people said that it broke really quick.. idk what you guys are doing with your curling iron but i purchased mine back in March and I switch the barrels out all the time. its still in perfect condition. when removing the barrel you have to make sure to remove it from the bottom and not the actual barrel itself you might end up breaking it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 months with this curling iron and i love it!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about this versatile product</li>
            <li> I love this wand. It shipped very fast. I love all the different size attachment. It really does heat up in less than 60 seconds. My clients love the waves I create with is product.</li>
            <li> I have finicky hair. Sometimes it does what I want it to and other times not so much. The first time I used it I was in a rush and didn&#x27;t hold the wand on my hair as long as I would have liked. It didn&#x27;t matter. My hair curled beautifully and stayed all day! After sleeping that night I still had beautiful curls the next day!!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and it gives you a nice natural waves result.Great for professional use in the salon.</li>
            <li> You can do it all with these. Loose curls, tit curls, beach curls, etc. Longer than 20 seconds for tight curls</li>
            <li> after 1 use  the display started dispalying ERROR in RED... it got really hot and all of a sudden it just stop working .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted BELLAZZA with no luck . i think i spoke to someone once and was told that they&#x27;ll be sending me a prepaid stamp for me to ship the item back to them. I never received anything. A little aggreavated because of it&#x27;s price i didnt want to be left in the dark with a broken wand. so i contacted AMAZON and ofcourse they told me to ship it back immediately with no cost to me :)  i dont recomend this just because the original manufacture were very irresponsible.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and sooo easy to use. The price is great too. YUou receive it before your shippiong date.</li>
            <li> This product is perfection. My super thick and long hair was completely curled within twenty minutes, which is never the case. It gets SO hot so quickly and it HOLDS. The curls lasted all day in the heat and humidity. And the next day, it was like I had just done it. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of wands and curling irons and this is by far the BEST.i love the versatility of the attachments. I love everything about this product.</li>
