    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>the aha is great for a sporadic exfoliant - it helps with blackheads!</li>
            <li>bp is an awesome product!  </li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment is perfect.</li>
            <li>Thank you acne.org for this great product!</li>
            <li>this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li>Stick to it, give it time and use it under make up as well, best of luck to you all</li>
            <li>This was the best decision I ever made.  </li>
            <li>I use this every day and it never irritates my skin, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li>cleanser is great.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes great too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% happy with this product</li>
            <li>so happy.  </li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m happy to say that since I started taking this combo a month ago, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li>And this kit is great.  </li>
            <li>its does a great job of moisturizing and would be great for winter but with summer around the corner</li>
            <li>this lotions has great soothing effect, esp after shaving.  </li>
            <li>its works great, and its great value for the money.  </li>
            <li>This is great because the products go farther</li>
            <li>IT IS IMPORTANT TO MOISTURIZE A LOT!!!</li>
            <li>but the Benz cream is the best part of this kit, great value for amount you get, its a gel not cream so dries clean.  </li>
            <li>I feel as though I did give this regiment a fair shot, I used it for months</li>
            <li>The good thing about this product is that it seems to heal some of my scars well, but my breakouts will not stop.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good job.</li>
            <li>Every time my mom sees me says she can&#x27;t believe how good my face looks</li>
            <li>To hear my mom now tell me how good it looks whenever she sees me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li>I began using this stuff incorrectly because the written instructions were a bit unclear but the tutorial video online helped and now after using it correctly for just over 2 weeks now my skin is better than it has ever been!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Now I LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Truly amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>all the products are fragrance free, which for guy is great, i don&#x27;t need to be smelling like roses and lavender.  </li>
            <li>but I found the cleanser to be amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lotion is nice too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You really do need to use all 3 of these for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I incorporated the benzoyl peroxide treatment from the regiment into my own routine as well as being put on birth control and I am happy to say that I&#x27;m now acne free.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is effective but too emulsive for oily skin</li>
            <li>I kept thinking how can a product this inexpensive be effective.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I started reading the product details &amp; reviews, watched the videos and was truly impressed at the whole presentation.</li>
            <li>the kind of acne that would stay for weeks or months.  </li>
            <li>Best stuff I have used so far</li>
            <li>I wish that it had been around when I was younger and suffering from acne myself--it would have saved me a lot of scars, and I&#x27;m happy that my beautiful daughter won&#x27;t have that happen to her.</li>
            <li>low!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSER: Love, Love, Love!  </li>
            <li>If you do the first 2 steps perfect, but don&#x27;t use this moisturizer, your face will be and look very dry and irritated and you probably won&#x27;t get the best results.</li>
            <li>And I sometimes skipped a day or two without having major breakouts. :D</li>
            <li>I followed everything precisely but somehow came out with even more acne than I had started with?!?</li>
            <li>The treatment bottle is just HUGE!</li>
            <li>more but 1 pump is the maximum amount for me)  </li>
            <li>my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>I could not give it a lesser rating because I am a witness that it has worked excellent for me before I started the Nexplanon implant in May of 2014.</li>
            <li>I love the way it lathers and feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it after it was so much better, and started again</li>
            <li>Just use everything as directed and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>My skin just kept getting better and better without the face peeling and what not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s worked for many but not for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This is better than what any doctor can give you.  </li>
            <li>OILY SKIN PEOPLE WILL LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>but then I started to moisturize more.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it bubbles up--unlike Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>:  This has taken me longer to love.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions, you&#x27;ll need wayyyyyy more face wash than you do with the treatment and lotion.  </li>
            <li>so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill.</li>
            <li>my skin is so much better.</li>
            <li>Than i discovered acne.org and realized that everything i had been doing for acne i was way off, i thought drier is better..</li>
            <li>i thought scrubbing was better.  </li>
            <li>My skins hasnever looked better.  </li>
            <li>so I make sure I order with plenty of time.  </li>
            <li>Just use everything as directed and you&#x27;ll love it.ery dry and irritated and you probably won&#x27;t get the best results.</li>
            <li>At first I loved the product</li>
            <li>The pay off will be huge and you will be so glad you stuck it out.</li>
            <li>My complexion is definitely more smooth and</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions carefully for the best results.</li>
            <li>Other than that PERFECT.</li>
            <li>so it goes on easily without having to rub it in, but it&#x27;s not runny.</li>
            <li>I bought this system when the regiment first came out and was still pretty uncommon</li>
            <li>: Glides on easy.  </li>
            <li>Never had this kind of acne my whole life until that moment.</li>
            <li>cleanser is gentle, but effective in removing makeup.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m acne free</li>
            <li>This is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the detailed version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re important.</li>
            <li>If you are on any birth control that has acne as a side effect or is high in androgen, this product may not be as effective.</li>
            <li>This drug is really strong that&#x27;s taking over my daily mood, thinning hair (good thing</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased so far and am planning to keep this as my regime.</li>
            <li>My first week of using the regimen was ok it did give me that working feeling and the irritation feeling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so excited about the CSR--</li>
            <li>Okay, before I go any further I&#x27;d like to say congratulations to you Mr. Kern, without a doubt your line of products are truly effective.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of all the good things about Cetaphil, but it actually FEELS like you&#x27;re getting your face clean.  </li>
            <li>Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits]] which has helped out with the breakouts on my face which is great considering that because of the medication I&#x27;m on, I break out much more than usual.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the packaging because it leaked oil all over my counter, and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to use it anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleared up the flakes from the BP right away, and now I have such smooth, even, bright, and glowing skin.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found it to be greasy and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, is nice and thin</li>
            <li>but luckily I had my biore pore unclogging scrub</li>
            <li>Quick summary:</li>
            <li>No guarantee, but maybe you&#x27;ll be as lucky as me.</li>
            <li>Those last two showed the best improvement, but my skin only got about 20%</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to purchase replacements as quickly.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I can already feel that it&#x27;s making huge difference for my skin.</li>
            <li>so the cost for me is very reasonable!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge tube of 2.5% benzo, so you can use large amounts like your supposed to.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is very good (but sometimes too delicate to eye make up).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was feed up with acne, so finally bought this regimen because of all the amazing things i&#x27;ve heard about it.</li>
            <li>I have only been using the regime for about a month and am quite happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>I love this so far.</li>
            <li>I should point out that I only got toner and repair lotion and used my own wash.  </li>
            <li>(they know what they&#x27;re talking about, after all) but also listening to your own personal skin type and tailoring it to your needs.</li>
            <li>(If you don&#x27;t get how remarkable that is, you&#x27;re not a true fellow sufferer.)</li>
            <li>and it really works on me!</li>
            <li>But other than that I love this product and I&#x27;ll continue using it!  </li>
            <li>For the first year or so, I tried tons stuff from the store, nothing would work.</li>
            <li>I followed the regimen pretty closely, and within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this out after using many different face cleaners.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ll definitely make more purchases &amp; recommend it also.</li>
            <li>By the next day I was sold : ) my item arrived faster than the date provided which is a plus .</li>
            <li>That helped SO much!</li>
            <li>I use about the size of the top part of my index finger only once a day.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t soak in quickly, which is the main reason I didn&#x27;t like it at first.  </li>
            <li>This worked well in the first month when I wasn&#x27;t using the AHA+ to minimize the flakes.  </li>
            <li>My face is not perfect but its the best ive had ut in years.  </li>
            <li>The products last many months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used numerous other bp products and this is the best one by far.  </li>
            <li>: I love that it has the best ingredients, that it avoids fragrances and other irritating ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been holding off on writing this review because I was positive my face would adjust to the Acne.org Regmin and would go back to the way it was, if not worse, when I started using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t enough good things I can say about Acne.org.  </li>
            <li>This was fantastic for my skin, but I don&#x27;t like taking hormones or medicine in general.  </li>
            <li>and ive tried pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li>felt was excessive dryness to the fact that I was taking Pantothenic Acid capsules which are also good for acne.  </li>
            <li>and my face definitely looks more vibrant in the morning when I use it the night before.  </li>
            <li>Dry skin people will love this.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ll just combine treatment, moisturizer and sunblock - mix it in my palm and gently apply it to my face.</li>
            <li>(the amount really depends if your face really needs</li>
            <li>so I think that really helps to speed up getting rid of my acne.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Unless you have really severe acne, this will work wonders for you and everybody should be using this, trust me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a very greasy forehead where I would need to wipe my forehead as if I was sweating at work.</li>
            <li>so I need an intense routine to keep everything at bay.</li>
            <li>After much research and YouTube reviews I decided to go ahead and give it a try, mind you</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really target them</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m really acne-free.  </li>
            <li>I think the oil really helped the flakes in the beginning.</li>
            <li>A WHOLE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to really like it</li>
            <li>I really think my emerging wrinkles are lessoned, too.</li>
            <li>1- Be really gentle with your skin while using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>very well priced.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is so oily I don&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
            <li>A bit of flakiness is so damn worth how clear your skin will be.</li>
            <li>Seller very uncooperative</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using The Regimen nearly three months now and it keeps getting better, I&#x27;ve also recently added the Glycolic Acid which also improves my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, it&#x27;s not harsh and</li>
            <li>Since my teenage years, I have tried probably close to a hundred different products without success, including Proactiv, Aveeno, Olay, Salacylic Acid, Retin-A, Clearasil, and Oxy clean, &amp; Neutragena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and some days would be okay while others were horrendous, big swollen red acne</li>
            <li>The second step bleaches your skin so quick</li>
            <li>I think I was using too much for my face early on, but Dan DOES recommend using a lot!  </li>
            <li>if you are looking for help with your acne, highly recommend this kit.  </li>
            <li>high end or drugstore acne lines never worked either.  </li>
            <li>Once I applied it on its own after cleansing, it hardly stings at all.  </li>
            <li>the lotion is also ok,  its a bit heavy, meaning i can feel it on my face.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is the most clear and smooth than it has ever been, except for some random large, under the skin lesions.  </li>
            <li>After finally giving up I eventually found the right cleansers, toners and moisturizers that worked for me.</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is a clear gel with no odor!  </li>
            <li>After using this regimine for 5 months, my skin has been clear for weeks at a time!  </li>
            <li>and I still had a few zits pretty much all the time this first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I occasionally get an itty bitty zit, but it has been a couple months since that happened &amp; it cleared up really fast with no scarring!  </li>
            <li>I personally had a huge problem with flaking and dryness (which looks even worse when you put make up on top of it).  </li>
            <li>I went to a dermatologist for my new adult acne.  </li>
            <li>First off i&#x27;m 31yr old Male.  </li>
            <li>Morning  a) 1 pump of cleanser  b) 2 or 3 drops of jojoba oil applied all over my face right after washing and wait for it to dry  c)</li>
            <li>I actually ordered another large kit now to have as spare and wife (no acne problems) loves the lotion and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m several months into using the products, I feel like I can be a little more flexible in my routine.  </li>
            <li>, I was really starting to think my face just reacted badly to all treatment but after using this its been awesome!</li>
            <li>came across these products (from Dan&#x27;s Clear Skin Regimen CSR at Acne.org)</li>
            <li>So, here is my review after months of totally clear skin:</li>
            <li>I may get clean&amp;clean clear lotion for daytime and use this for night time.  </li>
            <li>And once again my Dermatologist told me that it&#x27;s the only option that really works for me.</li>
            <li>So i decided to search for a topical drug that really fights acne and my search engine kept on mentioning acne.org.</li>
            <li>It really works just like 5% benzoyl peroxide but not such aggressive.</li>
            <li>In two weeks my skin is COMPLETLY CLEAR and I have skin of a 8 year old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Morning: Cleanser, Olay Complete Moisturizer SPF 15</li>
            <li>Cleanser, Olay Complete Moisturizer SPF 15</li>
            <li>MONTHS 2-4 - Treatment at night &amp; AHA+ in the morning&lt;br /&gt;Morning: Cleanser, AHA+, Olay Complete Moisturizer, Avon Mineral Make-up&lt;br /&gt;Evening:</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually use as much as Dan recommends, but that works for me.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I am 31 years old</li>
            <li>For me that&#x27;s completely unheard of.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m really thinking about changing is to maybe find a thicker moisturizer for winter.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>If used alone, it WILL dry out your skin pretty</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because everything I tried in the past, I thought Acne.org would just be more of the same.  </li>
            <li>The first two month my face was very dry and almost quit.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have my high school skin back.  </li>
            <li>For me this was particularly important at the beginning month to month and a half, which is the hardest part of starting this product.  </li>
            <li>You can always add a little more to your face if you didn&#x27;t get enough out of the tube/bottle at first, but once you put too much of this stuff on it feels near impossible to cool off your face even after trying to wash it</li>
            <li>When i&#x27;m on vacation or just really in a rush, I&#x27;ll wash my face, apply jojoba oil, then wait for it to dry</li>
            <li>This product works better than Proactive and better than either regimen that two different doctors prescribed--and it&#x27;s much less expensive than what the doctors recommended.  </li>
            <li>, Treatment (again wait 15 mins), Moisturizer without Jojoba oil anymore--I don&#x27;t need it!&lt;br /&gt;Findings: I just can&#x27;t believe that I finally have clear skin!  </li>
            <li>I actually told my friend who&#x27;s also suffering from adult acne about this</li>
            <li>Again, follow the instructions carefully, rub in gently and use a lot and it WILL work</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m starting to get adult acne.  </li>
            <li>if I know I&#x27;m going to spend a lot of time outside), Olay Complete Moisturizer (I skip this if I know I&#x27;ll be inside all day), Avon Mineral Make-up (optional, yay!)&lt;br /&gt;Evening</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Time of the month\\&quot; didn&#x27;t matter, I was always broken out, though I&#x27;m sure hormones and stress were some of the biggest factors.  </li>
            <li>Which leads to 2: your skin will get worse before it gets better</li>
            <li>My face as actually been clear about 5 months now with only 1 pimple</li>
            <li>1 pump, sometimes 1/2 pump of moisturizer + a little bit of sunblock (never really need to put on too much moisturizer because I live in a tropical area where everyday is very hot &amp; humid    </li>
            <li>so using a small amount of all of these products works better for me - I probably use about half the amount they suggest using.</li>
            <li>3- start off SLOW with SMALL amounts of Treament and AHA (if you decide to use it) because it is easy to use too much and feel like your face is going to burn off.  </li>
            <li>you have to slowly build up your skin&#x27;s tolerance to the benzoyl peroxide... and be consistent - no slacking!</li>
            <li>feel like other products in the market dry up my skin too much to the point that can irritate.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> the aha is great for a sporadic exfoliant - it helps with blackheads!</li>
            <li> bp is an awesome product!  </li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment is perfect.</li>
            <li> Thank you acne.org for this great product!</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> Stick to it, give it time and use it under make up as well, best of luck to you all</li>
            <li> This was the best decision I ever made.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day and it never irritates my skin, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> cleanser is great.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes great too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% happy with this product</li>
            <li> so happy.  </li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m happy to say that since I started taking this combo a month ago, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> And this kit is great.  </li>
            <li> its does a great job of moisturizing and would be great for winter but with summer around the corner</li>
            <li> this lotions has great soothing effect, esp after shaving.  </li>
            <li> its works great, and its great value for the money.  </li>
            <li> This is great because the products go farther</li>
            <li> IT IS IMPORTANT TO MOISTURIZE A LOT!!!</li>
            <li> but the Benz cream is the best part of this kit, great value for amount you get, its a gel not cream so dries clean.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though I did give this regiment a fair shot, I used it for months</li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is that it seems to heal some of my scars well, but my breakouts will not stop.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good job.</li>
            <li> Every time my mom sees me says she can&#x27;t believe how good my face looks</li>
            <li> To hear my mom now tell me how good it looks whenever she sees me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> I began using this stuff incorrectly because the written instructions were a bit unclear but the tutorial video online helped and now after using it correctly for just over 2 weeks now my skin is better than it has ever been!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Now I LOVE this!  </li>
            <li> my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> all the products are fragrance free, which for guy is great, i don&#x27;t need to be smelling like roses and lavender.  </li>
            <li> but I found the cleanser to be amazing</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lotion is nice too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You really do need to use all 3 of these for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I incorporated the benzoyl peroxide treatment from the regiment into my own routine as well as being put on birth control and I am happy to say that I&#x27;m now acne free.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is effective but too emulsive for oily skin</li>
            <li> I kept thinking how can a product this inexpensive be effective.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I started reading the product details &amp; reviews, watched the videos and was truly impressed at the whole presentation.</li>
            <li> the kind of acne that would stay for weeks or months.  </li>
            <li> Best stuff I have used so far</li>
            <li> I wish that it had been around when I was younger and suffering from acne myself--it would have saved me a lot of scars, and I&#x27;m happy that my beautiful daughter won&#x27;t have that happen to her.</li>
            <li> low!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSER: Love, Love, Love!  </li>
            <li> If you do the first 2 steps perfect, but don&#x27;t use this moisturizer, your face will be and look very dry and irritated and you probably won&#x27;t get the best results.</li>
            <li> And I sometimes skipped a day or two without having major breakouts. :D</li>
            <li> I followed everything precisely but somehow came out with even more acne than I had started with?!?</li>
            <li> The treatment bottle is just HUGE!</li>
            <li> more but 1 pump is the maximum amount for me)  </li>
            <li> my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> I could not give it a lesser rating because I am a witness that it has worked excellent for me before I started the Nexplanon implant in May of 2014.</li>
            <li> I love the way it lathers and feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it after it was so much better, and started again</li>
            <li> Just use everything as directed and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> My skin just kept getting better and better without the face peeling and what not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s worked for many but not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This is better than what any doctor can give you.  </li>
            <li> OILY SKIN PEOPLE WILL LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> but then I started to moisturize more.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it bubbles up--unlike Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> :  This has taken me longer to love.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions, you&#x27;ll need wayyyyyy more face wash than you do with the treatment and lotion.  </li>
            <li> so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill.</li>
            <li> my skin is so much better.</li>
            <li> Than i discovered acne.org and realized that everything i had been doing for acne i was way off, i thought drier is better..</li>
            <li> i thought scrubbing was better.  </li>
            <li> My skins hasnever looked better.  </li>
            <li> so I make sure I order with plenty of time.  </li>
            <li> Just use everything as directed and you&#x27;ll love it.ery dry and irritated and you probably won&#x27;t get the best results.</li>
            <li> At first I loved the product</li>
            <li> The pay off will be huge and you will be so glad you stuck it out.</li>
            <li> My complexion is definitely more smooth and</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions carefully for the best results.</li>
            <li> Other than that PERFECT.</li>
            <li> so it goes on easily without having to rub it in, but it&#x27;s not runny.</li>
            <li> I bought this system when the regiment first came out and was still pretty uncommon</li>
            <li> : Glides on easy.  </li>
            <li> Never had this kind of acne my whole life until that moment.</li>
            <li> cleanser is gentle, but effective in removing makeup.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m acne free</li>
            <li> This is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the detailed version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re important.</li>
            <li> If you are on any birth control that has acne as a side effect or is high in androgen, this product may not be as effective.</li>
            <li> This drug is really strong that&#x27;s taking over my daily mood, thinning hair (good thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased so far and am planning to keep this as my regime.</li>
            <li> My first week of using the regimen was ok it did give me that working feeling and the irritation feeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so excited about the CSR--</li>
            <li> Okay, before I go any further I&#x27;d like to say congratulations to you Mr. Kern, without a doubt your line of products are truly effective.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of all the good things about Cetaphil, but it actually FEELS like you&#x27;re getting your face clean.  </li>
            <li> Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits]] which has helped out with the breakouts on my face which is great considering that because of the medication I&#x27;m on, I break out much more than usual.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the packaging because it leaked oil all over my counter, and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to use it anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleared up the flakes from the BP right away, and now I have such smooth, even, bright, and glowing skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found it to be greasy and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, is nice and thin</li>
            <li> but luckily I had my biore pore unclogging scrub</li>
            <li> Quick summary:</li>
            <li> No guarantee, but maybe you&#x27;ll be as lucky as me.</li>
            <li> Those last two showed the best improvement, but my skin only got about 20%</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to purchase replacements as quickly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I can already feel that it&#x27;s making huge difference for my skin.</li>
            <li> so the cost for me is very reasonable!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge tube of 2.5% benzo, so you can use large amounts like your supposed to.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very good (but sometimes too delicate to eye make up).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was feed up with acne, so finally bought this regimen because of all the amazing things i&#x27;ve heard about it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the regime for about a month and am quite happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I love this so far.</li>
            <li> I should point out that I only got toner and repair lotion and used my own wash.  </li>
            <li> (they know what they&#x27;re talking about, after all) but also listening to your own personal skin type and tailoring it to your needs.</li>
            <li> (If you don&#x27;t get how remarkable that is, you&#x27;re not a true fellow sufferer.)</li>
            <li> and it really works on me!</li>
            <li> But other than that I love this product and I&#x27;ll continue using it!  </li>
            <li> For the first year or so, I tried tons stuff from the store, nothing would work.</li>
            <li> I followed the regimen pretty closely, and within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out after using many different face cleaners.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ll definitely make more purchases &amp; recommend it also.</li>
            <li> By the next day I was sold : ) my item arrived faster than the date provided which is a plus .</li>
            <li> That helped SO much!</li>
            <li> I use about the size of the top part of my index finger only once a day.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak in quickly, which is the main reason I didn&#x27;t like it at first.  </li>
            <li> This worked well in the first month when I wasn&#x27;t using the AHA+ to minimize the flakes.  </li>
            <li> My face is not perfect but its the best ive had ut in years.  </li>
            <li> The products last many months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous other bp products and this is the best one by far.  </li>
            <li> : I love that it has the best ingredients, that it avoids fragrances and other irritating ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been holding off on writing this review because I was positive my face would adjust to the Acne.org Regmin and would go back to the way it was, if not worse, when I started using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t enough good things I can say about Acne.org.  </li>
            <li> This was fantastic for my skin, but I don&#x27;t like taking hormones or medicine in general.  </li>
            <li> and ive tried pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li> felt was excessive dryness to the fact that I was taking Pantothenic Acid capsules which are also good for acne.  </li>
            <li> and my face definitely looks more vibrant in the morning when I use it the night before.  </li>
            <li> Dry skin people will love this.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ll just combine treatment, moisturizer and sunblock - mix it in my palm and gently apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> (the amount really depends if your face really needs</li>
            <li> so I think that really helps to speed up getting rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Unless you have really severe acne, this will work wonders for you and everybody should be using this, trust me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a very greasy forehead where I would need to wipe my forehead as if I was sweating at work.</li>
            <li> so I need an intense routine to keep everything at bay.</li>
            <li> After much research and YouTube reviews I decided to go ahead and give it a try, mind you</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really target them</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m really acne-free.  </li>
            <li> I think the oil really helped the flakes in the beginning.</li>
            <li> A WHOLE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to really like it</li>
            <li> I really think my emerging wrinkles are lessoned, too.</li>
            <li> 1- Be really gentle with your skin while using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> very well priced.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is so oily I don&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
            <li> A bit of flakiness is so damn worth how clear your skin will be.</li>
            <li> Seller very uncooperative</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using The Regimen nearly three months now and it keeps getting better, I&#x27;ve also recently added the Glycolic Acid which also improves my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, it&#x27;s not harsh and</li>
            <li> Since my teenage years, I have tried probably close to a hundred different products without success, including Proactiv, Aveeno, Olay, Salacylic Acid, Retin-A, Clearasil, and Oxy clean, &amp; Neutragena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and some days would be okay while others were horrendous, big swollen red acne</li>
            <li> The second step bleaches your skin so quick</li>
            <li> I think I was using too much for my face early on, but Dan DOES recommend using a lot!  </li>
            <li> if you are looking for help with your acne, highly recommend this kit.  </li>
            <li> high end or drugstore acne lines never worked either.  </li>
            <li> Once I applied it on its own after cleansing, it hardly stings at all.  </li>
            <li> the lotion is also ok,  its a bit heavy, meaning i can feel it on my face.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is the most clear and smooth than it has ever been, except for some random large, under the skin lesions.  </li>
            <li> After finally giving up I eventually found the right cleansers, toners and moisturizers that worked for me.</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is a clear gel with no odor!  </li>
            <li> After using this regimine for 5 months, my skin has been clear for weeks at a time!  </li>
            <li> and I still had a few zits pretty much all the time this first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I occasionally get an itty bitty zit, but it has been a couple months since that happened &amp; it cleared up really fast with no scarring!  </li>
            <li> I personally had a huge problem with flaking and dryness (which looks even worse when you put make up on top of it).  </li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist for my new adult acne.  </li>
            <li> First off i&#x27;m 31yr old Male.  </li>
            <li> Morning  a) 1 pump of cleanser  b) 2 or 3 drops of jojoba oil applied all over my face right after washing and wait for it to dry  c)</li>
            <li> I actually ordered another large kit now to have as spare and wife (no acne problems) loves the lotion and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m several months into using the products, I feel like I can be a little more flexible in my routine.  </li>
            <li> , I was really starting to think my face just reacted badly to all treatment but after using this its been awesome!</li>
            <li> came across these products (from Dan&#x27;s Clear Skin Regimen CSR at Acne.org)</li>
            <li> So, here is my review after months of totally clear skin:</li>
            <li> I may get clean&amp;clean clear lotion for daytime and use this for night time.  </li>
            <li> And once again my Dermatologist told me that it&#x27;s the only option that really works for me.</li>
            <li> So i decided to search for a topical drug that really fights acne and my search engine kept on mentioning acne.org.</li>
            <li> It really works just like 5% benzoyl peroxide but not such aggressive.</li>
            <li> In two weeks my skin is COMPLETLY CLEAR and I have skin of a 8 year old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Morning: Cleanser, Olay Complete Moisturizer SPF 15</li>
            <li> Cleanser, Olay Complete Moisturizer SPF 15</li>
            <li> MONTHS 2-4 - Treatment at night &amp; AHA+ in the morning&lt;br /&gt;Morning: Cleanser, AHA+, Olay Complete Moisturizer, Avon Mineral Make-up&lt;br /&gt;Evening:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually use as much as Dan recommends, but that works for me.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old</li>
            <li> For me that&#x27;s completely unheard of.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m really thinking about changing is to maybe find a thicker moisturizer for winter.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> If used alone, it WILL dry out your skin pretty</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because everything I tried in the past, I thought Acne.org would just be more of the same.  </li>
            <li> The first two month my face was very dry and almost quit.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have my high school skin back.  </li>
            <li> For me this was particularly important at the beginning month to month and a half, which is the hardest part of starting this product.  </li>
            <li> You can always add a little more to your face if you didn&#x27;t get enough out of the tube/bottle at first, but once you put too much of this stuff on it feels near impossible to cool off your face even after trying to wash it</li>
            <li> When i&#x27;m on vacation or just really in a rush, I&#x27;ll wash my face, apply jojoba oil, then wait for it to dry</li>
            <li> This product works better than Proactive and better than either regimen that two different doctors prescribed--and it&#x27;s much less expensive than what the doctors recommended.  </li>
            <li> , Treatment (again wait 15 mins), Moisturizer without Jojoba oil anymore--I don&#x27;t need it!&lt;br /&gt;Findings: I just can&#x27;t believe that I finally have clear skin!  </li>
            <li> I actually told my friend who&#x27;s also suffering from adult acne about this</li>
            <li> Again, follow the instructions carefully, rub in gently and use a lot and it WILL work</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m starting to get adult acne.  </li>
            <li> if I know I&#x27;m going to spend a lot of time outside), Olay Complete Moisturizer (I skip this if I know I&#x27;ll be inside all day), Avon Mineral Make-up (optional, yay!)&lt;br /&gt;Evening</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Time of the month\\&quot; didn&#x27;t matter, I was always broken out, though I&#x27;m sure hormones and stress were some of the biggest factors.  </li>
            <li> Which leads to 2: your skin will get worse before it gets better</li>
            <li> My face as actually been clear about 5 months now with only 1 pimple</li>
            <li> 1 pump, sometimes 1/2 pump of moisturizer + a little bit of sunblock (never really need to put on too much moisturizer because I live in a tropical area where everyday is very hot &amp; humid    </li>
            <li> so using a small amount of all of these products works better for me - I probably use about half the amount they suggest using.</li>
            <li> 3- start off SLOW with SMALL amounts of Treament and AHA (if you decide to use it) because it is easy to use too much and feel like your face is going to burn off.  </li>
            <li> you have to slowly build up your skin&#x27;s tolerance to the benzoyl peroxide... and be consistent - no slacking!</li>
            <li> feel like other products in the market dry up my skin too much to the point that can irritate.</li>
            <li> I will be adding AHA to my next order to have complete kit and will be tossing all my other facial products.  </li>
            <li> Also since I have started it I have noticed older scars looking lighter and the overall complexion being less greasy as well as it goes a long way to keep my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> Cleanser, Treatment, Moisturizer mixed with a few drops of Jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;Findings: I gradually saw my skin getting so clear, and no stinging!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of 5% and 10% benzol peroxide, and just like it claims, this stuff works waaaay better and is less irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists (biggest waste of money), tried over the counter remedy soaps (unscented, antibacterial, sensitive, etc- nothing), Proactiv (everything got 2x worse), Clarsonic and light treatment.  </li>
            <li> Once you stopped for a few days, new pimples keep on popping up.</li>
            <li> I definitely wait until my face is totally dry after cleansing before applying.  </li>
            <li> I only use the moisturizer during winter if my skin gets dry</li>
            <li> : Like I said above, this stung SO bad at first when I was applying right after the BP.  </li>
            <li> During the next month, I got lazy and stopped always waiting 15 minutes in between cleansing/treatment/moisturizing, &amp; once I realized that the timing was key, went back to this final (and my current) regimen below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a long time ago, but didn&#x27;t try them.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m happier with it than I have been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I refuse to stop using this for a long time</li>
            <li> When I do, it&#x27;s minor - never, ever cystic acne anymore</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend these products enough -  I have been using them for a few months now and barely ever break out now.</li>
            <li> extremely prone to redness (to the point where people think I have a rash if I just quickly scratch an itch), very oily skin all over my face except around my eyes which are always dry, and horribly prone to break outs which most heavily affected around my mouth,jaw and forehead.  </li>
            <li> a 33-year-old mother of 3 with pale, sensitive, oily, and acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I even tried prescribed face wash and all that did was dry out my face.</li>
            <li> system will dry your skin so you will NEED to buy the Jojoba oil as well.</li>
            <li> but then it started to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin overly dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few things that are critical to keep in mind with these products which all go back to things they mention on their website: follow their steps and suggestions!  </li>
            <li> line brings all of your black and white heads out of your skin.  </li>
            <li> though, if you use it without the lotion, your skin will get very dry and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she was always the first to point out how bad my skin looked, which only made me a lot more insecure.  </li>
            <li> I was actually looking to purchase an acne treatment when I came across this product, at first I was a bit skeptical due to the price -</li>
            <li> I only use this at night since I find it to be a little too oily looking under make-up.  </li>
            <li> Those zits would leave bad scars, which would make my skin look like I had more zits than I did.  </li>
            <li> and you can just wipe them off with a wet wipe.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely hormonal with heavy whitehead breakouts monthly and zits all the time.  </li>
            <li> (wait 15 mins), Treatment (again wait 15 mins), AHA+, Moisturizer mixed with a few drops of Jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;Findings:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on acutane twice, tons of creams and a wide variety of any drug that ends in cycline.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that you have to use this product everyday or every other day.</li>
            <li> The wash is ok, i mean its not better or worse than some of the store brand ones.  </li>
            <li> (Based on other products with that ingredient.)</li>
            <li> Like just about all other acne treatments you have to give it a month or two because your skin is purging.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that you need to stick with it for three or four months to see results, for me it wasn&#x27;t instantaneous.  </li>
            <li> i also recommend using the jojoba oil (you can mix it or not) in the winter when your skin is especially dry.</li>
            <li> Basically went from always having on average 10 pimples to having an occasional 1 or 2, usually when the regimen was not strictly followed.</li>
            <li> Pro Active, Pro Active</li>
            <li> I got a few pimples when my skin was dry, however they have now cleared up.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical about purchasing the regimen because I saw on one post someone didn&#x27;t receive theirs,so I did my research and looked around the site ; even contacted them as well.</li>
            <li> My acne is fairly tough, it is moderate to severe, my skin is not sensitive at all</li>
            <li> so bye bye to dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Its clearing up and all the dark spots are dissappear ing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it for half a year I think.</li>
            <li> MONTH - starting with small amount of treatment &amp; slowly ramping it up -&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only in my late 20&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> aha cream does sting a little by itself</li>
            <li> , yea you may get a little blemish here or there</li>
            <li> My face definitely dried out with fewer zits, but my pores felt clogged still</li>
            <li> now will give update in few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/20/2013</li>
            <li> It took a few months to figure what worked for me</li>
            <li> and I would never be caught dead without makeup on, even in front of family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been plagued by acne ever since my early teens &amp; for some reason the right side of my face is always the worst</li>
            <li> I have only broken out once, on small zit.  </li>
            <li> I also had started getting pretty bad chest and bacne by this</li>
            <li> If I do break out its 1 pimple that lasts a few days not a huge cyst that lasts forever!  </li>
            <li> my colleague encouraged me to have facial and that&#x27;s when my nightmare with acne begins (Before that my face was not flawless</li>
            <li> this product worked miracles for first month, then it just stopped, i&#x27;m back to having horrible achne and it just doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever write</li>
            <li> Lately in my late 20s</li>
            <li> For the last 18 years of my life, I&#x27;m currently 28, I&#x27;ve had awful pale skin:</li>
            <li> bad side is try not to get the second step on your eyelid</li>
            <li> I was sick and tired of the roller coaster of hope and eventual disappointment at every new product or prescription I tried.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d concede defeat, until the sorry state of my complexion (and corresponding self esteem) would drive me back to the store or doctor&#x27;s office for yet another worthless remedy.</li>
            <li> Your skin will become dry for a period of time while it&#x27;s getting used to the benzol peroxide… don&#x27;t give up if you are frustrated at that point!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how much you should buy this if you have bad acne or horrible acne.  </li>
            <li> but sadly she have an allergic reaction to BP.    </li>
            <li> having yet another system fail to help rid my face of acne.</li>
            <li> My complexion is not flawless, probably never will be.</li>
            <li> While proactive seemed to work it was just to expensive, bottles were tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I want to tell everyone how well this worked for me, but I&#x27;m shy and don&#x27;t want to make people with acne feel awkward by telling them to their faces.  </li>
            <li> It was quite disappointing</li>
            <li> , it was quite a depressing experience.</li>
            <li> Went online and decided to buy the regimen, because I was just desperate</li>
            <li> Yes, this sounds so cheesy, and when people would say this before, I never believed it couldhappen to ME!  </li>
            <li> Beware, it doesn&#x27;t work and it is impossible to return.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been bad.  </li>
            <li> The scarring was bad.  </li>

            <li> When I was 25yo my colleague encouraged me to have facial and that&#x27;s when my nightmare with acne begins (Before that my face was not flawless but I just had 1 or 2 pimples once in a while). Never had this kind of acne my whole life until that moment. I&#x27;d been to several dermatologists after that incident. Been on &amp; off with isotretinoin - this drug actually works! But once you stopped, acne came back with vengeance. And once again my Dermatologist told me that it&#x27;s the only option that really works for me. This drug is really strong that&#x27;s taking over my daily mood, thinning hair (good thing I have very thick hair! but still..)and I had joint pains and I&#x27;m only in my late 20&#x27;s! So i decided to search for a topical drug that really fights acne and my search engine kept on mentioning acne.org. And so I decided to try it and it really works on me! I actually told my friend who&#x27;s also suffering from adult acne about this but sadly she have an allergic reaction to BP.    Here&#x27;s my daily ritual:    Morning  a) 1 pump of cleanser  b) 2 or 3 drops of jojoba oil applied all over my face right after washing and wait for it to dry  c) Pea size amount of treatment - optional (sometimes I skipped putting treatment in the morning)  d) 1 pump, sometimes 1/2 pump of moisturizer + a little bit of sunblock (never really need to put on too much moisturizer because I live in a tropical area where everyday is very hot &amp; humid    *When i&#x27;m on vacation or just really in a rush, I&#x27;ll wash my face, apply jojoba oil, then wait for it to dry and i&#x27;ll just combine treatment, moisturizer and sunblock - mix it in my palm and gently apply it to my face. It works the same as following the regimen! But remember, what works for my skin might not work for you. Every skin type is different.    Evening  a) 1 pump of cleanser  b) apply 2 or 3 drops of jojoba oil  c) pea size, 1/2 or 1 pump of treatment (the amount really depends if your face really needs more but 1 pump is the maximum amount for me)  d)1/2 or 1 pump of moisturizer (+ AHA once a week - during fridays only)    The first time I used this product, I can already feel that it&#x27;s making huge difference for my skin. After 3 days, all my acne shrunk. I don&#x27;t use make-up so I think that really helps to speed up getting rid of my acne. These products last 3 months and now I&#x27;m using the Big Kit.  The only downside is that you have to use this product everyday or every other day. Once you stopped for a few days, new pimples keep on popping up. Blame it to our hormones. But other than that I love this product and I&#x27;ll continue using it!  *I&#x27;d been using these products for 9 months now. And I sometimes skipped a day or two without having major breakouts. :D</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she loves it.  She still has the occasional breakout--but otherwise, she looks like someone that doesn&#x27;t suffer from acne at all--which was not the case before she tried this.  This product works better than Proactive and better than either regimen that two different doctors prescribed--and it&#x27;s much less expensive than what the doctors recommended.  I would tell ANYONE that has acne issues to give these products a try.  I wish that it had been around when I was younger and suffering from acne myself--it would have saved me a lot of scars, and I&#x27;m happy that my beautiful daughter won&#x27;t have that happen to her.</li>
            <li> my skin has never been better. you have to slowly build up your skin&#x27;s tolerance to the benzoyl peroxide... and be consistent - no slacking! it pays off. my skin looks and feels amazing. i also recommend using the jojoba oil (you can mix it or not) in the winter when your skin is especially dry. the aha is great for a sporadic exfoliant - it helps with blackheads!</li>
            <li> I had been using this for 2.5 years and it worked well...until I had the birth control Nexplanon implanted!!! Beware!!! ! If you are on any birth control that has acne as a side effect or is high in androgen, this product may not be as effective. I could not give it a lesser rating because I am a witness that it has worked excellent for me before I started the Nexplanon implant in May of 2014. Hopefully, these products will continue to work when I start back using them again after I get this implant removed for good...today!!!.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the regime for about a month and am quite happy with the results so far.  I had been using a different bp beforehand, so I started using the aha gel already.  My complexion is the most clear and smooth than it has ever been, except for some random large, under the skin lesions.  But I haven&#x27;t been using the bp in the mornings and that could be why I&#x27;m still having some breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is gentle, but effective in removing makeup. I love the way it lathers and feels on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t over dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bp is an awesome product!  I&#x27;ve used numerous other bp products and this is the best one by far.  I like that it is a clear gel with no odor!  It is not over drying and doesn&#x27;t leave white powdery patches on my skin.  And it&#x27;s effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is nice too.  I haven&#x27;t found it to be greasy and it absorbs quickly.  I didn&#x27;t buy the jojoba oil and haven&#x27;t needed it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any yellowing of my skin from it as others have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aha cream does sting a little by itself so I mix it with my morning lotion.  My complexion is definitely more smooth and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased so far and am planning to keep this as my regime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for the last 4 or 5 years. For the first year or so, I tried tons stuff from the store, nothing would work. I finally got prescribed clindamycin, and it worked wonders... for about 6 months. I stopped using it after it was so much better, and started again and it didn&#x27;t really work. About 8 months ago I then got a prescription for erythromycin, and it basically did nothing. I also had started getting pretty bad chest and bacne by this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was feed up with acne, so finally bought this regimen because of all the amazing things i&#x27;ve heard about it. I followed the regimen pretty closely, and within 2 weeks. my skin was 50% clearer. By about the 4th week, my face was 90% clearer. Basically went from always having on average 10 pimples to having an occasional 1 or 2, usually when the regimen was not strictly followed. It also worked wonders on my chest and back, I&#x27;d say about 80% clearer. Truly amazing stuff. Unless you have really severe acne, this will work wonders for you and everybody should be using this, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do need to use all 3 of these for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is great. Follow the instructions carefully for the best results. If used alone, it WILL dry out your skin pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment is perfect. It&#x27;s a huge tube of 2.5% benzo, so you can use large amounts like your supposed to. Again, follow the instructions carefully, rub in gently and use a lot and it WILL work it&#x27;s magic! I&#x27;ve used tons of 5% and 10% benzol peroxide, and just like it claims, this stuff works waaaay better and is less irritating. Just like the cleanser though, if you use it without the lotion, your skin will get very dry and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is amazing. Smells great, is nice and thin so it goes on easily without having to rub it in, but it&#x27;s not runny. It moisturizes great too. If you do the first 2 steps perfect, but don&#x27;t use this moisturizer, your face will be and look very dry and irritated and you probably won&#x27;t get the best results. Just use everything as directed and you&#x27;ll love it.ery dry and irritated and you probably won&#x27;t get the best results. Just use everything as directed and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out after using many different face cleaners. I grew up with a sister so I would always just use her face cleaning stuff and none of it would work. I even tried prescribed face wash and all that did was dry out my face. Overall I would always wash my face and nothing would work. I had a very greasy forehead where I would need to wipe my forehead as if I was sweating at work. I began using this stuff incorrectly because the written instructions were a bit unclear but the tutorial video online helped and now after using it correctly for just over 2 weeks now my skin is better than it has ever been! I was expecting a breakout in week two like it says may and will probably happen on the website but nothing came from it. My skin just kept getting better and better without the face peeling and what not. Best stuff I have used so far, I was really starting to think my face just reacted badly to all treatment but after using this its been awesome!</li>
            <li> My acne is fairly tough, it is moderate to severe, my skin is not sensitive at all so I need an intense routine to keep everything at bay. After much research and YouTube reviews I decided to go ahead and give it a try, mind you I bought this system when the regiment first came out and was still pretty uncommon, there were different labels on the bottles but I believe it was the same formula as now. I followed everything precisely but somehow came out with even more acne than I had started with?!? It was quite disappointing having yet another system fail to help rid my face of acne. I feel as though I did give this regiment a fair shot, I used it for months and some days would be okay while others were horrendous, big swollen red acne like I had never had before, it was quite a depressing experience. After finally giving up I eventually found the right cleansers, toners and moisturizers that worked for me. I incorporated the benzoyl peroxide treatment from the regiment into my own routine as well as being put on birth control and I am happy to say that I&#x27;m now acne free.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! The cleanser is very good (but sometimes too delicate to eye make up). The treatment bottle is just HUGE! I&#x27;ll use it for half a year I think. The moisturizer is effective but too emulsive for oily skin (if you want to use it daytime).&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t have a lot of problems with my skin so I use the treatment once a week and the moisturizer as needed (it also helps with sunburn). Thank you acne.org for this great product! It really works just like 5% benzoyl peroxide but not such aggressive.</li>
            <li> it burned all my face it costed me 150 $ to cure to doctor  !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for about 4 months now. The good thing about this product is that it seems to heal some of my scars well, but my breakouts will not stop. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s worked for many but not for me.</li>
            <li> If I could give this 10 stars I would.  I have very oily skin.  Lately in my late 20s I&#x27;ve been having more breakouts.  I guess I&#x27;m starting to get adult acne.  I have tried everything. Pro Active, Pro Active +, Aveeda, Neutrogena, etc.  Let me tell you... In two weeks my skin is COMPLETLY CLEAR and I have skin of a 8 year old.  My poors are smalller.. I have terrible oily skin and would have to blot it all day.  I don&#x27;t have oily skin anymore. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system will dry your skin so you will NEED to buy the Jojoba oil as well. THIS IS A MUST. I mix it with the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This line brings all of your black and white heads out of your skin.  You will literally see them hanging off your face and you can just wipe them off with a wet wipe.  The second step bleaches your skin so quick so bye bye to dark spots.  Bye bye to spending 100s of dollars on lighting your skin.  I cannot tell you how much you should buy this if you have bad acne or horrible acne.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I feel like I have my high school skin back.  I hope they don&#x27;t change there formula.  This is better than what any doctor can give you.  I went to a dermatologist for my new adult acne.  They just give you antibiotics.. PLEASE TRY THIS. OILY SKIN PEOPLE WILL LOVE THIS. Dry skin people will love this. Remember all GET THE JOJOBA oil.  It should be in the kit but it&#x27;s not.  TRY IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only bad side is try not to get the second step on your eyelid or it will burn.  Other than that PERFECT.</li>
            <li> At first I loved the product but then it started to dry out my skin. I almost gave up on the product but then I started to moisturize more. I got a few pimples when my skin was dry, however they have now cleared up. It has been a month since I started the product and I love it. IT IS IMPORTANT TO MOISTURIZE A LOT!!!</li>
            <li> Okay, before I go any further I&#x27;d like to say congratulations to you Mr. Kern, without a doubt your line of products are truly effective. I was actually looking to purchase an acne treatment when I came across this product, at first I was a bit skeptical due to the price - I kept thinking how can a product this inexpensive be effective. Anyway, I started reading the product details &amp; reviews, watched the videos and was truly impressed at the whole presentation. I went ahead with the purchase &amp; received the items well within the promised delivery date, I started noticing a difference in my skin by day 4, The Regimen made my skin become noticeably smoother &amp; clearer. I&#x27;ve always been plagued by acne ever since my early teens &amp; for some reason the right side of my face is always the worst but now it&#x27;s all cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using The Regimen nearly three months now and it keeps getting better, I&#x27;ve also recently added the Glycolic Acid which also improves my skin tone. I&#x27;m 100% happy with this product &amp; I&#x27;ll definitely make more purchases &amp; recommend it also. Keep up the good job.</li>
            <li> this product worked miracles for first month, then it just stopped, i&#x27;m back to having horrible achne and it just doesn&#x27;t work anymore. i know its different for each person, but i was expecting something more out of this product.. not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical about purchasing the regimen because I saw on one post someone didn&#x27;t receive theirs,so I did my research and looked around the site ; even contacted them as well. By the next day I was sold : ) my item arrived faster than the date provided which is a plus . My first week of using the regimen was ok it did give me that working feeling and the irritation feeling but it does go away and no your face will not turn red or peel or whatever else! by my second week my acne was basically vanishing,yes it takes awhile but it&#x27;s worth it this stuff is the best. I&#x27;m currently on my 6th week give or take  and I&#x27;m acne free , yea you may get a little blemish here or there but the regimen will cure it .my only issue with this is the whiteheads!!!!! it doesn&#x27;t really target them but luckily I had my biore pore unclogging scrub I&#x27;d rub it on just my nose and it worked didn&#x27;t interfere with anything also if your skin is oily I&#x27;d suggest getting a blotting translucent powder it does the trick and no clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Quick summary: This is FANTASTIC.  The only line of skin care that has worked for my skin.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m really acne-free.  Here&#x27;s the detailed version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 33-year-old mother of 3 with pale, sensitive, oily, and acne-prone skin.  I have had acne since I was a teenager.  It&#x27;s been bad.  The one thing that worked for me was Aldactone.  I used the as prescribed by a dermatologist along with birth control pills, as recommended.  This was fantastic for my skin, but I don&#x27;t like taking hormones or medicine in general.  Obviously, they weren&#x27;t an option when my husband and I decided to start a family.  My acne came back with a vengeance.  It was definitely hormonal with heavy whitehead breakouts monthly and zits all the time.  The scarring was bad.  Since my teenage years, I have tried probably close to a hundred different products without success, including Proactiv, Aveeno, Olay, Salacylic Acid, Retin-A, Clearasil, and Oxy clean, &amp; Neutragena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across these products (from Dan&#x27;s Clear Skin Regimen CSR at Acne.org) a long time ago, but didn&#x27;t try them.  About 6 months ago, I decided to give it a go.  I bought the Cleanser, Treatment &amp; Moisturizer, &amp; Jojoba oil to start, and decided to wait on the AHA+ as recommended.  Also, I knew the AHA+ contained glycolic acid, which I thought my skin didn&#x27;t like.  (Based on other products with that ingredient.) So, I started the regimen following the application techniques that Dan recommends in his videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST MONTH - starting with small amount of treatment &amp; slowly ramping it up -&lt;br /&gt;Morning: Cleanser, Olay Complete Moisturizer SPF 15 (w/ 2 drops of Jojoba oil), Avon Mineral Make-up&lt;br /&gt;Evening: Cleanser (wait 15 mins- this is key!), Treatment (again wait 15 mins), Moisturizer mixed with a few drops of Jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;Findings: I found that I didn&#x27;t use as much moisturizer as Dan recommends when I mixed it with the oil.  I think the oil really helped the flakes in the beginning.My face definitely dried out with fewer zits, but my pores felt clogged still and I still had a few zits pretty much all the time this first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND MONTH - added AHA+&lt;br /&gt;Morning: Cleanser, Olay Complete Moisturizer SPF 15 (w/ 2 drops of Jojoba oil), Avon Mineral Make-up&lt;br /&gt;Evening: Cleanser (wait 15 mins), Treatment (again wait 15 mins), AHA+, Moisturizer mixed with a few drops of Jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;Findings: I WAS IN PAIN!!! The AHA+ stung so bad, I thought I would cry.  I toughed it out for about 2 weeks until I decided to try it in the morning instead.  That helped SO much! (see below for routine).  I think the stinging came from mixing the BP and AHA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED MONTHS 2-4 - Treatment at night &amp; AHA+ in the morning&lt;br /&gt;Morning: Cleanser, AHA+, Olay Complete Moisturizer, Avon Mineral Make-up&lt;br /&gt;Evening: Cleanser, Treatment, Moisturizer mixed with a few drops of Jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;Findings: I gradually saw my skin getting so clear, and no stinging!!  I do have very sensitive skin.  I used this regimen for a couple months, and it got to where I would have only 1 or 2 zits per month!  Those zits would leave bad scars, which would make my skin look like I had more zits than I did.  During the next month, I got lazy and stopped always waiting 15 minutes in between cleansing/treatment/moisturizing, &amp; once I realized that the timing was key, went back to this final (and my current) regimen below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TODAY&#x27;S REGIMEN (about 8 months after I started the CSR)&lt;br /&gt;Morning: Cleanser, AHA+ (I skip this if I know I&#x27;m going to spend a lot of time outside), Olay Complete Moisturizer (I skip this if I know I&#x27;ll be inside all day), Avon Mineral Make-up (optional, yay!)&lt;br /&gt;Evening: Cleanser (wait 15 mins- this is key!), Treatment (again wait 15 mins), Moisturizer without Jojoba oil anymore--I don&#x27;t need it!&lt;br /&gt;Findings: I just can&#x27;t believe that I finally have clear skin!  I occasionally get an itty bitty zit, but it has been a couple months since that happened &amp; it cleared up really fast with no scarring!  My scars are fading, too.  I&#x27;m just so excited about the CSR--and I hardly ever write reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my final thoughts on each of the products:&lt;br /&gt;THE LINE AS A WHOLE: I love that it has the best ingredients, that it avoids fragrances and other irritating ingredients.  I also like that Dan cares about limiting packaging and keeping the costs low!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSER: Love, Love, Love!  It reminds me of all the good things about Cetaphil, but it actually FEELS like you&#x27;re getting your face clean.  I love how it bubbles up--unlike Cetaphil.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin overly dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TREATMENT: Glides on easy.  I don&#x27;t actually use as much as Dan recommends, but that works for me.  I use about the size of the top part of my index finger only once a day.  I definitely wait until my face is totally dry after cleansing before applying.  This DOES bleach fabrics, so I always take a white pillowcase with me when traveling to avoid bleaching someone else&#x27;s pillowcase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOISTURIZER:  This has taken me longer to love.  I think I was using too much for my face early on, but Dan DOES recommend using a lot!  It doesn&#x27;t soak in quickly, which is the main reason I didn&#x27;t like it at first.  I&#x27;ve learned to really like it and my face definitely looks more vibrant in the morning when I use it the night before.  I only use this at night since I find it to be a little too oily looking under make-up.  I will keep buying it, but it lasts forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AHA+: Like I said above, this stung SO bad at first when I was applying right after the BP.  Once I applied it on its own after cleansing, it hardly stings at all.  Now I LOVE this!  This is the key to my face now looking totally polished.  It cleared up the flakes from the BP right away, and now I have such smooth, even, bright, and glowing skin.  Yes, this sounds so cheesy, and when people would say this before, I never believed it couldhappen to ME!  I really think my emerging wrinkles are lessoned, too. Perhaps it&#x27;s even fading my scars?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOJOBA OIL: This worked well in the first month when I wasn&#x27;t using the AHA+ to minimize the flakes.  I really didn&#x27;t like the packaging because it leaked oil all over my counter, and I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to use it anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I want to tell everyone how well this worked for me, but I&#x27;m shy and don&#x27;t want to make people with acne feel awkward by telling them to their faces.  So, here is my review after months of totally clear skin: wow.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions, you&#x27;ll need wayyyyyy more face wash than you do with the treatment and lotion.  If you buy this, prepare to buy another bottle of face wash before you finish the kit</li>
            <li> Ive been suffering from acne since I was 17, and cystic acne since 23.  I am 31 years old and ive tried pretty much everything.  The only thing that was working was accutane but couldnt continue because I couldnt afford it anymore.  Went online and decided to buy the regimen, because I was just desperate and I had tried everything else.  The first two month my face was very dry and almost quit.  But then read some reviews and some people noticed changes after 3 months.  Im so glad I did.  My face is not perfect but its the best ive had ut in years.  Its clearing up and all the dark spots are dissappear ing, im so happy.  Stick to it, give it time and use it under make up as well, best of luck to you all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40-something woman who&#x27;s had severe acne for over two decades. I&#x27;d tried everything, up to and including Accutane...twice. I was sick and tired of the roller coaster of hope and eventual disappointment at every new product or prescription I tried. So I&#x27;d concede defeat, until the sorry state of my complexion (and corresponding self esteem) would drive me back to the store or doctor&#x27;s office for yet another worthless remedy. A year ago, though, I went to my computer instead, and landed on the acne.org site, where I bought the Regimen. Here&#x27;s my testimonial: now, I actually go to the gym without makeup on. (If you don&#x27;t get how remarkable that is, you&#x27;re not a true fellow sufferer.) My complexion is not flawless, probably never will be. But I&#x27;m happier with it than I have been in a long time. If you&#x27;re where I was a year ago, give this a try. No guarantee, but maybe you&#x27;ll be as lucky as me. RECOMMENDATION:  watch the videos at acne.org regarding proper application. They&#x27;re important.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product. Have not noticed a difference at all</li>
            <li> Big fan of the Acne.org website and now that the products are being sold on Amazon I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I used The Regimen every day, twice a day along with another acne product [[ASIN:B004LJ0ZK6 ClearZine (2 Bottles) - The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill. Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits]] which has helped out with the breakouts on my face which is great considering that because of the medication I&#x27;m on, I break out much more than usual. Though I&#x27;m happy to say that since I started taking this combo a month ago, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since. my skin is so much better. I had only one pimple throughout the entire month. I am so happy to have found this. Also since I have started it I have noticed older scars looking lighter and the overall complexion being less greasy as well as it goes a long way to keep my skin from drying out. I love this so far. I hope it keeps working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been holding off on writing this review because I was positive my face would adjust to the Acne.org Regmin and would go back to the way it was, if not worse, when I started using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t enough good things I can say about Acne.org.  For the last 18 years of my life, I&#x27;m currently 28, I&#x27;ve had awful pale skin: extremely prone to redness (to the point where people think I have a rash if I just quickly scratch an itch), very oily skin all over my face except around my eyes which are always dry, and horribly prone to break outs which most heavily affected around my mouth,jaw and forehead.  \\&quot;Time of the month\\&quot; didn&#x27;t matter, I was always broken out, though I&#x27;m sure hormones and stress were some of the biggest factors.  I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists (biggest waste of money), tried over the counter remedy soaps (unscented, antibacterial, sensitive, etc- nothing), Proactiv (everything got 2x worse), Clarsonic and light treatment.  Those last two showed the best improvement, but my skin only got about 20% better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because everything I tried in the past, I thought Acne.org would just be more of the same.  The reason I decided to give it a go was their website.  They had a lot of information/explanations I&#x27;d never seen before and structure around their program.  They also talk about  alternative drugstore options which I&#x27;d never seen before.  This was the best decision I ever made.  My face as actually been clear about 5 months now with only 1 pimple I can actually recall.  For me that&#x27;s completely unheard of.  Every time my mom sees me says she can&#x27;t believe how good my face looks and she was always the first to point out how bad my skin looked, which only made me a lot more insecure.  (What happened to your face? Doesn&#x27;t that hurt?).  To hear my mom now tell me how good it looks whenever she sees me is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things that are critical to keep in mind with these products which all go back to things they mention on their website: follow their steps and suggestions!  1- Be really gentle with your skin while using this stuff.  For me this was particularly important at the beginning month to month and a half, which is the hardest part of starting this product.  Like just about all other acne treatments you have to give it a month or two because your skin is purging.  Which leads to 2: your skin will get worse before it gets better and I&#x27;ve yet to come across anyone say differently. I personally had a huge problem with flaking and dryness (which looks even worse when you put make up on top of it).  I contribute some of I felt was excessive dryness to the fact that I was taking Pantothenic Acid capsules which are also good for acne.  To help with the dryness and even out my skin tone I started using Acne.org AHA Lotion.  And that brings me to my final point; 3- start off SLOW with SMALL amounts of Treament and AHA (if you decide to use it) because it is easy to use too much and feel like your face is going to burn off.  you need to work up to the larger amounts.  You can always add a little more to your face if you didn&#x27;t get enough out of the tube/bottle at first, but once you put too much of this stuff on it feels near impossible to cool off your face even after trying to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m several months into using the products, I feel like I can be a little more flexible in my routine.  The only thing I&#x27;m really thinking about changing is to maybe find a thicker moisturizer for winter.  But I do like that their moisturize has a yellow tinge since it helps neutralize redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like my title says: my miracle product.  I refuse to stop using this for a long time and I tell everyone I can about this stuff.  Bravo Acne.org.</li>
            <li> First off i&#x27;m 31yr old Male.  I battled acne in my teens and by my 20s seems like it was gone here and there.  but using a medicated face wash twice a day did the job for me.  And all of sudden about 9months ago acne came back no idea why.. maybe stress??  I didn&#x27;t want to have to go see Dr just yet and looked to see at my OTC options.  I ended up getting proactiv which cleared me up and worked well for me.  I should point out that I only got toner and repair lotion and used my own wash.  Than i discovered acne.org and realized that everything i had been doing for acne i was way off, i thought drier is better.. i thought scrubbing was better.  While proactive seemed to work it was just to expensive, bottles were tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this kit from acne.org along w/ JoJoba oil too.  And this kit is great.  very well priced.  The wash is ok, i mean its not better or worse than some of the store brand ones.  but the Benz cream is the best part of this kit, great value for amount you get, its a gel not cream so dries clean.  the lotion is also ok,  its a bit heavy, meaning i can feel it on my face.  dont get me wrong its does a great job of moisturizing and would be great for winter but with summer around the corner i can see this lotion being a challenge.  I may get clean&amp;clean clear lotion for daytime and use this for night time.  this lotions has great soothing effect, esp after shaving.  all the products are fragrance free, which for guy is great, i don&#x27;t need to be smelling like roses and lavender.  I will be adding AHA to my next order to have complete kit and will be tossing all my other facial products.  Get this kit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but if you are looking for help with your acne, highly recommend this kit.  its works great, and its great value for the money.  Been using it for about 2weeks now will give update in few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/20/2013&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the whole kit now for few weeks.  I have only broken out once, on small zit.  My skins hasnever looked better.  I actually ordered another large kit now to have as spare and wife (no acne problems) loves the lotion and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> ACNE.ORG THANK YOU!  I&#x27;m 39 and have suffered from hormonal cystic acne since I was 12.  the kind of acne that would stay for weeks or months.  I&#x27;ve been on acutane twice, tons of creams and a wide variety of any drug that ends in cycline.  Proactive, high end or drugstore acne lines never worked either.  After using this regimine for 5 months, my skin has been clear for weeks at a time!  If I do break out its 1 pimple that lasts a few days not a huge cyst that lasts forever!  It took a few months to figure what worked for me but I found the cleanser to be amazing and the benzoyl is the key. I only use the moisturizer during winter if my skin gets dry but my skin is so oily I don&#x27;t really need it.  I can&#x27;t recommend this line enough.  I&#x27;m just so bummed I didn&#x27;t find this YEARS ago.  The products last many months so the cost for me is very reasonable!  I spend less,now, on something that works rather than dozens of products that don&#x27;t.  The delivery time does take a bit longer to be delivered so I make sure I order with plenty of time.  I agree with other reviews that you need to stick with it for three or four months to see results, for me it wasn&#x27;t instantaneous.  I&#x27;m so amazed and am I no longer embarrassed to go out!  THANK YOU!!!!!</li>
            <li> This cleared up my skin entirely. I had horrible hormonal acne…it was painful and embarrassing. I didn&#x27;t want to go out in public and I would never be caught dead without makeup on, even in front of family. I cannot recommend these products enough -  I have been using them for a few months now and barely ever break out now. When I do, it&#x27;s minor - never, ever cystic acne anymore (hallelujah!). I have really sensitive skin and so using a small amount of all of these products works better for me - I probably use about half the amount they suggest using. This is great because the products go farther and I don&#x27;t need to purchase replacements as quickly. I would recommend trying to follow it religiously (they know what they&#x27;re talking about, after all) but also listening to your own personal skin type and tailoring it to your needs. Your skin will become dry for a period of time while it&#x27;s getting used to the benzol peroxide… don&#x27;t give up if you are frustrated at that point! The pay off will be huge and you will be so glad you stuck it out. A bit of flakiness is so damn worth how clear your skin will be. Thank you, acne.org!!!!!</li>
            <li> Beware, it doesn&#x27;t work and it is impossible to return. Seller very uncooperative and now I&#x27;m stuck with it</li>
            <li> I like it very much, it&#x27;s not harsh and it does it&#x27;s work. I definitely recommend it. Since I discovered it 2 years ago, I&#x27;ve stuck to it.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like other products in the market dry up my skin too much to the point that can irritate. I use this every day and it never irritates my skin, so it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
