            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>But you don&#x27;t have to have if you already own F80 sigma kabuki brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and easy to maneuver around and in between  your eyebrows.</li>

            <li>Sigma brush, authentic.</li>
            <li>Very good quality; unique; fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This Sigma 3DHD Kabuki brush you have to use as if you are painting your face as opposed to the Sigma F80 Flat top Kabuki (which is great!), there is just no comparison.  </li>
            <li>Looks good, but the packing is really informal.....</li>
            <li>First of all Sigma Beauty brushes are amazing, very soft and great quality.</li>
            <li>Can fit into the crease of eye and nose area.</li>
            <li>Such an awesome brush and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>The Sigma 3DHD Brush is seriously the best foundation brush ever!</li>

            <li>Very soft bristles and gives a smooth finish to your makeup application.</li>
            <li>Shipping came very fast.</li>

            <li>I really recommend it, you wont regret buying these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>and I have seen my foundation not be quite as smooth as with other brush applications.  </li>
            <li>This brush is very different from all the other brushes in the market right now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a brush above makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>nice shape but so difficult to work with</li>
            <li>If you purchase from the seller &amp;#34;Sigma Beauty&amp;#34; here on Amazon, you&#x27;ll get the real Sigma brushes, because that&#x27;s the real Sigma- duh!</li>

            <li> Will be using this baby for a long time.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and thick.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money dont waste your time buying it!</li>
            <li> You can reach all those angles that you usually cant with other brushes, i personally  think that this is a replacement for beauty blender sponges because with this brush you don&#x27;t need any other tool to apply product under your eyes or and the sides of your nose, etc.</li>
            <li> The bristles constantly come off and its annoying when you are trying to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this brush!</li>

            <li> Not a fan of this brush at all. It clumps foundation on the face and is way too dense. I prefer the Sigma Flat Top over this any day. Complete waste of money dont waste your time buying it!</li>
            <li> nice shape but so difficult to work with</li>
            <li> Softest ever! Can fit into the crease of eye and nose area. The bristles are soft and thick.</li>

            <li> The best foundation brush on the market!. Ever since using this brush I have gotten so many compliments on my skin and makeup. It leaves no streaks and blends foundation beautifully! I love the shape of the brush as well. It lets you get every corner of your face. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Always a homerun!!! I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Applies my foundation verryyy verry well love it !</li>
            <li> This Sigma 3DHD Kabuki brush you have to use as if you are painting your face as opposed to the Sigma F80 Flat top Kabuki (which is great!), there is just no comparison.  I regret this purchase, I have used it for liquid foundation and I have seen my foundation not be quite as smooth as with other brush applications.  I love the color of the handle, I think this concept was a miss!  Skip this brush, I can&#x27;t believe I fell for this gimmick. I am not a makeup artist, but I have purchased lots of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a brush above makeup brushes. Larger in size than imagined. Postal service took their time, but it is truly worth it. Will be using this baby for a long time.</li>
            <li> You might not think you need this brush, but you do! This brush puts foundation in all the nooks and crannies in ways you never imagined. I use it in conjunction with Sigma&#x27;s standard kabuki and they make a wonderful pair. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this brush!</li>
            <li> Looks good, but the packing is really informal.....</li>
            <li> Sigma brush, authentic. Shipping came very fast. Only problem is the brush was bent on two ends....</li>
            <li> Very good quality; unique; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Such an awesome brush and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Very soft bristles and gives a smooth finish to your makeup application. No brush strokes visible. Such a pleasure to use. I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. Works well for her.</li>
