            <li>Good product for healthy nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li>Feels so nice, absorbs well, but won&#x27;t permanently remove.</li>
            <li>I love Healthy Hoof!  </li>
            <li>this is probably the best foot cream we have ever used....takes care of winter feet cracks and makes your feet so soft.</li>
            <li>This product it is great and totally helps the nails shine and makes them beautiful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any strong smell, but would use it even if it smelled because IT WORKS!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant odor, absorbs quickly, and moistures</li>
            <li>Item came quick and at a good price</li>
            <li>When it was gone, I just had to order more because may nail</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried Healthy Hoof Intensive Protein Treatment.</li>
            <li>In October 2010, I decided to faithfully apply Healthy Hoof twice a day.  </li>
            <li>My nails aren&#x27;t splitting, they don&#x27;t chip if I accidentally hit them against something, and the cuticles are moisturized and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This is more than just a cuticle cream.  </li>
            <li>Was introduced to Healthy Hoof a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I stocked up on this product.</li>
            <li>It is no longer carried at the store where I shop, so it pleased me to find it.</li>
            <li>but I would not be able to have it on my hands for any length of time.</li>
            <li>I found out about Healthy Hoof from a wonderful lady who gave me a pedicure while I was vacationing in Maui last year.  </li>
            <li>My cuticles have never looked better, and it&#x27;s even helping my nails look healthier.  </li>
            <li>I knew I would need to get more of the stuff.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have show my trainer my improved hooves, my wife will tell me how much better my hands look with nails that are trimmed and not jagged.</li>
            <li>I feel that it&#x27;s just okay for a moisturizer</li>
            <li>I will use it until it&#x27;s all gone, but I will not buy more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B0006Q00ZI Healthy Hoof Intensive Protein Treatment 4oz]]  </li>

            <li>I love</li>
            <li>There is an odor associated with this that I havent been able to describe</li>
            <li>Gena Healthy Hoof Cream is healing and provides a protective barrier.  </li>
            <li>I love this product as a cuticle cream.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this great product.</li>
            <li>Great product, does what it says it will do, the price is excellent and the jar should last a long time, I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li>They split and tear easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a strong scent</li>
            <li>After a week or so they are fresh and strong again!</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it as local sources no longer carried it.</li>
            <li>I put it on and almost immediately it was smooth and the peeling stopped.  </li>
            <li>Now I used it one or two times a week to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for human cuticles!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Works great on my dry cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li>Healthy Hoof works great on dried and cracked hands, feet, nails and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>So great for dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>I use this on my cuticles and nails and also works great on dry heals!</li>
            <li>My mom was right all those years ago when she started buying this item!</li>
            <li>This is an effective cream for soft brittle nails that I have used before.  </li>
            <li>This was a good price (I got the larger size) and</li>
            <li>Just buff &#x27;em for extra shine and good to go.</li>
            <li>sent it to my mom, recommended it to my girlfriends, I can&#x27;t say enough good about this cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to grow out natural strong nails.  </li>
            <li>The order came very quickly and was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>At first, I used it every day until my heels become smooth again.</li>
            <li>It has no unpleasant odor, absorbs rapidly, and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about it is you get tons of it (4oz) compared to women&#x27;s products (0.5 oz) for half the price.  </li>
            <li>Also good for dry elbows.</li>
            <li>:) It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used Burts Bee&#x27;s cuticle balm, but from what I can remember--this stuff works better.</li>
            <li>I have tried other nail treatments for this problem but none are as successful.</li>
            <li>Rub this into your nails daily, and they will become strong, moist, healthy.  </li>
            <li>Great product really works on dry skin and nails.</li>
            <li>It has a very minimal but pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>One time I was getting a pedicure and this was put on my heels and the bottoms of my feet, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth they were!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite nail product by far.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought some right there, and have been buying it through Amazon since.</li>
            <li>I see results right away.</li>
            <li>They continue to be fine, but any time I think maybe they have become too dry, I apply Healthy Hoof.  </li>
            <li>The small one is great for my purse.</li>
            <li>The whites of my nails are pure white (although they were never discolored before, this is a nice perk).</li>
            <li>It has a nice creamy, slightly greasy, quality, but after rubbing it into the cuticles and nails, it is absorbed rather quickly, leaving the cuticles well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is very creamy and absorbs quickly after being rubbed in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an amazing product that I first purchased about 7 years ago for my finger cuticles which dry out in winter.</li>
            <li>After trying many other products,I have used this product for years to keep my feet and hands free from cracks.</li>
            <li>Rub it on and it doesn&#x27;t wash off instantly like most creams or lotions do.</li>
            <li>you have pretty hands and nails.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my finger nails to you folks willing to believe a horse is talking to you.  </li>
            <li>I figured it would probably not be terrific, but perhaps okay.</li>
            <li>As long as he applies it religiously, it work great and it doesn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that the first time I put this on my nails they felt smoother.  </li>
            <li>Sounds funny</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li>Even after the first day I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive, and worth so much more than many more expensive nail products.</li>
            <li>Went to the dermatologist who said there was nothing to be done - it was some kind of condition for which there was no solution other than to have the nails removed.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cream for many many years, at least 20.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped that this would make my nails strong enough so that wouldn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li>My nails tend to start curling inward when they get to a certain length.  </li>
            <li>I ordered one jar and liked it so much that I ordered half a dozen additional jars.  </li>
            <li>Both seem much stronger and you don&#x27;t use much of it.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute staple in our home.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It works fantastically and really helps with healing cracked skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a very dense cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fussy about any product, and I give this the highest rating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to use this stuff, but I really can&#x27;t see any growth.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My husband really loves this...better than the $100 prescription cream the doctor recommends.</li>
            <li>You really need to be diligent using it.</li>
            <li>Now it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my split nails.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li>I so much as touch something.</li>
            <li>I apply heathly hoof Intensive Protein treatment twice daily and find the damage to my nails is significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found other cuticle creams to be either oily or waxy, and Healthy Hoof is neither.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough in this tub to last for years, it&#x27;s super cheap, and it works.</li>
            <li>will always purchase this cream as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic if you have dry, cracked cuticles.  </li>
            <li>They finally have grown and my hands and nails look better than they have my entire life.</li>
            <li>and by now my nails had grown more and the split continued to become wider and more vulnerable to infection.  </li>
            <li>I found Healthy Hoof in my local pharmacy for a very low cost and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found for my dry feet, makes them nice and soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and the jar is half gone and guess what, im ordering more. : )</li>
            <li>I use a little more than is needed, and then massage the rest into my hands.</li>
            <li>I know some use this on their feet with the same success.  </li>
            <li>, you can buy any thing like olive oil, or cuticle oil to do that, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, the hoof lacquer and this healthy hoof cream was a waste of my money, but this is what happens when you take a chance on a product like this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick cream keeps my cuticles nice, but I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I live in an \\&quot;Artic Desert\\&quot; climate in Fairbanks, Alaska.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have written, I also love it for the back of my heels -</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find it in a local drug store but they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it - couldn&#x27;t find it in other stores either.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this cream consistently for about three weeks</li>
            <li>After having tried numerous products, some of which helped a little, I found this hoof cream, and I am totally pleased.  </li>
            <li>but it soaks into the skin, cuticles and nail bed completely.</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff my husband uses for his very cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li>It helps to strengthen my nails and keeps my cuticles soft.</li>
            <li>Just bought my 93 year old mother 2 jars</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to make my nails grow in stronger, possibly because my cuticles are so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>Patience, regular filing, and skipping the polish while using this product really works</li>
            <li>It is not easy to find in stores it is fortunate that&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li>I found that I had to spend a few weeks filing back the peeling parts of the nail and keep applying this cream to really see good results because my nails were so fragile that once they peeled a tiny bit, there was nothing that could help other than removing the broken/peeling part of the nail.</li>
            <li>Any remaining oiliness can be wiped off with a towel, but there won&#x27;t be much if your cuticles are as dry as mine have been.  </li>
            <li>This really works on dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li>It is actually so moisturizing it made my nails very soft and prone to bending and breaking.  </li>
            <li>I thought perhaps I had damage to my cuticle from manicures because there was no other reason for this to happen.  </li>
            <li>Only problem after using for a month when someone asks how old you are you stomp out answer with your foot!  </li>
            <li>I used to be embarrassed to have bare feet, but not anymore.  </li>
            <li>I expected too much.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, my cuticles were very well conditioned.  </li>
            <li>only downside is that it&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t feel great on your finger tips, but it isn&#x27;t too bad, and anyways it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> This is a very  nice product.</li>
            <li> It is great for chapped hands and the lanolin smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I use this a couple of times a week on my feet, and it is amazing!  </li>
            <li> - this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I actually kind of like it!</li>
            <li> A good coat of this on my hands and a good nights sleep</li>
            <li> I found that it was good for my heel that had been peeling.  </li>
            <li> and they feel waxy until I give them a good washing.  </li>
            <li> Healthy Hoof helps to soften my cuticles, nails and hands and has been a great help in the process to stop nibbling.  </li>
            <li> This cream is great and my cuticles absolutely love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love how it works on my nails!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Thank you for an amazing product.</li>
            <li> A kind elderly lady recommended this hoof cream to me for dry/cracking hands.  </li>
            <li> My nails peel and this cream kind of keeps it from flaking and chipping more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product for healthy nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Feels so nice, absorbs well, but won&#x27;t permanently remove.</li>
            <li> I love Healthy Hoof!  </li>
            <li> this is probably the best foot cream we have ever used....takes care of winter feet cracks and makes your feet so soft.</li>
            <li> This product it is great and totally helps the nails shine and makes them beautiful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any strong smell, but would use it even if it smelled because IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant odor, absorbs quickly, and moistures</li>
            <li> Item came quick and at a good price</li>
            <li> When it was gone, I just had to order more because may nail</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried Healthy Hoof Intensive Protein Treatment.</li>
            <li> In October 2010, I decided to faithfully apply Healthy Hoof twice a day.  </li>
            <li> My nails aren&#x27;t splitting, they don&#x27;t chip if I accidentally hit them against something, and the cuticles are moisturized and healthy.  </li>
            <li> This is more than just a cuticle cream.  </li>
            <li> Was introduced to Healthy Hoof a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I stocked up on this product.</li>
            <li> It is no longer carried at the store where I shop, so it pleased me to find it.</li>
            <li> but I would not be able to have it on my hands for any length of time.</li>
            <li> I found out about Healthy Hoof from a wonderful lady who gave me a pedicure while I was vacationing in Maui last year.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles have never looked better, and it&#x27;s even helping my nails look healthier.  </li>
            <li> I knew I would need to get more of the stuff.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have show my trainer my improved hooves, my wife will tell me how much better my hands look with nails that are trimmed and not jagged.</li>
            <li> I feel that it&#x27;s just okay for a moisturizer</li>
            <li> I will use it until it&#x27;s all gone, but I will not buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend this great product.</li>
            <li> Great product, does what it says it will do, the price is excellent and the jar should last a long time, I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> They split and tear easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a strong scent</li>
            <li> After a week or so they are fresh and strong again!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find it as local sources no longer carried it.</li>
            <li> I put it on and almost immediately it was smooth and the peeling stopped.  </li>
            <li> Now I used it one or two times a week to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for human cuticles!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Works great on my dry cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li> Healthy Hoof works great on dried and cracked hands, feet, nails and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> So great for dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> I use this on my cuticles and nails and also works great on dry heals!</li>
            <li> My mom was right all those years ago when she started buying this item!</li>
            <li> This is an effective cream for soft brittle nails that I have used before.  </li>
            <li> This was a good price (I got the larger size) and</li>
            <li> Just buff &#x27;em for extra shine and good to go.</li>
            <li> sent it to my mom, recommended it to my girlfriends, I can&#x27;t say enough good about this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to grow out natural strong nails.  </li>
            <li> The order came very quickly and was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> At first, I used it every day until my heels become smooth again.</li>
            <li> It has no unpleasant odor, absorbs rapidly, and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about it is you get tons of it (4oz) compared to women&#x27;s products (0.5 oz) for half the price.  </li>
            <li> Also good for dry elbows.</li>
            <li> :) It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used Burts Bee&#x27;s cuticle balm, but from what I can remember--this stuff works better.</li>
            <li> I have tried other nail treatments for this problem but none are as successful.</li>
            <li> Rub this into your nails daily, and they will become strong, moist, healthy.  </li>
            <li> Great product really works on dry skin and nails.</li>
            <li> It has a very minimal but pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> One time I was getting a pedicure and this was put on my heels and the bottoms of my feet, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth they were!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite nail product by far.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought some right there, and have been buying it through Amazon since.</li>
            <li> I see results right away.</li>
            <li> They continue to be fine, but any time I think maybe they have become too dry, I apply Healthy Hoof.  </li>
            <li> The small one is great for my purse.</li>
            <li> The whites of my nails are pure white (although they were never discolored before, this is a nice perk).</li>
            <li> It has a nice creamy, slightly greasy, quality, but after rubbing it into the cuticles and nails, it is absorbed rather quickly, leaving the cuticles well moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is very creamy and absorbs quickly after being rubbed in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an amazing product that I first purchased about 7 years ago for my finger cuticles which dry out in winter.</li>
            <li> After trying many other products,I have used this product for years to keep my feet and hands free from cracks.</li>
            <li> Rub it on and it doesn&#x27;t wash off instantly like most creams or lotions do.</li>
            <li> you have pretty hands and nails.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my finger nails to you folks willing to believe a horse is talking to you.  </li>
            <li> I figured it would probably not be terrific, but perhaps okay.</li>
            <li> As long as he applies it religiously, it work great and it doesn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that the first time I put this on my nails they felt smoother.  </li>
            <li> Sounds funny</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li> Even after the first day I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very expensive, and worth so much more than many more expensive nail products.</li>
            <li> Went to the dermatologist who said there was nothing to be done - it was some kind of condition for which there was no solution other than to have the nails removed.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cream for many many years, at least 20.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that this would make my nails strong enough so that wouldn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> My nails tend to start curling inward when they get to a certain length.  </li>
            <li> I ordered one jar and liked it so much that I ordered half a dozen additional jars.  </li>
            <li> Both seem much stronger and you don&#x27;t use much of it.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute staple in our home.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It works fantastically and really helps with healing cracked skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a very dense cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fussy about any product, and I give this the highest rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use this stuff, but I really can&#x27;t see any growth.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this...better than the $100 prescription cream the doctor recommends.</li>
            <li> You really need to be diligent using it.</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my split nails.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> I so much as touch something.</li>
            <li> I apply heathly hoof Intensive Protein treatment twice daily and find the damage to my nails is significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found other cuticle creams to be either oily or waxy, and Healthy Hoof is neither.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough in this tub to last for years, it&#x27;s super cheap, and it works.</li>
            <li> will always purchase this cream as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic if you have dry, cracked cuticles.  </li>
            <li> They finally have grown and my hands and nails look better than they have my entire life.</li>
            <li> and by now my nails had grown more and the split continued to become wider and more vulnerable to infection.  </li>
            <li> I found Healthy Hoof in my local pharmacy for a very low cost and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found for my dry feet, makes them nice and soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to everyone.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and the jar is half gone and guess what, im ordering more. : )</li>
            <li> I use a little more than is needed, and then massage the rest into my hands.</li>
            <li> I know some use this on their feet with the same success.  </li>
            <li> , you can buy any thing like olive oil, or cuticle oil to do that, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, the hoof lacquer and this healthy hoof cream was a waste of my money, but this is what happens when you take a chance on a product like this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cream keeps my cuticles nice, but I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I live in an \\&quot;Artic Desert\\&quot; climate in Fairbanks, Alaska.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have written, I also love it for the back of my heels -</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find it in a local drug store but they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it - couldn&#x27;t find it in other stores either.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream consistently for about three weeks</li>
            <li> After having tried numerous products, some of which helped a little, I found this hoof cream, and I am totally pleased.  </li>
            <li> but it soaks into the skin, cuticles and nail bed completely.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff my husband uses for his very cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li> It helps to strengthen my nails and keeps my cuticles soft.</li>
            <li> Just bought my 93 year old mother 2 jars</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to make my nails grow in stronger, possibly because my cuticles are so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> Patience, regular filing, and skipping the polish while using this product really works</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find in stores it is fortunate that&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li> I found that I had to spend a few weeks filing back the peeling parts of the nail and keep applying this cream to really see good results because my nails were so fragile that once they peeled a tiny bit, there was nothing that could help other than removing the broken/peeling part of the nail.</li>
            <li> Any remaining oiliness can be wiped off with a towel, but there won&#x27;t be much if your cuticles are as dry as mine have been.  </li>
            <li> This really works on dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> It is actually so moisturizing it made my nails very soft and prone to bending and breaking.  </li>
            <li> I thought perhaps I had damage to my cuticle from manicures because there was no other reason for this to happen.  </li>
            <li> Only problem after using for a month when someone asks how old you are you stomp out answer with your foot!  </li>
            <li> I used to be embarrassed to have bare feet, but not anymore.  </li>
            <li> I expected too much.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my cuticles were very well conditioned.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that it&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t feel great on your finger tips, but it isn&#x27;t too bad, and anyways it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hope it helps other people, but so far it is not helping me.</li>
            <li> It is much less expensive and is just as effective.  </li>
            <li> If it will keep my nails from breaking I can live with a little odor and a waxy feel.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness - I tried this on my HAIR last night before bed because the ends of my hair are so dry.  </li>
            <li> This has been the only item that has ever worked for me in preventing and curing my dry, cracked and splitting nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Ive suffered with hands that crack and bleed for many years, a few months ago while in rehab for a broken hip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Dry, chapped hands or excema?</li>
            <li> I have had dry, splitting nails and ragged cuticles for years.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for years with cracked, dry and peeling heels and feet.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, brittle nails that peel</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product to help my dry, ragged cuticles for some time now.  </li>
            <li> I use this all the time for my dry nails at the recommendation of my family physician.  </li>
            <li> If I rub this into my nails every night, my cuticles are no longer dry</li>
            <li> My cuticles are always dry as sandpaper and this product works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry with calluses.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and only one time did my hands start to crack like they have always done, i continued putting it on daily</li>
            <li> This product has such a strong and unpleasant menthol-ish odor that I will never use it.</li>
            <li> In the winter, both my and my daughter&#x27;s hands get so dry that they get rough, crack and even bleed.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and cuticles</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly picking my cuticles until they bleed, and they&#x27;re always a scraggly mess.  </li>
            <li> my nails are back to being a mess as soon as the polish starts to chip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had weak and brittle nails for my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li> The 4 ounce jar is long-lasting as you only need a little each time.  </li>
            <li> Product is what I expected; it arrived on time so thankfully no difficulties with this purchase.</li>
            <li> If you have dermatitis or just cracked and rough skin</li>
            <li> It take care of the rough flaky patches I used to get on my heels.</li>
            <li> 4 ounces is a lot of cream to me, so I distribute it into several travel containers and tuck it around (in my purse, by the TV, etc) and apply frequently to save my poor fingers.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as it keeps your hands from drying out during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been rubbing it in to my nails and cuticles daily for a few weeks now, and I have noticed stronger nails with fewer splits and less peeling.</li>
            <li> they are no better and you will notice that the first ingrediant in some of the expensive cremes is actually petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my nails and cuticles daily and little by little</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and this product saves me from broken nails and torn cuticles.</li>
            <li> Both of my thumb nails had developed a split in the lower center by the cuticle which proceeded to become worse as my nails grew.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately,  it hasn&#x27;t solved that issue but my nails are certainly stronger than they used to be.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend for anyone with dry cuticles, or weak nails.</li>
            <li> Maybe it really works, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s not for me to find out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews unless something I purchase is really terrible or really great.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll want to keep trimming them down while using this because it isn&#x27;t going to fix the parts that are already peeled and split.</li>
            <li> He typically uses it before he goes to bed and rubs it in well.</li>
            <li> My nails seem to be hardening up, they are less peely, less prone to chipping/splitting anytime</li>
            <li> It has only a faint scent that reminds me of the facial cleanser Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> My daughter had purchased this product and gave me a little to try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a cuticle cream for a little over a week now.</li>
            <li> Every night I take a little dollop and cover my cuticles in it, coating all the skin around each nail.</li>
            <li> My nails were so, so horrible a few months ago  and would flake, peel, and tear when catching on even cloth.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my nail pealing and cracking.  </li>
            <li> Just like brushing your teeth, you have to do it everyday or every night for it to work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d given up on vitamin supplements as they were just a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my nails a few hours after using it.</li>
            <li> It keeps my thin fragile nails in line.</li>
            <li> Works in just a matter of a few days.</li>
            <li> Not easy to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just smells a bit floral smelling.  </li>
            <li> but I really dont notice it unless I wave my hands under my nose and don&#x27;t find it to be mediciney or to smell like crude oil</li>
            <li> This product did not satisfied me.</li>
            <li> No more splitting or cracking.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t the usual catastrophic failure.  </li>
            <li> so I can apply the cream whenever I have a chance but at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Seriously though, my nails have never been stronger.</li>
            <li> May be because my nails were such bad shape it will take longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had bad nails for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> they were weak and turning brown.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how weak they were.</li>
            <li> Paper thin nails are still there after 5-6 months.</li>
            <li> I was getting a lot of broken nails.  </li>
            <li> Try this product for your dry, cracked cuticles, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ill look for something else</li>
            <li> They are frail and chip and peel like crazy and nothing has helped.</li>
            <li> In addition, I found the texture to be unpleasantly sticky.</li>
            <li> I get bad hang nails.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had a bad habit of biting my nails and cuticles because they were always breaking.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone who has been dealing with bad nails for years like I have.</li>
            <li> If your nails are as bad as mine</li>
            <li> It eliminated the painful hang nails you get during winter.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t get Kiehls cuticle treatment cream anymore</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> If you suffer with hands that crack and eventually bleed, this is the stuff that works for that nasty problem.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff! I work in the garden and on my car and my hands get torn up. A good coat of this on my hands and a good nights sleep and they look like pampered princess hands again.  This stuff is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my nail pealing and cracking.  My daughter had purchased this product and gave me a little to try.  When it was gone, I just had to order more because may nail truly are on the road to recovery.  Thank you for an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I use this on finger and toenails. Both seem much stronger and you don&#x27;t use much of it. A friend told me of her use on her toenails..they were weak and turning brown. After a week or so they are fresh and strong again!</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It is the only thing I have used that actually strengthens my nails and prevents splitting cuticles.  I was so happy to find it as local sources no longer carried it.</li>
            <li> Dry, chapped hands or excema? This stuff is the best. In the winter, both my and my daughter&#x27;s hands get so dry that they get rough, crack and even bleed. This stuff is the best. Rub it on and it doesn&#x27;t wash off instantly like most creams or lotions do. Helps heal skin quicker than anything else I&amp;#34;ve tried. This is an absolute staple in our home.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hand / cutical treatments  It is not easy to find in stores it is fortunate that&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has this product listed.</li>
            <li> Great value - lots of product for the price! I don&#x27;t mind the smell...I actually kind of like it! I like that it&#x27;s not perfumed and &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smelling like some stuff on the market.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness - I tried this on my HAIR last night before bed because the ends of my hair are so dry.  It gave a wonderful body to my hair - so now I will try it in the morning and see if it lasts all day.  Like other reviewers have written, I also love it for the back of my heels - helps my feet look great in sandals.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> This product is great. The smell is a bit strong but I don&#x27;t care - it softens my hands, nails and cuticles beautifully. I even use it on my feet and what a difference! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried Healthy Hoof Intensive Protein Treatment. I have had dry, splitting nails and ragged cuticles for years. I was embarrassed to have people see my hands and nails! In October 2010, I decided to faithfully apply Healthy Hoof twice a day.  Well, it is February 2011 now and what a difference!!! My nails aren&#x27;t splitting, they don&#x27;t chip if I accidentally hit them against something, and the cuticles are moisturized and healthy.  I used to get cracks around my thumbs during the winter, but not this year! Now I keep a jar upstairs and downstairs so I can apply the cream whenever I have a chance but at least twice a day.  I don&#x27;t notice any strong smell, but would use it even if it smelled because IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> Perfect, it was just what I ordered, and the item was comparable in price and it showed up at the house in 3 days. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love Healthy Hoof!  I have struggled for years with cracked, dry and peeling heels and feet.  One time I was getting a pedicure and this was put on my heels and the bottoms of my feet, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth they were!  I used to be embarrassed to have bare feet, but not anymore.  I use this a couple of times a week on my feet, and it is amazing!  I have never found anything else that worked.  You will not be disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> My husband calls this my horse hoof cream :-)&lt;br /&gt;It is an amazing product that I first purchased about 7 years ago for my finger cuticles which dry out in winter. How I have made my next purchase of this cream and use it on my dry/cracked heels. It works fantastically and really helps with healing cracked skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will always purchase this cream as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> This is an effective cream for soft brittle nails that I have used before.  Product is what I expected; it arrived on time so thankfully no difficulties with this purchase.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t make that anymore so I have been looking for a substitute. This is as close as I have come. I have very dry hands and cuticles and this is very good. Don&#x27;t bother with some of the pricier ones- they are no better and you will notice that the first ingrediant in some of the expensive cremes is actually petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> This is more than just a cuticle cream.  Rub this into your nails daily, and they will become strong, moist, healthy.  Just like brushing your teeth, you have to do it everyday or every night for it to work--it&#x27;s great as a night cream for your toes and and your fingers.  It&#x27;s not very expensive, and worth so much more than many more expensive nail products.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to Healthy Hoof a couple of years ago.  A little goes a long way as it keeps your hands from drying out during the winter months.  I know some use this on their feet with the same success.  Ride &#x27;em cowboy or cowgirl.</li>
            <li> My nails were constantly peeling and breaking as a result of taking water aerobic classes several times weekly. I apply heathly hoof Intensive Protein treatment twice daily and find the damage to my nails is significantly reduced. I have tried other nail treatments for this problem but none are as successful.</li>
            <li> After trying many other products,I have used this product for years to keep my feet and hands free from cracks. It has no unpleasant odor, absorbs rapidly, and is non-greasy.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I stocked up on this product. Should have just bought one. I have dry, brittle nails that peel and I thought with daily use this would improve.  It is actually so moisturizing it made my nails very soft and prone to bending and breaking.  This may work for some others but it didn&#x27;t work for me.    On the other hand, my cuticles were very well conditioned.  I will use the rest of the bottles i bought on my elbows, knees and feet as a nice-moisturizer.  As a moisturizer and cuticle softener, 5 stars.  But if you want to strengthen nails specifically, it might not meet your needs.</li>
            <li> Great product, does what it says it will do, the price is excellent and the jar should last a long time, I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is a very dense cream but it soaks into the skin, cuticles and nail bed completely. With regular application, hang nails heal up and before you know it you have pretty hands and nails. It also works great on cracked heels. Put it on and put a sock over it so it doesn&#x27;t just rub off. This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to find this product.  It is no longer carried at the store where I shop, so it pleased me to find it.</li>
            <li> I have issues with nibbling my cuticles.  Healthy Hoof helps to soften my cuticles, nails and hands and has been a great help in the process to stop nibbling.  I use it on my elbows, as well, when I turn in for the night.  I used to be able to find it in a local drug store but they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it - couldn&#x27;t find it in other stores either.  This was a good price (I got the larger size) and I received the product promptly.  I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product has such a strong and unpleasant menthol-ish odor that I will never use it. I don&#x27;t know what the offending ingredient is but I would not be able to have it on my hands for any length of time. In addition, I found the texture to be unpleasantly sticky. Maybe it really works, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s not for me to find out.</li>
            <li> I found out about Healthy Hoof from a wonderful lady who gave me a pedicure while I was vacationing in Maui last year.  I bought some right there, and have been buying it through Amazon since.</li>
            <li> works good on toenails-will re-order!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great! Just a bit the size of a pea will do all the fingers on both hands. I&#x27;ve been rubbing it in to my nails and cuticles daily for a few weeks now, and I have noticed stronger nails with fewer splits and less peeling. There&#x27;s enough in this tub to last for years, it&#x27;s super cheap, and it works. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do what was advertised.  Paper thin nails are still there after 5-6 months.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product to help my dry, ragged cuticles for some time now.  After having tried numerous products, some of which helped a little, I found this hoof cream, and I am totally pleased.  This product has drastically improved my cuticles in the six days that I have been using it.  It has a nice creamy, slightly greasy, quality, but after rubbing it into the cuticles and nails, it is absorbed rather quickly, leaving the cuticles well moisturized.  Any remaining oiliness can be wiped off with a towel, but there won&#x27;t be much if your cuticles are as dry as mine have been.  Try this product for your dry, cracked cuticles, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that actually grew my nails. Longer, shinier and thicker.It eliminated the painful hang nails you get during winter. I don&#x27;t even wear nail polish now. Just buff &#x27;em for extra shine and good to go. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Great for nails and cuticles! I keep smaller amounts in smaller containers and in my purse. I refill as needed.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to help with my peeling nails, but I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic if you have dry, cracked cuticles.  My cuticles have never looked better, and it&#x27;s even helping my nails look healthier.  I massage it into my cuticles and nails before bed, and then do it before I leave in the morning, and I am so amazed that something actually works.  Now, you have to do it daily to see the results.  I&#x27;m very fussy about any product, and I give this the highest rating.</li>
            <li> A kind elderly lady recommended this hoof cream to me for dry/cracking hands.  Ive suffered with hands that crack and bleed for many years, a few months ago while in rehab for a broken hip a wonderful lady recommended this to me, i immediately ordered it. I use it everyday and only one time did my hands start to crack like they have always done, i continued putting it on daily and it went away.  What a miracle cream.  If you suffer with hands that crack and eventually bleed, this is the stuff that works for that nasty problem.  I use it everyday and the jar is half gone and guess what, im ordering more. : )</li>
            <li> Worked well on my hooves.  That&#x27;s my finger nails to you folks willing to believe a horse is talking to you.  I&#x27;ve had weak and brittle nails for my entire adult life.  I&#x27;d given up on vitamin supplements as they were just a waste of money.  In Walmart one night, I saw a product that purported to assist fingernails to become stronger.  What the hell, why not give it a try?  Damn if I didn&#x27;t get an immediate improvement in my nails.  The only problem was the quantity in the jar was miniscule.  I knew I would need to get more of the stuff.  This hoof cream claimed the same ingredients as the Walmart item.  I can attest to the improvement in my nails.  I don&#x27;t have show my trainer my improved hooves, my wife will tell me how much better my hands look with nails that are trimmed and not jagged.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t putting a lot of stock into this cream. I figured it would probably not be terrific, but perhaps okay. I&#x27;m so glad I was wrong - this stuff is AMAZING! I could tell a difference in my nails a few hours after using it. My nails are smoother, they look healthier, and they feel stronger. My nails peel and this cream kind of keeps it from flaking and chipping more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t feel great on your finger tips, but it isn&#x27;t too bad, and anyways it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent it to my mom, recommended it to my girlfriends, I can&#x27;t say enough good about this cream. I wish I had found this years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use this stuff, but I really can&#x27;t see any growth. I feel that it&#x27;s just okay for a moisturizer, you can buy any thing like olive oil, or cuticle oil to do that, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, the hoof lacquer and this healthy hoof cream was a waste of my money, but this is what happens when you take a chance on a product like this. I will use it until it&#x27;s all gone, but I will not buy more. I hope it helps other people, but so far it is not helping me.</li>
            <li> This excellent cream is what I have been looking for.  I use it on my nails every night, and they are healthier and stronger.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff my husband uses for his very cracked cuticles. As long as he applies it religiously, it work great and it doesn&#x27;t have an odor. He typically uses it before he goes to bed and rubs it in well.</li>
            <li> I have TERRIBLE cuticles. The worst. This is a great moisturizer to put on under gloves at night. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> If you have dermatitis or just cracked and rough skin this is the product to change that.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Works great on my dry cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li> The processed uses to remove polish ruined my nails.  I brought hoping it help to restore my nails.  May be because my nails were such bad shape it will take longer.  I will contine until the jar is gone and post an update.</li>
            <li> I get bad hang nails. This product helps prevent that. It also makes my nails stronger. Item came quick and at a good price</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0006Q00ZI Healthy Hoof Intensive Protein Treatment 4oz]]  This a great product!  I use it every night at bed.  It helps to strengthen my nails and keeps my cuticles soft.</li>
            <li> awesome product for nails and hands I have already placed 2nd order</li>
            <li> I was amazed that the first time I put this on my nails they felt smoother.  Sounds funny I know but it did.  I found that it was good for my heel that had been peeling.  I put it on and almost immediately it was smooth and the peeling stopped.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how well this product works.  For years I had nails that would chip and peel.  Since I&#x27;ve been using Gena Healthy Hoof Cream I&#x27;ve been able to grow out natural strong nails.  I am extremely pleased with this product and use it every night.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the name scare you off. This stuff makes your nails, cuticles, and hands look so much better. I live in the desert and this product saves me from broken nails and torn cuticles.</li>
            <li> After searching for years and buying every product for women that is supposed to stop splitting nails, this worked. What&#x27;s great about it is you get tons of it (4oz) compared to women&#x27;s products (0.5 oz) for half the price.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> The order came very quickly and was exactly what I wanted.  The Hoof Cream is wonderful for us gardeners --- strengthens the nails and keeps the cuticles neat.&lt;br /&gt;Sue C.</li>
            <li> Good product for healthy nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Great product really works on dry skin and nails. Also good for dry elbows. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews unless something I purchase is really terrible or really great. This stuff is absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve struggled with my nails constantly breaking and peeling and I&#x27;ve always had a bad habit of biting my nails and cuticles because they were always breaking. I bought a jar of this cream and rub it all over my nails and cuticles every morning and night.  It has a bit of a strong scent but you get used to it after a couple of uses. It really doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just smells a bit floral smelling.  Seriously though, my nails have never been stronger. They have finally stopped breaking and splitting and peeling. They finally have grown and my hands and nails look better than they have my entire life. I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about a month too. I definitely recommend for anyone with dry cuticles, or weak nails.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.  I highly recommend to everyone.  This product it is great and totally helps the nails shine and makes them beautiful.</li>
            <li> I give this a 5 star rating .... this is probably the best foot cream we have ever used....takes care of winter feet cracks and makes your feet so soft. My husband really loves this...better than the $100 prescription cream the doctor recommends.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t get Kiehls cuticle treatment cream anymore so thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It is much less expensive and is just as effective.  I will definitely be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the smaller size. The small one is great for my purse. I have terrible cuticles. They split and tear easily. I expected too much. You really need to be diligent using it. But if you&#x27;re diligent enough to massage cream on your cuticles every day, then any cream would probably work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cream keeps my cuticles nice, but I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again. Ill look for something else</li>
            <li> I use this all the time for my dry nails at the recommendation of my family physician.  Not easy to find in the stores.  recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago and it worked much better.  Now it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my split nails.  I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> This product did not satisfied me. My nails are worst then before. This is not worth the price. I do not recommand it.</li>
            <li> Both of my thumb nails had developed a split in the lower center by the cuticle which proceeded to become worse as my nails grew.  I thought perhaps I had damage to my cuticle from manicures because there was no other reason for this to happen.  Went to the dermatologist who said there was nothing to be done - it was some kind of condition for which there was no solution other than to have the nails removed.  I did not want to do this - and by now my nails had grown more and the split continued to become wider and more vulnerable to infection.  I found Healthy Hoof in my local pharmacy for a very low cost and decided to give it a try.  I applied it to my nails and cuticles daily and little by little I noticed the splits by my cuticles on each thumb were healing.  It took time, but within 6 months I had 2 very healthy nails!! Hurray! They continue to be fine, but any time I think maybe they have become too dry, I apply Healthy Hoof.  It was a Nail Saver! Best product ever... and I recommend to all of my friends with nail issues.</li>
            <li> I use this on my cuticles and nails and also works great on dry heals!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for many many years, at least 20.  It keeps my thin fragile nails in line.</li>
            <li> I use this produce on my heels and feet. It take care of the rough flaky patches I used to get on my heels. At first, I used it every day until my heels become smooth again. Now I used it one or two times a week to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.  It&#x27;s great for hands and feet.  Just bought my 93 year old mother 2 jars and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It came promptly and there was no shipping cost...I love that.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very pleasant scent and feels great. Works quite well.</li>
            <li> I live in an \\&quot;Artic Desert\\&quot; climate in Fairbanks, Alaska.  This has been the only item that has ever worked for me in preventing and curing my dry, cracked and splitting nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite nail product by far. I&#x27;m constantly picking my cuticles until they bleed, and they&#x27;re always a scraggly mess.  This is the only cream I can rub into my open cuticle wounds that doesn&#x27;t burn.  If I rub this into my nails every night, my cuticles are no longer dry and I have nothing to pick at.  Also, it seems to make my nails grow in stronger, possibly because my cuticles are so much healthier.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> EDIT: I wanted to check back in since it&#x27;s been over a month since my last review and mention that my nails have continued to improve using this cream. My nails were so, so horrible a few months ago  and would flake, peel, and tear when catching on even cloth. I&#x27;ve actually broken off chunks of nail lightly bumping my hand against a doorknob or reaching into my purse, that&#x27;s how weak they were. I found that I had to spend a few weeks filing back the peeling parts of the nail and keep applying this cream to really see good results because my nails were so fragile that once they peeled a tiny bit, there was nothing that could help other than removing the broken/peeling part of the nail. I hope this helps someone who has been dealing with bad nails for years like I have. Patience, regular filing, and skipping the polish while using this product really works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had bad nails for as long as I can remember. They are frail and chip and peel like crazy and nothing has helped. I have tried tons of supplements and every nail hardener under the sun and while hardeners work short-term my nails are back to being a mess as soon as the polish starts to chip. I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day for one week and I&#x27;m already impressed. My nails seem to be hardening up, they are less peely, less prone to chipping/splitting anytime I so much as touch something. The whites of my nails are pure white (although they were never discolored before, this is a nice perk). They just look healthier and hydrated. If your nails are as bad as mine you&#x27;ll want to keep trimming them down while using this because it isn&#x27;t going to fix the parts that are already peeled and split. It will beef up the undamaged nail and help keep it from peeling. Try it!</li>
            <li> I was getting a lot of broken nails.  I would trim them back beyond the break and they would break again while I was trimming them.  I decided to give this stuff a try and it seems to be working.  I try to slather my nails up a couple of times a week before I go to bed.  Initially my hands feel greasy but that goes away shortly and they feel waxy until I give them a good washing.  I have only had one nail break since I started using this and it wasn&#x27;t the usual catastrophic failure.  There is an odor associated with this that I havent been able to describe but I really dont notice it unless I wave my hands under my nose and don&#x27;t find it to be mediciney or to smell like crude oil so I don&#x27;t find it objectionable, just puzzling.  If it will keep my nails from breaking I can live with a little odor and a waxy feel.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for human cuticles! Only problem after using for a month when someone asks how old you are you stomp out answer with your foot!  JK</li>
            <li> Healthy Hoof works great on dried and cracked hands, feet, nails and cuticles.  I get cracked heals in the winter and it clears them up over night.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Have used this nail cream and recommended it for years. It keeps cuticles some and I believe it strenghens nails.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands.  I ordered one jar and liked it so much that I ordered half a dozen additional jars.  I keep it in my car and throughout my home, and have also given it as gifts.  Gena Healthy Hoof Cream is healing and provides a protective barrier.  The 4 ounce jar is long-lasting as you only need a little each time.  You&#x27;ll want to allow several minutes for it to absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product as a cuticle cream. It has a very minimal but pleasant scent. The consistency is very creamy and absorbs quickly after being rubbed in. I&#x27;ve found other cuticle creams to be either oily or waxy, and Healthy Hoof is neither. 4 ounces is a lot of cream to me, so I distribute it into several travel containers and tuck it around (in my purse, by the TV, etc) and apply frequently to save my poor fingers. My mom was right all those years ago when she started buying this item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a cuticle cream for a little over a week now. Even after the first day I noticed a difference. Every night I take a little dollop and cover my cuticles in it, coating all the skin around each nail. I use a little more than is needed, and then massage the rest into my hands. It&#x27;s a great moisturizing regime. I don&#x27;t use this for my nails...I always am wearing nail polish and am constantly doing my nails. Which is why I am so concerned about my cuticles. This cream is great and my cuticles absolutely love it :) It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used Burts Bee&#x27;s cuticle balm, but from what I can remember--this stuff works better. I&#x27;d have try it again though to know for sure. However, I think this stuff is great. If you want your cuticles to look and feel smooth, try this product!</li>
            <li> Love how it works on my nails! It makes my nails look better and removes the cracks.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream I&#x27;ve found to treat and prevent cracked skin on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found for my dry feet, makes them nice and soft!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this cream consistently for about three weeks but it has definitely made my nails stronger.  It has only a faint scent that reminds me of the facial cleanser Cetaphil.  My nails tend to start curling inward when they get to a certain length.  I had hoped that this would make my nails strong enough so that wouldn&#x27;t happen.  Unfortunately,  it hasn&#x27;t solved that issue but my nails are certainly stronger than they used to be.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Works in just a matter of a few days.</li>
            <li> Works miracles on my nails! No more splitting or cracking.</li>
            <li> This is a very  nice product. It has a pleasant odor, absorbs quickly, and moistures well. I definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years and I love it.  It is great for chapped hands and the lanolin smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> So great for dry cuticles. Love it</li>
            <li> My cuticles are always dry as sandpaper and this product works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry with calluses. Love this stuff. Feels so nice, absorbs well, but won&#x27;t permanently remove. Need doc for that.</li>
            <li> This really works on dry cracked heels. I see results right away.</li>
