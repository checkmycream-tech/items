            <li>Very comfortable and feels very gentle and soothing.</li>

            <li>I tried these Gel-Therapuy Booties and I&#x27;m sure they work really well.</li>

            <li>They really work!  </li>
            <li>these will get your feet back in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gel does stick to the sock when you first get them, but that&#x27;s simple to fix just peel the gel side away from the top of the sock</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used them before, these are really great if you have dry feet and cuticles (especially in the Winter).  </li>
            <li>My feet are soft and pretty much crack / scale free now.</li>
            <li>But when I take them off, my feet are soooo soft and look freshly pedicured!  </li>
            <li>Living in the dry mountains of drought-stricken California means moisturizing till you slide off the chair! :-)</li>
            <li>No idea how they work, but they really work for me.</li>
            <li>really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>When I woke up the next morning, my feet were already smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Since my feel are so rough, I did not expect these booties to completely take away my calluses, but I am satisfied with how much improvement I have seen.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these socks.</li>
            <li>after you file you feet with the flowery swedish clover foot file and use this your feet will be like new don&#x60;t walk in them</li>
            <li>I live in Las Vegas, so</li>
            <li>my feet are super dry</li>
            <li>Make your feet feel very soft.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night and take them off because my feet feel too hot, but that&#x27;s just me.  </li>
            <li>They made my feet soft and the softness lasted throughout the day.</li>
            <li>My feet felt really soft after wearing them.</li>
            <li>They really help as we have very low humidity</li>
            <li>I highly recommend over the tons of special foot creams I&#x27;ve ordered in the past.</li>

            <li>Sometimes I wear them around for a half hour or so during the day for a quick &#x27;touch</li>
            <li>I generally use them twice a week for soft feet all week long.</li>
            <li>So it holds the cream in and does not dry the feet out.  </li>
            <li>the are warm, thick, cozy material.</li>
            <li>My feet are in such great shape after wearing them for a few nights to bed (yes, my feet were in poor shape!).  </li>

            <li> While these have not completely gotten rid of my calluses, they have improved them by about 88%!</li>
            <li> These socks are very strange.  </li>
            <li> I got this for a family member who had dry feet from eczema.</li>
            <li> I had nerve damage in my legs and feet and become very dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I get dry, cracked heels and tough skin due to being on my feet all day and a high arch.</li>
            <li> My feet were so bad that I was surprised at the improvement after the first wearing.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely callused heels and toes.</li>
            <li> Compares well with other products....</li>
            <li> I also put some baby oil on my feet when taking them off and then wash my feet with soap and water, adding a little baby oil after I dry my feet as well.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re less odd than I am, give them a try.</li>
            <li> They remind me a little of hospital socks...</li>
            <li> I wear these to bed a few times a week</li>
            <li> They are gummy on the inside and can on,y be worn a few times.</li>
            <li> and this has dried out the soles of my feet.</li>
            <li> With these, for less than what I paid for one pair of the high-end gel booties, you get three pairs!  </li>
            <li> having dry feet is very common.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear them at night about 4-5 times a week.</li>
            <li> I usually put on some lotion and then put these on my feet around bed time.  </li>
            <li> The reasoning why these were so hard to get during Christmas shopping time is now obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because, having non-breathable cover for your feet for 24 hours is probably not a good idea.</li>
            <li> They are so cold when you put your feet in them!  </li>
            <li> I hate it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my feet are super dry and I did not quite get the results as some of the reviews but I still love the feeling of the bootie and the softness I have been able to aquire.</li>
            <li> These did exactly what I they said they would do. They made my feet soft and the softness lasted throughout the day. I generally use them twice a week for soft feet all week long. FYI I sleep in them I dont just put them on for a couple of hours if that helps.</li>
            <li> They really work they have a thick layer of gel on the bottom as well as the top, good quality</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a good product. Wife loves them!!!  They are non slip and comfortable. Easy to clean. No complaints!</li>
            <li> after you file you feet with the flowery swedish clover foot file and use this your feet will be like new don&#x60;t walk in them</li>
            <li> They are so cold when you put your feet in them!  But they do work to soften your feet overnight!</li>
            <li> Living in the dry mountains of drought-stricken California means moisturizing till you slide off the chair! :-) I tried these Gel-Therapuy Booties and I&#x27;m sure they work really well. Thing is, I&#x27;d never slept wearing socks or anything like that, and had to remove them because they felt so strange.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re less odd than I am, give them a try. Like I said, I&#x27;m sure they work really well. Just not my thing.</li>
            <li> I have extremely callused heels and toes. I have tried many different things to try to get my feet to look and feel softer. While these have not completely gotten rid of my calluses, they have improved them by about 88%! I do wear them longer than it tells you to wear them... I usually wear them at night about 4-5 times a week. I wash them with mild soap and water every time I use them. I also put some baby oil on my feet when taking them off and then wash my feet with soap and water, adding a little baby oil after I dry my feet as well. Since my feel are so rough, I did not expect these booties to completely take away my calluses, but I am satisfied with how much improvement I have seen. I will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> These gel socks are amazing.  I have purchased two pairs for myself and several pairs to give out as gifts.  I live in Las Vegas, so having dry feet is very common.  I wear these to bed a few times a week and my feet feel and look so much better.</li>
            <li> They worked overnight. I could truly feel the difference in the softness of my feet.  I highly recommend these socks.</li>
            <li> Make your feet feel very soft. Anti slip bottoms for good traction. Have yet to wash them, so that&#x27;s the only mystery.</li>
            <li> Short version of story - I had nerve damage in my legs and feet and become very dry and cracked. I&#x27;m using a cream too, but these seem to work amazingly. The only downside is having to handwash. I highly recommend over the tons of special foot creams I&#x27;ve ordered in the past. No idea how they work, but they really work for me. My feet are soft and pretty much crack / scale free now.</li>
            <li> Well it feels nice on your feet an it leaves them very smooth I got this cause my girlfriend like rubbing on me but she has ashy feet an I hate it but now her feet are ok. . I like them,  they do get hot after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I gave some of these as gifts. Everyone loved them. Hope to get more. They make your feet feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> The booties are great!  Perfect for those of us with dry, cracked heels!  I started using them after my last pedi, and my feet still look and feel great.</li>
            <li> They really work!  They have a thick layer of gel on the bottom as well as the top, good quality and very comfortable to walk in.  My feet were so bad that I was surprised at the improvement after the first wearing.  These are my favorite health improvement item so far!</li>
            <li> Compares well with other products....gel lasted a bit longer.  Would definately purchase again.  Very comfortable and feels very gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li> My feet feels great when I take them off. Walking in the NYC streets is no joke these will get your feet back in tip top shape. The grippies on th bottom are great.</li>
            <li> A great product! My feet felt really soft after wearing them. I am giving some as gifts and promoting them with my patients.</li>
            <li> These socks are very strange.  They are gummy on the inside and can on,y be worn a few times. You can&#x27;t wash them and can only wear them for about 2o min at a time according to the manufacturer. Not really what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would be a great gift for my roommate who loves manicures and pedicures and slipper socks just as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These came in a pack of three. They remind me a little of hospital socks...the are warm, thick, cozy material. They are skid resistant and breatheable. If your feet sweat easily, you won&#x27;t need to worry when wearing these as they are made from breathable cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to use them twice a week for 20 minutes. I forgot I still had then on and fell asleep with them on. When I woke up the next morning, my feet were already smooth and soft! After 1 use! Wow! I get dry, cracked heels and tough skin due to being on my feet all day and a high arch. This moisture gel really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel does stick to the sock when you first get them, but that&#x27;s simple to fix just peel the gel side away from the top of the sock it comes apart easily. They are cold when you first put them on but quickly warm up. I walked around the house in these and they were actually more comfortable than my orthopedic inserts for my shoes! It was like walking on a cloud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that you can clean them easily with a damp cloth by gently wiping the gel. These come with very simple care instructions.  To me, these using any salon tools. It&#x27;s a time and money saver. Just wear the socks and presto! Smooth \\&quot;happy feet\\&quot;! The reasoning why these were so hard to get during Christmas shopping time is now obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying more for myself and friends! I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> If you have dry feet from eczema, cracked heels or just plain dry skin, this may be something useful. I got this for a family member who had dry feet from eczema. The dermatologist had recommended moisturizer at night, and wearing socks to hold it in, but regular cotton socks were actually sucking out the moisturizer and drying up the feet. We got these socks- it has a gel like lining on the inside, which is non breathable. So it holds the cream in and does not dry the feet out.  Having said that, I would not recommend using this all the time, probably just during the night. Because, having non-breathable cover for your feet for 24 hours is probably not a good idea.</li>
            <li> I had originally seen these on a news story... then decided to order them.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect fit.  Perfect comfort.  My feet are in such great shape after wearing them for a few nights to bed (yes, my feet were in poor shape!).  Combined with using a Ped Egg to smooth my feet after wearing the booties, I have feet that are as smooth and comfortable as they have ever been.&lt;br /&gt;I have been diabetic for many years, and while I am healthy, my feet react terribly to the winter in Wisconsin.  I was able to get my feet back into great shape after just a few days!</li>
            <li> Fantastic value and these smoothen even the roughest of feet without lotion. SOLD! Will buy again and will  recommend to others as well.</li>
            <li> I had some booties like this from Bliss (although the Bliss ones come up higher, past your ankle) a few years ago that cost so much more, and these are just as good!  With these, for less than what I paid for one pair of the high-end gel booties, you get three pairs!  So I gave one pair to a friend and now she&#x27;s hooked on them, too!  If you&#x27;ve never used them before, these are really great if you have dry feet and cuticles (especially in the Winter).  I usually put on some lotion and then put these on my feet around bed time.  Sometimes I wake in the middle of the night and take them off because my feet feel too hot, but that&#x27;s just me.  But when I take them off, my feet are soooo soft and look freshly pedicured!  Sometimes I wear them around for a half hour or so during the day for a quick &#x27;touch up&amp;#34; if I&#x27;m going to wear open-toed shoes out somewhere.  They have a sort of &amp;#34;tread&amp;#34; on the bottom so you can wear them around like slippers.</li>
            <li> The instructions say use only for 20 minutes twice/week.  They really help as we have very low humidity and this has dried out the soles of my feet. I recommend these.</li>
