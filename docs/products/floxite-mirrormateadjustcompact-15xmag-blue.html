            <li>Great compact mirror for travel.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer encloses an order form for replacement bulbs which is great.</li>
            <li>The plus side to is that because of its size, it makes a great travel mirror.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel, great magnification, I use it every day.</li>
            <li>For about a month or so, it was great, as I could find my contacts in the corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I wanted- lightweight, lighted with great magnification (</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>Highlight is the magnification and one can take care of eyebrows, etc., with great ease.</li>
            <li>The magnification is great.</li>
            <li>she was really happy i could find this in amazon for her  </li>
            <li>and I have been happy with it.</li>
            <li>it was great until it stopped working.</li>
            <li>The magnification is great, it&#x27;s compact and works well.</li>
            <li>I have used this mirror before, and it works great to find anything in your eyes, my eyelashes have a tendency to grow towards eye instead of away, ouch</li>
            <li>but the seller was great with my return.</li>
            <li>Great for tweezing eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>and that is great when you just can&#x27;t touch anything anymore because your holding your pencil and your eye to draw a line</li>
            <li>We happily endorse this product.</li>
            <li>it works great when on the run.</li>
            <li>The product is great.</li>
            <li>Very handy but ones eyes must adjust to the magnification before focusing well for use.</li>
            <li>I did not even know I had, very handy for travel which was why I bought it.</li>
            <li>Very handy</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product but it does not suit my needs.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and compact for Traveling.</li>
            <li>What an amazing mirror!  </li>
            <li>Appropriate for giving to sister, best friend (or anyone who would not be offended by receiving a mirror!)</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>so I would assume it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>its good for putting make up and tweezing eyebrows</li>
            <li>The mirror is good but the lighting is fair.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a good magnifier that wouldn&#x27;t leap off the room mirror at me when the suction cups give up (the method i had used before).</li>
            <li>I think it will be good for travel as it is lightweight &amp; compact.  </li>
            <li>The light is the best thing I could think of for a portable mirror</li>
            <li>Light and sturdy a great buy!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a perfect size &amp; weight (light) for traveling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size to put in your travel bag and is easily folded up to keep handy in a vanity drawer.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product for the price paid.</li>
            <li>This one seems a good bit lighter in weight, but it does the job nicely.  </li>
            <li>Liked the size and quality of design however, the clarity if the mirror reflection not as good.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it&#x27;s ot ideal for applying makeup, but it&#x27;s sure better than no mirror at all when traveling or at the gym.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Strong, well made and attractive.</li>
            <li>Great idea as it is free standing</li>
            <li>The case and light are great.  </li>
            <li>Nobody needs to see their own face this closely.</li>
            <li>so I got him one of his own</li>
            <li>I use it for make-up and tweezing, I&#x27;m sure it would be good for contact lenses as well.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice travel mirror.</li>
            <li>The stand is nice and functional.</li>
            <li>The lighted feature is nice but the magnification is too much.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This is really handy for taking on a trip.  </li>
            <li>And since&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s battery-operated, you don&#x27;t have to think of what kind of electrical converter you might need.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if Amazon posted where the items they sell are manufactured.</li>
            <li>The light and stand have came in very handy.  </li>
            <li>Great travel mirror, the light is good, light weight and compact.  </li>
            <li>The light is nice and bright, and the magnification is amazing.</li>
            <li>received it quickly, which made me happy for my upcoming trip.</li>
            <li>The price was good and it is easy to travel with</li>
            <li>Another good feature is the light.  </li>
            <li>Nice for travel but needs to add a bit more flexibility in adjusting the angle of the mirror to avoid tipping.</li>
            <li>So far seems to work perfectly.</li>
            <li>The light is great, and I love the hands free operation!</li>
            <li>Folds into a compact that fits easily in my purse, and the light works great.  </li>
            <li>this mirror is so strong!  </li>
            <li>The amplification on this is wonderful and the light really helps me see my eyebrows so that I can evenly pluck them.  </li>
            <li>A better solution is to power the lights with just two AAA rechargeable cells (see my Customer Image).</li>
            <li>Boy, oh, boy, once I focused in, I may have seen more than I bargained for.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok for tossing into a bag.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re planning to travel to several countries this year and hotels &amp; cruise ships aren&#x27;t always reliable to have what a woman needs to look her best.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>She then bought more of them for gifts for her friends.  </li>
            <li>The magnification level is astonishing.  </li>
            <li>I love this travel mirror and use it on every trip I take</li>
            <li>I love this lighted 15X travel mirror</li>
            <li>Love the way it fold up for travel and the arm extends for setup</li>
            <li>I love the case which makes it indestructible in a suitcase on an airplane.  </li>
            <li>it is almost touching.  </li>
            <li>I have used it many times since it arrived &amp; will make do with it</li>
            <li>I fooled myself into buying it, thinking that 15X must be 50% better than 10X magnification.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror thinking 15X magnification would be better.  </li>
            <li>it cause she had to bring it up too close to be able to see.  </li>
            <li>Great value, very recommended.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I think 10x would have been better for me</li>
            <li>love the stand .</li>
            <li>I love how you can position this in so many ways.</li>
            <li>Very excited to have with me.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for...small, compact with good magnification.</li>
            <li>Love how strong it is, but you can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>The lighting and magnification were very good for getting at the facial stray hairs I wanted to remove.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if LED light sources were used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Safe and sound.</li>
            <li>I was good at always turning it off when done, so it didn&#x27;t seem reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Forget the full face!</li>
            <li>Plus, the light is really bright...almost too bright.</li>
            <li>Easy to fold and carry.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to find somewhere at a convenient height to place mirror for easy make-up application.</li>
            <li>Easily fits in purse.</li>
            <li>Will be easy to pack and travel with.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, works perfect for international travel.</li>
            <li>Easy open/close with conveniently placed light button.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the mirror is sturdy and arrived just fine.</li>
            <li>It goes through batteries quick but it shows EVERY hair!</li>
            <li>Fits in my purse, the magnification and light is just what I need to put my contacts in.</li>
            <li>Portable, light weight, with a light.</li>
            <li>The use of rechargeable batteries also prolongs the lifespan of light bulbs.</li>
            <li>Great compact mirror for daily use and for travel.</li>
            <li>it has a light and helps me see in darker areas.  </li>
            <li>And the light is sufficient.</li>
            <li>The wire connecting light to mirror broke from closing it each day.  </li>
            <li>Mirror was distorted and product was cheaply made plastic.</li>
            <li>The light works as it is supposed to work.  </li>
            <li>I like the light, but would not recommend.</li>
            <li>It stands up by itself leaving both hands free for whatever the intricate task is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, closes to protect the mirror, and has a light.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see if the light works as the batteries were removed from the package.  </li>
            <li>Compact and light.  </li>
            <li>The mirror was good, wires got worn where the mirror bends,  wasn&#x27;t even 3 months old then didn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li>I think the product is great and is pretty versatile if you are near sighted</li>
            <li>I like everything about this compact mirror, nice navy color, folds easy, smooth and small, lite good</li>
            <li>At first, I was totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The one DOWN-SIDE to this product is that IT IS TOO POWERFUL A MAGNIFICATION!</li>
            <li>and I need a larger mirror radius to apply makeup successfully.</li>
            <li>And the light is needed because the lighting in hotel rooms is very rarely bright enough for this.  </li>
            <li>The light is acceptable, not super bright but definitely better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I wear glasses and cannot see well enough to apply eye liner and mascara without my glasses, so I needed a good mirror for travel.  </li>
            <li>it may be good for tweezing or eye makeup only</li>
            <li>I travel for work, months at a time and had to leave my full size mirror at home.</li>
            <li>This mirror is ok for focusing on 1 area of the face...&amp; very close up.  </li>
            <li>It is OK but after couple of days working the light is not working, even with new batteries.</li>
            <li>The light is at just the right angle.</li>
            <li>This mirror is great for extreme close up looks at your face, like eyebrow tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Build seems adequate for the price.</li>
            <li>The first one didn&#x27;t light up but the seller got another one to me quickly.</li>
            <li>Light weight, distortion-free travel mirror is an excellent size for slipping into purse/backpack, or as an &#x27;up close &amp; personal&#x27; accessory at home.</li>
            <li>This is a great help with the latter problem, in particular.</li>
            <li>It lights up my eye area so I can see clearly where my lenses are on my eyes that makes removing them so easy!  </li>
            <li>The light is handy and provides reasonably uniform illumination for those hotel bathrooms that don&#x27;t have enough light where you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very portable and easy to travel with, throw it in your bag and go.</li>
            <li>unless you really have eye problems, the 15x was too strong</li>
            <li>, Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>The magnification is so powerful that all you see is an eye or an eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>Yes, if you manage to place this product that near to your eyeballs, you will definitely be able to apply eye make-up, etc.</li>
            <li>With this mirror as my aid I am able to see clearly to remove my lenses.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time I have bought this mirror and while it has come in handy each time and about after 6 months the bulbs burn out, and bulbs you can&#x27;t replace.  </li>
            <li>Mirror is fine -- folding functionality is good -- however, the light did not last long and replacing batteries did not help...</li>
            <li>The price was good compared to other mirrors I&#x27;ve seen in stores</li>
            <li>It has just the right size and magnification for this intended purpose.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>The two miniature incandescent light bulbs are far from \\&quot;super bright\\&quot; as advertised.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is so small, and the magnification so great, that you literally need to be an inch away from the glass for your face to be in focus.</li>
            <li>The 15x magnification is a little too much for makeup application, but great for tweezing.</li>
            <li>It really looks nice all weapped up in thr bubble wrap and that is where it will stay until I go my next trip.</li>
            <li>The light is in the right place so it doesn&#x27;t create a circular &#x27;halo&#x27; around my eyes that so many other lighted mirrors do.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, but is too cumbersome for travel and offers no protective case.</li>
            <li>Super clear, super zoom.  </li>
            <li>The compact hard case makes this great for travel.</li>
            <li>Light is bright &amp; definitely an asset, both in daylight &amp; darker settings by providing a diffused, evenly displayed glow that highlights facial features, rather than harsher reflective glare from mirror, (or too dim to be useful).</li>
            <li>(*) Footnote:  </li>
            <li>I bought it for traveling &amp; it turned out to be exactly what</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described and what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I had to replace the first 15x travel mirror exactly like this one.  </li>
            <li>this is exactly what was described and is what I needed.</li>
            <li>But it sure beats by a mile what I had when away from home for a month last year--which was nothing!</li>
            <li>first one I had for over five years with no problems.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror and would definitely recommend it to anyone who has vision problems or needs magnification for putting on make-up etc.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not the thing to use for applying makeup, which I did not buy it for, but just ok for tweezing.  </li>
            <li>my second one, love it</li>
            <li>I wish it was just a bit bigger, but I love this.  </li>
            <li>If that was the only issue be better rating but it not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered it and hope to have it around for a long time.</li>
            <li>That is pretty much what I am using it for.</li>
            <li>Good magnification but small mirror.</li>
            <li>It was amazing to see that the image is upside down.</li>
            <li>I already have a large, pedestal magnifying mirror in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It folds up into itself and looks like a large compact.</li>
            <li>The light is ok; not sure I will use the light, but necessary for some.</li>
            <li>little pricey but handy mirror according to the wife.</li>
            <li>It was a little more powerful than I thought.  </li>
            <li>Compact lighted travel mirror work very well but did not meet our needs.</li>
            <li>The 15x magnification does take some getting used to -- the mirror is much closer to my face than I was accustomed to with my 2x or 3x mirrors.</li>
            <li>zoom is too much.  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time and it was as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much the zoom would be.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too much.  </li>
            <li>It has to be held very close to your skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;the seller was very prompt in shipping.  </li>
            <li>I love the style, the compactness when it is closed, and its ability to adjust to any position.  </li>
            <li>After a month, the light simply stopped working.  </li>
            <li>This lighted, adjustable travel mirror is very compact, yet allows &amp;#34;up close &amp; personal&amp;#34; reflections that I don&#x27;t get from my cosmetic table&#x27;s 10X mirror.  </li>
            <li>This mirror really makes eyebrow tweezing a cinch.  </li>
            <li>real well.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase</li>
            <li>Since I wear glasses for close-up, I really need the 15x magnification.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is very compact.  </li>
            <li>This is the third one I purchased because after a while the connections for the light stop connecting and the closing latch breaks.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Very warped image.  </li>
            <li>if you really want to see all the wrinkles, etc., this mirror does it.  </li>
            <li>but you have to get your fact really up close to see.  </li>
            <li>like this so much that I keep one in the bathroom at all times and have another for travel.</li>
            <li>Very misleading</li>
            <li>and I received the mirror very quickly thanks to Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>This little guy is perfect for hunting for small imperfections.  </li>
            <li>although the magnification was great the actual size was too small for me to use .  </li>
            <li>there are probably better values available considering that half of the functionality didn&#x27;t even last 6 months.</li>
            <li>Not useful as table top travel mirror for makeup - too blurry</li>
            <li>If you are more than an inch from the mirror, you are upside down in the image.  </li>
            <li>and I also love the compact size it folds down into.</li>
            <li>The exact mirror is sold at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond for $19.99 where you have a 20% discount pretty much constantly.</li>
            <li>my particular case, I kept this compact mirror in my office in case of emergency \\&quot;Do-</li>
            <li>highly recommend for travel or home use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>A+; highly recommended</li>
            <li>chose it because of high magnification.  </li>
            <li>The power is too high.  </li>
            <li>The magnification is way to high.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised when I got this,15X makes your face SO large its unusable, I&#x27;m not one to write reviews</li>
            <li>I can see Every little hair, and aim better with the tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife wanted strong magnification and this one produces extremely well for her - unsure why she needs it</li>
            <li>The small size makes it suitable as a travel mirror.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was defective because I wasn&#x27;t holding it close enough to my face to really focus.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is OK for VERY close view of one eye or a small part of the face if that is your purpose.  </li>
            <li>Such intense magnification is not useful to me, with glasses but clearly able to see.  </li>
            <li>I am grateful for this new vision.  </li>
            <li>this was a gift to a friend, who already new the product ....</li>
            <li>15X bonus, clear, no distortion!</li>
            <li>*) can only provide useable illumination for around 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>My first order was the same!  </li>
            <li>We found a man in a local old-fashioned hardware store who was willing to work with my husband for 20 minutes to find the tiniest of screwdrivers until he managed to tighten the screw.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m near sighted!</li>
            <li>10X may work better for this size mirror; not sure.  </li>
            <li>but if you have a small to medium bag or using this or overnight or travel you will be pleased</li>
            <li>we returned the item to seller and received a full refund (minus shipping) promptly.</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly and was as expected.</li>
            <li>This little gem at 15x magnification does a fine job.  </li>
            <li>You must place the mirror SO NEAR TO YOUR FACE in order to see your face and eyes with no distortion.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>However, the magnification is simply too much for the size of the mirror.</li>
            <li>It could, however, be another inch or two in diameter, and I think the 15x might actually be too much magnification.  </li>
            <li>My old mirror didn&#x27;t have a stand and this should function the way I want.</li>
            <li>but it really should be double or triple the size.</li>
            <li>However, this was a gift for my mother who has so far sighted.  </li>
            <li>You can open it a few ways and most times I just hold the sides and gently pull it open.</li>
            <li>So while it&#x27;s useful for very specific jobs (like plucking chin hairs) it&#x27;s not so useful for plucking your eyebrows because you generally have to turn your head slightly to do that--</li>
            <li>The edges can seem a little warped due to the high level of magnification, but you will be able to see every pore and hair.</li>
            <li>It is too strong a magnification, I have trouble finding a spot that I do not see double.</li>
            <li>This is so highly magnified that it has to be no more than 3\\&quot; from your eyes to be useful.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve taken it on a couple of trips and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be fragile at all.</li>
            <li>I can barely see let alone use this mirror.</li>
            <li>It is just ridiculously too strong for me.</li>
            <li>As an elderly lady with poor eyesight, I was finally able to apply my makeup, including mascara with ease and accuracy.  </li>
            <li>I bought a 10x mirror but had a hard time plucking eyebrows as it wasn&#x27;t strong enough.  </li>
            <li>Combined with high magnification, it gives a very limited visible area.</li>
            <li>The only thing that you must be careful of is, that you remember to shut light off before you close up, otherwise the battery will go dead.</li>
            <li>Way too small to really be useful.</li>
            <li>I wanted a decent magnifying mirror for travel that would aid me in putting on eye-liner and other make-up.  </li>
            <li>A special purpose item, and not advertised as such, at least not that I could see.</li>
            <li>The light is not really bright enough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s pretty darned useful for travel.  </li>
            <li>so if you want to check both eyes or your whole face, for example, you will need to look in a regular mirror or a larger, less magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>I should have realized that it was of poor quality since the enclosure said &amp;#34; you have purchased a product of fine quality&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> Great compact mirror for travel.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer encloses an order form for replacement bulbs which is great.</li>
            <li> The plus side to is that because of its size, it makes a great travel mirror.  </li>
            <li> Great for travel, great magnification, I use it every day.</li>
            <li> For about a month or so, it was great, as I could find my contacts in the corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I wanted- lightweight, lighted with great magnification (</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> Highlight is the magnification and one can take care of eyebrows, etc., with great ease.</li>
            <li> The magnification is great.</li>
            <li> she was really happy i could find this in amazon for her  </li>
            <li> and I have been happy with it.</li>
            <li> it was great until it stopped working.</li>
            <li> The magnification is great, it&#x27;s compact and works well.</li>
            <li> I have used this mirror before, and it works great to find anything in your eyes, my eyelashes have a tendency to grow towards eye instead of away, ouch</li>
            <li> but the seller was great with my return.</li>
            <li> Great for tweezing eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> and that is great when you just can&#x27;t touch anything anymore because your holding your pencil and your eye to draw a line</li>
            <li> We happily endorse this product.</li>
            <li> it works great when on the run.</li>
            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> Very handy but ones eyes must adjust to the magnification before focusing well for use.</li>
            <li> I did not even know I had, very handy for travel which was why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Very handy</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product but it does not suit my needs.  </li>
            <li> Very nice and compact for Traveling.</li>
            <li> What an amazing mirror!  </li>
            <li> Appropriate for giving to sister, best friend (or anyone who would not be offended by receiving a mirror!)</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> so I would assume it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> its good for putting make up and tweezing eyebrows</li>
            <li> The mirror is good but the lighting is fair.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a good magnifier that wouldn&#x27;t leap off the room mirror at me when the suction cups give up (the method i had used before).</li>
            <li> I think it will be good for travel as it is lightweight &amp; compact.  </li>
            <li> The light is the best thing I could think of for a portable mirror</li>
            <li> Light and sturdy a great buy!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a perfect size &amp; weight (light) for traveling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size to put in your travel bag and is easily folded up to keep handy in a vanity drawer.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product for the price paid.</li>
            <li> This one seems a good bit lighter in weight, but it does the job nicely.  </li>
            <li> Liked the size and quality of design however, the clarity if the mirror reflection not as good.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it&#x27;s ot ideal for applying makeup, but it&#x27;s sure better than no mirror at all when traveling or at the gym.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!  </li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Strong, well made and attractive.</li>
            <li> Great idea as it is free standing</li>
            <li> The case and light are great.  </li>
            <li> Nobody needs to see their own face this closely.</li>
            <li> so I got him one of his own</li>
            <li> I use it for make-up and tweezing, I&#x27;m sure it would be good for contact lenses as well.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice travel mirror.</li>
            <li> The stand is nice and functional.</li>
            <li> The lighted feature is nice but the magnification is too much.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> This is really handy for taking on a trip.  </li>
            <li> And since&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s battery-operated, you don&#x27;t have to think of what kind of electrical converter you might need.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if Amazon posted where the items they sell are manufactured.</li>
            <li> The light and stand have came in very handy.  </li>
            <li> Great travel mirror, the light is good, light weight and compact.  </li>
            <li> The light is nice and bright, and the magnification is amazing.</li>
            <li> received it quickly, which made me happy for my upcoming trip.</li>
            <li> The price was good and it is easy to travel with</li>
            <li> Another good feature is the light.  </li>
            <li> Nice for travel but needs to add a bit more flexibility in adjusting the angle of the mirror to avoid tipping.</li>
            <li> So far seems to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> The light is great, and I love the hands free operation!</li>
            <li> Folds into a compact that fits easily in my purse, and the light works great.  </li>
            <li> this mirror is so strong!  </li>
            <li> The amplification on this is wonderful and the light really helps me see my eyebrows so that I can evenly pluck them.  </li>
            <li> A better solution is to power the lights with just two AAA rechargeable cells (see my Customer Image).</li>
            <li> Boy, oh, boy, once I focused in, I may have seen more than I bargained for.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok for tossing into a bag.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re planning to travel to several countries this year and hotels &amp; cruise ships aren&#x27;t always reliable to have what a woman needs to look her best.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it for many years.  </li>
            <li> She then bought more of them for gifts for her friends.  </li>
            <li> The magnification level is astonishing.  </li>
            <li> I love this travel mirror and use it on every trip I take</li>
            <li> I love this lighted 15X travel mirror</li>
            <li> Love the way it fold up for travel and the arm extends for setup</li>
            <li> I love the case which makes it indestructible in a suitcase on an airplane.  </li>
            <li> it is almost touching.  </li>
            <li> I have used it many times since it arrived &amp; will make do with it</li>
            <li> I fooled myself into buying it, thinking that 15X must be 50% better than 10X magnification.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror thinking 15X magnification would be better.  </li>
            <li> it cause she had to bring it up too close to be able to see.  </li>
            <li> Great value, very recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I think 10x would have been better for me</li>
            <li> love the stand .</li>
            <li> I love how you can position this in so many ways.</li>
            <li> Very excited to have with me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for...small, compact with good magnification.</li>
            <li> Love how strong it is, but you can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> The lighting and magnification were very good for getting at the facial stray hairs I wanted to remove.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if LED light sources were used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Safe and sound.</li>
            <li> I was good at always turning it off when done, so it didn&#x27;t seem reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Forget the full face!</li>
            <li> Plus, the light is really bright...almost too bright.</li>
            <li> Easy to fold and carry.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to find somewhere at a convenient height to place mirror for easy make-up application.</li>
            <li> Easily fits in purse.</li>
            <li> Will be easy to pack and travel with.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, works perfect for international travel.</li>
            <li> Easy open/close with conveniently placed light button.</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the mirror is sturdy and arrived just fine.</li>
            <li> It goes through batteries quick but it shows EVERY hair!</li>
            <li> Fits in my purse, the magnification and light is just what I need to put my contacts in.</li>
            <li> Portable, light weight, with a light.</li>
            <li> The use of rechargeable batteries also prolongs the lifespan of light bulbs.</li>
            <li> Great compact mirror for daily use and for travel.</li>
            <li> it has a light and helps me see in darker areas.  </li>
            <li> And the light is sufficient.</li>
            <li> The wire connecting light to mirror broke from closing it each day.  </li>
            <li> Mirror was distorted and product was cheaply made plastic.</li>
            <li> The light works as it is supposed to work.  </li>
            <li> I like the light, but would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It stands up by itself leaving both hands free for whatever the intricate task is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, closes to protect the mirror, and has a light.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see if the light works as the batteries were removed from the package.  </li>
            <li> Compact and light.  </li>
            <li> The mirror was good, wires got worn where the mirror bends,  wasn&#x27;t even 3 months old then didn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> I think the product is great and is pretty versatile if you are near sighted</li>
            <li> I like everything about this compact mirror, nice navy color, folds easy, smooth and small, lite good</li>
            <li> At first, I was totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The one DOWN-SIDE to this product is that IT IS TOO POWERFUL A MAGNIFICATION!</li>
            <li> and I need a larger mirror radius to apply makeup successfully.</li>
            <li> And the light is needed because the lighting in hotel rooms is very rarely bright enough for this.  </li>
            <li> The light is acceptable, not super bright but definitely better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses and cannot see well enough to apply eye liner and mascara without my glasses, so I needed a good mirror for travel.  </li>
            <li> it may be good for tweezing or eye makeup only</li>
            <li> I travel for work, months at a time and had to leave my full size mirror at home.</li>
            <li> This mirror is ok for focusing on 1 area of the face...&amp; very close up.  </li>
            <li> It is OK but after couple of days working the light is not working, even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> The light is at just the right angle.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for extreme close up looks at your face, like eyebrow tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Build seems adequate for the price.</li>
            <li> The first one didn&#x27;t light up but the seller got another one to me quickly.</li>
            <li> Light weight, distortion-free travel mirror is an excellent size for slipping into purse/backpack, or as an &#x27;up close &amp; personal&#x27; accessory at home.</li>
            <li> This is a great help with the latter problem, in particular.</li>
            <li> It lights up my eye area so I can see clearly where my lenses are on my eyes that makes removing them so easy!  </li>
            <li> The light is handy and provides reasonably uniform illumination for those hotel bathrooms that don&#x27;t have enough light where you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very portable and easy to travel with, throw it in your bag and go.</li>
            <li> unless you really have eye problems, the 15x was too strong</li>
            <li> , Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The magnification is so powerful that all you see is an eye or an eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> Yes, if you manage to place this product that near to your eyeballs, you will definitely be able to apply eye make-up, etc.</li>
            <li> With this mirror as my aid I am able to see clearly to remove my lenses.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this mirror and while it has come in handy each time and about after 6 months the bulbs burn out, and bulbs you can&#x27;t replace.  </li>
            <li> Mirror is fine -- folding functionality is good -- however, the light did not last long and replacing batteries did not help...</li>
            <li> The price was good compared to other mirrors I&#x27;ve seen in stores</li>
            <li> It has just the right size and magnification for this intended purpose.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> The two miniature incandescent light bulbs are far from \\&quot;super bright\\&quot; as advertised.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is so small, and the magnification so great, that you literally need to be an inch away from the glass for your face to be in focus.</li>
            <li> The 15x magnification is a little too much for makeup application, but great for tweezing.</li>
            <li> It really looks nice all weapped up in thr bubble wrap and that is where it will stay until I go my next trip.</li>
            <li> The light is in the right place so it doesn&#x27;t create a circular &#x27;halo&#x27; around my eyes that so many other lighted mirrors do.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, but is too cumbersome for travel and offers no protective case.</li>
            <li> Super clear, super zoom.  </li>
            <li> The compact hard case makes this great for travel.</li>
            <li> Light is bright &amp; definitely an asset, both in daylight &amp; darker settings by providing a diffused, evenly displayed glow that highlights facial features, rather than harsher reflective glare from mirror, (or too dim to be useful).</li>
            <li> (*) Footnote:  </li>
            <li> I bought it for traveling &amp; it turned out to be exactly what</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described and what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the first 15x travel mirror exactly like this one.  </li>
            <li> this is exactly what was described and is what I needed.</li>
            <li> But it sure beats by a mile what I had when away from home for a month last year--which was nothing!</li>
            <li> first one I had for over five years with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror and would definitely recommend it to anyone who has vision problems or needs magnification for putting on make-up etc.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not the thing to use for applying makeup, which I did not buy it for, but just ok for tweezing.  </li>
            <li> my second one, love it</li>
            <li> I wish it was just a bit bigger, but I love this.  </li>
            <li> If that was the only issue be better rating but it not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered it and hope to have it around for a long time.</li>
            <li> That is pretty much what I am using it for.</li>
            <li> Good magnification but small mirror.</li>
            <li> It was amazing to see that the image is upside down.</li>
            <li> I already have a large, pedestal magnifying mirror in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It folds up into itself and looks like a large compact.</li>
            <li> The light is ok; not sure I will use the light, but necessary for some.</li>
            <li> little pricey but handy mirror according to the wife.</li>
            <li> It was a little more powerful than I thought.  </li>
            <li> Compact lighted travel mirror work very well but did not meet our needs.</li>
            <li> The 15x magnification does take some getting used to -- the mirror is much closer to my face than I was accustomed to with my 2x or 3x mirrors.</li>
            <li> zoom is too much.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it was as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much the zoom would be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too much.  </li>
            <li> It has to be held very close to your skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;the seller was very prompt in shipping.  </li>
            <li> I love the style, the compactness when it is closed, and its ability to adjust to any position.  </li>
            <li> After a month, the light simply stopped working.  </li>
            <li> This lighted, adjustable travel mirror is very compact, yet allows &amp;#34;up close &amp; personal&amp;#34; reflections that I don&#x27;t get from my cosmetic table&#x27;s 10X mirror.  </li>
            <li> This mirror really makes eyebrow tweezing a cinch.  </li>
            <li> real well.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase</li>
            <li> Since I wear glasses for close-up, I really need the 15x magnification.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is very compact.  </li>
            <li> This is the third one I purchased because after a while the connections for the light stop connecting and the closing latch breaks.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Very warped image.  </li>
            <li> if you really want to see all the wrinkles, etc., this mirror does it.  </li>
            <li> but you have to get your fact really up close to see.  </li>
            <li> like this so much that I keep one in the bathroom at all times and have another for travel.</li>
            <li> Very misleading</li>
            <li> and I received the mirror very quickly thanks to Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> This little guy is perfect for hunting for small imperfections.  </li>
            <li> although the magnification was great the actual size was too small for me to use .  </li>
            <li> there are probably better values available considering that half of the functionality didn&#x27;t even last 6 months.</li>
            <li> Not useful as table top travel mirror for makeup - too blurry</li>
            <li> If you are more than an inch from the mirror, you are upside down in the image.  </li>
            <li> and I also love the compact size it folds down into.</li>
            <li> The exact mirror is sold at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond for $19.99 where you have a 20% discount pretty much constantly.</li>
            <li> my particular case, I kept this compact mirror in my office in case of emergency \\&quot;Do-</li>
            <li> highly recommend for travel or home use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> A+; highly recommended</li>
            <li> chose it because of high magnification.  </li>
            <li> The power is too high.  </li>
            <li> The magnification is way to high.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised when I got this,15X makes your face SO large its unusable, I&#x27;m not one to write reviews</li>
            <li> I can see Every little hair, and aim better with the tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife wanted strong magnification and this one produces extremely well for her - unsure why she needs it</li>
            <li> The small size makes it suitable as a travel mirror.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was defective because I wasn&#x27;t holding it close enough to my face to really focus.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is OK for VERY close view of one eye or a small part of the face if that is your purpose.  </li>
            <li> Such intense magnification is not useful to me, with glasses but clearly able to see.  </li>
            <li> I am grateful for this new vision.  </li>
            <li> this was a gift to a friend, who already new the product ....</li>
            <li> 15X bonus, clear, no distortion!</li>
            <li> *) can only provide useable illumination for around 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> My first order was the same!  </li>
            <li> We found a man in a local old-fashioned hardware store who was willing to work with my husband for 20 minutes to find the tiniest of screwdrivers until he managed to tighten the screw.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m near sighted!</li>
            <li> 10X may work better for this size mirror; not sure.  </li>
            <li> but if you have a small to medium bag or using this or overnight or travel you will be pleased</li>
            <li> we returned the item to seller and received a full refund (minus shipping) promptly.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and was as expected.</li>
            <li> This little gem at 15x magnification does a fine job.  </li>
            <li> You must place the mirror SO NEAR TO YOUR FACE in order to see your face and eyes with no distortion.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> However, the magnification is simply too much for the size of the mirror.</li>
            <li> It could, however, be another inch or two in diameter, and I think the 15x might actually be too much magnification.  </li>
            <li> My old mirror didn&#x27;t have a stand and this should function the way I want.</li>
            <li> but it really should be double or triple the size.</li>
            <li> However, this was a gift for my mother who has so far sighted.  </li>
            <li> You can open it a few ways and most times I just hold the sides and gently pull it open.</li>
            <li> So while it&#x27;s useful for very specific jobs (like plucking chin hairs) it&#x27;s not so useful for plucking your eyebrows because you generally have to turn your head slightly to do that--</li>
            <li> The edges can seem a little warped due to the high level of magnification, but you will be able to see every pore and hair.</li>
            <li> It is too strong a magnification, I have trouble finding a spot that I do not see double.</li>
            <li> This is so highly magnified that it has to be no more than 3\\&quot; from your eyes to be useful.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve taken it on a couple of trips and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be fragile at all.</li>
            <li> I can barely see let alone use this mirror.</li>
            <li> It is just ridiculously too strong for me.</li>
            <li> As an elderly lady with poor eyesight, I was finally able to apply my makeup, including mascara with ease and accuracy.  </li>
            <li> I bought a 10x mirror but had a hard time plucking eyebrows as it wasn&#x27;t strong enough.  </li>
            <li> Combined with high magnification, it gives a very limited visible area.</li>
            <li> The only thing that you must be careful of is, that you remember to shut light off before you close up, otherwise the battery will go dead.</li>
            <li> Way too small to really be useful.</li>
            <li> I wanted a decent magnifying mirror for travel that would aid me in putting on eye-liner and other make-up.  </li>
            <li> A special purpose item, and not advertised as such, at least not that I could see.</li>
            <li> The light is not really bright enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s pretty darned useful for travel.  </li>
            <li> so if you want to check both eyes or your whole face, for example, you will need to look in a regular mirror or a larger, less magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> I should have realized that it was of poor quality since the enclosure said &amp;#34; you have purchased a product of fine quality&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a little awkward about this mirror - probably because of the super magnification - is that you have to hold it at just the right distance from your face (no more than a couple of inches) to really see clearly.  </li>
            <li> and then you can only make out a small patch at a time, everything else is too out of focus with that much zoom.</li>
            <li> Really not a useable mirror as it is too small and not at all useful for travel or anything else in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> but I would not use it for my main mirror everyday.</li>
            <li> Too small and magnifies too large.</li>
            <li> This little mirror has so much magnification in such a small area that only the center is really in focus.</li>
            <li> I probably have average 55 yr old eyes</li>
            <li> I have owned the 10X compact for several years, so long that I can&#x27;t remember how long -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I am just not smart enough to realize open item &#x3D; returned item.</li>
            <li> Not only is it small enough for travel, but the lighted 15X magnification allows me to see my face clearly.</li>
            <li> This is small, compact, sturdy and highly recommended for travel.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, 15x magnification is what I need now to accurately apply eye make-up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price for a couple of months use and especially not when you only use it a couple of times a month at that!</li>
            <li> Reflection not clear.</li>
            <li> Have not attempted to return it yet; not clear on policy.</li>
            <li> Very small to be much use.</li>
            <li> Entire face cannot be viewed due to magnification.  </li>
            <li> It is a little thick, but worth it for the mirror size and the fold-up protection.  </li>
            <li> Also, check to make sure neck piece, where it screws together stays tight, otherwise it will CUT the very thin wires, I keep checking</li>
            <li> Obviously not in new condition.</li>
            <li> It did not live up to the advertised copy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard to focus with as the magnification is a little too much for regular use.  </li>
            <li> The slight malfunction being the point of focus is quite small and you need to be very close to the mirror to find it.</li>
            <li> I bought the small version as a gift for a friend who travels frequently.  </li>
            <li> The screws that hold the mirror&lt;br /&gt;upright are loose and can not be tightened.</li>
            <li> and then if loose, tighten with eyeglass repair kit screwdriver.</li>
            <li> Anything further than that created and upside down image.</li>
            <li> Cant really use it with the stand as it is very difficult to get close enough to see your eye clearly.</li>
            <li> If you pull back even just a little bit, the image gets blurred.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected at all.  </li>
            <li> You cannot see in this compact mirror at all, it was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> When closed, mirror is well protected.</li>
            <li> It just flopped over like a wet noodle.  </li>
            <li> The wire powering it came apart and no real way to fix it.</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very well balanced.</li>
            <li> I am at that age where all of the sudden 1) print everywhere seems really small and 2) hair is just popping out all over the place.</li>
            <li> Small enough to bring out to kitchen or living room--wherever I wanted to use it at.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, you also have to cope with its limitations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This means you can only examine a small region of your face at any one time.</li>
            <li> Over the past four years, it must have paid for itself ten times over.</li>
            <li> It is EXTREMELY disconcerting to be so close to this mirror, almost dizzying.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;but can only see a small area on my face.  </li>
            <li> that wasn&#x27;t too close, while still using the other hand for makeup or tweezers or whatever.</li>
            <li> Use extreme caution as not to hit eyeball tho.</li>
            <li> Extremely magnified.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, you don&#x27;t see a very big area as a result of the magnification and small size (it&#x27;s a TRAVEL mirror, after all)</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is due to its size?</li>
            <li> So I have been using little compact purse mirrors where the magnifying side is just not strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> This is so tiny it is hard to use unless you can hold it with one hand and put on your makeup or contact lens with the other.  </li>
            <li> By looking at the product picture of this item ([[ASIN:B001VHZXOE Lighted Adjustable 15X Travel Mirror]]), it is hard to realize its actual size.</li>
            <li> It was hard to hold it close enough to you</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not worth returning it.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, someone else thought it was not worth it and returned it????</li>
            <li> you need something for daily usage at home, you should look for a magnified mirror with a diameter of at least 8 inches.</li>
            <li> It is too big for a purse (at least my purse), but I can&#x27;t see a need to be carrying a light-up magnifying mirror in your purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The image was upside down and distorted.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> i am upside down.</li>
            <li> The mirror is less than 4 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> removing them has become difficult as I have grown older.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m always careful but have managed to break one in the past.</li>
            <li> Waste on money I received this and the mirror was upside down</li>
            <li> This is a nifty little mirror.  </li>
            <li> This item helps me see those little hairs on my chin and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Yet it pops away into a neat little package for storage.  </li>
            <li> Until I dropped it that is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this one for probably a little over five weeks.</li>
            <li> The (difficult to reach) screw that allows the mirror to hinge and hold the chosen position came loose in only a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> This mirror reflects everything upside down !  </li>
            <li> Not fantastic quality, but inexpensive and serves its purpose.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday and for travel.</li>
            <li> Blur don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Just a little too small for what I wanted it for</li>
            <li> about 2 inches is not ideal for a  very tiny pocketbook</li>
            <li> It takes up very little space and weighs practically nothing.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased at all</li>
            <li> Maybe because it is so small?</li>
            <li> I ordered this in error, having ordered it in the past and returned it.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is small and folds and lights.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not buy this for makeup application, it is way too small and way to magnified.</li>
            <li> Too small and too magnified.</li>
            <li> However it is too small to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li> This is small just like the description said.</li>
            <li> My friend told me to get this mirror instead of buying a big expensive one.  </li>
            <li> usually work for me.  </li>
            <li> Mirror was small, but becauase of the 15x</li>
            <li> Bought this for my cruise and it was hard to use.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see hardly any of your face.</li>
            <li> And oh yeah, DON&#x27;T USE THE LIGHTS while applying your make-up or looking at your face, AS YOU WILL BE BLASTED BY ILLUMINATION that actually prohibits seeing, as opposed to helping you.</li>
            <li> it was very difficult to actually see.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as it is extremely hard to use unless you are only centimeters away from the mirror.</li>
            <li> least the mirror still works!  </li>
            <li> the product was lousy ,hard to use.threw</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> that has poor lighting.</li>
            <li> This mirror is the worse thing ever you can&#x27;t see yourself in it.  </li>
            <li> However, after about a month, the lights failed.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, too,</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do it, so it was just useless to me.</li>
            <li> Putting the lenses on is not too difficult but</li>
            <li> The magnification is absurd if 6 inches away from your face.  </li>
            <li> Sadly this will not work for me for travel, which is the reason I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Useless</li>
            <li> Weird way of opening.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality item.</li>
            <li> My vision is very poor and I needed to see myself put on my eye makeup without my glasses.</li>
            <li> Impossible to make out anything in the mirror.</li>
            <li> My bad for ordering again.  </li>
            <li> bad bad bad</li>
            <li> Product does not work, I cant tell if its broken or just terrible...</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in how close to the mirror I have to be to be in focus</li>
            <li> but hate to go thru the bother to return things.</li>
            <li> It folds up into it&#x27;s base, so the mirror is protected during travel - another plus.</li>
            <li> it now!super bad very bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this purchase and will be looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible magnifier.</li>
            <li> Brutal truth!</li>
            <li> but it was terrible to see into.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is perfect. Fits in my purse, the magnification and light is just what I need to put my contacts in.</li>
            <li> Portable, light weight, with a light.</li>
            <li> Not happy. One eye at a time to apply makeup. Forget the full face! Very small to be much use.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses and cannot see well enough to apply eye liner and mascara without my glasses, so I needed a good mirror for travel.  I had to hold his mirror within inches of my eye to bring it into focus.  I probably have average 55 yr old eyes so I would not recommend this to anyone in this age bracket.  Also not well made.</li>
            <li> the product was as advertised. Compact lighted travel mirror work very well but did not meet our needs. we returned the item to seller and received a full refund (minus shipping) promptly.</li>
            <li> I am at that age where all of the sudden 1) print everywhere seems really small and 2) hair is just popping out all over the place. This is a great help with the latter problem, in particular. The 15x magnification does take some getting used to -- the mirror is much closer to my face than I was accustomed to with my 2x or 3x mirrors. It&#x27;s been super-helpful in getting the grooming under control in this household.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible magnifier. Impossible to make out anything in the mirror. And there&#x27;s a 30% restocking fee so it&#x27;s not worth returning it.</li>
            <li> Great compact mirror for travel.  I will purchase again if anything ever happens to this one.</li>
            <li> Very handy but ones eyes must adjust to the magnification before focusing well for use.</li>
            <li> It is OK but after couple of days working the light is not working, even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> 15x zoom is too much.  It arrived on time and it was as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much the zoom would be.  It&#x27;s way too much.  10x is probably what I should have gone for.  It has to be held very close to your skin and then you can only make out a small patch at a time, everything else is too out of focus with that much zoom.</li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon, but wanted to actually see it, Bath and Body has them and I bought one, it is totally awesome, found hairs I did not even know I had, very handy for travel which was why I bought it. The manufacturer encloses an order form for replacement bulbs which is great. highly recommend for travel or home use.</li>
            <li> I like the mirror, but the dimentions is smaller than what I was looking for.  The plus side to is that because of its size, it makes a great travel mirror.  I would receommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the seller was very prompt in shipping.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Nobody needs to see their own face this closely.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, works perfect for international travel.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as it is extremely hard to use unless you are only centimeters away from the mirror. Cant really use it with the stand as it is very difficult to get close enough to see your eye clearly.</li>
            <li> I bought a 10x mirror but had a hard time plucking eyebrows as it wasn&#x27;t strong enough.  This little gem at 15x magnification does a fine job.  Not fantastic quality, but inexpensive and serves its purpose.  EDIT 1/3/15  What is going on with Amazon price gouging?  I purchased this on Amazon, same seller for $18.66 May 2015, now (Jan 2016) it&#x27;s over $27.  The exact mirror is sold at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond for $19.99 where you have a 20% discount pretty much constantly.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected at all.  No way can you use it to put on makeup unless you do one inch of your face at a time.  If you are more than an inch from the mirror, you are upside down in the image.  The magnification is so powerful that all you see is an eye or an eyebrow.  Not pleased at all but hate to go thru the bother to return things.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift, but know it was purchased for under $25 at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond. At first, I was totally satisfied.  Small enough to bring out to kitchen or living room--wherever I wanted to use it at. The lighting and magnification were very good for getting at the facial stray hairs I wanted to remove.  However, after about a month, the lights failed.  I was good at always turning it off when done, so it didn&#x27;t seem reasonable.  But I thought, well, maybe left it on when I thought it was off, etc.  But then it happened again.  This time when I went to replace them, placing them in caused smoke!  Sooo, that was it for me--trashed it.  I went back to BBB to see if they had a comparable mirror and what caught my eye was the same model I just trashed was on the shelf in a resealed package.  Hmmm, someone else thought it was not worth it and returned it????</li>
            <li> By looking at the product picture of this item ([[ASIN:B001VHZXOE Lighted Adjustable 15X Travel Mirror]]), it is hard to realize its actual size. The unit is so compact, it fits in my palm when folded. The small size makes it suitable as a travel mirror. On the other hand, you also have to cope with its limitations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The mirror is less than 4 inches in diameter. Combined with high magnification, it gives a very limited visible area. This means you can only examine a small region of your face at any one time. Plus you only have a working distance of 4-5 inches from the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The two miniature incandescent light bulbs are far from \\&quot;super bright\\&quot; as advertised. A set of four AAA alkaline cells (*) can only provide useable illumination for around 2-3 hours. It would be better if LED light sources were used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my particular case, I kept this compact mirror in my office in case of emergency \\&quot;Do-It-Yourself eye surgery\\&quot; (I have problems with inward growing eyelash). It has just the right size and magnification for this intended purpose. Over the past four years, it must have paid for itself ten times over. So for that I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need something for daily usage at home, you should look for a magnified mirror with a diameter of at least 8 inches. I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B001FS0HAY Daylight Fluorescent Lighted 10X Mirror]], also made by Floxite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*) Footnote:  The battery compartment accepts four AAA cells. But the cells are actually connected two-in-parallel, in order to double the operating time. A better solution is to power the lights with just two AAA rechargeable cells (see my Customer Image). The use of rechargeable batteries also prolongs the lifespan of light bulbs. I have not replaced the bulbs in over 4 years.</li>
            <li> I wanted a decent magnifying mirror for travel that would aid me in putting on eye-liner and other make-up.  I already have a large, pedestal magnifying mirror in my bathroom. It works fine, but is too cumbersome for travel and offers no protective case. So I have been using little compact purse mirrors where the magnifying side is just not strong enough to do the job. I decided to buy this lighted, adjustable travel mirror to solve my problem.  I love the style, the compactness when it is closed, and its ability to adjust to any position.  The one DOWN-SIDE to this product is that IT IS TOO POWERFUL A MAGNIFICATION! You must place the mirror SO NEAR TO YOUR FACE in order to see your face and eyes with no distortion. It is EXTREMELY disconcerting to be so close to this mirror, almost dizzying. Yes, if you manage to place this product that near to your eyeballs, you will definitely be able to apply eye make-up, etc. In fact, I think you could perform surgery on your face...this mirror is so strong!  Hah! The manufacturer should call this product \\&quot;THE MICROSCOPE\\&quot;.  It is just ridiculously too strong for me. And oh yeah, DON&#x27;T USE THE LIGHTS while applying your make-up or looking at your face, AS YOU WILL BE BLASTED BY ILLUMINATION that actually prohibits seeing, as opposed to helping you.</li>
            <li> This is a nifty little mirror.  Folds into a compact that fits easily in my purse, and the light works great.  At first I thought it was defective because I wasn&#x27;t holding it close enough to my face to really focus.  Boy, oh, boy, once I focused in, I may have seen more than I bargained for.  Super clear, super zoom.  Brutal truth!</li>
            <li> Perfect mirror for great magnification! I use this lighted mirror to pluck my eyebrows and I can actually see everything!</li>
            <li> Just a little too small for what I wanted it for but it&#x27;s ok for tossing into a bag.  I am still on a quest for the perfect travel mirror!</li>
            <li> Everyone needs one of these. Very handy and you can replace batteries.</li>
            <li> Really not a useable mirror as it is too small and not at all useful for travel or anything else in my opinion.  Expensive, too, and now I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> Product does not work, I cant tell if its broken or just terrible...</li>
            <li> Great for travel, great magnification, I use it every day.</li>
            <li> You cannot see in this compact mirror at all, it was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I recently started wearing contacts.  For about a month or so, it was great, as I could find my contacts in the corners of my eyes.  After a month, the light simply stopped working.  Replaced the batteries, but still not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least the mirror still works!  For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> I bought it for traveling &amp; it turned out to be exactly what I wanted- lightweight, lighted with great magnification (almost too good!)-but perfect for when you&#x27;re staying somewhere that has poor lighting.</li>
            <li> Great compact mirror for daily use and for travel. (Tip: without the batteries - it&#x27;s even lighter)!  Already had this same mirror - got another.</li>
            <li> This mirror is the worse thing ever you can&#x27;t see yourself in it.  I bought it for our RV and will just throw it away</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re planning to travel to several countries this year and hotels &amp; cruise ships aren&#x27;t always reliable to have what a woman needs to look her best.  This lighted, adjustable travel mirror is very compact, yet allows &amp;#34;up close &amp; personal&amp;#34; reflections that I don&#x27;t get from my cosmetic table&#x27;s 10X mirror.  Case seems durable enough to withstand the bumps of traveling.  Very satisfied with the product for the price paid.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and I see her using it every so I would assume it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Good magnification but small mirror.</li>
            <li> A+; highly recommended</li>
            <li> Light weight, distortion-free travel mirror is an excellent size for slipping into purse/backpack, or as an &#x27;up close &amp; personal&#x27; accessory at home. Light is bright &amp; definitely an asset, both in daylight &amp; darker settings by providing a diffused, evenly displayed glow that highlights facial features, rather than harsher reflective glare from mirror, (or too dim to be useful). Easy open/close with conveniently placed light button. When closed, mirror is well protected. Appropriate for giving to sister, best friend (or anyone who would not be offended by receiving a mirror!)</li>
            <li> This mirror really makes eyebrow tweezing a cinch.  You will see hairs you didn&#x27;t even know you had.  The only thing that is a little awkward about this mirror - probably because of the super magnification - is that you have to hold it at just the right distance from your face (no more than a couple of inches) to really see clearly.  If you pull back even just a little bit, the image gets blurred.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I can now find the smallest hairs in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My daughter had one of these and so I went on Amazon and found one for myself. It was exactly as described and what I wanted.</li>
            <li> chose it because of high magnification.  Mirror image is so distorted I can&#x27;t use it. Maybe because it is so small?</li>
            <li> my husband saw my mirror that I ordered so I got him one of his own so I told somebody</li>
            <li> Reflection not clear.</li>
            <li> little pricey but handy mirror according to the wife. Likes batteries real well.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase a 20 pack of aa&#x27;s and you&#x27;ll be ahead of the curve.</li>
            <li> Bought this for travel.  I use it for make-up and tweezing, I&#x27;m sure it would be good for contact lenses as well.  Since I wear glasses for close-up, I really need the 15x magnification.  And the light is needed because the lighting in hotel rooms is very rarely bright enough for this.  It folds up into it&#x27;s base, so the mirror is protected during travel - another plus. So far I&#x27;ve taken it on a couple of trips and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be fragile at all. It is a little thick, but worth it for the mirror size and the fold-up protection.  It is too big for a purse (at least my purse), but I can&#x27;t see a need to be carrying a light-up magnifying mirror in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a replacement for your close-up vanity mirror at home - it&#x27;s not as big as I&#x27;d want at home and it does not have an AC adapter (batteries only).  For the purpose I needed, it&#x27;s PERFECT and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also received it quickly, which made me happy for my upcoming trip.</li>
            <li> The mirror is smaller than I wanted but it allows me to do my eyebrows, etc. just fine. It works for me.</li>
            <li> This little mirror has so much magnification in such a small area that only the center is really in focus. Plus, the light is really bright...almost too bright. Therefore, it&#x27;s ot ideal for applying makeup, but it&#x27;s sure better than no mirror at all when traveling or at the gym.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on May 2 and received it on may 6.  Perfect timing for me.  As I increase in age my eyes do not work as well as they used to.  This item helps me see those little hairs on my chin and around my mouth.  I am grateful for this new vision.  it has a light and helps me see in darker areas.  Wa Hoo for me and this compact mirror  I can use for traveling too.</li>
            <li> This is the best magnifying mirror I have ever owned. The first one didn&#x27;t light up but the seller got another one to me quickly. Very impressed with the speed if replacement was handled.</li>
            <li> although the magnification was great the actual size was too small for me to use .  I wanted it to put mu makeup on while I travel&lt;br /&gt;but can only see a small area on my face.  it may be good for tweezing or eye makeup only</li>
            <li> I ordered this in error, having ordered it in the past and returned it. This mirror reflects everything upside down !  My first order was the same!  My bad for ordering again.  I would not recommend wasting your money as I did.</li>
            <li> This little guy is perfect for hunting for small imperfections.  Wow.  With 15x magnification, you can see the smallest problem areas.  Yet it pops away into a neat little package for storage.  Solved my problem under my chin!</li>
            <li> Mirror is fine -- folding functionality is good -- however, the light did not last long and replacing batteries did not help... there are probably better values available considering that half of the functionality didn&#x27;t even last 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have the larger version of this mirror.  We&#x27;ve used it for many years.  I bought the small version as a gift for a friend who travels frequently.  She then bought more of them for gifts for her friends.  The magnification level is astonishing.  The edges can seem a little warped due to the high level of magnification, but you will be able to see every pore and hair.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice travel mirror. The light is at just the right angle. Easy to fold and carry.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous mirror, the magnification is absolutely superb, you can see even the tiniest hairs or the ones that havenÂ´t grown yet (no joking). ItÂ´ll be an invaluable tool for tweezing eyebrow and upper lip hairs, that I canÂ´t detect with my glasses on!</li>
            <li> I love this travel mirror and use it on every trip I take</li>
            <li> The compact hard case makes this great for travel. And the light is sufficient. The slight malfunction being the point of focus is quite small and you need to be very close to the mirror to find it. The stand is nice and functional.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very compact.  It works great.  The light and stand have came in very handy.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> The (difficult to reach) screw that allows the mirror to hinge and hold the chosen position came loose in only a couple weeks.  It just flopped over like a wet noodle.  We found a man in a local old-fashioned hardware store who was willing to work with my husband for 20 minutes to find the tiniest of screwdrivers until he managed to tighten the screw.  We bought the screwdriver (smaller than those I have for my eyeglasses or jewelry) but hope to not have to repeat the process.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed.  The lighted magnified mirror is well protected for traveling with ease.  As an elderly lady with poor eyesight, I was finally able to apply my makeup, including mascara with ease and accuracy.  Just what I always needed. Strong, well made and attractive.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the first 15x travel mirror exactly like this one.  The wire connecting light to mirror broke from closing it each day.  Lesson learned - do not close the mirror after each use - actually only when traveling.  Highlight is the magnification and one can take care of eyebrows, etc., with great ease.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product but it does not suit my needs.  I wear eyeglasses and I need a larger mirror radius to apply makeup successfully.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a travel mirror to take on weekends away. I like how compact it is, and that it folds neatly into a case. The light is acceptable, not super bright but definitely better than nothing. However, the magnification is simply too much for the size of the mirror. My intended use is to tweeze my eyebrows and stray facial hairs while away from home. The mirror itself is so small, and the magnification so great, that you literally need to be an inch away from the glass for your face to be in focus. If you are trying to look at any part of your face besides your eyeball, it becomes quite the problem. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this purchase and will be looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my cruise and it was hard to use. It was hard to hold it close enough to you that wasn&#x27;t too close, while still using the other hand for makeup or tweezers or whatever.</li>
            <li> This mirror has great magnification! It is very portable and easy to travel with, throw it in your bag and go.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what was described and is what I needed. Thank you</li>
            <li> The light is not really bright enough.  The magnification is great.</li>
            <li> The mirror was good, wires got worn where the mirror bends,  wasn&#x27;t even 3 months old then didn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Worked just as I needed. Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My lighted magnifying mirror at home is too big and doesn&#x27;t fold to travel, so I like this because it is small and folds and lights.  It could, however, be another inch or two in diameter, and I think the 15x might actually be too much magnification.  But it sure beats by a mile what I had when away from home for a month last year--which was nothing!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality item. Did not work at all as described. Mirror was distorted and product was cheaply made plastic.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for extreme close up looks at your face, like eyebrow tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this for makeup application, it is way too small and way to magnified.</li>
            <li> The power is too high.  There isn&#x27;t room for tweezers between the mirror and one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> this was a gift to a friend, who already new the product .... she was really happy i could find this in amazon for her  she went nuts.... she loved it !!!!!!!!!  its good for putting make up and tweezing eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have owned the 10X compact for several years, so long that I can&#x27;t remember how long - and I have been happy with it. This one seems a good bit lighter in weight, but it does the job nicely.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered it and hope to have it around for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is so tiny it is hard to use unless you can hold it with one hand and put on your makeup or contact lens with the other.  I couldn&#x27;t do it, so it was just useless to me.</li>
            <li> Such intense magnification is not useful to me, with glasses but clearly able to see.  A special purpose item, and not advertised as such, at least not that I could see.</li>
            <li> This lighted 15X travel mirror is one of the best items I have ever purchased!  I wear contact lenses.  Putting the lenses on is not too difficult but removing them has become difficult as I have grown older.  With this mirror as my aid I am able to see clearly to remove my lenses.  I love this mirror!  Another good feature is the light.  The light is in the right place so it doesn&#x27;t create a circular &#x27;halo&#x27; around my eyes that so many other lighted mirrors do.  The light works as it is supposed to work.  It lights up my eye area so I can see clearly where my lenses are on my eyes that makes removing them so easy!  I love this lighted 15X travel mirror and I also love the compact size it folds down into.</li>
            <li> Great travel mirror, the light is good, light weight and compact.  I wear reading glasses and I have no problem utilizing the mirror without my glasses.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Too small and too magnified. I can&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> What an amazing mirror!  Not only is it small enough for travel, but the lighted 15X magnification allows me to see my face clearly.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly and was as expected.</li>
            <li> The mirror is good but the lighting is fair.  The price was good and it is easy to travel with but I would not use it for my main mirror everyday.</li>
            <li> I had a mirror that LOOKED just like this one but they are not the same.&lt;br /&gt;The first one I had for over five years with no problems. Until I dropped it that is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this one for probably a little over five weeks. The screws that hold the mirror&lt;br /&gt;upright are loose and can not be tightened. I&#x27;m going to order one from the place I got the first&lt;br /&gt;one and trash this one. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The mirror is just what I was looking for to travel with.  My old mirror didn&#x27;t have a stand and this should function the way I want. The light is ok; not sure I will use the light, but necessary for some. It folds up into itself and looks like a large compact.</li>
            <li> it was great until it stopped working. The wire powering it came apart and no real way to fix it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it fold up for travel and the arm extends for setup but it really should be double or triple the size.</li>
            <li> The magnification is absurd if 6 inches away from your face.  Anything further than that created and upside down image.</li>
            <li> what can I say about something I haven&#x27;t used? It really looks nice all weapped up in thr bubble wrap and that is where it will stay until I go my next trip. Safe and sound. If you give it 5 stars is there a need to write about it?</li>
            <li> I wanted a good magnifier that wouldn&#x27;t leap off the room mirror at me when the suction cups give up (the method i had used before). It is easy to find somewhere at a convenient height to place mirror for easy make-up application.</li>
            <li> It is too strong a magnification, I have trouble finding a spot that I do not see double. I like the light, but would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror and would definitely recommend it to anyone who has vision problems or needs magnification for putting on make-up etc.  I love the case which makes it indestructible in a suitcase on an airplane.  It stands up by itself leaving both hands free for whatever the intricate task is.</li>
            <li> Love how strong it is, but you can&#x27;t use it.  By the time you can see without distortion you are too close.</li>
            <li> I travel for work, months at a time and had to leave my full size mirror at home. The magnification is great, it&#x27;s compact and works well. Very excited to have with me.</li>
            <li> Too small and magnifies too large. NOT 4 makeup will probably return</li>
            <li> Not useful as table top travel mirror for makeup - too blurry and I&#x27;m near sighted!</li>
            <li> This mirror is ok for focusing on 1 area of the face...&amp; very close up.  I have to hold it so close to my face it is almost touching.  Definitely not the thing to use for applying makeup, which I did not buy it for, but just ok for tweezing.  I think it will be good for travel as it is lightweight &amp; compact.  I have used it many times since it arrived &amp; will make do with it but will also be getting a larger one.</li>
            <li> This is so highly magnified that it has to be no more than 3\\&quot; from your eyes to be useful.  Any further away and you literally can&#x27;t see anything.  So while it&#x27;s useful for very specific jobs (like plucking chin hairs) it&#x27;s not so useful for plucking your eyebrows because you generally have to turn your head slightly to do that--and then you lose \\&quot;the picture\\&quot; so to speak.  I fooled myself into buying it, thinking that 15X must be 50% better than 10X magnification.  Not really.</li>
            <li> I can barely see let alone use this mirror. The lighted feature is nice but the magnification is too much.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It fits in  my purse, it is bright and is perfect for using when I am in a hotel and they do not have a magnifying mirror (which I need now to put on my makeup)</li>
            <li> I have used this mirror before, and it works great to find anything in your eyes, my eyelashes have a tendency to grow towards eye instead of away, ouch so it easier to pull out with tweezer instead of going to optician that charges $200. per visit! Use extreme caution as not to hit eyeball tho. Easily fits in purse. The only thing that you must be careful of is, that you remember to shut light off before you close up, otherwise the battery will go dead. Also, check to make sure neck piece, where it screws together stays tight, otherwise it will CUT the very thin wires, I keep checking and then if loose, tighten with eyeglass repair kit screwdriver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, closes to protect the mirror, and has a light. Everything I need to get the job done while traveling.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror thinking 15X magnification would be better.  However, this was a gift for my mother who has so far sighted.  She did not like it cause she had to bring it up too close to be able to see.  I think the product is great and is pretty versatile if you are near sighted that is!!</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 stars but it&#x27;s a personal thing with me.  The magnification is way to high.  Didn&#x27;t have any idea what 15x would be.  Won&#x27;t work for me to put in contact lens when traveling.  So, had to return it but the seller was great with my return.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I purchased because after a while the connections for the light stop connecting and the closing latch breaks.</li>
            <li> Nice for travel but needs to add a bit more flexibility in adjusting the angle of the mirror to avoid tipping. It&#x27;s not very well balanced.</li>
            <li> This mirror is OK for VERY close view of one eye or a small part of the face if that is your purpose.  Perhaps finding a tiny stray hair and seeing a distorted view of pore size.  However it is too small to apply makeup.  Entire face cannot be viewed due to magnification.  10X may work better for this size mirror; not sure.  Sadly this will not work for me for travel, which is the reason I purchased it.  Have not attempted to return it yet; not clear on policy.</li>
            <li> This is small just like the description said. Perfect for travel. Extremely magnified. Great for tweezing eyebrows. That is pretty much what I am using it for. It will sit on a table but it some times tilts over.</li>
            <li> My friend told me to get this mirror instead of buying a big expensive one.  It works really well and I can travel with it.  Great value, very recommended.</li>
            <li> Wonderful,it help me to see my eyes to see so close. It is 15x. I would recommend people to buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. You can open it a few ways and most times I just hold the sides and gently pull it open. My vision is very poor and I needed to see myself put on my eye makeup without my glasses. The light is the best thing I could think of for a portable mirror and it is just a push of a button away. The magnification lets me see everything with precision. Thickness  about 2 inches is not ideal for a  very tiny pocketbook but if you have a small to medium bag or using this or overnight or travel you will be pleased The stand alone option.does not move or slip when you extend it and that is great when you just can&#x27;t touch anything anymore because your holding your pencil and your eye to draw a line LOL! Light and sturdy a great buy!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works great.have two in 10 &amp; 15 power.  Use it everyday and for travel.</li>
            <li> smaller than I thought, but works well</li>
            <li> the product was lousy ,hard to use.threw them out.bad bad bad bad .do you get it now!super bad very bad</li>
            <li> Very warped image.  Can&#x27;t see if the light works as the batteries were removed from the package.  Obviously not in new condition.</li>
            <li> if you really want to see all the wrinkles, etc., this mirror does it.  So far seems to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this compact mirror, nice navy color, folds easy, smooth and small, lite good, Exactly what I wanted! 15X bonus, clear, no distortion!</li>
            <li> I need to have a magnifer to see to put my makeup on and some hotels do not have them.  This works but you have to get your fact really up close to see.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is really handy for taking on a trip.  It takes up very little space and weighs practically nothing.  We happily endorse this product.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted strong magnification and this one produces extremely well for her - unsure why she needs it but I&#x27;m a dude!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s pretty darned useful for travel.  I&#x27;m short, so the wall-mounted make-up mirrors in hotels&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t usually work for me.  This is small, compact, sturdy and highly recommended for travel.  And since&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s battery-operated, you don&#x27;t have to think of what kind of electrical converter you might need.  Whew!</li>
            <li> Way too small to really be useful.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for...small, compact with good magnification.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, 15x magnification is what I need now to accurately apply eye make-up. As other reviewers have noted, you don&#x27;t see a very big area as a result of the magnification and small size (it&#x27;s a TRAVEL mirror, after all) so if you want to check both eyes or your whole face, for example, you will need to look in a regular mirror or a larger, less magnifying mirror. The light is handy and provides reasonably uniform illumination for those hotel bathrooms that don&#x27;t have enough light where you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this so much that I keep one in the bathroom at all times and have another for travel.</li>
            <li> It did not live up to the advertised copy. It was much smaller than advertised.  Should have indicated dimensions in the advertising.</li>
            <li> I bought the mirror to use for travel-putting on makeup and putting my contacts in.  It&#x27;s too hard to focus with as the magnification is a little too much for regular use.  Otherwise, the mirror is sturdy and arrived just fine.</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself, then 3 as gifts for girlfriends.&lt;br /&gt;With this lighted , magnified mirror I can see Every little hair, and aim better with the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s a perfect size &amp; weight (light) for traveling.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror for an overseas trip this summer. The light is nice and bright, and the magnification is amazing.</li>
            <li> Very nice and compact for Traveling.</li>
            <li> Love this! It goes through batteries quick but it shows EVERY hair!</li>
            <li> use it every  day..my second one, love it</li>
            <li> I think 10x would have been better for me</li>
            <li> unless you really have eye problems, the 15x was too strong so i returned and using the 10x which is  just right. love the stand . it works great when on the run.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this mirror and while it has come in handy each time and about after 6 months the bulbs burn out, and bulbs you can&#x27;t replace.  It&#x27;s not worth the price for a couple of months use and especially not when you only use it a couple of times a month at that!</li>
            <li> I wish it was just a bit bigger, but I love this.  You see EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> Had exactly same thing for years. It still works but lights don&#x27;t work and u can&#x27;t buy replacements and no place to put replacement bulbs. So I just decided to buy another one. The product is great.</li>
            <li> I love how you can position this in so many ways. The 15x magnification is a little too much for makeup application, but great for tweezing. The light is great, and I love the hands free operation!</li>
            <li> Compact and light.  Magnifies and it lighted which is what I was looking for.  Will be easy to pack and travel with.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, just what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> Liked the size and quality of design however, the clarity if the mirror reflection not as good. Perhaps it is due to its size?</li>
            <li> Listed as &#x27;open item&#x27;, this was obviously a returned item as the mirror is warped. I have another just like it so I know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am just not smart enough to realize open item &#x3D; returned item. Very misleading</li>
            <li> Just received it and returning it. The image was upside down and distorted.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money do not purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror for travel purposes but I now use it daily at home too. It&#x27;s the perfect size to put in your travel bag and is easily folded up to keep handy in a vanity drawer. The price was good compared to other mirrors I&#x27;ve seen in stores and I received the mirror very quickly thanks to Amazon Prime. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It was a little more powerful than I thought.  Mirror was small, but becauase of the 15x it was very difficult to actually see.</li>
            <li> Waste on money I received this and the mirror was upside down I couldt see anything in it all. Blur don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> The amplification on this is wonderful and the light really helps me see my eyebrows so that I can evenly pluck them.  I now have (2) of these, one for use at home and one in my makeup bag.  The only downside is that it&#x27;s made of plastic and so is prone to breaking.  So, I&#x27;m always careful but have managed to break one in the past.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I got this,15X makes your face SO large its unusable, I&#x27;m not one to write reviews but I wished someone had written this for me so I thought I would do it. Great idea as it is free standing, I wish someone would make this item in a 5X or 7X!</li>
            <li> Perfect mirror if you only have one eye!  Can&#x27;t see hardly any of your face. Sent it back and ordered a larger type.</li>
            <li> The case and light are great.  Was disappointed in how close to the mirror I have to be to be in focus</li>
            <li> Can not use the mirror.  Useless</li>
            <li> Given as a gift.  Build seems adequate for the price.</li>
            <li> Maybe its because i wear glasses but it was terrible to see into. If that was the only issue be better rating but it not. Weird way of opening. Felt like i break it just opening it. Sent it back</li>
            <li> i bought this item because of the reviews. It was amazing to see that the image is upside down. No matter which way I turn the mirror i am upside down. I should have realized that it was of poor quality since the enclosure said &amp;#34; you have purchased a product of fine quality&amp;#34;. This will be returned.It would be nice if Amazon posted where the items they sell are manufactured.</li>
