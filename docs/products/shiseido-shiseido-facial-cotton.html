            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love these cotton pads and when I travel my mates always ask where I got them at.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best quality that is out there!</li>
            <li>they are better than any cotton I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>That desperation to pick up your spirits by making yourself even more broke.</li>
            <li>The softest, most luxurious cotton pads.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>My favorite cotton pads</li>
            <li>So glad I found these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to split the pads apart</li>
            <li>Love these, they don&#x27;t shed fibers, I cut in 1/2 fto remove eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Ok so these are pricey...</li>
            <li>They are the ultimate in the perfect cotton pad for everything you would use a cotton pad for.</li>
            <li>BUT I LOVE these for my toners and makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Really love these and will get them again when I run out.</li>
            <li>: Their great feel, large size, 0.5 cm thickness, and strong material makes these the perfect facial cotton pads.</li>
            <li>These are great and exactly what I was looking for to clean my skin, nails or use my toner.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find these on amazon!</li>
            <li>However, when removing makeup, applying skin lotion, nothing beats a larger cushy cotton pad.</li>
            <li>Very nice soft cotton</li>
            <li>Very nice, soft cotton pads.</li>
            <li>glad that the price has been lowered significantly.</li>
            <li>best cotton pads I&#x27;ve ever used, soft absorbs very well, not a lot of product has to be used</li>
            <li>drug store easy buy...</li>
            <li>Just beautiful facial cotton pads that do not fall apart.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>The cotton is ultra smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave lint.</li>
            <li>Very nice facial pads.</li>
            <li>I had just paid my rent and bought over $600 worth of body oils, so I was broke, broke, broke!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I found this product available at $9.5 on Norstrom (with FREE SHIPPING) and Sephora also later today(I&#x27;m a Sephora VIB Rouge member, and enjoy free shipping on all orders all the time)!!</li>
            <li>It was sooo nice on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The pad is quite large, about 2\\&quot; by 2.5\\&quot;, so I am currently able to use one pad to remove my makeup and apply my toner over the span of two days.</li>
            <li>Well anyway, this is a true story.  </li>
            <li>Cotton bacon was far superior but FAR more</li>
            <li>This is also, excellent for men with their facial stubble as regular cotton</li>
            <li>Very strong, yet soft and does not fall apart on the face after wiping off cleansers.</li>
            <li>So much better then cotton balls, not to mention very soft and doesnt fall apart.</li>
            <li>I use these instead of toilet paper and it amazing just how clean they make you feel.</li>
            <li>I was looking for good quality cotton for my face, and enjoy using this really soft facial cotton from shiseido, it helps toner get into skin.</li>
            <li>worth the splurge, get them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it just for that alone.  </li>
            <li>These are the Rolls Royce of cotton and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>And you get a TON of squares, so economical as well as functional.  </li>
            <li>You can cut a third off and use the 2/3 portion most of the time and then the 1/3 portion of days you use toner or light eye make up.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I actually purchased these to make my own liquid masks from toners, milk, lemon juice etc.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>These are super soft and lint free.</li>
            <li>These cotton squares are so soft, yet strong.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy these very soft cotton wipes and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !</li>
            <li>Love the facial cotton very much.</li>
            <li>First of all it does have those cotton residues all around the square...</li>
            <li>I am used to generic cotton balls that I can get from Walmart or wherever until the lady at Shiseido counter gave me a complimentary facial used this to apply their toner,so i asked for a sample and loved it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought cotton pads online with regards to those 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using this every night along with my Bioderma Sensibio makeup remover/toner, and it is my current favorite combination for removing my makeup and toning my face.</li>
            <li>I love these facial cottons!!</li>
            <li>Then I have switched to these squares and they feel so much better on the face, I never want to change back.</li>
            <li>an added bonus there is so many in the pack I have enough to remove my makeup and put on skin products.</li>
            <li>As I was running out of these facial cottons and about to purchase more, I found that this product was $2 cheaper on the Shisheido official website.</li>
            <li>I love these facial cotton pads!  </li>
            <li>The speedy delivery was much appreciated!</li>
            <li>I had trouble figuring out the count before ordering but went ahead with it because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>The facial cottons from Shiseido are super soft and so very smooth.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that once you try them, you will never be able to go back to cheap cotton.</li>
            <li>These are seriously the best facial cotton pads on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are super soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>The package is fairly large.</li>
            <li>, this price is reasonable considering &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; imported.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d spend this much on cotton pads, but I heard about it from a makeup guru on you tube, so I decided to splurge and spend  the $9 &amp;#34;one</li>
            <li>I NEVER in a million years would have paid so much for cotton squares if a woman I was traveling with had not said, &amp;</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping and arrival.</li>
            <li>Much easier than cotton balls.</li>
            <li>considering Macys wants $10 for shipping..</li>
            <li>I use these with my Bioderma makeup remover and know it&#x27;s much gentler on my skin than drugstore cotton pads.</li>
            <li>For me this really improves the quality of my nightly makeup removal experience.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of luxury you get by using this Facial Cotton from Shiseido.&lt;br /&gt;It´s made to complement Shiseidos products, soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>I started using these when I changed to the Shiseido skin care line and they are so soft and comfortable on even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They are soft, don&#x27;t fall apart, and absorb the right amount of liquid (make up remover).</li>
            <li>have to say, This cotton &amp; other Japanese made cotton (Koh Gen Doh etc) are really superior to most other companies&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>With most cotton it will turn dark, but this turns a nice white color when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>These pads are nice, but seem small in comparison - I have been spoiled.</li>
            <li>Come over to the dark side, you will love every swiping minute of it.</li>
            <li>I do not know how it works, but it is true, when I have these my skin care products last longer</li>
            <li>Quality and elegance for particular care.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I specifically use them to remove my eye makeup given that the eye area is more sensitive and these are extremely durable, gentle and soft.  </li>
            <li>Soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>They last forever and in my opinion, there worth the price.</li>
            <li>It feels nice under my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li>and they save the products from being absorbed by a big cotton ball.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely give the product five stars but the only thing is that the one that qualifies for Amazon Prime shipping costs a lot more than other sellers.</li>
            <li>Some may think these facial cotton pads are way too expensive but you get a very large number of pads and they are very soft and hold product well, great value for your money.</li>
            <li>I interchange a lot of beauty products because I like to try new products in my skincare routine -- this is NOT one of them.</li>
            <li>They are extremely gentle, but light and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>This pack is smaller than those jumbo but cheap packs of cotton, but it will definitely last you a while.</li>
            <li>They are so thick and plush and hold so much more makeup remover which I really like.</li>
            <li>The squares are very soft, they absorb the make up remover or toner or whatnot, and it feels very soft on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea, meaning my skin is very sensitive to chemicals and cleaning cloths.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, so this is the only product I can use without breaking out into a rash.&lt;br /&gt;The cotton is incredibly soft but strong, and the pack lasts forever if you only use one cotton pad a day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no alcoholic, and I don&#x27;t do drugs, so what do I do?  </li>
            <li>I bought these for the first time in 1998 and am using them since, they are very different from anything else I have seen on the market.</li>
            <li>how silky soft they felt!</li>
            <li>These lovely little pads are so tough, yet so lovely and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>DR,TL - incredibly soft, great for toners/nail polish etc, not made for the peel apart DIY masks (recommend Selena brand for that use), no lint, thick enough to peel in 2 layers and double the use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A full sheet is definitely too big.</li>
            <li>Much better than typical Japanese cotton.</li>
            <li>One note, they are only $9.50 at that major cosmetic (black/white striped logo) retailer, so if you are a first time user I would suggest picking them up there to ensure authenticity.</li>
            <li>thanks to the reviews I decided to try these facial cotton pads</li>
            <li>So soft and gentile.</li>
            <li>The are so soft,</li>
            <li>Everything panned out - did not shred/fall apart, soft, holds liquid well.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have clothes this soft.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and do not pull on my skin, which helps prevents wrinkles from forming.</li>
            <li>These cotton pads are so soft and they do not leave any fibers on you face.  </li>
            <li>Soft, luxurious cotton pads.</li>
            <li>Soft and yet durable.  </li>
            <li>Does not waste product.</li>
            <li>They are so soft on my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft~</li>
            <li>Extremely soft, it feels like cotton made by angels</li>
            <li>and I absolutely prefer them to regular cotton pads!</li>
            <li>Both sides of the pad are identical and feel the same (unlike other cotton pads that have one smooth side and one quilted</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for the sensitive facial, neck, and décolleté areas.</li>
            <li>I cut the soft plastic bag open (even the packaging is major quality!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little luxury and for me, now, worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have used these facial wipes/cottons for near a decade now.</li>
            <li>Quality soft cotton that you cannot find at a regular store.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These squares for face only, they are way too soft for a nail polish remover for example.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and thick and feel so luxurious.</li>
            <li>no other facial cotton will touch my skin</li>
            <li>BUT you get the job done the first time and ultimately use less product...I.e.</li>
            <li>SO much softer than the ones you can buy at a US pharmacy (I have always found those too harsh for my sensitive facial skin, especially around eye area).</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love these cotton pads and when I travel my mates always ask where I got them at.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best quality that is out there!</li>
            <li> they are better than any cotton I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> That desperation to pick up your spirits by making yourself even more broke.</li>
            <li> The softest, most luxurious cotton pads.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> My favorite cotton pads</li>
            <li> So glad I found these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to split the pads apart</li>
            <li> Love these, they don&#x27;t shed fibers, I cut in 1/2 fto remove eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Ok so these are pricey...</li>
            <li> They are the ultimate in the perfect cotton pad for everything you would use a cotton pad for.</li>
            <li> BUT I LOVE these for my toners and makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Really love these and will get them again when I run out.</li>
            <li> : Their great feel, large size, 0.5 cm thickness, and strong material makes these the perfect facial cotton pads.</li>
            <li> These are great and exactly what I was looking for to clean my skin, nails or use my toner.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find these on amazon!</li>
            <li> However, when removing makeup, applying skin lotion, nothing beats a larger cushy cotton pad.</li>
            <li> Very nice soft cotton</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft cotton pads.</li>
            <li> glad that the price has been lowered significantly.</li>
            <li> best cotton pads I&#x27;ve ever used, soft absorbs very well, not a lot of product has to be used</li>
            <li> drug store easy buy...</li>
            <li> Just beautiful facial cotton pads that do not fall apart.  </li>
            <li> These are fantastic.</li>
            <li> The cotton is ultra smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave lint.</li>
            <li> Very nice facial pads.</li>
            <li> I had just paid my rent and bought over $600 worth of body oils, so I was broke, broke, broke!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I found this product available at $9.5 on Norstrom (with FREE SHIPPING) and Sephora also later today(I&#x27;m a Sephora VIB Rouge member, and enjoy free shipping on all orders all the time)!!</li>
            <li> It was sooo nice on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The pad is quite large, about 2\\&quot; by 2.5\\&quot;, so I am currently able to use one pad to remove my makeup and apply my toner over the span of two days.</li>
            <li> Well anyway, this is a true story.  </li>
            <li> Cotton bacon was far superior but FAR more</li>
            <li> This is also, excellent for men with their facial stubble as regular cotton</li>
            <li> Very strong, yet soft and does not fall apart on the face after wiping off cleansers.</li>
            <li> So much better then cotton balls, not to mention very soft and doesnt fall apart.</li>
            <li> I use these instead of toilet paper and it amazing just how clean they make you feel.</li>
            <li> I was looking for good quality cotton for my face, and enjoy using this really soft facial cotton from shiseido, it helps toner get into skin.</li>
            <li> worth the splurge, get them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it just for that alone.  </li>
            <li> These are the Rolls Royce of cotton and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> And you get a TON of squares, so economical as well as functional.  </li>
            <li> You can cut a third off and use the 2/3 portion most of the time and then the 1/3 portion of days you use toner or light eye make up.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I actually purchased these to make my own liquid masks from toners, milk, lemon juice etc.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> These are super soft and lint free.</li>
            <li> These cotton squares are so soft, yet strong.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy these very soft cotton wipes and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !</li>
            <li> Love the facial cotton very much.</li>
            <li> First of all it does have those cotton residues all around the square...</li>
            <li> I am used to generic cotton balls that I can get from Walmart or wherever until the lady at Shiseido counter gave me a complimentary facial used this to apply their toner,so i asked for a sample and loved it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought cotton pads online with regards to those 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this every night along with my Bioderma Sensibio makeup remover/toner, and it is my current favorite combination for removing my makeup and toning my face.</li>
            <li> I love these facial cottons!!</li>
            <li> Then I have switched to these squares and they feel so much better on the face, I never want to change back.</li>
            <li> an added bonus there is so many in the pack I have enough to remove my makeup and put on skin products.</li>
            <li> As I was running out of these facial cottons and about to purchase more, I found that this product was $2 cheaper on the Shisheido official website.</li>
            <li> I love these facial cotton pads!  </li>
            <li> The speedy delivery was much appreciated!</li>
            <li> I had trouble figuring out the count before ordering but went ahead with it because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> The facial cottons from Shiseido are super soft and so very smooth.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that once you try them, you will never be able to go back to cheap cotton.</li>
            <li> These are seriously the best facial cotton pads on the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are super soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li> The package is fairly large.</li>
            <li> , this price is reasonable considering &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; imported.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d spend this much on cotton pads, but I heard about it from a makeup guru on you tube, so I decided to splurge and spend  the $9 &amp;#34;one</li>
            <li> I NEVER in a million years would have paid so much for cotton squares if a woman I was traveling with had not said, &amp;</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping and arrival.</li>
            <li> Much easier than cotton balls.</li>
            <li> considering Macys wants $10 for shipping..</li>
            <li> I use these with my Bioderma makeup remover and know it&#x27;s much gentler on my skin than drugstore cotton pads.</li>
            <li> For me this really improves the quality of my nightly makeup removal experience.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of luxury you get by using this Facial Cotton from Shiseido.&lt;br /&gt;It´s made to complement Shiseidos products, soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> I started using these when I changed to the Shiseido skin care line and they are so soft and comfortable on even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They are soft, don&#x27;t fall apart, and absorb the right amount of liquid (make up remover).</li>
            <li> have to say, This cotton &amp; other Japanese made cotton (Koh Gen Doh etc) are really superior to most other companies&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> With most cotton it will turn dark, but this turns a nice white color when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> These pads are nice, but seem small in comparison - I have been spoiled.</li>
            <li> Come over to the dark side, you will love every swiping minute of it.</li>
            <li> I do not know how it works, but it is true, when I have these my skin care products last longer</li>
            <li> Quality and elegance for particular care.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I specifically use them to remove my eye makeup given that the eye area is more sensitive and these are extremely durable, gentle and soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> They last forever and in my opinion, there worth the price.</li>
            <li> It feels nice under my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> and they save the products from being absorbed by a big cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely give the product five stars but the only thing is that the one that qualifies for Amazon Prime shipping costs a lot more than other sellers.</li>
            <li> Some may think these facial cotton pads are way too expensive but you get a very large number of pads and they are very soft and hold product well, great value for your money.</li>
            <li> I interchange a lot of beauty products because I like to try new products in my skincare routine -- this is NOT one of them.</li>
            <li> They are extremely gentle, but light and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> This pack is smaller than those jumbo but cheap packs of cotton, but it will definitely last you a while.</li>
            <li> They are so thick and plush and hold so much more makeup remover which I really like.</li>
            <li> The squares are very soft, they absorb the make up remover or toner or whatnot, and it feels very soft on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, meaning my skin is very sensitive to chemicals and cleaning cloths.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so this is the only product I can use without breaking out into a rash.&lt;br /&gt;The cotton is incredibly soft but strong, and the pack lasts forever if you only use one cotton pad a day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no alcoholic, and I don&#x27;t do drugs, so what do I do?  </li>
            <li> I bought these for the first time in 1998 and am using them since, they are very different from anything else I have seen on the market.</li>
            <li> how silky soft they felt!</li>
            <li> These lovely little pads are so tough, yet so lovely and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> DR,TL - incredibly soft, great for toners/nail polish etc, not made for the peel apart DIY masks (recommend Selena brand for that use), no lint, thick enough to peel in 2 layers and double the use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A full sheet is definitely too big.</li>
            <li> Much better than typical Japanese cotton.</li>
            <li> One note, they are only $9.50 at that major cosmetic (black/white striped logo) retailer, so if you are a first time user I would suggest picking them up there to ensure authenticity.</li>
            <li> thanks to the reviews I decided to try these facial cotton pads</li>
            <li> So soft and gentile.</li>
            <li> The are so soft,</li>
            <li> Everything panned out - did not shred/fall apart, soft, holds liquid well.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have clothes this soft.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and do not pull on my skin, which helps prevents wrinkles from forming.</li>
            <li> These cotton pads are so soft and they do not leave any fibers on you face.  </li>
            <li> Soft, luxurious cotton pads.</li>
            <li> Soft and yet durable.  </li>
            <li> Does not waste product.</li>
            <li> They are so soft on my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft~</li>
            <li> Extremely soft, it feels like cotton made by angels</li>
            <li> and I absolutely prefer them to regular cotton pads!</li>
            <li> Both sides of the pad are identical and feel the same (unlike other cotton pads that have one smooth side and one quilted</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for the sensitive facial, neck, and décolleté areas.</li>
            <li> I cut the soft plastic bag open (even the packaging is major quality!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little luxury and for me, now, worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used these facial wipes/cottons for near a decade now.</li>
            <li> Quality soft cotton that you cannot find at a regular store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These squares for face only, they are way too soft for a nail polish remover for example.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and thick and feel so luxurious.</li>
            <li> no other facial cotton will touch my skin</li>
            <li> BUT you get the job done the first time and ultimately use less product...I.e.</li>
            <li> SO much softer than the ones you can buy at a US pharmacy (I have always found those too harsh for my sensitive facial skin, especially around eye area).</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and other generic cotton pads always irritated my skin and especially the eyes!!</li>
            <li> This is far softer on my skin than any other facial cottons out there.</li>
            <li> I have been very frugal with them, so they have last a few months, and I think I will be ordering them again!</li>
            <li> It is not only the case that they are soft, but also they help one to use less lotion...</li>
            <li> They are pretty thick and absorb a lot of product</li>
            <li> So soft and I use less product when using them.  </li>
            <li> They require less product as they are soft and absorbable.  </li>
            <li> so they are super thin and then ROLL your wicks, don&#x27;t twist them up.</li>
            <li> very soft for face, my skin is very sensitive and need something very delicate.</li>
            <li> I made my purchase, strapped the seat-belt carefully around my Nordstrom shopping bag, and drove home with my Shiseido Facial Cotton.  </li>
            <li> I am going back to the previous brand I used -  just like the bigger surface area.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned already, so I list my use briefly as a pro:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> It may seem silly but trust me, it&#x27;s worth the money from all the product you save by using these instead!</li>
            <li> These are so plush and thick that my toner gets soaks in instead of spilling out but are soft enough that it come onto your skin when wipe it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Big bulbous teardrops flowed down my cheeks.</li>
            <li> And now you know what to do when you&#x27;re down to your last 10$.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are even thick enough to split down the middle so that you get double usage.</li>
            <li> I tried several other types of cotton rounds/squares, but these won hands down.  </li>
            <li> This is such a luxury buy for me - but it&#x27;s so hard to go back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; cotton pads.</li>
            <li> I had been using Swisspers, however they were really rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I use them wet to remove my cream cleanser, and with my cream eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> : The pads keep their shape and do not \\&quot;shed\\&quot; fluff like other pads I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> and I will never purchase any other brand.  </li>
            <li> After removing my eye makeup with these pads and then applying my cream, my eyes don&#x27;t sting and burn like they did with other pads.</li>
            <li> so soft puts products on really nice and never leaves behind those annoying cotton pieces.</li>
            <li> They are NOT your average cotton pad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft yet leaves not lint behind after use.</li>
            <li> i cut these in half</li>
            <li> I rather get it for almost half the price from Sephora or etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little pricey, so took one star off, but I will repurchase</li>
            <li> These are firm and I&#x27;m not always picking cotton pieces off my eye lashes and out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> But clinique&#x27;s cotton pads are not available in US.</li>
            <li> Cut these in half!</li>
            <li> No more sore backside.</li>
            <li> Some of my lotions and toners are quite expensive and after months of use, these actually will help you save quite a bit of product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sheets are too big, but cutting in half will solve the issue</li>
            <li> Bawk at the price if you will, but you must try them at least once.</li>
            <li> ; common cotton pads on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and product doesn&#x27;t soak through.</li>
            <li> I mean, there cotton pads.</li>
            <li> No more picking cotton pieces off your face, ever!  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> The pads feel like a thin cotton cloth, and when I used them to take off my makeup</li>
            <li> I will not be using these to remove nail polish as they are too luxurious and expensive for that and would rather put them to use on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I was immediately shocked as to</li>
            <li> I was so over softners and toners until I tried these, and realized it was the lousy cotton squares I was using that were annoying me!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna be broke, you can&#x27;t have this disgusting $10 bill in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> These are the best! I was leary of spending the amount I did for these, but I actually save on the amount of product I am using... The are so soft, no pulling on your skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> One of the best cottons you can get for vaping.  Great taste!</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the very best on the market and I will never purchase any other brand.  They are super soft and thick and feel so luxurious.</li>
            <li> I love this product. One of the best cotton pads I&#x27;ve ever uses. It&#x27;s soft yet leaves not lint behind after use.</li>
            <li> best cotton pads I&#x27;ve ever used, soft absorbs very well, not a lot of product has to be used these are wonderful, soft and do not tug your skin. no other facial cotton will touch my skin these are tops in my book. worth the splurge, get them</li>
            <li> Very nice soft cotton</li>
            <li> I love these cotton pads and when I travel my mates always ask where I got them at. These are firm and I&#x27;m not always picking cotton pieces off my eye lashes and out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I jus recieved mine and it is not how people describe it... I rrad the reviews and people talked about how it doesnt shed and how the size is big... First of all it does have those cotton residues all around the square... So it will def leave cotton strings on your face... Secondly it is not the softest thing... The ones in the drugstore are the same as these... They&#x27;re not anything big deal for the price... 18 bucks for buncha cottons... Not the best... Again I dont know who these people are that rated this product 5 star...</li>
            <li> I am used to generic cotton balls that I can get from Walmart or wherever until the lady at Shiseido counter gave me a complimentary facial used this to apply their toner,so i asked for a sample and loved it. Unlike any generic cotton balls, this doesn&#x27;t absorb the product, so you&#x27;re actually putting on everything to your skin. I recommend this facial cotton to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft cotton pads.</li>
            <li> I have used these facial wipes/cottons for near a decade now. They are soft, don&#x27;t fall apart, and absorb the right amount of liquid (make up remover). Definitely the best quality that is out there!</li>
            <li> I bought these cotton pads based on reviews. Everything panned out - did not shred/fall apart, soft, holds liquid well. However, when removing makeup, applying skin lotion, nothing beats a larger cushy cotton pad. I am going back to the previous brand I used -  just like the bigger surface area. These pads are nice, but seem small in comparison - I have been spoiled.</li>
            <li> Very nice taste on my rda good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Very good cosmetic product. Sturdy!</li>
            <li> After watching YouTube videos and seeing these everywhere I had to see what all the hype was about. I mean, there cotton pads. They are NOT your average cotton pad. It&#x27;s thick and product doesn&#x27;t soak through. Weather I&#x27;m removing my eye makeup or using tonor they are better than any cotton I have ever used. They last forever and in my opinion, there worth the price.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned already, so I list my use briefly as a pro:&lt;br /&gt;1. One cotton (both side) to wipe off all of your face&lt;br /&gt;2. Cotton doesn&#x27;t get fallen apart so there is no annoyance&lt;br /&gt;3. You can CUT any size to use for treatment (Lotion mask on eye area etc)&lt;br /&gt;4. Cost effective ; Morning &amp; Night Use with toner then 2 cotton if no extra treatment, that will last 1 month +&lt;br /&gt;For the quality and usefulness, this price is reasonable considering &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; imported.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No drug store easy buy... I always get at Sephora&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, This cotton &amp; other Japanese made cotton (Koh Gen Doh etc) are really superior to most other companies&#x27;.  Try it once, you will know the difference!</li>
            <li> You pay for what you get</li>
            <li> Some may think these facial cotton pads are way too expensive but you get a very large number of pads and they are very soft and hold product well, great value for your money.</li>
            <li> Cut these in half! A full sheet is definitely too big. These are so plush and thick that my toner gets soaks in instead of spilling out but are soft enough that it come onto your skin when wipe it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Soft&lt;br /&gt;Gentle&lt;br /&gt;Plush&lt;br /&gt;Soaks in product and applies on skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Sheets are too big, but cutting in half will solve the issue</li>
            <li> These cotton squares are so soft, yet strong.  They never shred, pull, or scratch the skin, and never leave cotton pieces on your face.  No more picking cotton pieces off your face, ever!  It&#x27;s worth it just for that alone.  I was so over softners and toners until I tried these, and realized it was the lousy cotton squares I was using that were annoying me!  These are the Rolls Royce of cotton and worth every penny.  The only problem is that once you try them, you will never be able to go back to cheap cotton.</li>
            <li> This is far softer on my skin than any other facial cottons out there. It feels nice under my delicate eye area. I will continue to buy this product always.</li>
            <li> I had been using Swisspers, however they were really rough on my skin. I decided to try Shiseido,  and I will never use anything else.  I love them.  They are extremely gentle, but light and fluffy.  They are incredibly soft.  They are even thick enough to split down the middle so that you get double usage.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic. So soft and I use less product when using them.  Sometimes i will separate the layers into two and get double the use!</li>
            <li> Just beautiful facial cotton pads that do not fall apart.  Quality and elegance for particular care.</li>
            <li> i cut these in half and ive havent even gone through 1/4 of the bag in a month... so soft puts products on really nice and never leaves behind those annoying cotton pieces.</li>
            <li> These are the best cotton squares I have ever used!  They require less product as they are soft and absorbable.  I highly recommend these for the sensitive facial, neck, and décolleté areas.</li>
            <li> Much better than typical Japanese cotton. With most cotton it will turn dark, but this turns a nice white color when it&#x27;s dry. This is the only cotton I use now.</li>
            <li> Received my package earlier today, and found that the product I got has a totally different looking package than the product picture shown online. Isn&#x27;t that kinda cheating? When I emailed the seller about the question, they said they are just sending the same product I used to order and get last year. No kidding!! This is the first time I bought cotton pads online with regards to those 5-star reviews. AND! I found this product available at $9.5 on Norstrom (with FREE SHIPPING) and Sephora also later today(I&#x27;m a Sephora VIB Rouge member, and enjoy free shipping on all orders all the time)!! So no bother shopping here!! Wosrt shopping experience on Amazon ever!!!</li>
            <li> The facial cottons from Shiseido are super soft and so very smooth. I look forward to using this every night along with my Bioderma Sensibio makeup remover/toner, and it is my current favorite combination for removing my makeup and toning my face. It feels great! These Shiseido facial cottons work perfectly for &amp;#34;Japanese lotion masks&amp;#34; which feels amazing! The seller had my item arrive promptly and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> I interchange a lot of beauty products because I like to try new products in my skincare routine -- this is NOT one of them. I use these pads, and these pads alone. Period. They are the only cotton pads I will *ever* use from now on. Bawk at the price if you will, but you must try them at least once. You will never go back to spitty drugstore cotton pads again. Come over to the dark side, you will love every swiping minute of it. Seriously. There is a reason these have incredible reviews. One note, they are only $9.50 at that major cosmetic (black/white striped logo) retailer, so if you are a first time user I would suggest picking them up there to ensure authenticity.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d spend this much on cotton pads, but I heard about it from a makeup guru on you tube, so I decided to splurge and spend  the $9 &amp;#34;one time&amp;#34;...well, I never thought there could be such a difference in cotton products!!  It was sooo nice on my very sensitive skin.  I have been very frugal with them, so they have last a few months, and I think I will be ordering them again! Love!!!</li>
            <li> This is just the awesome wipe... soft on skin...&lt;br /&gt;But I dont feel as the skin is moisturized on using it, as advertised...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve officially become quite bougie ... now you know why. This!&lt;br /&gt;I was minding my own business, walking through Nordstrom. I was broke, depressed.  I had just paid my rent and bought over $600 worth of body oils, so I was broke, broke, broke! But you know that feeling that comes with being broke?  That desperation to pick up your spirits by making yourself even more broke. Shopping comforts me. I&#x27;m no alcoholic, and I don&#x27;t do drugs, so what do I do?  I stroll through Nordstroms or the Ulta Brow Bar - that&#x27;s a bar right. Anyway, \\&quot;All in or all out\\&quot;, is what I say. If you&#x27;re gonna be broke, you can&#x27;t have this disgusting $10 bill in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there it was, the only remaining $10 item in all the Nordstrom land. Shiseido Facial Cotton. I made my purchase, strapped the seat-belt carefully around my Nordstrom shopping bag, and drove home with my Shiseido Facial Cotton.  When I got upstairs, I didn&#x27;t even remove my coat, I felt an urgency! I cut the soft plastic bag open (even the packaging is major quality! Then I welled up. Big bulbous teardrops flowed down my cheeks. I threw myself on the bed and cried from pure joy. What do you think I wiped my tears with? Yep. The softest, most luxurious cotton pads. I don&#x27;t think I have clothes this soft. I love them. Now I won&#x27;t use anything else on my face.  Isn&#x27;t that like bougie as hell? Well anyway, this is a true story.  I felt compelled to open up. So the moral of the story is: Buy this Shiseido facial cotton if you&#x27;re broke and you want to feel like a million bucks. And now you know what to do when you&#x27;re down to your last 10$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The End</li>
            <li> My favorite cotton pads</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of luxury you get by using this Facial Cotton from Shiseido.&lt;br /&gt;It´s made to complement Shiseidos products, soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> No more sore backside. I use these instead of toilet paper and it amazing just how clean they make you feel. Mr. Whipple would be proud.</li>
            <li> Very strong, yet soft and does not fall apart on the face after wiping off cleansers. It is recommended !</li>
            <li> Quality soft cotton that you cannot find at a regular store.  What you pay is what you get.</li>
            <li> I love these facial cottons!! So much better then cotton balls, not to mention very soft and doesnt fall apart. A great buy!</li>
            <li> I used to use regular facial cotton from the drug store. Then I have switched to these squares and they feel so much better on the face, I never want to change back. The squares are very soft, they absorb the make up remover or toner or whatnot, and it feels very soft on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These squares for face only, they are way too soft for a nail polish remover for example.</li>
            <li> VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !</li>
            <li> These are great and exactly what I was looking for to clean my skin, nails or use my toner.</li>
            <li> Excellent, exactly what I was looking for to clean my makeups.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the first time in 1998 and am using them since, they are very different from anything else I have seen on the market. It is not only the case that they are soft, but also they help one to use less lotion... I do not know how it works, but it is true, when I have these my skin care products last longer and I do not need a refill as often as I do otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is such a luxury buy for me - but it&#x27;s so hard to go back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; cotton pads. These things are amazing.</li>
            <li> I NEVER in a million years would have paid so much for cotton squares if a woman I was traveling with had not said, &amp;#34;here, try these.&amp;#34; They make a big difference because of how they feel and they don&#x27;t fall apart. It&#x27;s a little luxury and for me, now, worth the price.</li>
            <li> I started using these when I changed to the Shiseido skin care line and they are so soft and comfortable on even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping and arrival. So glad I found these on Amazon. Now I no longer have to drive 45 minutes away to my nearest Shiseido counter! I ordered three and will definitely be repurchasing from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these to apply my toner after washing my face and for removing my eye-makeup. They are so soft and do not pull on my skin, which helps prevents wrinkles from forming. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These are lovely...thick and luxurious. The package is fairly large. I had trouble figuring out the count before ordering but went ahead with it because of the good reviews. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for wicking vaporizers. Much easier than cotton balls. Just make sure to split the pads apart so they are super thin and then ROLL your wicks, don&#x27;t twist them up.</li>
            <li> Excellent product , Soft cotton perfect for sensitive skins . I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth the money.  The quality is there.</li>
            <li> I tried several other types of cotton rounds/squares, but these won hands down.  And you get a TON of squares, so economical as well as functional.  I order two packages at a time and used them for everything from cleansing to applying makeup.  There are 165 squares in each package.</li>
            <li> Love these, they don&#x27;t shed fibers, I cut in 1/2 fto remove eye makeup.  Little pricey, so took one star off, but I will repurchase</li>
            <li> I use a russian %91 for vaping and have tried several brands of cotton to use. These squares are the best cost effective type I&#x27;ve tried. Cotton bacon was far superior but FAR more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The squares are easy to seperate and cut into perfect size pieces.&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus there is so many in the pack I have enough to remove my makeup and put on skin products. The cotton is ultra smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave lint.</li>
            <li> Very nice facial pads.</li>
            <li> These are super soft and lint free. The best thing is that they don&#x27;t absorb too much product. Some of my lotions and toners are quite expensive and after months of use, these actually will help you save quite a bit of product. Great for removing eye makeup and using as DIY masks as well. I would absolutely give the product five stars but the only thing is that the one that qualifies for Amazon Prime shipping costs a lot more than other sellers. I rather get it for almost half the price from Sephora or etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that the price has been lowered significantly. Changing from 3 stars to 4!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful and will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> These cotton pads are so soft and they do not leave any fibers on you face.  Great to remove your make-up.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s very soft. I have been using it for years.  As I was running out of these facial cottons and about to purchase more, I found that this product was $2 cheaper on the Shisheido official website. So I purchased it on the Shisheido website instead.</li>
            <li> Ok so these are pricey...BUT you get the job done the first time and ultimately use less product...I.e. Eye make up remover or toner... This is also, excellent for men with their facial stubble as regular cotton just is a nightmare to use on their face. You can cut a third off and use the 2/3 portion most of the time and then the 1/3 portion of days you use toner or light eye make up. Anyway you can stretch these as the size of each pad is generous.</li>
            <li> These are seriously the best facial cotton pads on the market. I have extremely sensitive skin and other generic cotton pads always irritated my skin and especially the eyes!! After removing my eye makeup with these pads and then applying my cream, my eyes don&#x27;t sting and burn like they did with other pads. I have been ordering them from amazon because I don&#x27;t have any Shiseido sellers by me, and the price is good considering Macys wants $10 for shipping..that&#x27;s more than the cotton is!!</li>
            <li> Soft, luxurious cotton pads. They are the ultimate in the perfect cotton pad for everything you would use a cotton pad for. I&#x27;m totally spoiled now.</li>
            <li> I love these facial cotton pads!  I have extremely sensitive skin, so this is the only product I can use without breaking out into a rash.&lt;br /&gt;The cotton is incredibly soft but strong, and the pack lasts forever if you only use one cotton pad a day.  I cannot speak highly enough of these things!</li>
            <li> By far the best cotton pad I have used. Soft and yet durable.  Well worth the money.  Noticeable difference from the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; common cotton pads on the market.</li>
            <li> Like these very much!!!!</li>
            <li> shiseido cotton is the best best cotton pads i have ever used!!! it is great for everything, however, it is kinda pricey.</li>
            <li> I purchased these based on all the great reviews and they&#x27;re really worth the price.  I specifically use them to remove my eye makeup given that the eye area is more sensitive and these are extremely durable, gentle and soft.  Will definitely be repurchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> Creme de la creme of cotton pads. Does not waste product. This pack is smaller than those jumbo but cheap packs of cotton, but it will definitely last you a while. The speedy delivery was much appreciated!</li>
            <li> After trying numerous drugstore cotton pads, I decided to give Shiseido a shot after hearing rave reviews of it from my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: I did not buy this product from Amazon- I bought it from The Bay (a Canadian department store), but the price was identical: $9.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: The Shiseido facial cottons come in a package of 165 white rectangular cotton pads. The pads feel like a thin cotton cloth, and when I used them to take off my makeup I was immediately shocked as to how silky soft they felt! The pad is quite large, about 2\\&quot; by 2.5\\&quot;, so I am currently able to use one pad to remove my makeup and apply my toner over the span of two days. Thus, one package of these pads lasts for about 11 months for me, so it is definitely a great deal. Both sides of the pad are identical and feel the same (unlike other cotton pads that have one smooth side and one quilted side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: The pads keep their shape and do not \\&quot;shed\\&quot; fluff like other pads I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Their great feel, large size, 0.5 cm thickness, and strong material makes these the perfect facial cotton pads. I will never buy a different brand again!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find these on amazon! You will never want to use a cotton ball again. They are so soft on my skin and they save the products from being absorbed by a big cotton ball.</li>
            <li> DR,TL - incredibly soft, great for toners/nail polish etc, not made for the peel apart DIY masks (recommend Selena brand for that use), no lint, thick enough to peel in 2 layers and double the use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are super soft and luxurious. I actually purchased these to make my own liquid masks from toners, milk, lemon juice etc. These are NOT made for that purpose and are not made to peel apart or stretch out. I ended up purchasing another brand from Amazon (Selena, see my review) for that. BUT I LOVE these for my toners and makeup remover. I use Skii lotions (toners) with these and also the Koh Gen Do Spa Water to remove my makeup (it is AMAZING). I will not be using these to remove nail polish as they are too luxurious and expensive for that and would rather put them to use on my face and neck. I highly recommend these. SO much softer than the ones you can buy at a US pharmacy (I have always found those too harsh for my sensitive facial skin, especially around eye area). They are pretty thick and absorb a lot of product so I split them in two, just peel it apart from the middle to make 2 pads out of one. Highly recommend. FIY I purchased mine at Nordstroms because I HAD to have it that day</li>
            <li> Excellent, cloths do not leave residue fibers on your face.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I use these with my Bioderma makeup remover and know it&#x27;s much gentler on my skin than drugstore cotton pads. Really love these and will get them again when I run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft~ But I think it&#x27;s not as good as clinique cotton pads I used to use. But clinique&#x27;s cotton pads are not available in US.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft, it feels like cotton made by angels</li>
            <li> For me this really improves the quality of my nightly makeup removal experience. They are so thick and plush and hold so much more makeup remover which I really like. They don&#x27;t disintegrate and soak through to my fingers like regular cotton pads do.  For my purpose, which is to remove makeup, these are such a step up and I absolutely prefer them to regular cotton pads!</li>
            <li> the best cotton pads I&#x27;ve ever used- waaaaaaay better than those CVS/Target/Walgreen&#x27;s etc kinds. It may seem silly but trust me, it&#x27;s worth the money from all the product you save by using these instead!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, meaning my skin is very sensitive to chemicals and cleaning cloths. These lovely little pads are so tough, yet so lovely and gentle on my skin. I use them wet to remove my cream cleanser, and with my cream eye makeup remover. They don&#x27;t shred or hurt at all. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Really enjoy these very soft cotton wipes and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> good quality. good price.</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle on the skin. Really like it.</li>
