            <li>I am very happy with this product and will stick with it.</li>
            <li>This is the best, I have tried.</li>
            <li>Brilliant color.</li>
            <li>I combine the Warm Spice with the Molten Bronze for the perfect combo of auburn hair.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>It adds a nice tone and doesn&#x27;t stain your hands and skin or your shower!</li>
            <li>- I use shade Bright Auburn.  </li>
            <li>I had been getting my hair dyed at a salon for over a year and really loved it.</li>
            <li>They were good.</li>
            <li>Very rich, beautiful shade....</li>
            <li>I am very pleased w/ this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>LOVE the Tressa WaterColors brand!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I really love this product!  </li>
            <li>The smell is actually pleasant no nasty chemical smell.</li>
            <li>The color difference in my hair is amazing and along with that took the shiny silver look away from the gray growth.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice product however.</li>
            <li>Nice to hear -</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of other color shampoos, I like this one best, it has good pigment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair color since using it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I chose Molten Bronze.&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better on someone with dyed red/copper hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a bit more of a color change.</li>
            <li>am more speaking to what this product/brand DOES....</li>
            <li>If you need to get additional lather, just dip your head under the water again and it&#x27;ll bring up more lather.  </li>
            <li>It is a wonderful addition to whatever coloring process you use, and it freshens up the red tones and the color lasts longer.</li>
            <li>It really is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I did not see the more drastic results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This product will work best if you have a professional dye job and want to keep your color fresh in between salon appointments.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this shampoo but with a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great for natural (not colour treated) hair.</li>
            <li>It adds a hint of color and loads of volume to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>For sure the gray is still there if I look closely, but not so very evident as it was.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>The nice thing is you have a lot of control over how much it does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but took repeated uses before I noticed much of a difference at all.  </li>
            <li>I have med to light auburn hair</li>
            <li>I mix this color with the fire red shampoo and it makes a great red-copper color.</li>
            <li>Light lather, non drying.  </li>
            <li>but it does a good job of cleaning and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stain and it made my hair feel and look clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO clean your shower well as it will turn it orange.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a month, I had used Clairol before with good results, and another one called Radiance Red, I think.</li>
            <li>I use a really good moisturizing conditioner though and only shampoo every 3 days.</li>
            <li>I am told I look like a natural redhead :)</li>
            <li>Soft, silky hair with a bit more richness of color.  </li>
            <li>I tried it a few times by itself and it was good, definitely brightening, but the two mixed together is the best.</li>
            <li>It gives my medium brown hair a golden coppery boost.  </li>
            <li>Try it on your roots after applying golden mist to the ends.  </li>
            <li>were right on.  </li>
            <li>Foams up wells, rinses out easily and so far hasn&#x27;t stained my shower or hands.</li>
            <li>It also tends to stain a bit, towels, bathtub, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind going a bit more red</li>
            <li>If your hair is a lighter color than mine is you may notice more drastic changes earlier.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>is the only product I have found besides the ted gibson captivating copper-which is way pricier-</li>
            <li>sure your hair is super wet before applying this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dyed red hair most of my life ($130 salon color treatments), but only since I started using these products did people start commenting on how bright and red my hair looks!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this product because the red coloring fades from my hair too quickly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much to make my dark roots any redder (some redder highlights with more frequent uses), but it makes them brighter, so they blend better with my dyed hair color.</li>
            <li>After the first wash I noticed some highlights, but the real difference was seen after about 3-4 washes.</li>
            <li>well first, and then wash it out it works very well and leaves your hair feeling nice.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I got Warm spice which I mix with a little Molten Bronze and</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and leaves a little bit of color, but I mostly only notice it when the light hits my hair a certain way.</li>
            <li>Really like the product as it works well in between hair coloring.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really a shampoo.</li>
            <li>my color has stayed much stronger and not faded as much.</li>
            <li>After drying I can see that my hair looks shiny, but I don&#x27;t see much change.</li>
            <li>It covers them really well.</li>
            <li>I liked the hint of color it put in my hair, but it really dried it out.</li>
            <li>I love it and may order some other shades to mix in once in a while.</li>
            <li>This product allows me to stretch salon visits way longer than I normally could and the color is very vibrant.</li>
            <li>I usually mix the Warm Spice + Liquid Copper</li>
            <li>It does leave your hair a bit dry, as other reviewers said but nothing a good conditioner won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>If you want to use it everyday and leave the shampoo in for longer than suggested times, you will see more intense results.</li>
            <li>Keeps my color vibrant in between color.</li>
            <li>and I was left with a very pretty caramel and bronze looking color to my hair.</li>
            <li>Kept my freshly dyed copper (over blonde highlights) for 2 months now.</li>
            <li>I recently switched from permanent dyes to temporary colors, but while these did not damage my hair as much they often look streaky for the first day or two after application and fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews prior to purchasing and all of the very positive reviews</li>
            <li>It actually will give hair a color boost if you select the right color for your hair.</li>
            <li>(I know this review should be for Molten Bronze, but my experience is fantastic with the other 2 colors so</li>
            <li>And very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I found that it needs to be used daily and consistently for the color to deposit correctly.</li>
            <li>This actually did help a bit with my oily scalp, though, so I was able to shampoo every other day while using it.</li>
            <li>First of all, I had bleached blonde hair that a hairstylist dyed to brunette for me with lowlights, toners, and dye.</li>
            <li>Wish prices were consistent and low.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tressa WaterColors Shampoo does not give my hair as much red color as hair dye does, BUT the color is even and consistent.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of how the red dye was applied, it faded quickly leaving my hair looking almost the same as it had before I dyed it... with the added bonus of hair dye damage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s medium brown with auburn highlights (naturally)</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW...</li>
            <li>I have natural auburn hair.</li>
            <li>I play around with combining colors in the red/copper family to achieve the tone I want, and always include  Molten Bronze for a natural look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe in daily washing unless I&#x27;m really sweaty or something which sometimes happens in the summer.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally a reddish, blond-brown.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair at home and had it professionally done at salons.  </li>
            <li>I had naturally reddish hair which has faded throughout the years.</li>
            <li>70 years old...</li>
            <li>My natural color has faded over the years.</li>
            <li>I definitely see a red tint in my light brown hair, especially out in the sun.</li>
            <li>I can see that my next color will last substantially longer if I have this maintenance right from the start.</li>
            <li>(we rarely talk, just don&#x27;t know each other that well....)</li>
            <li>For more subtle results, you can just use it once in a while.</li>
            <li>I was the first time, but the second time just put the shampoo on my hair and left if for 4-5 minutes before rinsing it off.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has lost it&#x27;s red hues.</li>
            <li>my color is as vibrant after 4 weeks as the day I left the salon.</li>
            <li>Actually does work- very natural looking and no &#x27;line&#x27; of grow out!</li>
            <li>This brings out my red highlights and looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I am a natural red head...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had random people comment on loving the color of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I can skip a shampoo or two for a lighter less red look which is fun too.</li>
            <li>I first used it to add life to my naturally auburn hair as it began to dull, and now use it to extend the time between coloring as well as to add manageability.  </li>
            <li>I always use Davine&#x27;s alchemic conditioner in copper after using this shampoo because the shampoo is a little drying, and the Davines conditioner is very nourishing and also adds some color.</li>

            <li> For more subtle results, you can just use it once in a while.</li>
            <li> I was the first time, but the second time just put the shampoo on my hair and left if for 4-5 minutes before rinsing it off.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has lost it&#x27;s red hues.</li>
            <li> my color is as vibrant after 4 weeks as the day I left the salon.</li>
            <li> Actually does work- very natural looking and no &#x27;line&#x27; of grow out!</li>
            <li> This brings out my red highlights and looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I am a natural red head...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had random people comment on loving the color of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I can skip a shampoo or two for a lighter less red look which is fun too.</li>
            <li> I first used it to add life to my naturally auburn hair as it began to dull, and now use it to extend the time between coloring as well as to add manageability.  </li>
            <li> I always use Davine&#x27;s alchemic conditioner in copper after using this shampoo because the shampoo is a little drying, and the Davines conditioner is very nourishing and also adds some color.</li>
            <li> The color may be deepened by lengthening the time you leave the shampoo on your hair-I do about 3 mins every other time I wash my hair to add a soft reddish tint to my medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I had my hair died strawberry blonde professionally from a dark blonde and was spending a fortune trying to keep my roots up.</li>
            <li> Though I like it, it&#x27;s actually cheaper for me to just dye my hair twice a month in the long run.</li>
            <li> As long as I&#x27;m dyed copper, I&#x27;ll never want to be without this.</li>
            <li> The red has almost all washed out and the blond color of my hair got very drab....and along with that about an inch of grey root growth.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned because a few people said that their scalp dried out so recommended to be careful while shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Instead, you need to use several times to build up color, then you can switch to using every other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I only need to do the demi about every other month with this.</li>
            <li> Every other product I&#x27;ve tried either leaves freakish red streaks or doesn&#x27;t add any color.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all, if anything it adds body and softness....</li>
            <li> This shampoo does take a little bit longer to lather than regular shampoo</li>
            <li> leave my hair loosely in a towel (or an inexpensive shower cap), then rinse out, condition, and voila!  </li>
            <li> I mix this with Wet Brick to use over my (ahem) aging naturally-medium-brown-but-demi-dyed-auburn hair.</li>
            <li> only need a few teaspoons per wash.</li>
            <li> I shampoo every other day and have been using this product exclusively for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products like glazes and color depositing conditioner</li>
            <li> and you do not wish to mess with henna or semi permeant dyes.</li>
            <li> I wasnt crazy about this at first, as it deposits some color but is a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I wanted a little color &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; between salon visits, but this is not what I would use for that.  </li>
            <li> I like how I can add a little kick to my natural color without my hair looking fake.</li>
            <li> I no longer feel like my hair is on a crazy roller-coaster from Ronald MacDonald red to brown and back again.  </li>
            <li> My hair turned a gray, ashy green.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to buy the liquid copper but some of those reviews said it left behind pink.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now and have not experienced the dryness that others mention.</li>
            <li> You have very little to no gray hair and just want a bit of a color boost to your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the result would be without using both products.</li>
            <li> I can see a subtle difference.</li>
            <li> Too bad not all colors are priced the same.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked the hint of color it put in my hair, but it really dried it out.</li>
            <li> I like how I can add a little kick to my natural color without my hair looking fake.</li>
            <li> Really like the product as it works well in between hair coloring. I found that it needs to be used daily and consistently for the color to deposit correctly. It actually will give hair a color boost if you select the right color for your hair. Too bad not all colors are priced the same. It also tends to stain a bit, towels, bathtub, so be aware of that. The smell is actually pleasant no nasty chemical smell. Though I like it, it&#x27;s actually cheaper for me to just dye my hair twice a month in the long run. I use Colorsilk dye and can get 2 boxes of different color dye for $5-6 per month. This product will work best if you have a professional dye job and want to keep your color fresh in between salon appointments. You have very little to no gray hair and just want a bit of a color boost to your hair and you do not wish to mess with henna or semi permeant dyes.</li>
            <li> I had been getting my hair dyed at a salon for over a year and really loved it. But I wanted to save money, so I went back to the dreaded boxed hair color. It was so dull and boring. I found the Tressa Molten Bronze Shampoo online and decided to give it a try. After the first wash I noticed some highlights, but the real difference was seen after about 3-4 washes. This brings out my red highlights and looks so natural. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair color since using it. The nice thing is you have a lot of control over how much it does. If you want to use it everyday and leave the shampoo in for longer than suggested times, you will see more intense results. For more subtle results, you can just use it once in a while. I love it and may order some other shades to mix in once in a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to give a color boost to my un-colortreated hair.  It&#x27;s medium brown with auburn highlights (naturally) and I wanted to boost the red without permanent hair color damage.  I shampoo every other day and have been using this product exclusively for a couple of weeks.  I can see a subtle difference. The color is deeper.  It&#x27;s nice, but took repeated uses before I noticed much of a difference at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind going a bit more red so may look for a different shade next time.  If your hair is a lighter color than mine is you may notice more drastic changes earlier.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really a shampoo. i don&#x27;t know what it is. It didn&#x27;t lather, and left my hair all gummy. I tried it for a month, I had used Clairol before with good results, and another one called Radiance Red, I think. They were good. This one, I&#x27;ll skip.</li>
            <li> This makes my colored auburn hair retain coppery hues weeks after coloring. I have tried other products like glazes and color depositing conditioner but this stuff has worked best for me. I am told I look like a natural redhead :)</li>
            <li> Put my childhood auburn back in my hair. Foams up wells, rinses out easily and so far hasn&#x27;t stained my shower or hands. Will continue to buy</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product! Every time I wash my hair with it, people ask me if I dyed my hair. Even color distribution, nourishing shampoo. Brilliant color. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the name- this is a product for Red-Auburn hair.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW...this product is great!!  I read all the reviews prior to purchasing and all of the very positive reviews were right on.  I am glad I chose Molten Bronze.&lt;br /&gt;About 6 weeks ago I had my hair foiled with blond, red highlights.  The red has almost all washed out and the blond color of my hair got very drab....and along with that about an inch of grey root growth.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned because a few people said that their scalp dried out so recommended to be careful while shampooing.  I was the first time, but the second time just put the shampoo on my hair and left if for 4-5 minutes before rinsing it off.  The color difference in my hair is amazing and along with that took the shiny silver look away from the gray growth.  For sure the gray is still there if I look closely, but not so very evident as it was.&lt;br /&gt;Next week I am getting my hair colored again, and I know already that I will not be without this product now that I have tried it out.  I can see that my next color will last substantially longer if I have this maintenance right from the start.</li>
            <li> It really works!  The product is supposed to be a shampoo and conditioner, but I just use it for shampoo.  Keeps my color vibrant in between color.</li>
            <li> I wanted a little color &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; between salon visits, but this is not what I would use for that.  Not enough pigment to notice any visible color enhancement after just one shampoo. Instead, you need to use several times to build up color, then you can switch to using every other shampoo.  This actually did help a bit with my oily scalp, though, so I was able to shampoo every other day while using it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other color shampoos, I like this one best, it has good pigment and I think over the last month that I have used it my color has stayed much stronger and not faded as much.</li>
            <li> First of all, I had bleached blonde hair that a hairstylist dyed to brunette for me with lowlights, toners, and dye. My hair turned a gray, ashy green. I bought this shampoo and within one wash, those disgusting tones were gone and I was left with a very pretty caramel and bronze looking color to my hair. Thank goodness for this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have natural auburn hair. As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has lost it&#x27;s red hues. I bought this in hopes to get my &amp;#34;fire&amp;#34;back. I did 2 washes with this product. I even left it on my hair for about 10 to fifteen minutes each time. After drying I can see that my hair looks shiny, but I don&#x27;t see much change. Maybe it would work better on someone with dyed red/copper hair. It was a nice product however. It didn&#x27;t stain and it made my hair feel and look clean and shiny. I would not buy this again,  but I may try out another color.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a bit more of a color change. I have only used it for a week, but my color is still the same. That said, I like it as a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Kept my freshly dyed copper (over blonde highlights) for 2 months now. As long as I&#x27;m dyed copper, I&#x27;ll never want to be without this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tressa WaterColors shampoos for several years, since my then hairdresser sold me a bottle.  I first used it to add life to my naturally auburn hair as it began to dull, and now use it to extend the time between coloring as well as to add manageability.  I play around with combining colors in the red/copper family to achieve the tone I want, and always include  Molten Bronze for a natural look. The price and ease of ordering through Amazon is the best way for me to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE the Tressa WaterColors brand!  I have med to light auburn hair w/copper highlights.  I usually mix the Warm Spice + Liquid Copper (I know this review should be for Molten Bronze, but my experience is fantastic with the other 2 colors so am more speaking to what this product/brand DOES....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hair is super wet before applying this shampoo.  If you need to get additional lather, just dip your head under the water again and it&#x27;ll bring up more lather.  I like to leave this shampoo in for about 10 min, so I get out of shower, leave my hair loosely in a towel (or an inexpensive shower cap), then rinse out, condition, and voila!  Soft, silky hair with a bit more richness of color.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all, if anything it adds body and softness....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t change the color(s), but it adds dimension and richer tones, especially if you use it often - like every time you shampoo,  for about 4 times in a row.  And then occasionally after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red colors do NOT stain the shower/tub.  Not at all.  I had an acquaintance text me (we rarely talk, just don&#x27;t know each other that well....) and she specifically asked what product(s) I use in my hair because she LOVES the color.  I&#x27;ve had random people comment on loving the color of my hair.  Nice to hear - and this Tressa brand is one of the reasons I get the compliments!  Oh - and I use a cheapo hair color rather than spend tons at the salon - I use Revlon ColorSilk 3D tehnology.  Love it!  It&#x27;s about $3 or $4 at Walmart - I use shade Bright Auburn.  Very rich, beautiful shade....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this Tressa product.  It is a wonderful addition to whatever coloring process you use, and it freshens up the red tones and the color lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I mix this with Wet Brick to use over my (ahem) aging naturally-medium-brown-but-demi-dyed-auburn hair. The demi dye avoids visible roots, and using the Tressa WaterColors extends the vibrancy of the color. I only need to do the demi about every other month with this. Excellent.</li>
            <li> Actually does work- very natural looking and no &#x27;line&#x27; of grow out!</li>
            <li> I mix this color with the fire red shampoo and it makes a great red-copper color. I tried it a few times by itself and it was good, definitely brightening, but the two mixed together is the best. I always use Davine&#x27;s alchemic conditioner in copper after using this shampoo because the shampoo is a little drying, and the Davines conditioner is very nourishing and also adds some color. I&#x27;m not sure what the result would be without using both products. I&#x27;ve had dyed red hair most of my life ($130 salon color treatments), but only since I started using these products did people start commenting on how bright and red my hair looks! It doesn&#x27;t do much to make my dark roots any redder (some redder highlights with more frequent uses), but it makes them brighter, so they blend better with my dyed hair color. I definitely recommend this shampoo but with a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wasnt crazy about this at first, as it deposits some color but is a bit drying. However I found out sort of by accident, that is you condition your hair well first, and then wash it out it works very well and leaves your hair feeling nice.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product I have found besides the ted gibson captivating copper-which is way pricier- that deposits a copper tone instead of pinkish hues. I was tempted to buy the liquid copper but some of those reviews said it left behind pink.&lt;br /&gt;DO clean your shower well as it will turn it orange.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  It gives my medium brown hair a golden coppery boost.  This shampoo does take a little bit longer to lather than regular shampoo but it does a good job of cleaning and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased w/ this shampoo.  It adds a hint of color and loads of volume to my fine hair.  The color may be deepened by lengthening the time you leave the shampoo on your hair-I do about 3 mins every other time I wash my hair to add a soft reddish tint to my medium brown hair.  It is a bit drying, but  conditioning ends helps!</li>
            <li> Adds a lot of coppery color.  Try it on your roots after applying golden mist to the ends.  Light lather, non drying.  Wish prices were consistent and low.  only need a few teaspoons per wash.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. I don&#x27;t know what I would without it. I had my hair died strawberry blonde professionally from a dark blonde and was spending a fortune trying to keep my roots up. This product allows me to stretch salon visits way longer than I normally could and the color is very vibrant. I can skip a shampoo or two for a lighter less red look which is fun too. I combine the Warm Spice with the Molten Bronze for the perfect combo of auburn hair. When I skip my hair is back to a lighter strawberry blonde but you still can&#x27;t see my roots. It covers them really well. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now and have not experienced the dryness that others mention. I use a really good moisturizing conditioner though and only shampoo every 3 days. I don&#x27;t believe in daily washing unless I&#x27;m really sweaty or something which sometimes happens in the summer. Hope this helps those who are on the fence about this product. It really is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product because the red coloring fades from my hair too quickly.  It smells really nice and leaves a little bit of color, but I mostly only notice it when the light hits my hair a certain way. I did not see the more drastic results I was looking for. However, I do use it time to time even though my hair is darker now just to give it a warmer undertone.</li>
            <li> I have light/medium reddish-auburn hair which I color for gray coverage. I got Warm spice which I mix with a little Molten Bronze and my color is as vibrant after 4 weeks as the day I left the salon. Awesome product and very reasonably priced. Every other product I&#x27;ve tried either leaves freakish red streaks or doesn&#x27;t add any color. I am sold on this in a way I haven&#x27;t been on a product in years. Will buy out their stock if they ever stop making it!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a reddish, blond-brown.  I have been frustrated over the years trying to dye my hair red.  I&#x27;ve dyed my hair at home and had it professionally done at salons.  Regardless of how the red dye was applied, it faded quickly leaving my hair looking almost the same as it had before I dyed it... with the added bonus of hair dye damage.  I recently switched from permanent dyes to temporary colors, but while these did not damage my hair as much they often look streaky for the first day or two after application and fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tressa WaterColors Shampoo does not give my hair as much red color as hair dye does, BUT the color is even and consistent.  I no longer feel like my hair is on a crazy roller-coaster from Ronald MacDonald red to brown and back again.  And this shampoo treats my hair well.  In fact, it seems to add thickness to my hair making it feel healthier than before.  I am very happy with this product and will stick with it.</li>
            <li> I wish the color was permanent.  I&#x27;ll buy again..in different shades.</li>
            <li> Great for natural (not colour treated) hair. I had naturally reddish hair which has faded throughout the years. This molten bronze shampoo added some red back after only one use. And very natural looking. It does leave your hair a bit dry, as other reviewers said but nothing a good conditioner won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I am a natural red head...70 years old...My natural color has faded over the years. This adds reddish color and highlights. Will order this again.</li>
            <li> Works! I definitely see a red tint in my light brown hair, especially out in the sun. I think it might be drying my hair out though, I don&#x27;t recommend using it every time you shampoo, and use a deep conditioner after.</li>
            <li> This is the best, I have tried. It adds a nice tone and doesn&#x27;t stain your hands and skin or your shower!</li>
