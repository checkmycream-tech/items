            <li>Best thing I ever bought for lips and hands!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>Good!</li>
            <li>After a couple of days my hands looked great.  </li>
            <li>and when I get up in the morning my hands feel great and look noticeably better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for face, hands, elbows, heels.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Sweet Blessed Bee Magic&amp;#34; is great.</li>
            <li>Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>It is very nice indeed.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>swear every chap stick I&#x27;ve ever bought, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or otherwise, has never done a good job of stopping my lips from getting chapped every winter.  </li>
            <li>The stick is really good, but it feels greasy on my face--</li>
            <li>let it warm and spread around and repeat until I have good coverage on face and neck.</li>
            <li>but, good for me it fades very quickly so that&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was out of aloe vera (my sunburn go-to-remedy) and remembered reading on the Sweet Bee Magic jar that it was good for sunburns</li>
            <li>I was sure there would be a lot of peeling.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t written many reviews but, I love what this has done for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of health problems and spend most of my time in bed</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace Egyptian Magic.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is made with organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Possibly the best product I&#x27;ve found is Udderly Smooth lotion, but I was hoping to find something more like, well, like this.  </li>
            <li>Safe, non-toxic....you can feel good about your whole family using it, baby to grandma/pa.  </li>
            <li>Great natural skin product!</li>
            <li>lobes to make it easy to put earrings on -</li>
            <li>I like the stick as an easy applicator.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Medicine Mama, your Sweet Bee Magic</li>
            <li>I loooove the sweet bee magic.  </li>
            <li>scent is fine with me, my husband doesn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, red hair (and yes, I should have known better).  </li>
            <li>I am beginning to use on the rest of my body but still working on a good application process without using too much since it isn&#x27;t cheap (but so worth it)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have also used it on bug bites and scapes, my grand daughter already goes right to the jar for those type of boo boos</li>
            <li>The product in the jar is great for dry spots on your skin</li>
            <li>It does a great job keeping your skin silky soft--even now, I can&#x27;t help but run my fingers down my legs.  </li>
            <li>I really love it as a lip balm and it makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li>Love the organic ingredients and how it makes my skin feel, soft &amp; supple.</li>
            <li>they slide right in when I use this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using both right now</li>
            <li>raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medicine Mama...this really is medicine for the hands and lips!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li>I pat a small amount of warm water on it then dab a very small smear of Sweet Bee Magic on my finger tips and rub together then lightly tap on face</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re using too much.</li>
            <li>This is the real product.</li>
            <li>Especially when soooo many womens products just don&#x27;t deliver anything near what they promise.&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face</li>
            <li>I stumbled across this during special daily deals Amazon was having</li>
            <li>- the only drawback is that it&#x27;s a bit oily, so if you use it as a morning facial moisturizer, I would recommend using very LIGHTLY, and giving it five minutes or so to soak in before you apply any makeup.  </li>
            <li>It took a long time to sink in (over an hour), but if I put it on right before bed, by morning my skin was very hydrated feeling.  </li>
            <li>As good as Egyptian Magic and less expensive.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old can put it on her eczema spots all by herself without making a huge mess.</li>
            <li>so anything that can make me feel better with such little effort is a keeper.</li>
            <li>This Sweet Bee Magic makes my skin look dewy, soft, refreshed and younger even though my wrinkles are still there, I have no more crate paper on my face!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent for general skin care and should be a staple for keeping hands and lips soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>so, I recommend using small, light swipes.</li>
            <li>Some lipsticks are hard and do not go on easily</li>
            <li>Very greasy for my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Use it as a hair conditioner, and general skin creme.</li>
            <li>Finally something that helps clear up my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  </li>

            <li> I had not realized how great it is until last week when I stayed out in the sun too long without sunscreen and got one of the worst sun burns I&#x27;ve had in years!!  </li>
            <li> I have just started to get dry crate paper skin on my face.</li>
            <li> my skin still looked dry.</li>

            <li> but, I had a white dry rough spot on my arm that is now gone which nothing I applied before helped the least little bit.</li>
            <li> No more cracks and dry sandaper-y body parts!  </li>
            <li> so this was a practical buy despite it seeming a little pricey.</li>
            <li> and i can use less make up as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale with sensitive skin with tendencies toward dry, patchy excema in cold weather.  </li>
            <li> should note that I&#x27;ve lately been having trouble finding a moisturizer of any sort that doesn&#x27;t break me out, give me a rash, or both.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s less expensive seal&#x27;s the deal.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I work in a glass studio and a wood shop</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks, I began to notice discoloration on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and you could never tell how badly I burnt myself.  </li>
            <li> I am shocked and amazed, because I have had no peeling what-so-ever; with a burn as bad as it was</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated using steroid creams.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This product is life-changing.</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever bought for lips and hands!&lt;br /&gt;I swear every chap stick I&#x27;ve ever bought, &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or otherwise, has never done a good job of stopping my lips from getting chapped every winter.  I&#x27;m very pale with sensitive skin with tendencies toward dry, patchy excema in cold weather.  To make matters worse, I work in a glass studio and a wood shop so my hands are like a farmer&#x27;s wife!  My cuticles crack and split and the skin gets itchy and raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medicine Mama...this really is medicine for the hands and lips!  After a couple of days my hands looked great.  I put it on at night before I go to bed and when I get up in the morning my hands feel great and look noticeably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it on my legs and face too and it seems to work well - the only drawback is that it&#x27;s a bit oily, so if you use it as a morning facial moisturizer, I would recommend using very LIGHTLY, and giving it five minutes or so to soak in before you apply any makeup.  I also coat my hands before putting my driving gloves on and heading out the door to the studio.  For feet - it got rid of my rough heels in ONE night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for general skin care and should be a staple for keeping hands and lips soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;No scent and a little goes a long way so this was a practical buy despite it seeming a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I would order this again. I really love it as a lip balm and it makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I started out liking this product a lot.  It took a long time to sink in (over an hour), but if I put it on right before bed, by morning my skin was very hydrated feeling.  Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks, I began to notice discoloration on my skin.  I&#x27;d begun to get blobs of red.  I stopped using the product almost immediately, and the rash was gone within a couple of days.  I tried the product again, rash came back.  During this time, I did not change anything else about my skincare routine, so this is definitely what caused the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I&#x27;ve lately been having trouble finding a moisturizer of any sort that doesn&#x27;t break me out, give me a rash, or both.  Possibly the best product I&#x27;ve found is Udderly Smooth lotion, but I was hoping to find something more like, well, like this.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the organic ingredients and how it makes my skin feel, soft &amp; supple. Keep the wand in your purse &amp; the tub on your vanity. Great for face, hands, elbows, heels. Safe, non-toxic....you can feel good about your whole family using it, baby to grandma/pa.  You will not be disappointed. For those that say it&#x27;s greasy...you&#x27;re using too much. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> try it in your hair it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I had not realized how great it is until last week when I stayed out in the sun too long without sunscreen and got one of the worst sun burns I&#x27;ve had in years!!  I am fair skinned, red hair (and yes, I should have known better).  I was out of aloe vera (my sunburn go-to-remedy) and remembered reading on the Sweet Bee Magic jar that it was good for sunburns so I used it.  I am shocked and amazed, because I have had no peeling what-so-ever; with a burn as bad as it was I was sure there would be a lot of peeling. It&#x27;s been 10-days and you could never tell how badly I burnt myself.  Thank you Medicine Mama, your Sweet Bee Magic will always be a staple in my cabinet!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Sweet Blessed Bee Magic&amp;#34; is great. Some lipsticks are hard and do not go on easily but they do when I use this. The product in the jar is great for dry spots on your skin and I use it on my ear lobes to make it easy to put earrings on - sometimes they don&#x27;t go in without a struggle but they slide right in when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Use it as a hair conditioner, and general skin creme. It is very nice indeed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t written many reviews but, I love what this has done for my skin. I have just started to get dry crate paper skin on my face. No matter what other cream or lotion I&#x27;ve used on my face my skin still looked dry. This Sweet Bee Magic makes my skin look dewy, soft, refreshed and younger even though my wrinkles are still there, I have no more crate paper on my face!!! I&#x27;ve had a lot of health problems and spend most of my time in bed so anything that can make me feel better with such little effort is a keeper. Especially when soooo many womens products just don&#x27;t deliver anything near what they promise.&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face I pat a small amount of warm water on it then dab a very small smear of Sweet Bee Magic on my finger tips and rub together then lightly tap on face let it warm and spread around and repeat until I have good coverage on face and neck. I use a heavier amount at night and lighter during the day since it can give you a shine.&lt;br /&gt;I also use on my hands and arms applying the same way as my face. My skin on my hand is rather crate paperish but, I had a white dry rough spot on my arm that is now gone which nothing I applied before helped the least little bit. I am beginning to use on the rest of my body but still working on a good application process without using too much since it isn&#x27;t cheap (but so worth it)&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on bug bites and scapes, my grand daughter already goes right to the jar for those type of boo boos now!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fine with me, my husband doesn&#x27;t like it but, good for me it fades very quickly so that&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep this as a regular part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> As good as Egyptian Magic and less expensive.  I&#x27;m using both right now and I may even prefer this to EM. The fact that it&#x27;s less expensive seal&#x27;s the deal. Pleasant smell. Very greasy for my very dry skin.  I especially like it around my eyes. This is a  4 Oz. Jar</li>
            <li> Great natural skin product! since using it, my skin has actually cleared up and i can use less make up as well! love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It is nourishing and rejuvenating. No petro Chemicals in this product.  Highest quality ingredients from Mother Nature. Save the bees!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace Egyptian Magic. The oils in this product smelled rancid and I couldn&#x27;t use it. Using EM again.</li>
            <li> I received this on the day that it was scheduled to arrive.  I&#x27;ve never heard of Medicine Mama until I heard the creator talk about it on a public radio show.  I loooove the sweet bee magic.  It does a great job keeping your skin silky soft--even now, I can&#x27;t help but run my fingers down my legs.  It also work wonders on your heels and elbows.  No more cracks and dry sandaper-y body parts!  Love it.  The stick is really good, but it feels greasy on my face--so, I recommend using small, light swipes.</li>
            <li> This is the real product. Good!</li>
            <li> Will give these a try. Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Finally something that helps clear up my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  I hated using steroid creams.  I stumbled across this during special daily deals Amazon was having and I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  I love that it is made with organic ingredients.  I will definitely be purchasing more.  I like the stick as an easy applicator.  My 6 year old can put it on her eczema spots all by herself without making a huge mess.</li>
