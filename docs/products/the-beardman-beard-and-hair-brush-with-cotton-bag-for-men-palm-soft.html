            <li>it feels good in your hand</li>
            <li>Good brush.</li>
            <li>brush is best used after applying your beard oil or wax, or as quick brushing and touch ups are needed.  </li>
            <li>I use this to neatly brush my beard and also rub my Honest Amish beard balm into my beard.</li>
            <li>After reading many inexpensive brush reviews I wasn&#x27;t expecting softness.</li>
            <li>Great comb, felt that it removed old skin and end of the line hair from beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comfortable size if you have a beard under 3&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it seems to be a nice quality brush for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It works good but the bristles are to short.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the brush for my hair  except for a quick swipe here and there.</li>
            <li>Its ok for long beard, but i think it works much better in shorter beard.</li>
            <li>My beard was noticeably more full and felt so soft and the sheen from my beard</li>
            <li>As soon as I brushed my beard, I realized how much more manly I became!</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve applied whatever products you use by hand, this brush does a great job at spreading out any uneven areas and finishing up your styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The boar hair bristles are strong enough to tease out the beard hairs lying closer to the skin without scraping the skin.</li>
            <li>Not as soft as I expected but works well and feels pretty nice.</li>
            <li>This is one fine brush for facial hair!  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a nice little storage bag.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work to apply oils very well but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>At first I was nervous about the soft bristles but it works so well.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for any man with face fur.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>A little small but a great hair &amp; beard brush.</li>
            <li>Palm size soft boar bristle brush measures 4.25&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough to be comfortable against the skin, but coarse enough to work out any tangles that may be in your beard.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the palm-sized soft bristle brush.</li>

            <li> This brush is very well made and does the job for me everyday!...</li>

            <li> This, while not being soft, surely isn&#x27;t hard or rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> Sadly it doesn&#x27;t work very well for that purpose, but</li>
            <li> It makes my unruly stache lay down and behave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> but the brush is a bit too harsh for my skin.....feels synthetic some.  </li>

            <li> I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because as I started brushing, not many but a few small bristles started to separate from the brush.</li>

            <li> it that doesn&#x27;t make it a bad brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is a great brush. At first I was nervous about the soft bristles but it works so well. I&#x27;m going to buy another one to replace a brush j have with really stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> Great beard brush! Palm size soft boar bristle brush measures 4.25&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a comfortable size if you have a beard under 3&amp;#34;. A longer beard than 3&amp;#34; would require a larger brush IMHO.... This brush is very well made and does the job for me everyday!... Looking for a brush to distribute some beard oil? You just found it!...</li>
            <li> Good price, came on time. This brush smells real bad. I am trying to take steps to neutralize the odor but i wish i had known about the odor before purchasing the brush</li>
            <li> I bought this brush with plans of using it to apply some beard oil and beard wax to avoid greasy hands.  Sadly it doesn&#x27;t work very well for that purpose, but it that doesn&#x27;t make it a bad brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is best used after applying your beard oil or wax, or as quick brushing and touch ups are needed.  The bristles are soft enough to be comfortable against the skin, but coarse enough to work out any tangles that may be in your beard.  When trying to use this brush to apply different products I found that the layout and type of bristles (boar&#x27;s hair) just don&#x27;t work well for gathering product in it and transferring it to your beard.  Once you&#x27;ve applied whatever products you use by hand, this brush does a great job at spreading out any uneven areas and finishing up your styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it seems to be a nice quality brush for a reasonable price.  It also comes with a nice little storage bag.</li>
            <li> My beard is thick, this brush is not. It works good but the bristles are to short. If the bristles were longer it would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Been a week now since I&#x27;ve started using it.  it feels good in your hand but the brush is a bit too harsh for my skin.....feels synthetic some.  Overall it does the job and does it well</li>
            <li> A little small but a great hair &amp; beard brush. After reading many inexpensive brush reviews I wasn&#x27;t expecting softness. This, while not being soft, surely isn&#x27;t hard or rough on the skin. Don&#x27;t know if it all Boar hair but it&#x27;s uniform and no bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as I expected but works well and feels pretty nice. Doesn&#x27;t work to apply oils very well but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Great comb, felt that it removed old skin and end of the line hair from beard. Its ok for long beard, but i think it works much better in shorter beard.</li>
            <li> As soon as I brushed my beard, I realized how much more manly I became! My beard was noticeably more full and felt so soft and the sheen from my beard balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>

            <li> Beard massage?! YES PLEASE</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for the price, would buy from again</li>
            <li> Good brush. I purchased the palm-sized soft bristle brush. The boar hair bristles are strong enough to tease out the beard hairs lying closer to the skin without scraping the skin. No problems with bristles falling out. The boar bristles initially seemed to absorb some of the beard oil I was using, but after a week of daily use it seems to be spreading the oils as expected.
