            <li>You need to have nice, healthy hair to start with, and it will keep it that way.</li>

            <li>Love Love Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love how shiny it makes my hair</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping smells great</li>
            <li>It reminded me more of spritz.</li>
            <li>I have been using kerastase for more than 3 years.</li>
            <li>This product works better than the store brands I have purchased.</li>
            <li>This flat iron spray works well and smells great!</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes your hair soft and shiny with no frizz!!</li>
            <li>I use this every single day, its awesome!!</li>
            <li>and i gotta say im glad i got this for cheap</li>
            <li>this product is getting.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this product isn&#x27;t going to just magically make your hair feel silky and smooth all on</li>
            <li>Got2b Guardian Angel Flat Iron Balm with Gloss Finish is very good.</li>
            <li>But since using this Got2b flat iron balm my hair is in incredible shape.  </li>
            <li>The smell is alright, in my opinion and it isn&#x27;t too strong, either.</li>
            <li>I sprayed my hair pretty close (about 2 inches away) once, and it was kind of sticky when I tried to straighten it</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, I notice my hair turns out smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>And is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It left a great shine and no breakage at all.</li>
            <li>I section the hair again and give it a light coating with this heat protectant again and then use my Chi 1.25&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great deal compared to salon products, so I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s on to straightening, so I reapply a light coat to all of my hair again and straighten away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make hair fizzy and it make your hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of heat protectants and this buy far is the best!</li>
            <li>I always end up with a silky, smooth finish</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the result: shiny, soft - simply beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>She has long beautiful brown hair.</li>
            <li>I use flat iron almost every day and finding a product that will give protection (real protection) to my hair is priceless.</li>
            <li>Very nice, overall.</li>
            <li>I was with a paraben free shampoo/condioner to clean all products out of my hair the day before I color it.  </li>
            <li>I am positive there is something better for my hair out there.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product to keep your hair healthy and shiny, even if you use a flat iron every day.</li>
            <li>It really has been keeping my hair safe from all of the heat</li>
            <li>Any way, I still have a good amount of the product left and will use it up until finished.</li>
            <li>I have fine, frizzy hair that is super curly if left to it&#x27;s own devices.  </li>
            <li>One of those items that I can&#x27;t go without is a good flat iron heat protecting spray.</li>
            <li>I recently tried Got2B Guardian Angel and am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to laugh at the reviews where people said they began straighting their hair</li>
            <li>I love this, made my hair so soft and straight!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely find hair in the drain or on the floor..  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>hair seems to be much smoother and stays looking good until the next shampoo (for me</li>
            <li>Worth the price on line .</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 11 year old daughter along with a flat iron, her hair smells great and is protected</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I brush the section of hair after I spray it on to make sure all the strands are coated, flat-iron, and then move on to the next section.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I like to use it even if I&#x27;m not straightening my hair just because it takes away the volume so much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves your hair very shiny!</li>
            <li>It did make my hair shiny, but also made it stick to the hot iron and pulled out hair.</li>
            <li>i like the silky smooth soft look..</li>
            <li>I will give the product 4 stars for now because I used it only once with fabulous results!</li>
            <li>At first, while your hair is still moist from the spray, YES, it&#x27;ll look greasy.</li>
            <li>After using this, my hair looks really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the first heat protection spray I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Tried hot water, even tried hot water with Dawn soap, it streams out instead of a misty spray to evenly coat the hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>In the shower I use super hydrating shampoo and conditioner from Biolage, then towel dry it lightly and spray on a spray leave in conditioner which I comb through.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that, while I have used sprays in the past, none of them left my hair feeling this natural!</li>
            <li>it seems to have made my hair more dry instead providing the moisture that I need for pre-heat</li>
            <li>(Although I did try it this way the first few times, and can honestly say there is no difference between how my hair looks at the end.)</li>
            <li>All of this makes my hair feel like pure silk  </li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>(make sure hair is dry before using the iron!).  </li>
            <li>It made my hair easy to flat iron and the whole process was a lot quicker.</li>
            <li>If you have color treated hair, it is extremely important to protect it from all kinds of heat--not only to protect it from breakage, but also to prevent color from seeping out of the hair&#x27;s cuticle.</li>
            <li>I watched a YouTube video featuring this spray and she used way too much product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Makes it really shiny too.</li>
            <li>but it makes my hair feel tacky like i have to much product in my hair..</li>
            <li>This thermal protection spray works really well when I flatiron my hair.  </li>
            <li>It work really well</li>
            <li>I really like how this worked on my hair.</li>
            <li>The whole process took me over 20 minutes and my hair sometimes still felt frizzy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>: oily if you use too much, it sizzles when it passes through the flat-iron, hair is not as shiny as I wanted it to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spray it lightly on my damp hair, paying extra attention to the ends and parts</li>
            <li>My hair is SO soft right now</li>
            <li>and i actually just spray it on after washing my hair and it leaves my hair nice and flat instead of a a poof ball</li>
            <li>Just apply freely on your dry hair and then iron it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little concerned at first as I thought Guardian Angel was a little light weight and wouldn&#x27;t be able to provide much protection.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li>The scent is hard to describe but it&#x27;s really nice--</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard and is a nice addition to add in your hair care regimen.</li>
            <li>, I got this stuff the other day when there was a buy 1 get 1 free sale going on.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product about a month ago because I wanted to try something new as a heat protector.</li>
            <li>This flat iron balm won&#x27;t magically mend your split ends or soften up dry, fried hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often these days, because I&#x27;m wearing my hair in beachy waves, but it worked really well for me a while back.  </li>
            <li>Guardian Angel Flat Iron Balm before straightening and finished it off with a touch of g&amp;ouml;t2b Smooth Operator Smoothing Hairspray before a final run through.</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman and thought maybe this was more for white women.</li>
            <li>After living four years in Colorado  at high altitude I&#x27;ve finally accepted that my hair is now dry and needs a lot more TLC than I was used to giving back when I was living at sea level.</li>
            <li>I use this product twice so far and I am in live with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps healthy hair from being damaged by extreme amounts of heat from flat irons and curling irons.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even feel it really protects it much considering how wet it makes my hair since the product is like water.</li>
            <li>I notice when I don&#x27;t use it my hair is not as soft.</li>
            <li>My 5 yr old daughter even likes to use on her hair just for the smell &amp; softness</li>
            <li>I was expecting soft shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t touch them for 10 minutes so that they can cool down</li>
            <li>YOU HAVE TO LET ANY HEAT PROTECTANT DRY FIRST TO GET ANY PROTECTION.</li>
            <li>Then I spray on Guardian Angel,  flat iron it, and in 5 minutes my hair is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t exactly seem to provide a lot of extra shine, my hair does feel healthier and definitely looks</li>
            <li>doing some more research I have found that alcohol is not good for your hair.</li>
            <li>cause my hair is pretty much wet from the consistensy of the product.</li>
            <li>I then section the hair and spray this heat protectant on the damp hair, brush it though and blow dry my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>course that the real benefits will come later on when my hair does not present a burn aspect because of the flat iron.</li>
            <li>Now I let my hair air dry until it&#x27;s almost dry, then quickly blow it dry</li>
            <li>This product produces the softest yet holds the style for a long time; much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little oily but it does leave hair sleak and straight.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fast shipping smells great</li>
            <li> It reminded me more of spritz.</li>
            <li> I have been using kerastase for more than 3 years.</li>
            <li> This product works better than the store brands I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This flat iron spray works well and smells great!</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your hair soft and shiny with no frizz!!</li>
            <li> I use this every single day, its awesome!!</li>
            <li> and i gotta say im glad i got this for cheap</li>
            <li> this product is getting.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this product isn&#x27;t going to just magically make your hair feel silky and smooth all on</li>
            <li> Got2b Guardian Angel Flat Iron Balm with Gloss Finish is very good.</li>
            <li> But since using this Got2b flat iron balm my hair is in incredible shape.  </li>
            <li> The smell is alright, in my opinion and it isn&#x27;t too strong, either.</li>
            <li> I sprayed my hair pretty close (about 2 inches away) once, and it was kind of sticky when I tried to straighten it</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, I notice my hair turns out smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> And is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It left a great shine and no breakage at all.</li>
            <li> I section the hair again and give it a light coating with this heat protectant again and then use my Chi 1.25&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great deal compared to salon products, so I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s on to straightening, so I reapply a light coat to all of my hair again and straighten away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make hair fizzy and it make your hair so smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of heat protectants and this buy far is the best!</li>
            <li> I always end up with a silky, smooth finish</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the result: shiny, soft - simply beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> She has long beautiful brown hair.</li>
            <li> I use flat iron almost every day and finding a product that will give protection (real protection) to my hair is priceless.</li>
            <li> Very nice, overall.</li>
            <li> I was with a paraben free shampoo/condioner to clean all products out of my hair the day before I color it.  </li>
            <li> I am positive there is something better for my hair out there.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product to keep your hair healthy and shiny, even if you use a flat iron every day.</li>
            <li> It really has been keeping my hair safe from all of the heat</li>
            <li> Any way, I still have a good amount of the product left and will use it up until finished.</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy hair that is super curly if left to it&#x27;s own devices.  </li>
            <li> One of those items that I can&#x27;t go without is a good flat iron heat protecting spray.</li>
            <li> I recently tried Got2B Guardian Angel and am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to laugh at the reviews where people said they began straighting their hair</li>
            <li> I love this, made my hair so soft and straight!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely find hair in the drain or on the floor..  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> hair seems to be much smoother and stays looking good until the next shampoo (for me</li>
            <li> Worth the price on line .</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 11 year old daughter along with a flat iron, her hair smells great and is protected</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I brush the section of hair after I spray it on to make sure all the strands are coated, flat-iron, and then move on to the next section.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I like to use it even if I&#x27;m not straightening my hair just because it takes away the volume so much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaves your hair very shiny!</li>
            <li> It did make my hair shiny, but also made it stick to the hot iron and pulled out hair.</li>
            <li> i like the silky smooth soft look..</li>
            <li> I will give the product 4 stars for now because I used it only once with fabulous results!</li>
            <li> At first, while your hair is still moist from the spray, YES, it&#x27;ll look greasy.</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair looks really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the first heat protection spray I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Tried hot water, even tried hot water with Dawn soap, it streams out instead of a misty spray to evenly coat the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> In the shower I use super hydrating shampoo and conditioner from Biolage, then towel dry it lightly and spray on a spray leave in conditioner which I comb through.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that, while I have used sprays in the past, none of them left my hair feeling this natural!</li>
            <li> it seems to have made my hair more dry instead providing the moisture that I need for pre-heat</li>
            <li> (Although I did try it this way the first few times, and can honestly say there is no difference between how my hair looks at the end.)</li>
            <li> All of this makes my hair feel like pure silk  </li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> (make sure hair is dry before using the iron!).  </li>
            <li> It made my hair easy to flat iron and the whole process was a lot quicker.</li>
            <li> If you have color treated hair, it is extremely important to protect it from all kinds of heat--not only to protect it from breakage, but also to prevent color from seeping out of the hair&#x27;s cuticle.</li>
            <li> I watched a YouTube video featuring this spray and she used way too much product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Makes it really shiny too.</li>
            <li> but it makes my hair feel tacky like i have to much product in my hair..</li>
            <li> This thermal protection spray works really well when I flatiron my hair.  </li>
            <li> It work really well</li>
            <li> I really like how this worked on my hair.</li>
            <li> The whole process took me over 20 minutes and my hair sometimes still felt frizzy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> : oily if you use too much, it sizzles when it passes through the flat-iron, hair is not as shiny as I wanted it to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spray it lightly on my damp hair, paying extra attention to the ends and parts</li>
            <li> My hair is SO soft right now</li>
            <li> and i actually just spray it on after washing my hair and it leaves my hair nice and flat instead of a a poof ball</li>
            <li> Just apply freely on your dry hair and then iron it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little concerned at first as I thought Guardian Angel was a little light weight and wouldn&#x27;t be able to provide much protection.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li> The scent is hard to describe but it&#x27;s really nice--</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard and is a nice addition to add in your hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> , I got this stuff the other day when there was a buy 1 get 1 free sale going on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago because I wanted to try something new as a heat protector.</li>
            <li> This flat iron balm won&#x27;t magically mend your split ends or soften up dry, fried hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often these days, because I&#x27;m wearing my hair in beachy waves, but it worked really well for me a while back.  </li>
            <li> Guardian Angel Flat Iron Balm before straightening and finished it off with a touch of g&amp;ouml;t2b Smooth Operator Smoothing Hairspray before a final run through.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and thought maybe this was more for white women.</li>
            <li> After living four years in Colorado  at high altitude I&#x27;ve finally accepted that my hair is now dry and needs a lot more TLC than I was used to giving back when I was living at sea level.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice so far and I am in live with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps healthy hair from being damaged by extreme amounts of heat from flat irons and curling irons.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even feel it really protects it much considering how wet it makes my hair since the product is like water.</li>
            <li> I notice when I don&#x27;t use it my hair is not as soft.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old daughter even likes to use on her hair just for the smell &amp; softness</li>
            <li> I was expecting soft shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t touch them for 10 minutes so that they can cool down</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE TO LET ANY HEAT PROTECTANT DRY FIRST TO GET ANY PROTECTION.</li>
            <li> Then I spray on Guardian Angel,  flat iron it, and in 5 minutes my hair is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t exactly seem to provide a lot of extra shine, my hair does feel healthier and definitely looks</li>
            <li> doing some more research I have found that alcohol is not good for your hair.</li>
            <li> cause my hair is pretty much wet from the consistensy of the product.</li>
            <li> I then section the hair and spray this heat protectant on the damp hair, brush it though and blow dry my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> course that the real benefits will come later on when my hair does not present a burn aspect because of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Now I let my hair air dry until it&#x27;s almost dry, then quickly blow it dry</li>
            <li> This product produces the softest yet holds the style for a long time; much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oily but it does leave hair sleak and straight.</li>
            <li> I tried lot of hair styling products, numerous different brands to keep my long hair straight, freeze-free and with less damage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since my Junior year in high school, so for about three and a half years now.</li>
            <li> So far there has been no damage I can see, but I am not really willing to risk it.</li>
            <li> I use it before blow drying, flat ironing or curling.</li>
            <li> does help when using the flat iron</li>
            <li> I use this for flat ironing and body waving my hair.</li>
            <li> It works great--protects my hair from flat ironing it</li>
            <li> I got this product not so long ago because i cut my hair short and always need to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> When my emtire head is done being blown out, I then spray this stuff in sections to use my flat iron on.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done flat ironing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair all that often, but when I do I always use this product.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to help with smoothing my hair for the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Also left a strange smell in my hair-that had been washed.</li>
            <li> and I use this to straighten my hair with a flat iron</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve noticed over the past few years a significant decrease in split ends and damaged strands of hair.</li>
            <li> but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron for a few years ago and initially used Pantene&#x27;s Full and Thick (or whatever it&#x27;s called) heat protector.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The directions say to spray on dry hair, one section at a time, before passing over with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> The directions also do not tell you to wait for the product to dry, before using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very noticeable once you&#x27;ve left the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Once you flat iron and give it maybe 10 mins to dry up, your hair will NOT look greasy!</li>
            <li> I said, I have nothing to compare this to, but I will be trying other products shortly.</li>
            <li> Heat damage has caused my hair to look dry and a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I spray this on my hair starting halfway and working down to my ends, then I brush it through also letting it dry.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair every other day</li>
            <li> While it does leave your hair a little filmy-feeling, it protects your hair from the heat well enough.</li>
            <li> I used to blow it dry, trying to straighten it with a round brush, followed by the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading some of the reviews that say this product sizzles and feels like they are straightening wet hair.</li>
            <li> It is not like i expected...</li>
            <li> While out of town, my hair became wet while my family and I were out sightseeing (the weather was damp and rainy).</li>
            <li> Later that night in our hotel room, I washed, conditioned and blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is not long (just above the shoulder, but it is thick, and its slight wave can be sort of stubborn.)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dull and dry, you need a different product.</li>
            <li> Not as expected lots of smoke wirh use, my experience!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s every other day.)</li>
            <li> this stuff is horrible, it don&#x27;t work well at all, your hair is not even left with any kind of shine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little wet, so it takes a few minutes to dry</li>
            <li> I am about 80% gray but color my hair to a dark brown every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Almost reminds me of watered down hairspray?</li>
            <li> my hair is stiff and looks a little dry now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at Walmart because the brand my daughter uses was not in supply (although I never tried hers previously).</li>
            <li> this isnt horrible and it does protect but there are better flat iron heat protectants out there..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other heat protectants before and have not experienced such results.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> So expensive and gives the same results as this Got2b angel flat iron balm.</li>
            <li> my hair shafts look like fluffy fish scales sticking up if  don&#x27;t keep smoothing them down with the iron.  </li>
            <li> DUH you didn&#x27;t let it even dry.</li>
            <li> (that takes just a few minutes since we have so little humidity here.)</li>
            <li> dont get this it a waste of money ..</li>
            <li> but Amazon helped and I ordered few.</li>
            <li> it was sticky and heavy to me.</li>
            <li> Has a strong chemical smell which in the past has left me with a terrible migraine.</li>
            <li> didnt feel any heating protection and if you are not carefull with the amount of product you use, your hair will look stiff.</li>
            <li> feels like I&#x27;m straightening wet hair which is not good for your hair.</li>
            <li> its too thin and wet like water on my hair, not even shiny or like a serum at all.</li>
            <li> , i never more will buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;It´s not god</li>
            <li> this stuff smells :/</li>
            <li> and it sucks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all of the negative comments</li>
            <li> even if i use a very small amout..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused about the reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of my hair being like straw!!&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mom bought me this at CVS after my last heat protection ran out, and this is horrible.</li>
            <li> but it makes my hair feel weird and sticky..</li>
            <li> But I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> could be wrong</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier for color to stick if there isn&#x27;t too much crap on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s sticky, didn&#x27;t hate the product just the design.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product. Not sticky, and not oily.</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my morning hair routine. I notice when I don&#x27;t use it my hair is not as soft. I use it before blow drying, flat ironing or curling. Highly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li> Good product .. smells good amd does help when using the flat iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading some of the reviews that say this product sizzles and feels like they are straightening wet hair. NOTE: YOU HAVE TO LET ANY HEAT PROTECTANT DRY FIRST TO GET ANY PROTECTION. I had to laugh at the reviews where people said they began straighting their hair and it sounded like the straightner was frying their hair. DUH you didn&#x27;t let it even dry. I spray this on my hair starting halfway and working down to my ends, then I brush it through also letting it dry. THEN you can use whatever heated hair styling tool you want. I&#x27;m not going to say this is the best heat protectant but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> The spray smells nice, almost like a perfume but it does not last very long. Adds a nice gloss and shine to my hair, and i needed a good heat protectent and this does the job. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now. A must have. Buy Buy Buy!</li>
            <li> But this is a really lovely spray. Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad. It&#x27;s a little oily but it does leave hair sleak and straight. Very nice, overall. Works as well as Organix but smells lighter, which I like.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews on this product. Has a strong chemical smell which in the past has left me with a terrible migraine. its too thin and wet like water on my hair, not even shiny or like a serum at all. feels like I&#x27;m straightening wet hair which is not good for your hair. doesn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny. and takes forever to straighten it cause my hair is pretty much wet from the consistensy of the product. I don&#x27;t even feel it really protects it much considering how wet it makes my hair since the product is like water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused about the reviews on this product. This was recommended to me and I really like it! It has become one of my hair staples now. If you have color treated hair, it is extremely important to protect it from all kinds of heat--not only to protect it from breakage, but also to prevent color from seeping out of the hair&#x27;s cuticle. I brush the section of hair after I spray it on to make sure all the strands are coated, flat-iron, and then move on to the next section. The scent is hard to describe but it&#x27;s really nice--it smells like some sort of delicious candy. I really love it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your hair soft and shiny with no frizz!! Love it!! Definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for heat protectant!</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother, she says it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I use this for flat ironing and body waving my hair. It stops my hair from being burned by the heat from the appliances. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard and is a nice addition to add in your hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I love this, made my hair so soft and straight!&lt;br /&gt;-mikes wife!!</li>
            <li> It handles my frizzy hair plus protects my hair from the curling iron. Great results for a great price. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product to keep your hair healthy and shiny, even if you use a flat iron every day. Just apply freely on your dry hair and then iron it. Please, keep in mind that this product WILL NOT REPAIR your hair. You need to have nice, healthy hair to start with, and it will keep it that way. If your hair is dull and dry, you need a different product.</li>
            <li> This flat iron spray works well and smells great! I watched a YouTube video featuring this spray and she used way too much product. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this product i bought it at cvs and it sucks. i dont think it protects my hair how it should and does smell good but then it goes way dont get this it a waste of money ..well for me</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Every time I use it, I notice my hair turns out smooth and silky.  On the bottle, it says to spray about 8-10 inches from head so remember to do that. I sprayed my hair pretty close (about 2 inches away) once, and it was kind of sticky when I tried to straighten it (when you hold the bottle father away, the spray spreads more). If you&#x27;re about 10 inches away, it works soooo well!  Well I run out, I am definitely buying this again!</li>
            <li> I tried lot of hair styling products, numerous different brands to keep my long hair straight, freeze-free and with less damage and I must say that this one is my favorite. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore but Amazon helped and I ordered few. Hopefully it won&#x27;t be discontinued any time soon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It doesnt make your hair greasy and it smells great. I use it with my Babyliss straightener and I am happy with it. Just hold a few inches away from your hair when you spray or it will get greasy and coat it too much</li>
            <li> Smells really good. Surely takes away volume and protects hair. Sometimes I like to use it even if I&#x27;m not straightening my hair just because it takes away the volume so much! Makes it really shiny too.</li>
            <li> Got2b Guardian Angel Flat Iron Balm with Gloss Finish is very good. And is fantastic. Loved it! is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I dont like it its like water  i dont feel  deference</li>
            <li> Glad to find this on Amazon as I was suddenly unable to find it locally.  It works great--protects my hair from flat ironing it all the time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine not having this in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair very shiny! It isn&#x27;t exactly the most beautiful fragrance in the world but it&#x27;s not very noticeable once you&#x27;ve left the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me this at CVS after my last heat protection ran out, and this is horrible. It did make my hair shiny, but also made it stick to the hot iron and pulled out hair. I did not like this at all and i&#x27;m going to stay with tresemme.</li>
            <li> I didn´t like it. It is not like i expected...&lt;br /&gt;So, i never more will buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;It´s not god</li>
            <li> i got this for a great deal and i gotta say im glad i got this for cheap cuz this is ok but it makes my hair feel weird and sticky..maybe its just me but it makes my hair feel tacky like i have to much product in my hair..even if i use a very small amout..i like the silky smooth soft look..this isnt horrible and it does protect but there are better flat iron heat protectants out there..i will be using this as a back up..</li>
            <li> This thermal protection spray works really well when I flatiron my hair.  I don&#x27;t use it very often these days, because I&#x27;m wearing my hair in beachy waves, but it worked really well for me a while back.  It&#x27;s a little wet, so it takes a few minutes to dry (make sure hair is dry before using the iron!).  I spray this all over and then do my makeup while it&#x27;s drying.  I&#x27;ve had no breakage or dryness when I&#x27;ve used this spray so it must be working!  I also get no frizz whatsoever, which in Florida, is a really big thing.  My hair stays smooth and silky and looks really nice and shiny.  It smells nice as well.  I think this spray works as well as more expensive formulas I&#x27;ve used.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with a curling iron because I don&#x27;t know if it has something in it that relaxes curls.  But I suppose it&#x27;s worth a try, lol!  I definitely recommend this spray for anyone on a budget who flatirons.  It will leave your hair in a nice condition, with smooth silky locks.</li>
            <li> While it does leave your hair a little filmy-feeling, it protects your hair from the heat well enough. The smell is alright, in my opinion and it isn&#x27;t too strong, either. It&#x27;s pretty reasonably priced as well. While I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there, this is good if you&#x27;re on a budget or just need a backup heat protectant in a hair emergency.</li>
            <li> Good seller an good products.</li>
            <li> I saw this item advertised in a magazine and decided to try it.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  it seems to have made my hair more dry instead providing the moisture that I need for pre-heat</li>
            <li> this stuff is horrible, it don&#x27;t work well at all, your hair is not even left with any kind of shine.  I guess I will stick to using ION products for my hair, they work  the best with heat and they leave a beautiful shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it since my Junior year in high school, so for about three and a half years now. I don&#x27;t get all of the negative comments this product is getting.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this product isn&#x27;t going to just magically make your hair feel silky and smooth all on it&#x27;s own, you need to be taking proper care of your hair before you start using this. This flat iron balm won&#x27;t magically mend your split ends or soften up dry, fried hair. It keeps healthy hair from being damaged by extreme amounts of heat from flat irons and curling irons. It works incredibly well, it makes my hair feel incredibly soft after it&#x27;s straightened and it smells nice. And I&#x27;ve noticed over the past few years a significant decrease in split ends and damaged strands of hair. It really has been keeping my hair safe from all of the heat I expose it to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been able to find it at Walmart, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s in all kinds of beauty/salon stores everywhere you go.</li>
            <li> I will give the product 4 stars for now because I used it only once with fabulous results! While out of town, my hair became wet while my family and I were out sightseeing (the weather was damp and rainy). I purchased this product at Walmart because the brand my daughter uses was not in supply (although I never tried hers previously). Later that night in our hotel room, I washed, conditioned and blow dried my hair. My daughter flat-ironed it using this spray. I was surprised at the result: shiny, soft - simply beautiful hair! I recommendeded the product later that year to my friends to try out. I am African American with a relaxer. I&#x27;ve tried other heat protectants before and have not experienced such results. I&#x27;m not the best at using heat styling tools, so maybe my daughter&#x27;s deft hand helped a bit. Any way, I still have a good amount of the product left and will use it up until finished. I am trying to stay away from heat styling so it may take a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teen daughter. She has long beautiful brown hair. The product seemed to make her hair shine beautifully. She loves the product. I will plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got this product not so long ago because i cut my hair short and always need to straighten my hair. I decided to get a heat protectant spray and stumbled upon this one. It work really well and i actually just spray it on after washing my hair and it leaves my hair nice and flat instead of a a poof ball</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago because I wanted to try something new as a heat protector. I really like how this worked on my hair. It didn&#x27;t have that crunchy feeling after using and it smells yummy! It left a great shine and no breakage at all. Just remember not to over spray. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have long, thick, curly hair and this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I use this every single day, its awesome!! My hair is bleached as well.</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy hair that is super curly if left to it&#x27;s own devices.  I am about 80% gray but color my hair to a dark brown every 3 weeks. In the shower I use super hydrating shampoo and conditioner from Biolage, then towel dry it lightly and spray on a spray leave in conditioner which I comb through.  I then section the hair and spray this heat protectant on the damp hair, brush it though and blow dry my hair straight.  When my emtire head is done being blown out, I then spray this stuff in sections to use my flat iron on.  my hair shafts look like fluffy fish scales sticking up if  don&#x27;t keep smoothing them down with the iron.  When I&#x27;m done flat ironing I section the hair again and give it a light coating with this heat protectant again and then use my Chi 1.25&amp;#34; barrell curling iron to give it big, controlled waves/curls.  I don&#x27;t touch them for 10 minutes so that they can cool down and then I run a glossing serum through the hair.  All of this makes my hair feel like pure silk  no breakage no burning.  And I style DAILY.  Since that is a Lot of product in my hair, I make  sure I was with a paraben free shampoo/condioner to clean all products out of my hair the day before I color it.  It&#x27;s easier for color to stick if there isn&#x27;t too much crap on your hair.  But since using this Got2b flat iron balm my hair is in incredible shape.  I rarely find hair in the drain or on the floor..  I hope they never stop making this product!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 11 year old daughter along with a flat iron, her hair smells great and is protected</li>
            <li> Not as expected lots of smoke wirh use, my experience!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so glad I gave it a try ! Great price smells so YUMMY &amp; it works so great &amp; makes hair feel so soft !! going to buy more . My 5 yr old daughter even likes to use on her hair just for the smell &amp; softness</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all. Staying with all the brand names.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron for a few years ago and initially used Pantene&#x27;s Full and Thick (or whatever it&#x27;s called) heat protector. That stuff SUCKED--it looked like I&#x27;d dunked my strands in baby oil once I was done. So, I gave up on heat protection for the sake of it not looking like I didn&#x27;t know how to take a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got this stuff the other day when there was a buy 1 get 1 free sale going on. I figured what the heck. It&#x27;s FANTASTIC! At first, while your hair is still moist from the spray, YES, it&#x27;ll look greasy. Once you flat iron and give it maybe 10 mins to dry up, your hair will NOT look greasy! It&#x27;ll look like it did when you started--freshly washed--and smell great, and you&#x27;ll have the satisfaction of knowing you used a heat protector. Plus, it works like a spray (My pantene stuff was just a liquid stream, so I&#x27;d wind up with streaks around my head) so you can evenly get all of your hair without applying too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend! Can&#x27;t comment on the Amazon seller here since I bought it in-store.</li>
            <li> lasts forever, nice smell and nothing else. didnt feel any heating protection and if you are not carefull with the amount of product you use, your hair will look stiff.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! Makes my hair soft and healthy looking. Heat damage has caused my hair to look dry and a bit frizzy. After using this, my hair looks really soft and smooth. Healthy.</li>
            <li> After living four years in Colorado  at high altitude I&#x27;ve finally accepted that my hair is now dry and needs a lot more TLC than I was used to giving back when I was living at sea level. One of those items that I can&#x27;t go without is a good flat iron heat protecting spray. I recently tried Got2B Guardian Angel and am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned at first as I thought Guardian Angel was a little light weight and wouldn&#x27;t be able to provide much protection. But I was so wrong. It made my hair easy to flat iron and the whole process was a lot quicker. Although my hair is not long (just above the shoulder, but it is thick, and its slight wave can be sort of stubborn.) I used to blow it dry, trying to straighten it with a round brush, followed by the flat iron. The whole process took me over 20 minutes and my hair sometimes still felt frizzy. Now I let my hair air dry until it&#x27;s almost dry, then quickly blow it dry (that takes just a few minutes since we have so little humidity here.) Then I spray on Guardian Angel,  flat iron it, and in 5 minutes my hair is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems to be much smoother and stays looking good until the next shampoo (for me that&#x27;s every other day.) I like that Guardian Angel doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily or greasy. While it doesn&#x27;t exactly seem to provide a lot of extra shine, my hair does feel healthier and definitely looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best yet, Guardian Angel sells for only around $5 for a 6.8 ounce bottle. I think it&#x27;s a great deal compared to salon products, so I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again. 4 stars</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products! I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair all that often, but when I do I always use this product. It works wonders! My hair always looks so shiny and feels to silky after I straighten with it. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair since I can remember and I have *literally* never had effects this amazing! I used g&amp;ouml;t2b Guardian Angel Flat Iron Balm before straightening and finished it off with a touch of g&amp;ouml;t2b Smooth Operator Smoothing Hairspray before a final run through. My hair is SO soft right now, I have no visible fly aways or frizzies which is extremely uncommon for my untamable hair, and it is SERIOUSLY straight. The best part is that, while I have used sprays in the past, none of them left my hair feeling this natural! I don&#x27;t feel like there is any caked product sitting on top of my head and I can run my hands through my hair without worrying about getting sticky! I love, love, love these products!!</li>
            <li> It left my hair sticky and fried. Did nothing to help with smoothing my hair for the flat iron. Also left a strange smell in my hair-that had been washed. Please note that I don&#x27;t use a cheapy iron. I use either my Chi or GHD.</li>
            <li> Used this with the Revlon Perfect Heat Jumbo 3 Barrel Waver my hair looks so nice it looks very smooth and silky .  I also love the scent smells very good.  Worth the price on line . And I will buy again .</li>
            <li> I have a curly perm and I use this to straighten my hair with a flat iron and it doesnt make my hair any shinier than if I iron my hair withought it. Looking for something that will make my hair look glossy.</li>
            <li> This is the first heat protection spray I&#x27;ve ever used so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;ll let you know how it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: smells amazing, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Cons: oily if you use too much, it sizzles when it passes through the flat-iron, hair is not as shiny as I wanted it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to spray on dry hair, one section at a time, before passing over with the flat iron. Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!!! (Although I did try it this way the first few times, and can honestly say there is no difference between how my hair looks at the end.) I spray it lightly on my damp hair, paying extra attention to the ends and parts I know I will have to go over more than once. Then I blow dry. Then it&#x27;s on to straightening, so I reapply a light coat to all of my hair again and straighten away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I have nothing to compare this to, but I will be trying other products shortly. There has to be something better. I&#x27;m tired of my hair being like straw!!&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;EDIT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After doing some more research I have found that alcohol is not good for your hair. Alcohol is the second ingredient on this heat protectant spray. The directions also do not tell you to wait for the product to dry, before using a flat iron. I am positive there is something better for my hair out there. So far there has been no damage I can see, but I am not really willing to risk it. It&#x27;s a shame, because I love the ay this stuff smells :/</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is so good. It also is a very good heat protection. It doesn&#x27;t make hair fizzy and it make your hair so smooth. Love Love Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of heat protectants and this buy far is the best! I always end up with a silky, smooth finish and I love how shiny it makes my hair☺️</li>
            <li> smells great, but leaves hair sticky</li>
            <li> love it.  My hair does not looked fried when I use this.  Fast shipping smells great I love this hair line all of it is great!!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product at all. I flat iron my hair every other day so I needed something to help protect it. This didn&#x27;t work for me at all. It reminded me more of spritz. it was sticky and heavy to me. the bottle say its leaves hair sleek and with a bit of a shine. my hair is stiff and looks a little dry now. it does smell good though. idk maybe it would work for someone else just not for me. I am an African American woman and thought maybe this was more for white women. could be wrong</li>
            <li> What an amazing product!  This product produces the softest yet holds the style for a long time; much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Nozzle broke only 1/4 through the bottle. Tried hot water, even tried hot water with Dawn soap, it streams out instead of a misty spray to evenly coat the hair. Sticky products and spray nozzles DO NOT go together. Yes, it&#x27;s sticky, didn&#x27;t hate the product just the design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky. Almost reminds me of watered down hairspray? I was expecting soft shiny hair. That didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up washing/drying my hair and using a leave in conditioner. Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice so far and I am in live with it.&lt;br /&gt;Of course that the real benefits will come later on when my hair does not present a burn aspect because of the flat iron. I use flat iron almost every day and finding a product that will give protection (real protection) to my hair is priceless. I have been using kerastase for more than 3 years. So expensive and gives the same results as this Got2b angel flat iron balm. My hair is shinny! very good without doubt!</li>
            <li> This product works better than the store brands I have purchased. The price is unbeatable. I would buy this again.</li>
