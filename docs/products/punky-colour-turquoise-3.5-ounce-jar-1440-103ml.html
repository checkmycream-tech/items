            <li>and I must say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>However, this smells great (like bubblegum!), and has a lot of pigment in it.</li>

            <li>I still liked it but not what I thought it was!</li>
            <li>It is fading very nicely, and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and the color is BOLD!</li>
            <li>My pictures are all over the internet because of how bright these colors were and still are despite that they&#x27;ve faded a tad</li>
            <li>However, the Turquoise does not look good on people with fair skin.</li>
            <li>(I think it smells like grape soda) and felt good on my</li>
            <li>it stay in good condition</li>
            <li>These the colors together are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It is gorgeous, so bright and mermaid-like.</li>
            <li>It did smell good though.</li>
            <li>The smell is probably as good as the color.</li>
            <li>Both are just gorgeous (and I received compliments on them).</li>
            <li>i loved the color</li>
            <li>Great product, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The color is so potent that it came out beautifully anyway without having to literally saturate my stubborn hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still beautiful and sooo many compliments.</li>
            <li>This dye lasts exceptionally long--especially for turquoise!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with the result, love the smell of this product</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use and as everyone says it smells really good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better results from halloween hair spray!</li>
            <li>She has received so many compliments using this product!</li>
            <li>The best thing is that this doesn&#x27;t cost that much either!</li>
            <li>and well I am satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I bought this product on recommendation from a friend and was sooo pleased!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>but i love this one!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair dye!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fry my hair, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>We used rubber gloves for the application and it worked amazingly well, no stained skin.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing vibrancy.</li>
            <li>dye smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not up for that kind of a pain-in-the-butt, then reconsider dying your hair.</li>
            <li>and I ended up with a really nice medium/dark turquoise.</li>
            <li>dye kind of smells like koolaid or those fruit markers we used to get as kids, and didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It started off a lot darker than I thought it would be, but it has faded after about a week to a really nice turquoise.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice.</li>
            <li>so that was nice.</li>
            <li>Plus you can mix to make your own customized color.</li>
            <li>Other than that one of the best products I ever had and smelled awesome :)</li>
            <li>I actually really like the color turn out, and it was very easy to use, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I think this hairdye is one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>This violet is seriously by far the best purple ever!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>This is by far, the best color I have used!</li>
            <li>although I have not dyed my hair yet I am impressed that it came early and it looks just like the picture</li>
            <li>It just gives a blue/green tint to whatever color you have (hers was a very light brown/blonde after bleaching.)</li>
            <li>I am pretty happy for the most part though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price for what you get and it faded to a more tasteful color quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooo much better then manic panic.  </li>
            <li>Also it is more permanent than non.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite brand of hair dye.</li>
            <li>I love this dye.</li>
            <li>After reading such wonderful reviews about this, I thought it would work for sure.</li>
            <li>If it does indeed work better after hours of leaving the product in, then I still fault the company for not stating so.</li>
            <li>love colorbrightness  </li>
            <li>We found the best way to actually combat</li>
            <li>Okay, I know what you&#x27;re thinking.</li>
            <li>It stains, but so do most dyes,</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li>But when I put the violet on top of my bleach, it&#x27;s like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve love this dye a lot.</li>
            <li>but most of the stain still washed off quite well.</li>
            <li>used with a color safe shampoo and colder water</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite hair dye brand too.</li>
            <li>i love this brand</li>
            <li>it is definitely my favorite for semi permanent colors.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I love to use this stuff on me and my friends hair</li>
            <li>100% Gracias - Love this product</li>
            <li>I used so many semi-Blues....</li>
            <li>i love this brand but had never tried this color. . .</li>
            <li>Way better than Ion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be able to do it over with just a brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have a bit more to do one more touch up.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>better love</li>
            <li>love this color line.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>the color was amazing, and I found it to be more true than Manic Panic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>i have used many products to dye my hair before, and this color works wonderfully and stays in for a very long time.</li>
            <li>(a first for bright dyes for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasted WAY longer than Manic Panic, and Punky hair colour is cheap :)  </li>
            <li>It goes on quite easily but be warned, it does stain easily as well.</li>
            <li>We treated my ears and around my face with baby oil and any dye that went astray was easily wiped up.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I did find a product called \\&quot;Zep\\&quot; that will easily remove stains from this product from the sink or tub.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair and the color still comes out bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Fades quickly, very quickly, I&#x27;ve washed my hair three</li>
            <li>and it arrived very quickly</li>
            <li>I also love that this color is very bright and doesn&#x27;t bleed as badly as other dyes tend to do.</li>
            <li>But I tried just dying my hair flamingo pink at one point, and it stayed bright for weeks even though I was shampooing more often than I should and in warm water).</li>
            <li>so I did not have to bleach my hair first, and I just did the underside of my hair, to have some streak effect, so the faded pastel color was nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I loved the color achieved with this hair dye, it was beautiful but it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re willing to deal with all this, then you will have awesome teal blue hair and be the coolest kid/adult/grandma on the block.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine for awhile.</li>
            <li>Used the violet and turquoise and the color and quality is awesome, it&#x27;s been over two weeks and its just now slightly fading.</li>
            <li>Love the color and the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>it turned out BOLD and fabulous!</li>
            <li>Loved the vivid turquoise color immediately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that, this product shipped in two days, and is very pretty. :]</li>
            <li>Still, it was very vibrant the next day and looked wonderful.</li>
            <li>They both have similar features which I think is great for dyes.  </li>
            <li>Once the green washed out, I decided to try Punky Colour, and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>it laststed me or 2 months,it does stain a few things so best to where vasaline</li>
            <li>I cannot rave about how fantastic this dye is.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to bleach my light brown hair.</li>
            <li>Also it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually believe it was the dye smelling that great.</li>
            <li>its so light that I won&#x27;t need the color pulled out</li>
            <li>happy to say I will be using them again!-In red!</li>
            <li>Colors are rich, pure, brilliant and the lasting power is greater than what is described on the label (&amp;#34;semi-permanent; lasts through 8 washes).</li>
            <li>However, it was super easy to apply and a great product overall</li>
            <li>it turned out a very deep vibrant neon blu :D</li>
            <li>Plum is a a true purple kind of color, flamingo pink looks like a bright fuchsia.</li>
            <li>I found it super easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I purchased this great value color along with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue powder lightener packets and Ion developer.</li>
            <li>It was purple, but it turned into a more rusty reddish-pink within the first month of having it.</li>
            <li>(From the reviewer&#x27;s college-student daughter): I put this in my hair a week ago, and it&#x27;s just the most fantastic color, better even than what I got at the professional salon.</li>
            <li>Love the dye, received the item fast!</li>
            <li>Worth the couple dollars!</li>
            <li>the first couple days tho just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>the color faded off significantly on my highlighted streak of hair after prob 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love the pigment, and the way it fades is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair super smooth and luxurious.</li>
            <li>Stains like crazy but smells good and looks awesome.  </li>
            <li>I have a white patch of hair, and I doused it with peroxide for 30 min as suggested, so the dye will be more effective.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and had to bleach it first, and then this color was awesome.</li>
            <li>know that a lot of people say that this kind of dye can stain a lot, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem, just put the right amount(not too much) of product</li>
            <li>It washes out pretty quickly, but it fades nicely so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>If you bleach you hair first the color will come out bright and vivid,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly be doing it much more often.</li>
            <li>Really great product, highly recommend if you want the wow factor and true color.</li>
            <li>Now, I rated this so poorly, not by the quality (Which is pretty nice,)</li>
            <li>The dye has a sweet grape smell to it, which intrigued me because I love candy fruity smells and its really dense compared to manic.</li>
            <li>My hair was an extremely bright shade of blue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a more intense color bleach hair before applying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised at just how much I liked this dye.</li>
            <li>Also, this dye smells really good, so you don&#x27;t have to smell anything really gross while you wait for it to soak in.</li>
            <li>This is esppecciallly true with this stuff.</li>
            <li>And even as it started to fade, it still looked cool.</li>
            <li>You can even mix the colors, and get great results, unlike other kinds of brands.</li>
            <li>Well this is a perfect color but in this picture I mixed it with navy blue.  </li>
            <li>The initial colour is a very beautiful blue colour.</li>
            <li>after a month of washing, it survived and was still super bright.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it had never faded so quickly.</li>
            <li>The color fades in 4-6 shampoos even with this preparation, but it is quick to retouch.  </li>
            <li>love the color in this dye, and if you wash your hair like I did, the dye should last a long time, and when it fades, it looks beautiful and pastel too, if you don&#x27;t mind that sort of thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of the way I wash my hair, the turquoise color lasted a full month dark, and two more months as a nice faded teal.</li>
            <li>I bleached certain sections first in order to remove some remaining purple coloring, and the Jerome Russell Semi Permanent Punky Colour Hair Cream in Turquoise was lovely.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my only downside, I love this color and stays in my hair for a while!</li>
            <li>But so far, I&#x27;m overwhelmed with the dye!:)</li>
            <li>People say it looks cool, which is nice, but honestly I was hoping more for a blue and not so much green.</li>
            <li>color is amazing especially if you want to keep your hair color.</li>
            <li>My hair is a nice seafoam blue (is that a color?</li>
            <li>I have incredibly curly and coarse hair, and prior to using this product, I&#x27;d been using splat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does stain, but it&#x27;s bearable, and definitely worth it, considering the results.</li>
            <li>this is the only hair dye I use, it lasts forever, makes my hair healthy  and has fantastic colors</li>
            <li>--I use a small section of my hair), and it stays beautifully.</li>
            <li>i have the rose red.</li>
            <li>Nice greener toned blue.  </li>
            <li>But overall I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dye, and will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>It smells just like grape soda, which I love, and my hair is always soft and shiny after I use it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last forever, but it lasted longer than I would have liked, which felt like</li>
            <li>It faded nicely, leaving a green tint before I colored over it (purple, these DO blend one on top of the other).&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Jerome Russell creates very vibrant, rich colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it comes right off.</li>
            <li>you do it right away.</li>
            <li>Started out as a very bright blue (thanks to the bleach), but faded into more of a green as time passed.</li>
            <li>Application was very easy and relatively mess-free.</li>
            <li>, the color is beautiful, there&#x27;s a lot in the jar (at least 10 uses for me</li>
            <li>I did bleach it first, but since my hair was dark it didnt turn completely blonde and this product still worked awesome.</li>
            <li>It is very vibrant and the color lasts and lasts and did not fade quickly even though I wash my hair almost every day.</li>
            <li>i would recommend it to anyone who wants to dye their hair at a low cost for something that is very long-lasting and good.</li>
            <li>I am VERY satisfied with plum and flamingo pink.</li>
            <li>First, both dyes are pretty thick which is great when applying and keeping the grounds clean.  </li>
            <li>it was very vibrant!</li>
            <li>Especially anyone wanting a really great turquoise or blue.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, hair dye sticks like superglue on my hair, haha :D&lt;br</li>
            <li>(some dyes smell harshly chemical; JR has a pleasant smell, like a fruity conditioner).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very intense and it comes with plenty of color.</li>
            <li>The item shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>My hair was originally medium brown, then bleached to a light yellowy blonde before using this product.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this brand of hair coloring and most certainly this shade!</li>
            <li>The first hair dye I bought when I first began bleaching my hair and totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The first few washes run, of course, and stained my face but can easily be solved by bending over in the shower and washing your hair away from your face. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>It is definitely a color that looks better on darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>The color smells like bubble gum when applying and for the first couple washes.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t hurt your hair if left in for more time.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>The color is stunning, especially in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>So we went back to get more color</li>

            <li>We died her hair the first part of June and it is STILL in her hair to this day.  </li>
            <li>Plus, when it fades, it&#x27;s not yellow or orange like most colours.</li>
            <li>Just go over it a couple days after the first dye</li>
            <li>I tried bleaching my hair first, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li>well first off you should bleach your hair</li>
            <li>and I am happy with it, plus its one hair dye that actually smells good opposed to an array of suffocating chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first day your hair is dyed</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m definitely buying more and</li>
            <li>need to bleach your hair to almost white, because if you bleach to something more yellowish, it would look green.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The turquoise looked exactly like the picture even without toner.</li>
            <li>I love how it wasn&#x27;t all the same color.</li>
            <li>i got it at hot topic</li>
            <li>an i washed it in hot water with save professionals and it washed out but not alot.</li>
            <li>It has a vivid saturated color - obviously most vivid when the hair has been bleached and the dye has been slept-in.</li>
            <li>The vibrancy is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s been about a month since I first used this hair dye.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t stain skin for more than a day or so, though, especially if you scrub at it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different fading methods</li>
            <li>Just be aware that whenever there is MOISTURE (sweat, shower, swimming, whatever) there will be bleeding.</li>

            <li>I accidentally stained my mom&#x27;s white counter top.</li>
            <li>Take my advice, bleach your hair first.</li>
            <li>So bleach it first.</li>
            <li>I would call this more rockstar electic blue than turquoise</li>
            <li>This product is much better than manic panic and actually smells</li>
            <li>I did lighten my hair first</li>
            <li>I went to the salon to have my hair professionally bleached to as light as my hair would go(can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair or anything to get the exact color out of this hair dye.</li>
            <li>I will definitely try more of these hair dyes.</li>
            <li>This dye lasted for a good few months in my hair.</li>
            <li>this first, it felt better than the rest of my hair that I used regular dye on), and it has stayed in VERY well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried turquoise, green, lagoon, hot pink, purple--all great!</li>
            <li>To make it extra bright, rinse with white vinegar and don&#x27;t condition.</li>
            <li>The color is very vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li>it came fast and works okay, but i thought it would be bigger.</li>
            <li>Been growing out my hair for months, so I figured, &amp;#34;Hey, why not have some fun with it?&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve put a lot of research into hair dye and found that Punky Colour was highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I purchased for my daughter after trying several other products and we were very pleased!</li>
            <li>color fades pretty quickly, which was unexpected.</li>
            <li>The colour stays and fades very gracefully, and is the first product I have used in a while that did not stain my pillowcases.</li>
            <li>I LOVE how long this color lasted.</li>
            <li>I gave it the 5 stars though, because most people are looking for a semi-permanent that lasts a long time and in that regard, I do recommend this.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the colors come out great with both Punky and Arctic Fox and the colors lasts much longer than other brands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells fruity, the color is very vibrant, doesn&#x27;t fade, doesn&#x27;t come off on my pillow case,</li>
            <li>I will say, leave this color on as long as possible for bright result.</li>
            <li>This color can definitely be thinned out with a good deal of white conditioner and still achieve a vibrant shade.</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice and soft too not brittle or dry at all.</li>
            <li>left the dye in my hair for 1 hour, and then washed it out with water, and using conditioner on the dyed area is fine.</li>
            <li>I used Manic Panic&#x27;s Atomic Turquoise, which I love, however it tends to wash out fairly quickly, after the third wash the color has diminished greatly and eventually ends up being a minty green, and when redyed this green tint stays and increases.  </li>
            <li>the product got here FAST and the color is really vibrant!</li>
            <li>Like I said, conditioner is fine, but I would avoid using too much shampoo-just use a little and wash it out quickly for the first couple weeks if you are trying to make the color</li>
            <li>one problem I had with it was it does stain skin very well, and it takes a while to get it</li>
            <li>and figured we didn&#x27;t need a whole kit, so grabbed this one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this color and the company.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look neon, but it&#x27;s very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It does take quite a while to rinse out fully afterward but take the time, with how much I rinsed</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d naturally a light ashy/dirty blonde</li>
            <li>This was a very awsome product.</li>
            <li>Its still a very luminous turquoise color throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>But shampooing dyed hair isn&#x27;t really something you should do unless you&#x27;re trying to wash the color out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>but I did purchase it to be semi-permanent, as advertised because I am very fickle and like to change up my hair a lot.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Works really well and doesnt fade out really fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really bleed onto my pillowcases or anything.</li>
            <li>I found it at home Depot and it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>This one.. not so much.</li>
            <li>if it were the whole thing I think I would cry.</li>
            <li>I love punky color, i have had my hair every shade of the rainbow imaginable and no dye, stays in the hair as long, lasts so long in a bottle and is so cheap.</li>
            <li>but I was really hoping for turquoise.</li>
            <li>with sulfate free products to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>it was also a very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>Individually, Punky Colour offers more selection of colors then Arctic Fox.  </li>
            <li>Some areas where I was naturally having more yellow tones ended up greener and darker hair ended up darker</li>
            <li>It might be a bit more dark blue at first, but it fades beautifully to a true teal/blue greenish color after a couple of washes.</li>
            <li>I bought this with an experimentational mindset (after being disappointed  with the wella products i tried) and i got perfect results, the first time!</li>
            <li>The color is sharp and goes into pretty shades of green as it fades that sometimes looks even better (unlike most dyes.)  </li>
            <li>Secondly, they both have this sweet yummy scent that I really like.  </li>
            <li>Yet, if you want an intense, vibrant and longlasting turquoise dye this is the product to use.</li>
            <li>It was a really deep blue right after I put it in (left it in for about two hours), but after a couple washes it&#x27;s a very nice deep blueish-teal color.</li>
            <li>: in order for this to wash out to a true turquoise color, your hair literally needs to be bleached white.</li>
            <li>IT smells good ,it last  LONGER than manic panic , it does smell sweet, the color is a deep turquoise green indeed, which can be used to achieve a pastel mint if diluted with conditioner for bleached white blonde hair :)</li>
            <li>Before using this product I had never really colored my hair, but because the product was so easy to use</li>
            <li>(this was most likely since my hair wasn&#x27;t bleached white).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still vibrant and I get compliments on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>People will constantly compliment you and think that your are dieing your hair many different colors because everytime you shower</li>
            <li>These colors condition you hair and are so vibrant.</li>
            <li>I received plenty of compliments and re-applied after eight weeks when the color wasn&#x27;t as vibrant as I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am going to try the blue next and bleach my tips to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>I seriously adore this brand out of all I&#x27;ve tried (Manic Panic, Ion, N Rage color, and Raw) and Punky Colour certainly is the best.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dye.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to people.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this dye.</li>
            <li>I went to rinse it off in the shower and had to stay in there for nearly 25 minutes until I decided it just wouldn&#x27;t be very cooperative with me.</li>
            <li>it leans more to green</li>
            <li>Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>This shade was my little sister&#x27;s favorite, so around this time last year (right before halloween), I dyed her hair with streaks of it.</li>
            <li>sure to dry your hair with a specific towel that you don&#x27;t mind dying.</li>
            <li>Well my daughter had just used Splat Blue envy in her hair, which wasn&#x27;t enough by any means to cover her hair, but the color was strong and even stained some of her scalp.</li>
            <li>I get compliments left and right.</li>
            <li>but alike any other product, the intensity depends on how light your hair is to begin with, but i will swear by this product from now on.</li>
            <li>a good blue dye is hard to find</li>
            <li>i bought this punky color turqouise to go over my light magenta hair based on the premise red &amp; blue make purple</li>
            <li>It shows up lighter than expected on top of bleach, so multiple touch ups are needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Faded to a nice green on my hair and parts of my dog&#x27;s, for his white areas</li>
            <li>I liked it but not what I expected the color was not very long lasting</li>
            <li>I honestly believed  it would wash out to a more violet-y purple color within a few weeks according to the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, but I was obviously wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Punky Colour does react differently on all types of hair, yes.</li>
            <li>I left it it for 1hr as one reviewer recommended and it gave me a very dark gorgeous blue color, though it didn&#x27;t come out turquoise for me</li>
            <li>I bleached the underside of my hair (which really didn&#x27;t seem to damage it, imagine that!) and left Punky Colour-</li>
            <li>and its past its 5th wash for sure.</li>
            <li>Only did for the first week.</li>
            <li>The sky blue already faded a bit after the first wash.</li>
            <li>It also looks better against dark hair than blonde</li>
            <li>Before I had a pink streak that quickly turned to orange after every application.</li>
            <li>BUT i have red hair that turned true yellow when bleached</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to try out the other Punky colors as well!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about bleaching my hair myself, but I really wanted the color to stay in since some Punky Colour- Spring Green didn&#x27;t show up much at all in my virgin hair when left for about half an hour.</li>
            <li>The colors are vivid and bright (not sure how long plum will last.</li>
            <li>water always runs clear when I shower my hair, although I noticed that it started running a bit when I once applied shampoo.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way I could if rinsed my hair until it ran clear, so I just did until I thought it was all out.</li>
            <li>It fades very well, I still actually get compliments from strangers after all that time!</li>
            <li>I did have to bleach my hair first because its so dark, but it was worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li>Some of the cheap dyes that are like water, Adore for example, can be messy and will drip everywhere you stand.  </li>
            <li>This does NOT cover completely.</li>
            <li>(blue comes out really fast, after all, no matter what brand of dye!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>A color sealant will help a bit with the staining, but not stop it completely.</li>
            <li>have found that leaving the dye set for 2 hours really makes it pop and last longer.</li>
            <li>That being said I&#x27;m surprised that some people are recommending it as a \\&quot;safe\\&quot; or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; haircolor.</li>
            <li>(as some people on here are suggesting to leave it on for an entire hour), 30 minutes maximum really should be plenty.</li>
            <li>If you want it to fade after a few washes and your hair is light like mine, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>Especially in the sun, when it really shows.</li>
            <li>It smelled like grapes, made my hair soft and silky (even though I bleached the pieces I colored w/</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had it in for almost 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I really like this hairdye, but the blue...</li>
            <li>The dye is not damaging to the hair, and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>I DON;T USE THIS STUFF, BUT MY 16 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES TO EXPERIMENT WITH HAIR COLOR AND STYLE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just put the dye in over my natural hair and let it sit for a few hours or overnight if I can manage it, rinse it out, and I&#x27;m good for a few months until I need to touch it up or do my roots.</li>
            <li>My hair is a light golden brown in the center, and it also looks like puke green.</li>
            <li>You need to be careful of that... be sure to have a towel you aren&#x27;t extremely fond of when you get out.</li>
            <li>I one time mixed bright yellow and blue and it made green!  </li>
            <li>love adding little highlights of color to my hair and this color looks just like the name, the color has lasted me a long time too.</li>
            <li>Still looks vibrant and blue!</li>
            <li>I did not have any staining on my clothes or pillows, although I was worried at first because it kept looking like it was washing out in the shower several times (blue water).</li>
            <li>have medium-dark brown hair, so the color was a very nice subtle green.</li>
            <li>My hair was bleached to a light yellow, so as this washes out it will become more dull and green.</li>
            <li>After a few washes it faded down to a nice turquoise colour.</li>
            <li>A hot pink one (don&#x27;t remember the name)</li>
            <li>Also to keep it this colour, I mixed some of the dye with my normal conditioner and use it everytime I wash my har.</li>
            <li>it is to dye her hair with that other stuff that darkened her hair but didn&#x27;t really put color in it (like Raw&#x27;s red color), and that makes it more &#x27;natural&#x27; color, that her school will accept.</li>
            <li>Also it smells like artificial grapes, so the smell was pleasant</li>
            <li>You really do have to let it wash out completely when you first dye it though, otherwise you can end up having blue run down your face if it rains or blue dye on your pillow case or whatever.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it would be wimpy color, but it is beautiful, much easier to apply, and if I wash my hair every other day lasts several weeks.  </li>
            <li>Even on my 5th wash (with shampoo) the color is strong, i only redye my hair about once to twice a month (if not less), when I used to have to wash it at least once a week, if not twice with manic panic&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It starts as a really pretty teal blue color and fades to a vibrant alpine green on me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick conditioner-like consistency, so it&#x27;s pretty easy to put in your hair without making a mess.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really dyed my hair much, but for the past 6+ months I have had turquoise in my hair.</li>
            <li>I still have bright pink streaks of the flamingo pink AND the teal in my hair, and I have attempted to dye my hair back to my natural blonde TWICE in the past 4 months.</li>
            <li>if you apply it to natural hair it will give you highlights especially visible in the sun.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve only tried Plum, though.</li>
            <li>So I dyed my hair rainbow with Punky Poppy Red, Lagoon Blue, Bright Yellow, and mixed the yellow and blue to make green and yellow and red to make orange</li>
            <li>It has been almost a couple months now, and it still has barely faded.</li>
            <li>The damage comes in when you use bleach first, but if your hair is dark and you want a purer shade of the color, you&#x27;ll have to bleach</li>
            <li>barely tints my bleached hair.</li>
            <li>Also, I only did a few strands, not my whole head, but after retouching mine a few times, dying my boyfriend&#x27;s dreadlock, and letting my friends borrow it, I still have more than 2/3 of the container left!</li>
            <li>I separate the dyed part from the natural part for the first few weeks, so my natural blonde is not stained in the shower, and I wash them separately.</li>
            <li>The allergic reaction could be better or worse for someone else.</li>
            <li>I find that this brand of colors lasts far longer than others I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s been ages since I&#x27;ve touched it up, and my turquoise has faded to a pretty pale turquoise.</li>
            <li>Eventhough it does not contain PPD (a toxic chemical in most commercial haircolors that causes severe allergic reactions), Jerome Russell haircolors are still fully loaded with other heavy chemicals.</li>
            <li>Punky and Arctic Fox colors are stable and does not run or smear as much compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li>I also put a little color in some regular conditioner and use when i wash my hair to keep the color fresh</li>
            <li>so I just don&#x27;t wear light clothes with wet hair for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of fantasy color dyes and absolutely nothing has compared to Jerome russell punky colour.</li>
            <li>The dye comes out of the towel eventually, but just have a towel just for that for the first few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair ended up soft and slightly on the dry side, but not terrible compared to past dyes or bleach</li>
            <li>I have natural dirty blonde hair that I dye VERY light ash blonde.</li>
            <li>One word of caution (which is a good thing and a bad thing)...</li>
            <li>Before, the colors were too dark and barely showed up on my daughter&#x27;s naturally brunette hair.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair turquoise for about six months now, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very awesome.</li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> However, this smells great (like bubblegum!), and has a lot of pigment in it.</li>
            <li> Was sent promptly and well packaged, all around I&#x27;m a very happy colored haired gal!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> oh by golly this is the best hair dye ever!</li>
            <li> this dye is legit perfect.</li>
            <li> but as two days pass it will darken to a perfect turquoise.</li>
            <li> the color is wonderful and stays for a while</li>

            <li> But since I knew that when I bought it, I am VERY happy with this dye.</li>

            <li> It smells great</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really happy with the muted effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dyed a streak in my hair and the tips of my bangs without bleaching it, with great results.</li>

            <li> Out of all the hair dye products ive used this has to be the best and arrived like 1 day after ordering  ima be ordering these from now on im in love guys.</li>
            <li> I still liked it but not what I thought it was!</li>
            <li> It is fading very nicely, and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and the color is BOLD!</li>
            <li> My pictures are all over the internet because of how bright these colors were and still are despite that they&#x27;ve faded a tad</li>
            <li> However, the Turquoise does not look good on people with fair skin.</li>
            <li> (I think it smells like grape soda) and felt good on my</li>
            <li> it stay in good condition</li>
            <li> These the colors together are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It is gorgeous, so bright and mermaid-like.</li>
            <li> It did smell good though.</li>
            <li> The smell is probably as good as the color.</li>
            <li> Both are just gorgeous (and I received compliments on them).</li>
            <li> i loved the color</li>
            <li> Great product, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The color is so potent that it came out beautifully anyway without having to literally saturate my stubborn hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still beautiful and sooo many compliments.</li>
            <li> This dye lasts exceptionally long--especially for turquoise!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really happy with the result, love the smell of this product</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use and as everyone says it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better results from halloween hair spray!</li>
            <li> She has received so many compliments using this product!</li>
            <li> The best thing is that this doesn&#x27;t cost that much either!</li>
            <li> and well I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on recommendation from a friend and was sooo pleased!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> but i love this one!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dye!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fry my hair, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> We used rubber gloves for the application and it worked amazingly well, no stained skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing vibrancy.</li>
            <li> dye smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not up for that kind of a pain-in-the-butt, then reconsider dying your hair.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with a really nice medium/dark turquoise.</li>
            <li> dye kind of smells like koolaid or those fruit markers we used to get as kids, and didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It started off a lot darker than I thought it would be, but it has faded after about a week to a really nice turquoise.</li>
            <li> It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> so that was nice.</li>
            <li> Plus you can mix to make your own customized color.</li>
            <li> Other than that one of the best products I ever had and smelled awesome :)</li>
            <li> I actually really like the color turn out, and it was very easy to use, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I think this hairdye is one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This violet is seriously by far the best purple ever!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best color I have used!</li>
            <li> although I have not dyed my hair yet I am impressed that it came early and it looks just like the picture</li>
            <li> It just gives a blue/green tint to whatever color you have (hers was a very light brown/blonde after bleaching.)</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy for the most part though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for what you get and it faded to a more tasteful color quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooo much better then manic panic.  </li>
            <li> Also it is more permanent than non.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite brand of hair dye.</li>
            <li> I love this dye.</li>
            <li> After reading such wonderful reviews about this, I thought it would work for sure.</li>
            <li> If it does indeed work better after hours of leaving the product in, then I still fault the company for not stating so.</li>
            <li> love colorbrightness  </li>
            <li> We found the best way to actually combat</li>
            <li> Okay, I know what you&#x27;re thinking.</li>
            <li> It stains, but so do most dyes,</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li> But when I put the violet on top of my bleach, it&#x27;s like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve love this dye a lot.</li>
            <li> but most of the stain still washed off quite well.</li>
            <li> used with a color safe shampoo and colder water</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite hair dye brand too.</li>
            <li> i love this brand</li>
            <li> it is definitely my favorite for semi permanent colors.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I love to use this stuff on me and my friends hair</li>
            <li> 100% Gracias - Love this product</li>
            <li> I used so many semi-Blues....</li>
            <li> i love this brand but had never tried this color. . .</li>
            <li> Way better than Ion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be able to do it over with just a brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have a bit more to do one more touch up.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> better love</li>
            <li> love this color line.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> the color was amazing, and I found it to be more true than Manic Panic&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> i have used many products to dye my hair before, and this color works wonderfully and stays in for a very long time.</li>
            <li> (a first for bright dyes for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasted WAY longer than Manic Panic, and Punky hair colour is cheap :)  </li>
            <li> It goes on quite easily but be warned, it does stain easily as well.</li>
            <li> We treated my ears and around my face with baby oil and any dye that went astray was easily wiped up.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I did find a product called \\&quot;Zep\\&quot; that will easily remove stains from this product from the sink or tub.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair and the color still comes out bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Fades quickly, very quickly, I&#x27;ve washed my hair three</li>
            <li> and it arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> I also love that this color is very bright and doesn&#x27;t bleed as badly as other dyes tend to do.</li>
            <li> But I tried just dying my hair flamingo pink at one point, and it stayed bright for weeks even though I was shampooing more often than I should and in warm water).</li>
            <li> so I did not have to bleach my hair first, and I just did the underside of my hair, to have some streak effect, so the faded pastel color was nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I loved the color achieved with this hair dye, it was beautiful but it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re willing to deal with all this, then you will have awesome teal blue hair and be the coolest kid/adult/grandma on the block.</li>
            <li> and you should be fine for awhile.</li>
            <li> Used the violet and turquoise and the color and quality is awesome, it&#x27;s been over two weeks and its just now slightly fading.</li>
            <li> Love the color and the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> it turned out BOLD and fabulous!</li>
            <li> Loved the vivid turquoise color immediately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that, this product shipped in two days, and is very pretty. :]</li>
            <li> Still, it was very vibrant the next day and looked wonderful.</li>
            <li> They both have similar features which I think is great for dyes.  </li>
            <li> Once the green washed out, I decided to try Punky Colour, and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> it laststed me or 2 months,it does stain a few things so best to where vasaline</li>
            <li> I cannot rave about how fantastic this dye is.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to bleach my light brown hair.</li>
            <li> Also it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually believe it was the dye smelling that great.</li>
            <li> its so light that I won&#x27;t need the color pulled out</li>
            <li> happy to say I will be using them again!-In red!</li>
            <li> Colors are rich, pure, brilliant and the lasting power is greater than what is described on the label (&amp;#34;semi-permanent; lasts through 8 washes).</li>
            <li> However, it was super easy to apply and a great product overall</li>
            <li> it turned out a very deep vibrant neon blu :D</li>
            <li> Plum is a a true purple kind of color, flamingo pink looks like a bright fuchsia.</li>
            <li> I found it super easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I purchased this great value color along with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue powder lightener packets and Ion developer.</li>
            <li> It was purple, but it turned into a more rusty reddish-pink within the first month of having it.</li>
            <li> (From the reviewer&#x27;s college-student daughter): I put this in my hair a week ago, and it&#x27;s just the most fantastic color, better even than what I got at the professional salon.</li>
            <li> Love the dye, received the item fast!</li>
            <li> Worth the couple dollars!</li>
            <li> the first couple days tho just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> the color faded off significantly on my highlighted streak of hair after prob 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love the pigment, and the way it fades is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair super smooth and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Stains like crazy but smells good and looks awesome.  </li>
            <li> I have a white patch of hair, and I doused it with peroxide for 30 min as suggested, so the dye will be more effective.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and had to bleach it first, and then this color was awesome.</li>
            <li> know that a lot of people say that this kind of dye can stain a lot, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem, just put the right amount(not too much) of product</li>
            <li> It washes out pretty quickly, but it fades nicely so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> If you bleach you hair first the color will come out bright and vivid,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly be doing it much more often.</li>
            <li> Really great product, highly recommend if you want the wow factor and true color.</li>
            <li> Now, I rated this so poorly, not by the quality (Which is pretty nice,)</li>
            <li> The dye has a sweet grape smell to it, which intrigued me because I love candy fruity smells and its really dense compared to manic.</li>
            <li> My hair was an extremely bright shade of blue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a more intense color bleach hair before applying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised at just how much I liked this dye.</li>
            <li> Also, this dye smells really good, so you don&#x27;t have to smell anything really gross while you wait for it to soak in.</li>
            <li> This is esppecciallly true with this stuff.</li>
            <li> And even as it started to fade, it still looked cool.</li>
            <li> You can even mix the colors, and get great results, unlike other kinds of brands.</li>
            <li> Well this is a perfect color but in this picture I mixed it with navy blue.  </li>
            <li> The initial colour is a very beautiful blue colour.</li>
            <li> after a month of washing, it survived and was still super bright.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it had never faded so quickly.</li>
            <li> The color fades in 4-6 shampoos even with this preparation, but it is quick to retouch.  </li>
            <li> love the color in this dye, and if you wash your hair like I did, the dye should last a long time, and when it fades, it looks beautiful and pastel too, if you don&#x27;t mind that sort of thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of the way I wash my hair, the turquoise color lasted a full month dark, and two more months as a nice faded teal.</li>
            <li> I bleached certain sections first in order to remove some remaining purple coloring, and the Jerome Russell Semi Permanent Punky Colour Hair Cream in Turquoise was lovely.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only downside, I love this color and stays in my hair for a while!</li>
            <li> But so far, I&#x27;m overwhelmed with the dye!:)</li>
            <li> People say it looks cool, which is nice, but honestly I was hoping more for a blue and not so much green.</li>
            <li> color is amazing especially if you want to keep your hair color.</li>
            <li> My hair is a nice seafoam blue (is that a color?</li>
            <li> I have incredibly curly and coarse hair, and prior to using this product, I&#x27;d been using splat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does stain, but it&#x27;s bearable, and definitely worth it, considering the results.</li>
            <li> this is the only hair dye I use, it lasts forever, makes my hair healthy  and has fantastic colors</li>
            <li> --I use a small section of my hair), and it stays beautifully.</li>
            <li> i have the rose red.</li>
            <li> Nice greener toned blue.  </li>
            <li> But overall I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dye, and will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> It smells just like grape soda, which I love, and my hair is always soft and shiny after I use it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last forever, but it lasted longer than I would have liked, which felt like</li>
            <li> It faded nicely, leaving a green tint before I colored over it (purple, these DO blend one on top of the other).&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jerome Russell creates very vibrant, rich colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> you do it right away.</li>
            <li> Started out as a very bright blue (thanks to the bleach), but faded into more of a green as time passed.</li>
            <li> Application was very easy and relatively mess-free.</li>
            <li> , the color is beautiful, there&#x27;s a lot in the jar (at least 10 uses for me</li>
            <li> I did bleach it first, but since my hair was dark it didnt turn completely blonde and this product still worked awesome.</li>
            <li> It is very vibrant and the color lasts and lasts and did not fade quickly even though I wash my hair almost every day.</li>
            <li> i would recommend it to anyone who wants to dye their hair at a low cost for something that is very long-lasting and good.</li>
            <li> I am VERY satisfied with plum and flamingo pink.</li>
            <li> First, both dyes are pretty thick which is great when applying and keeping the grounds clean.  </li>
            <li> it was very vibrant!</li>
            <li> Especially anyone wanting a really great turquoise or blue.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, hair dye sticks like superglue on my hair, haha :D&lt;br</li>
            <li> (some dyes smell harshly chemical; JR has a pleasant smell, like a fruity conditioner).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very intense and it comes with plenty of color.</li>
            <li> The item shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> My hair was originally medium brown, then bleached to a light yellowy blonde before using this product.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this brand of hair coloring and most certainly this shade!</li>
            <li> The first hair dye I bought when I first began bleaching my hair and totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The first few washes run, of course, and stained my face but can easily be solved by bending over in the shower and washing your hair away from your face. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> It is definitely a color that looks better on darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> The color smells like bubble gum when applying and for the first couple washes.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t hurt your hair if left in for more time.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> The color is stunning, especially in the sunlight.</li>
            <li> So we went back to get more color</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re just gonna go back and get more of the splat to finish the job.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> We died her hair the first part of June and it is STILL in her hair to this day.  </li>
            <li> Plus, when it fades, it&#x27;s not yellow or orange like most colours.</li>
            <li> Just go over it a couple days after the first dye</li>
            <li> I tried bleaching my hair first, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help.</li>
            <li> well first off you should bleach your hair</li>
            <li> and I am happy with it, plus its one hair dye that actually smells good opposed to an array of suffocating chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first day your hair is dyed</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m definitely buying more and</li>
            <li> need to bleach your hair to almost white, because if you bleach to something more yellowish, it would look green.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The turquoise looked exactly like the picture even without toner.</li>
            <li> I love how it wasn&#x27;t all the same color.</li>
            <li> i got it at hot topic</li>
            <li> an i washed it in hot water with save professionals and it washed out but not alot.</li>
            <li> It has a vivid saturated color - obviously most vivid when the hair has been bleached and the dye has been slept-in.</li>
            <li> The vibrancy is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s been about a month since I first used this hair dye.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stain skin for more than a day or so, though, especially if you scrub at it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even funny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different fading methods</li>
            <li> Just be aware that whenever there is MOISTURE (sweat, shower, swimming, whatever) there will be bleeding.</li>
            <li> Many compliments on the Lagoon Blue!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;) must try</li>
            <li> I accidentally stained my mom&#x27;s white counter top.</li>
            <li> Take my advice, bleach your hair first.</li>
            <li> So bleach it first.</li>
            <li> I would call this more rockstar electic blue than turquoise</li>
            <li> This product is much better than manic panic and actually smells</li>
            <li> I did lighten my hair first</li>
            <li> I went to the salon to have my hair professionally bleached to as light as my hair would go(can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair or anything to get the exact color out of this hair dye.</li>
            <li> I will definitely try more of these hair dyes.</li>
            <li> This dye lasted for a good few months in my hair.</li>
            <li> this first, it felt better than the rest of my hair that I used regular dye on), and it has stayed in VERY well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried turquoise, green, lagoon, hot pink, purple--all great!</li>
            <li> To make it extra bright, rinse with white vinegar and don&#x27;t condition.</li>
            <li> The color is very vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li> it came fast and works okay, but i thought it would be bigger.</li>
            <li> Been growing out my hair for months, so I figured, &amp;#34;Hey, why not have some fun with it?&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve put a lot of research into hair dye and found that Punky Colour was highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my daughter after trying several other products and we were very pleased!</li>
            <li> color fades pretty quickly, which was unexpected.</li>
            <li> The colour stays and fades very gracefully, and is the first product I have used in a while that did not stain my pillowcases.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how long this color lasted.</li>
            <li> I gave it the 5 stars though, because most people are looking for a semi-permanent that lasts a long time and in that regard, I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the colors come out great with both Punky and Arctic Fox and the colors lasts much longer than other brands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells fruity, the color is very vibrant, doesn&#x27;t fade, doesn&#x27;t come off on my pillow case,</li>
            <li> I will say, leave this color on as long as possible for bright result.</li>
            <li> This color can definitely be thinned out with a good deal of white conditioner and still achieve a vibrant shade.</li>
            <li> My hair feels nice and soft too not brittle or dry at all.</li>
            <li> left the dye in my hair for 1 hour, and then washed it out with water, and using conditioner on the dyed area is fine.</li>
            <li> I used Manic Panic&#x27;s Atomic Turquoise, which I love, however it tends to wash out fairly quickly, after the third wash the color has diminished greatly and eventually ends up being a minty green, and when redyed this green tint stays and increases.  </li>
            <li> the product got here FAST and the color is really vibrant!</li>
            <li> Like I said, conditioner is fine, but I would avoid using too much shampoo-just use a little and wash it out quickly for the first couple weeks if you are trying to make the color</li>
            <li> one problem I had with it was it does stain skin very well, and it takes a while to get it</li>
            <li> and figured we didn&#x27;t need a whole kit, so grabbed this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this color and the company.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look neon, but it&#x27;s very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It does take quite a while to rinse out fully afterward but take the time, with how much I rinsed</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d naturally a light ashy/dirty blonde</li>
            <li> This was a very awsome product.</li>
            <li> Its still a very luminous turquoise color throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> But shampooing dyed hair isn&#x27;t really something you should do unless you&#x27;re trying to wash the color out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> but I did purchase it to be semi-permanent, as advertised because I am very fickle and like to change up my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Works really well and doesnt fade out really fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really bleed onto my pillowcases or anything.</li>
            <li> I found it at home Depot and it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> This one.. not so much.</li>
            <li> if it were the whole thing I think I would cry.</li>
            <li> I love punky color, i have had my hair every shade of the rainbow imaginable and no dye, stays in the hair as long, lasts so long in a bottle and is so cheap.</li>
            <li> but I was really hoping for turquoise.</li>
            <li> with sulfate free products to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> it was also a very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Individually, Punky Colour offers more selection of colors then Arctic Fox.  </li>
            <li> Some areas where I was naturally having more yellow tones ended up greener and darker hair ended up darker</li>
            <li> It might be a bit more dark blue at first, but it fades beautifully to a true teal/blue greenish color after a couple of washes.</li>
            <li> I bought this with an experimentational mindset (after being disappointed  with the wella products i tried) and i got perfect results, the first time!</li>
            <li> The color is sharp and goes into pretty shades of green as it fades that sometimes looks even better (unlike most dyes.)  </li>
            <li> Secondly, they both have this sweet yummy scent that I really like.  </li>
            <li> Yet, if you want an intense, vibrant and longlasting turquoise dye this is the product to use.</li>
            <li> It was a really deep blue right after I put it in (left it in for about two hours), but after a couple washes it&#x27;s a very nice deep blueish-teal color.</li>
            <li> : in order for this to wash out to a true turquoise color, your hair literally needs to be bleached white.</li>
            <li> IT smells good ,it last  LONGER than manic panic , it does smell sweet, the color is a deep turquoise green indeed, which can be used to achieve a pastel mint if diluted with conditioner for bleached white blonde hair :)</li>
            <li> Before using this product I had never really colored my hair, but because the product was so easy to use</li>
            <li> (this was most likely since my hair wasn&#x27;t bleached white).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still vibrant and I get compliments on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> People will constantly compliment you and think that your are dieing your hair many different colors because everytime you shower</li>
            <li> These colors condition you hair and are so vibrant.</li>
            <li> I received plenty of compliments and re-applied after eight weeks when the color wasn&#x27;t as vibrant as I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am going to try the blue next and bleach my tips to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> I seriously adore this brand out of all I&#x27;ve tried (Manic Panic, Ion, N Rage color, and Raw) and Punky Colour certainly is the best.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dye.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to people.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this dye.</li>
            <li> I went to rinse it off in the shower and had to stay in there for nearly 25 minutes until I decided it just wouldn&#x27;t be very cooperative with me.</li>
            <li> it leans more to green</li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> This shade was my little sister&#x27;s favorite, so around this time last year (right before halloween), I dyed her hair with streaks of it.</li>
            <li> sure to dry your hair with a specific towel that you don&#x27;t mind dying.</li>
            <li> Well my daughter had just used Splat Blue envy in her hair, which wasn&#x27;t enough by any means to cover her hair, but the color was strong and even stained some of her scalp.</li>
            <li> I get compliments left and right.</li>
            <li> but alike any other product, the intensity depends on how light your hair is to begin with, but i will swear by this product from now on.</li>
            <li> a good blue dye is hard to find</li>
            <li> i bought this punky color turqouise to go over my light magenta hair based on the premise red &amp; blue make purple</li>
            <li> It shows up lighter than expected on top of bleach, so multiple touch ups are needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Faded to a nice green on my hair and parts of my dog&#x27;s, for his white areas</li>
            <li> I liked it but not what I expected the color was not very long lasting</li>
            <li> I honestly believed  it would wash out to a more violet-y purple color within a few weeks according to the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, but I was obviously wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Punky Colour does react differently on all types of hair, yes.</li>
            <li> I left it it for 1hr as one reviewer recommended and it gave me a very dark gorgeous blue color, though it didn&#x27;t come out turquoise for me</li>
            <li> I bleached the underside of my hair (which really didn&#x27;t seem to damage it, imagine that!) and left Punky Colour-</li>
            <li> and its past its 5th wash for sure.</li>
            <li> Only did for the first week.</li>
            <li> The sky blue already faded a bit after the first wash.</li>
            <li> It also looks better against dark hair than blonde</li>
            <li> Before I had a pink streak that quickly turned to orange after every application.</li>
            <li> BUT i have red hair that turned true yellow when bleached</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to try out the other Punky colors as well!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about bleaching my hair myself, but I really wanted the color to stay in since some Punky Colour- Spring Green didn&#x27;t show up much at all in my virgin hair when left for about half an hour.</li>
            <li> The colors are vivid and bright (not sure how long plum will last.</li>
            <li> water always runs clear when I shower my hair, although I noticed that it started running a bit when I once applied shampoo.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way I could if rinsed my hair until it ran clear, so I just did until I thought it was all out.</li>
            <li> It fades very well, I still actually get compliments from strangers after all that time!</li>
            <li> I did have to bleach my hair first because its so dark, but it was worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li> Some of the cheap dyes that are like water, Adore for example, can be messy and will drip everywhere you stand.  </li>
            <li> This does NOT cover completely.</li>
            <li> (blue comes out really fast, after all, no matter what brand of dye!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> A color sealant will help a bit with the staining, but not stop it completely.</li>
            <li> have found that leaving the dye set for 2 hours really makes it pop and last longer.</li>
            <li> That being said I&#x27;m surprised that some people are recommending it as a \\&quot;safe\\&quot; or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; haircolor.</li>
            <li> (as some people on here are suggesting to leave it on for an entire hour), 30 minutes maximum really should be plenty.</li>
            <li> If you want it to fade after a few washes and your hair is light like mine, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Especially in the sun, when it really shows.</li>
            <li> It smelled like grapes, made my hair soft and silky (even though I bleached the pieces I colored w/</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had it in for almost 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I really like this hairdye, but the blue...</li>
            <li> The dye is not damaging to the hair, and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> I DON;T USE THIS STUFF, BUT MY 16 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES TO EXPERIMENT WITH HAIR COLOR AND STYLE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just put the dye in over my natural hair and let it sit for a few hours or overnight if I can manage it, rinse it out, and I&#x27;m good for a few months until I need to touch it up or do my roots.</li>
            <li> My hair is a light golden brown in the center, and it also looks like puke green.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful of that... be sure to have a towel you aren&#x27;t extremely fond of when you get out.</li>
            <li> I one time mixed bright yellow and blue and it made green!  </li>
            <li> love adding little highlights of color to my hair and this color looks just like the name, the color has lasted me a long time too.</li>
            <li> Still looks vibrant and blue!</li>
            <li> I did not have any staining on my clothes or pillows, although I was worried at first because it kept looking like it was washing out in the shower several times (blue water).</li>
            <li> have medium-dark brown hair, so the color was a very nice subtle green.</li>
            <li> My hair was bleached to a light yellow, so as this washes out it will become more dull and green.</li>
            <li> After a few washes it faded down to a nice turquoise colour.</li>
            <li> A hot pink one (don&#x27;t remember the name)</li>
            <li> Also to keep it this colour, I mixed some of the dye with my normal conditioner and use it everytime I wash my har.</li>
            <li> it is to dye her hair with that other stuff that darkened her hair but didn&#x27;t really put color in it (like Raw&#x27;s red color), and that makes it more &#x27;natural&#x27; color, that her school will accept.</li>
            <li> Also it smells like artificial grapes, so the smell was pleasant</li>
            <li> You really do have to let it wash out completely when you first dye it though, otherwise you can end up having blue run down your face if it rains or blue dye on your pillow case or whatever.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be wimpy color, but it is beautiful, much easier to apply, and if I wash my hair every other day lasts several weeks.  </li>
            <li> Even on my 5th wash (with shampoo) the color is strong, i only redye my hair about once to twice a month (if not less), when I used to have to wash it at least once a week, if not twice with manic panic&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It starts as a really pretty teal blue color and fades to a vibrant alpine green on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick conditioner-like consistency, so it&#x27;s pretty easy to put in your hair without making a mess.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really dyed my hair much, but for the past 6+ months I have had turquoise in my hair.</li>
            <li> I still have bright pink streaks of the flamingo pink AND the teal in my hair, and I have attempted to dye my hair back to my natural blonde TWICE in the past 4 months.</li>
            <li> if you apply it to natural hair it will give you highlights especially visible in the sun.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only tried Plum, though.</li>
            <li> So I dyed my hair rainbow with Punky Poppy Red, Lagoon Blue, Bright Yellow, and mixed the yellow and blue to make green and yellow and red to make orange</li>
            <li> It has been almost a couple months now, and it still has barely faded.</li>
            <li> The damage comes in when you use bleach first, but if your hair is dark and you want a purer shade of the color, you&#x27;ll have to bleach</li>
            <li> barely tints my bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I only did a few strands, not my whole head, but after retouching mine a few times, dying my boyfriend&#x27;s dreadlock, and letting my friends borrow it, I still have more than 2/3 of the container left!</li>
            <li> I separate the dyed part from the natural part for the first few weeks, so my natural blonde is not stained in the shower, and I wash them separately.</li>
            <li> The allergic reaction could be better or worse for someone else.</li>
            <li> I find that this brand of colors lasts far longer than others I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s been ages since I&#x27;ve touched it up, and my turquoise has faded to a pretty pale turquoise.</li>
            <li> Eventhough it does not contain PPD (a toxic chemical in most commercial haircolors that causes severe allergic reactions), Jerome Russell haircolors are still fully loaded with other heavy chemicals.</li>
            <li> Punky and Arctic Fox colors are stable and does not run or smear as much compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> I also put a little color in some regular conditioner and use when i wash my hair to keep the color fresh</li>
            <li> so I just don&#x27;t wear light clothes with wet hair for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of fantasy color dyes and absolutely nothing has compared to Jerome russell punky colour.</li>
            <li> The dye comes out of the towel eventually, but just have a towel just for that for the first few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair ended up soft and slightly on the dry side, but not terrible compared to past dyes or bleach</li>
            <li> I have natural dirty blonde hair that I dye VERY light ash blonde.</li>
            <li> One word of caution (which is a good thing and a bad thing)...</li>
            <li> Before, the colors were too dark and barely showed up on my daughter&#x27;s naturally brunette hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair just sucks it right up.</li>
            <li> For the first 3 weeks at least, any time I got even a tiny bit sweaty/wet/moist, I turned turquoise!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had blue dye last so long in my hair, it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s long lasting, and as it fades it gives the look of different shades of the color making it even prettier!</li>
            <li> Lightning Orange Blast Super Strength cleaner helps get it off surfaces, but be prepared to make everything you touch green for a few days after.</li>
            <li> Everyone asks me if I&#x27;m ready for Christmas because my turquoise turned out green!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to how long it lasts as I&#x27;ve done a lot of research into maintenance and have been washing my hair only 2-3 a week, and when I condition, using conditioner with hair dye in it.</li>
            <li> and it is lasting a long time</li>
            <li> no matter how long I left it in.</li>
            <li> It wast close to a turquoise colour, but I think that&#x27;s because I left it in so long.</li>
            <li> because I like it to last a long time (3-4 months).</li>
            <li> na last long.</li>
            <li> long lasting too!</li>
            <li> , kinda disappointed read good reviews about it</li>
            <li> I mean its pretty, but I don&#x27;t think it is gon</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used other dyes before from Hot Topic (Raw and Manic Panic) and Jean&#x27;s Colour from Amazon, but then we gave this a shot.  </li>
            <li> When I wash my hair, for the first few weeks, I use as LITTLE shampoo on the dyed area as possible, and only wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> i also barely had to use any of the product, so this little bottle with last me forever.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on the color, it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> when I learn how long it stays in my hair until I have to retouch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> will definitely by Jerome Russel&#x27;s Flamingo Pink.</li>
            <li> No matter how long you have had it dyed for,</li>
            <li> lasts so long.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just hope it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> Basically, as long as I want my hair to be this color, I&#x27;ll keep buying this dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> so I wanted purple, pink, and blue streaks in my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased Plum, Flamingo Pink, and Lagoon Blue.</li>
            <li> Color moves a bit when wet at first..but only moves after that when washed with shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first blue I&#x27;ve tired</li>
            <li> Not only is it long-lasting (I recolor once every 6 weeks, and only because it&#x27;s a little faded), but I get complimented on the vibrancy of my little peekaboos that I colored near my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using either a black or white solid colored pillow case (black, so it doesn&#x27;t show, or white, so you can bleach it).</li>
            <li> When I applied the dye I led it on for about 45 minutes, but definitely could of left it on for less.</li>
            <li> So the other colors may react differently on my hair, I&#x27;ve got some Flamingo Pink and Atlantic Blue to try out also.</li>
            <li> This color last&#x27;s a LONG TIME compared to manic panic and other dyes!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I use atlantic blue and voilet to due my hair.</li>
            <li> It is similar in color a little bluer than the directions turquoise but it is cheaper and is bigger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on the product and will never go back to any other.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair coarse feeling like some of the other dye&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The color turns out very bright and doesn&#x27;t stain too bad where I accidentally get in on my skin, like behind my ears.</li>
            <li> Also be very carefully, it will dye everything it touches blue!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair once every three days (I use dry shampoo in between washes, specifically \\&quot;Stila hair refresher\\&quot;), but I can see myself needing to retouch the color every 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> Just blow dry your hair and it won&#x27;t get on anything.</li>
            <li> It only cause a small, barely noticeable rash.</li>
            <li> I died my hair blue LAST SUMMER, (almost 8 months ago) and there&#x27;s still green in my hair.</li>
            <li> The atlantic blue looks dark.</li>
            <li> I have dark, reddish-brown hair, and I tried Manic Panic before, and it only seemed to dye my hair this nasty-looking greenish color</li>
            <li> And its lasted long than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so dark or if this particular color just works well.</li>
            <li> Not vibrant at all.</li>
            <li> and it turned my hair jet blue black</li>
            <li> The actual purple color in this brand shows up with a slight pinkish tint.</li>
            <li> If you buy this product (pre-bleached or not), just a few tips, don&#x27;t use conditioner or hot water, and leave in the color for at least an hour..  </li>
            <li> And typically, if you let it sit for an hour, it&#x27;ll last a week.</li>
            <li> but the product stays in the hair for a long time and your not stressed after two or three washes due to loss of color.  </li>
            <li> I bleached it to a very pale yellow, almost white.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s only because of roots and a little lightening of the color at the ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months since I last applied to my bleached hair.</li>
            <li> bought it roughly a month ago, and used it the day I got it.</li>
            <li> Color washed out within a week and left daughters hair green ;(</li>
            <li> it took really no experience to use.. just apply where you want it and let it set for about a 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> , haven&#x27;t even seen a hint of it turning pink yet</li>
            <li> The turquoise fades to green on my strawberry blonde hair.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s wet, it will get on your shirt.</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s not much at this point</li>
            <li> wet cause</li>
            <li> You MUST be careful when applying because it will stain your skin and sink/tub</li>
            <li> Actually, I had to get the color pulled out by a salonist and sitting in the chair for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because it only lasted for 4 washes, it started to look green instead of turquoise.</li>
            <li> Also it looks slightly green in some parts of my hair (and that DEFINITELY wasn&#x27;t what I was aiming for).</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s a little expensive, but overall worth the price compared to all the other dye products I&#x27;ve read about.</li>
            <li> I can see that if one&#x27;s hair is as close to white as possible, then less reapplications of dye would be needed (in order to not have green - yuck!).</li>
            <li> I will say, other colors I&#x27;ve tried did terrible and some did great.</li>
            <li> I have long black hair and wanted to add some color to the ends for the spring.</li>
            <li> and I only wash my hair in cold water, but it doesn&#x27;t fade very fast</li>
            <li> this dye does NOT stain tubs/sinks, just clean it with cold water.</li>
            <li> After about a week and a half, it stops getting all over the towel when you dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I always love the results and it always stays so well in my hair, even though I don&#x27;t usually wash it in cold water.</li>
            <li> If you rinse the dye out completely, it won&#x27;t stain, but I&#x27;m lazy and impatient</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even need to be that often, it could seriously go 3-4 months depending on how frequently you shower.</li>
            <li> my hair, I have coarse, curly, thick, medium long hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what or if the other colors are scented, but the turquoise smelled like blueberries to me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> and I ended up with a lot of highlights and lowlights due to it.</li>
            <li> At a shop I worked at, girls would come up to me, having used other brands and ask me what I used.</li>
            <li> and when I washed out each section I dipped it in vinegar to stop the colors from blending into each other and to prolong the color.</li>
            <li> *  of us know, when dying your hair a weird color to lighten it first.</li>
            <li> Lasts very long as well!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good but can get a little overpowering and sickening after a while..</li>
            <li> Lagoon Blue (i think thats what it&#x27;s called) didn&#x27;t show up hardly at all.</li>
            <li> : If you have very thick or long hair, buy two jars and if you have any left over, you can keep it for touch-ups!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to keep the bathroom clean.  </li>
            <li> Not working for my dark hair...</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t buy it if you have dark hair</li>
            <li> Well at least with spray and wash.&lt;br /&gt;Atlantic blue-</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s the dark purple you expect when you hear the word purple.</li>
            <li> If you have dark colored hair you have to bleach it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other colors!</li>
            <li> The jars are small, so if you have very long hair</li>
            <li> The bottom of my hair, which was a dark brown lightened to a.. slightly lighter brown.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 is because it is VERY messy!</li>
            <li> jar says to leave it in for half an hour, but I would suggest longer.</li>
            <li> I typically let my hair dye sit for way longer than suggested (8 hours or so)</li>
            <li> do it myself since I have jet black hair and don&#x27;t need it falling out).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way around the mess with this one.</li>
            <li> My hair is REALLY thick and long, and although I don&#x27;t have all of it dyed (just the ends, about 7-8 inches of ombre)</li>
            <li> It lasts FOREVER, which is gonna be a problem once you want to dye your hair a different color because it&#x27;s really hard to get it out of your hair (and sink for that matter!).</li>
            <li> My other turquoises I have used in the past in my hair have faded out or looked almost &#x27;brassy&#x27; in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using turquoise for months now and it works so well for a semi permanent dye that costs so little.</li>
            <li> But hell hath no fury like a little bit of sweat.</li>
            <li> It looked like little purple freckles in clusters on my neck, and because I dyed the underside of my bangs, it was also on my eye lids.</li>
            <li> I did leave the dye in for two hours a little longer than the recommended time.</li>
            <li> approximately a year and a half ago, I bought six different colors of this brand, to dye my hair rainbow.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a very dark brown, and I before using this product</li>
            <li> It looks like her hair turned green from swimming in chlorine.</li>
            <li> But by the fact that it is loaded with chemicals (HARSH chemicals)</li>
            <li> 4 star is just because it is so incredibly messy.</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting this color out.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s green.</li>
            <li> The bottom of my hair looks like puke green.</li>
            <li> but it is a puke green and</li>
            <li> I still have these green streaks on towels from when I colored it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind having green hair</li>
            <li> After awhile it turns green.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wash my hair but a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I dropped some on my shirt and put some tide liquid in it before it dried</li>
            <li> Like all Punky Colours this was extremely vibrant and lasts weeks when hair is washed in cold water.</li>
            <li> Always wash hair in cold water to keep color vibrant.</li>
            <li> I hardly used half the container.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because, Arctic Fox feels unbelievably silky after a wash and uses vegan ingredients.</li>
            <li> its really small.</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached and it will usually stay about 3-4 weeks in the summer when I&#x27;m swimming (I don&#x27;t use anything to protect it while swimming)</li>
            <li> I usually have to re-dye my hair every 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> Very messy application if you aren&#x27;t equip with a in-home salon.  </li>
            <li> Item was very messy and stained.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hardly faded.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t show up hardly at all</li>
            <li> It took only one jar but it was cutting it close</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been growing my roots out though, so I&#x27;ve gone over 4 months without a touch-up before.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell like icky hair dye, smells like yummy berries</li>
            <li> The color was so subtle it never showed up in pictures, the vampire of hair colors.</li>
            <li> IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> NOT true if you use Punky Colour!!!</li>
            <li> : flamingo pink does bleed like crazy whenever you shampoo your hair.</li>
            <li> my blouse or shirt gets blue at the contact with my hair, yes,predictable but really annoying :/</li>
            <li> disappointed next time i will use manic panic</li>
            <li> I am a tad disappointed with the lagoon blue though.</li>
            <li> It wears off very slowly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that this is a bad product, because it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still there which can be frustrating.</li>
            <li> The only annoying thing is that I cannot leave my hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is insane, I freaking LOVEEE it, it gives vibrant color</li>
            <li> It seems to be going away now, after 2 days, so I am really not that disappointed.</li>
            <li> The worst when it comes to lasting power is Manic Panic.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> sadly they dont have it anymore</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, 1 in 10 people have an allergic skin reaction to this product, and I was one of those unlucky people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sorry because i didn&#x27;t rate u before, is just my order was delayed in my country.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this brand and dye my hair crazy colors... until I have to get a job this summer,</li>
            <li> Stains from this dye are almost impossible to get out.</li>
            <li> So frustrated that this didnt work.  </li>
            <li> so I wont have to bleach the crap out of my hair, but this is just NOT coming out ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The color is sharp and goes into pretty shades of green as it fades that sometimes looks even better (unlike most dyes.)  Punky is the only brand I use now.  It&#x27;s sooo much better then manic panic.  You really do have to let it wash out completely when you first dye it though, otherwise you can end up having blue run down your face if it rains or blue dye on your pillow case or whatever.</li>
            <li> Been growing out my hair for months, so I figured, &amp;#34;Hey, why not have some fun with it?&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve put a lot of research into hair dye and found that Punky Colour was highly recommended. Loved the vivid turquoise color immediately. I can&#x27;t attest to how long it lasts as I&#x27;ve done a lot of research into maintenance and have been washing my hair only 2-3 a week, and when I condition, using conditioner with hair dye in it. BUT that&#x27;s something you should be doing anyway, and the color has lasted! Have bought this dye twice, will be buying it again soon.</li>
            <li> Works well but with darker hair you must dye it multiple times. Also it is more permanent than non. I dyed a piece of my hair in January and here it is in June and it&#x27;s still visible.</li>
            <li> Not working for my dark hair... So don&#x27;t buy it if you have dark hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this great value color along with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue powder lightener packets and Ion developer. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about bleaching my hair myself, but I really wanted the color to stay in since some Punky Colour- Spring Green didn&#x27;t show up much at all in my virgin hair when left for about half an hour. I bleached the underside of my hair (which really didn&#x27;t seem to damage it, imagine that!) and left Punky Colour- Turquoise on for an hour. I went to rinse it off in the shower and had to stay in there for nearly 25 minutes until I decided it just wouldn&#x27;t be very cooperative with me. You need to be careful of that... be sure to have a towel you aren&#x27;t extremely fond of when you get out. Still, it was very vibrant the next day and looked wonderful. I hear that it will stay in for a while. I&#x27;ll have to come back to edit this when I learn how long it stays in my hair until I have to retouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* It&#x27;s been a few months since I last applied to my bleached hair. It fades very well, I still actually get compliments from strangers after all that time! My hair is a nice seafoam blue (is that a color? I Googled it, anyway).</li>
            <li> Before using this product I had never really colored my hair, but because the product was so easy to use I&#x27;ll certainly be doing it much more often. I did have to bleach my hair first because its so dark, but it was worth the extra effort.</li>
            <li> There are two brands I recommend when it comes to Semi Permanent hair dyes, Punky Colour and Arctic Fox.  They both have similar features which I think is great for dyes.  First, both dyes are pretty thick which is great when applying and keeping the grounds clean.  They do not drip when keeping it on for over 40 min.  Some of the cheap dyes that are like water, Adore for example, can be messy and will drip everywhere you stand.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to keep the bathroom clean.  Secondly, they both have this sweet yummy scent that I really like.  Lastly, the colors come out great with both Punky and Arctic Fox and the colors lasts much longer than other brands.  The worst when it comes to lasting power is Manic Panic.  Punky and Arctic Fox colors are stable and does not run or smear as much compared to other brands.  Individually, Punky Colour offers more selection of colors then Arctic Fox.  The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because, Arctic Fox feels unbelievably silky after a wash and uses vegan ingredients.</li>
            <li> Like all Punky Colours this was extremely vibrant and lasts weeks when hair is washed in cold water. However, the Turquoise does not look good on people with fair skin. It is definitely a color that looks better on darker skin tones. It also looks better against dark hair than blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a more intense color bleach hair before applying. The color smells like bubble gum when applying and for the first couple washes. Always wash hair in cold water to keep color vibrant. Also, this color is more difficult to bleach out than others.</li>
            <li> I think this hairdye is one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far. It lasts FOREVER, which is gonna be a problem once you want to dye your hair a different color because it&#x27;s really hard to get it out of your hair (and sink for that matter!). This is why I&#x27;ve given it 4 stars as I like to change the color of my hair a lot. Yet, if you want an intense, vibrant and longlasting turquoise dye this is the product to use. It might be a bit more dark blue at first, but it fades beautifully to a true teal/blue greenish color after a couple of washes. I&#x27;m really excited to try out the other Punky colors as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair turquoise for about six months now, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I used Manic Panic dye in Atomic Turquoise, which is not a product I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;This product, however, is great!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it roughly a month ago, and used it the day I got it. Application was very easy and relatively mess-free. It smelled very nice (I think it smells like grape soda) and felt good on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The jar says to leave it in for half an hour, but I would suggest longer. It won&#x27;t hurt your hair if left in for more time.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of it comes out when washing hair, and mine continued to come out for several washes without losing any of the color.&lt;br /&gt;The one problem I had with it was it does stain skin very well, and it takes a while to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, no complaints. I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly curly and coarse hair, and prior to using this product, I&#x27;d been using splat. My hair was damaged and the color faded. It was purple, but it turned into a more rusty reddish-pink within the first month of having it. I couldn&#x27;t get it out, even with Color Oops. I had to bleach it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dye is quite the opposite. The color is stunning, especially in the sunlight. It&#x27;s been over a month now and it&#x27;s hardly faded. It didn&#x27;t fry my hair, and it smells amazing. My hair is REALLY thick and long, and although I don&#x27;t have all of it dyed (just the ends, about 7-8 inches of ombre) i was worried there wouldn&#x27;t be enough dye for me to cover it all. I was wrong. I hardly used half the container. The color is so potent that it came out beautifully anyway without having to literally saturate my stubborn hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does stain, but it&#x27;s bearable, and definitely worth it, considering the results. This is definitely my favorite brand of hair dye.</li>
            <li> Very messy application if you aren&#x27;t equip with a in-home salon.  Color washed out within a week and left daughters hair green ;(</li>
            <li> I love this dye. The color turns out very bright and doesn&#x27;t stain too bad where I accidentally get in on my skin, like behind my ears. I don&#x27;t know what or if the other colors are scented, but the turquoise smelled like blueberries to me. Very awesome.</li>
            <li> After reading such wonderful reviews about this, I thought it would work for sure. Well my daughter had just used Splat Blue envy in her hair, which wasn&#x27;t enough by any means to cover her hair, but the color was strong and even stained some of her scalp. So we went back to get more color and figured we didn&#x27;t need a whole kit, so grabbed this one. Her hair had already been bleached, and colored blue. So you&#x27;d think this woulda just helped intensify the blue. It turned out a washed out teal color. Not vibrant at all. It literally feels like finger paints and has the same consistency. It looks like her hair turned green from swimming in chlorine. We&#x27;re just gonna go back and get more of the splat to finish the job. So frustrated that this didnt work.  BTW she left it on for about 40 min (on already blueish hair!) which is longer than they recommend. If it does indeed work better after hours of leaving the product in, then I still fault the company for not stating so. This does NOT cover completely. It just gives a blue/green tint to whatever color you have (hers was a very light brown/blonde after bleaching.) I&#x27;ve seen better results from halloween hair spray! IT IS NOT DYE! IT DOES NOT COVER!</li>
            <li> love colorbrightness  it stay in good condition i still have the color on my hair and people ask me if i just got done even tho i have it on a month ago ☺</li>
            <li> I had never used Jerome before...and I must say I&#x27;m impressed. My other turquoises I have used in the past in my hair have faded out or looked almost &#x27;brassy&#x27; in my hair. However, this smells great (like bubblegum!), and has a lot of pigment in it. Would definitely recommend! Was sent promptly and well packaged, all around I&#x27;m a very happy colored haired gal! May even post pics soon! ;)</li>
            <li> (From the reviewer&#x27;s college-student daughter): I put this in my hair a week ago, and it&#x27;s just the most fantastic color, better even than what I got at the professional salon. It was a really deep blue right after I put it in (left it in for about two hours), but after a couple washes it&#x27;s a very nice deep blueish-teal color. I wash my hair once every three days (I use dry shampoo in between washes, specifically \\&quot;Stila hair refresher\\&quot;), but I can see myself needing to retouch the color every 2-3 weeks (blue comes out really fast, after all, no matter what brand of dye!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: in order for this to wash out to a true turquoise color, your hair literally needs to be bleached white. My hair was bleached to a light yellow, so as this washes out it will become more dull and green. I can see that if one&#x27;s hair is as close to white as possible, then less reapplications of dye would be needed (in order to not have green - yuck!). For me it&#x27;s a little expensive, but overall worth the price compared to all the other dye products I&#x27;ve read about. I will continue to buy this brand and dye my hair crazy colors... until I have to get a job this summer, anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware: having blue hair will stain everything blue, ALL THE TIME! If you&#x27;re not up for that kind of a pain-in-the-butt, then reconsider dying your hair. Plan for darker-shaded clothing and covering pillows and couches with towels you don&#x27;t care about, and buying a ton of Comet cleaner with bleach for the shower. A color sealant will help a bit with the staining, but not stop it completely. As for staining on the skin (back of neck, hands, etc) use a soap with exfoliating beads/crystals or something, since that stuff isn&#x27;t coming off with just regular soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re willing to deal with all this, then you will have awesome teal blue hair and be the coolest kid/adult/grandma on the block. People will stare at you, but that&#x27;s just because they&#x27;re jealous ;)  Or right-wing tight-ass conservative Bible-thumpers, but who ever cares what they think?s conservative Bible-thumpers, but who ever cares what they think?</li>
            <li> this is the only hair dye I use, it lasts forever, makes my hair healthy  and has fantastic colors</li>
            <li> Well this is a perfect color but in this picture I mixed it with navy blue.  but yeah that&#x27;s what it looks like.</li>
            <li> i bought this punky color turqouise to go over my light magenta hair based on the premise red &amp; blue make purple well i only left it on for 30 min tops no heat and it turned my hair jet blue black disappointed next time i will use manic panic</li>
            <li> I bought this with an experimentational mindset (after being disappointed  with the wella products i tried) and i got perfect results, the first time! it took really no experience to use.. just apply where you want it and let it set for about a 1/2 hour. it isn&#x27;t permanent, but its about a month later and i still have color!! (a bit lighter, but still there!) i also barely had to use any of the product, so this little bottle with last me forever. awesome!! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this color and the company. Not only is it long-lasting (I recolor once every 6 weeks, and only because it&#x27;s a little faded), but I get complimented on the vibrancy of my little peekaboos that I colored near my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this over Manic Panic! any day. It smells great, the color is beautiful, there&#x27;s a lot in the jar (at least 10 uses for me--I use a small section of my hair), and it stays beautifully. I would definitely recommend using either a black or white solid colored pillow case (black, so it doesn&#x27;t show, or white, so you can bleach it). It will ruin towels and clothing as well, but that&#x27;s on you, not the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars because it was above and beyond what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to dye her hair, and I will only allow temporary dye without bleaching.  We&#x27;ve used other dyes before from Hot Topic (Raw and Manic Panic) and Jean&#x27;s Colour from Amazon, but then we gave this a shot.  Before, the colors were too dark and barely showed up on my daughter&#x27;s naturally brunette hair.  Everyone told her she had to bleach her hair to get the color to show.  NOT true if you use Punky Colour!!! She has received so many compliments using this product! Her hair is truly bluish-green, and boy does it pop! It doesn&#x27;t look neon, but it&#x27;s very noticeable.  One word of caution (which is a good thing and a bad thing)...it LASTS a looonnnnngggg time.  We died her hair the first part of June and it is STILL in her hair to this day.  The color has to be out before school starts up again, so this can be a problem.  We found the best way to actually combat it is to dye her hair with that other stuff that darkened her hair but didn&#x27;t really put color in it (like Raw&#x27;s red color), and that makes it more &#x27;natural&#x27; color, that her school will accept.</li>
            <li> I had my hair entirely purple and changed to turquoise after a bunch of people at work copied the purple. This colour lasts forever! Two months after initially dying it, I still had colour in and that was with me actually trying to get rid of it. Plus, when it fades, it&#x27;s not yellow or orange like most colours. It turns greenish then white. The initial colour is a very beautiful blue colour. The best thing is that this doesn&#x27;t cost that much either! I actually recommend this brand to everyone. Especially anyone wanting a really great turquoise or blue.</li>
            <li> Okay, I know what you&#x27;re thinking. Now, I rated this so poorly, not by the quality (Which is pretty nice,) But by the fact that it is loaded with chemicals (HARSH chemicals) And also is TESTED ON ANIMALS! I will never buy this product ever again.</li>
            <li> good stuff, looks great.  only problem is that it stains the shower blue when you wash your hair. extra scrubbing, or washing hair in the laundry sink for a number of shampooings….</li>
            <li> it came fast and works okay, but i thought it would be bigger. its really small. its just a bit bigger then a dixie cup.</li>
            <li> While the yellow lasted, the lagoon blue washed out in one shampoo.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really dyed my hair much, but for the past 6+ months I have had turquoise in my hair. I used Manic Panic&#x27;s Atomic Turquoise, which I love, however it tends to wash out fairly quickly, after the third wash the color has diminished greatly and eventually ends up being a minty green, and when redyed this green tint stays and increases.  After I ran out I turned to Jerome Russel&#x27;s Punky Colour, after removing the dye, and re-dyed it with this Turquoise the color was amazing, and I found it to be more true than Manic Panic&#x27;s. The dye has a sweet grape smell to it, which intrigued me because I love candy fruity smells and its really dense compared to manic. It stains, but so do most dyes, when I wash my hair it bleeds alot but the color LASTS! Even on my 5th wash (with shampoo) the color is strong, i only redye my hair about once to twice a month (if not less), when I used to have to wash it at least once a week, if not twice with manic panic&#x27;s.  Great product! Can&#x27;t wait to try more. I&#x27;ve used the purple one as well and it is lasting a long time, haven&#x27;t even seen a hint of it turning pink yet and its past its 5th wash for sure. Next color to try out will definitely by Jerome Russel&#x27;s Flamingo Pink.</li>
            <li> I use atlantic blue and voilet to due my hair. I used to use turquoise. The turquoise fades to green on my strawberry blonde hair. The atlantic blue looks dark. Now after I bleached it, they look totally different. These dyes will bleed every time you take a shower. No matter how long you have had it dyed for, if it&#x27;s wet, it will get on your shirt. Just blow dry your hair and it won&#x27;t get on anything. After about a week and a half, it stops getting all over the towel when you dry your hair. Stains from this dye are almost impossible to get out. Well at least with spray and wash.&lt;br /&gt;Atlantic blue- you might need to touch this up alot! I dye it and after a couple days I already see patches of my bleach showing thru. This one fades faster than the voilet. Just go over it a couple days after the first dye and you should be fine for awhile. It shows up lighter than expected on top of bleach, so multiple touch ups are needed.&lt;br /&gt;Violet- oh by golly this is the best hair dye ever! A little goes a long way too! I can get a small blob on my finger and it will cover so much! I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so dark or if this particular color just works well. But when I put the violet on top of my bleach, it&#x27;s like my hair just sucks it right up. The purple lasts forever!!! I didnt have to touch up for 2 months. This violet is seriously by far the best purple ever! And it&#x27;s the dark purple you expect when you hear the word purple. The actual purple color in this brand shows up with a slight pinkish tint. So violet all the way!&lt;br /&gt;I have found that leaving the dye set for 2 hours really makes it pop and last longer. Rinse out with cold water, then warm water, then shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The 4 star is just because it is so incredibly messy. There&#x27;s no way around the mess with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using turquoise for months now and it works so well for a semi permanent dye that costs so little. My hair is bleached and it will usually stay about 3-4 weeks in the summer when I&#x27;m swimming (I don&#x27;t use anything to protect it while swimming) and if I remember correctly it has lasted around 6 weeks in the winter or when I don&#x27;t swim. I&#x27;ve love this dye a lot. I will say, other colors I&#x27;ve tried did terrible and some did great. Lagoon Blue (i think thats what it&#x27;s called) didn&#x27;t show up hardly at all. A hot pink one (don&#x27;t remember the name) I tried lasted almost 2 months. I&#x27;ve noticed colors on the pastel side don&#x27;t show up hardly at all but the brighter the color, the longer they stay.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife who wanted her entire head turquoise, here is her review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at just how much I liked this dye. It goes on quite easily but be warned, it does stain easily as well. We used rubber gloves for the application and it worked amazingly well, no stained skin. We treated my ears and around my face with baby oil and any dye that went astray was easily wiped up. I would suggest also doing the back of the neck, I&#x27;d forgotten to but most of the stain still washed off quite well. I sat with the dye for 30 min after it was applied (though with all of my hair it did take a while to apply it all) and I ended up with a really nice medium/dark turquoise. It does take quite a while to rinse out fully afterward but take the time, with how much I rinsed I didn&#x27;t end up with any stain on clothing or sheets afterward (a first for bright dyes for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my hair, I have coarse, curly, thick, medium long hair. It took only one jar but it was cutting it close and we had a backup jar in case. I shampooed my hair thoroughly beforehand and didn&#x27;t condition which I believe helps with the dye taking. My hair had not been bleached beforehand and I&#x27;d naturally a light ashy/dirty blonde and I ended up with a lot of highlights and lowlights due to it. Some areas where I was naturally having more yellow tones ended up greener and darker hair ended up darker but I&#x27;m really happy with the muted effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair ended up soft and slightly on the dry side, but not terrible compared to past dyes or bleach treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye kind of smells like koolaid or those fruit markers we used to get as kids, and didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used with a color safe shampoo and colder water it&#x27;s lasting quite well. Just need to avoid pools so that the color doesn&#x27;t warp in chlorine.</li>
            <li> IT smells good ,it last  LONGER than manic panic , it does smell sweet, the color is a deep turquoise green indeed, which can be used to achieve a pastel mint if diluted with conditioner for bleached white blonde hair :)</li>
            <li> The colour stays and fades very gracefully, and is the first product I have used in a while that did not stain my pillowcases.</li>
            <li> I have dark, reddish-brown hair, and I tried Manic Panic before, and it only seemed to dye my hair this nasty-looking greenish color no matter how long I left it in. I tried bleaching my hair first, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help. The dye just rinsed out immediately. Once the green washed out, I decided to try Punky Colour, and it worked wonderfully. I dyed a streak in my hair and the tips of my bangs without bleaching it, with great results. It started off a lot darker than I thought it would be, but it has faded after about a week to a really nice turquoise. Also, this dye smells really good, so you don&#x27;t have to smell anything really gross while you wait for it to soak in.</li>
            <li> well first off you should bleach your hair it wont work on darker hair. i bleached mine almost white and put it on for 2 hours and was blinded it turned out a very deep vibrant neon blu :D it laststed me or 2 months,it does stain a few things so best to where vasaline so you dont stain your face. i will so be buying this again</li>
            <li> My hair was originally medium brown, then bleached to a light yellowy blonde before using this product. I left it it for 1hr as one reviewer recommended and it gave me a very dark gorgeous blue color, though it didn&#x27;t come out turquoise for me (this was most likely since my hair wasn&#x27;t bleached white). Also I dyed it about 3 1/2 weeks ago, since then it has lighted to a deep teal color but even as this color It&#x27;s still vibrant and I get compliments on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first blue I&#x27;ve tired and I am happy with it, plus its one hair dye that actually smells good opposed to an array of suffocating chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is I still have blue runoff in the shower/tub. Obviously it&#x27;s not much at this point but it&#x27;s still there which can be frustrating. Also be very carefully, it will dye everything it touches blue!</li>
            <li> If you bleach you hair first the color will come out bright and vivid, if you apply it to natural hair it will give you highlights especially visible in the sun. It does wash out gradually over the course of about a month. That being said I&#x27;m surprised that some people are recommending it as a \\&quot;safe\\&quot; or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; haircolor. Eventhough it does not contain PPD (a toxic chemical in most commercial haircolors that causes severe allergic reactions), Jerome Russell haircolors are still fully loaded with other heavy chemicals. The point is I would never recommend for anyone to leave this on their head for any longer than 30 minutes (as some people on here are suggesting to leave it on for an entire hour), 30 minutes maximum really should be plenty.</li>
            <li> This was a very awsome product. It lasted WAY longer than Manic Panic, and Punky hair colour is cheap :)  If you buy this product (pre-bleached or not), just a few tips, don&#x27;t use conditioner or hot water, and leave in the color for at least an hour..  It&#x27;s very intense and it comes with plenty of color. You can even mix the colors, and get great results, unlike other kinds of brands. I one time mixed bright yellow and blue and it made green!  Always go for J.Russell..</li>
            <li> Smells good but can get a little overpowering and sickening after a while.. That&#x27;s my only downside, I love this color and stays in my hair for a while! Definitely my favorite hair dye brand too.</li>
            <li> this dye is legit perfect. it smells like grape soda and it does not bleed at all. the first day your hair is dyed it leans more to green but as two days pass it will darken to a perfect turquoise. this dye does NOT stain tubs/sinks, just clean it with cold water. i&#x27;m definitely buying more and so should you (:</li>
            <li> Great great product. If you properly lift your hair before applying it lasts!!! Seriously, I only have to re-process every 2-3 months and that&#x27;s only because of roots and a little lightening of the color at the ends. Its still a very luminous turquoise color throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> I did some lights on my hair with this product and I&#x27;m really happy with the result, love the smell of this product, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are dying your hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;You need to bleach your hair to almost white, because if you bleach to something more yellowish, it would look green.&lt;br /&gt;I know that a lot of people say that this kind of dye can stain a lot, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem, just put the right amount(not too much) of product and you won&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> The Plum color is simply amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I dyed my hair with Plum over a month ago, and heck, I swear it hasn&#x27;t faded the slightest.I honestly believed  it would wash out to a more violet-y purple color within a few weeks according to the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, but I was obviously wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Punky Colour does react differently on all types of hair, yes. Luckily for me, hair dye sticks like superglue on my hair, haha :D&lt;br /&gt;The water always runs clear when I shower my hair, although I noticed that it started running a bit when I once applied shampoo. But shampooing dyed hair isn&#x27;t really something you should do unless you&#x27;re trying to wash the color out.&lt;br /&gt;The dye has never stained my neck. At all. I managed to stain my skin a bit when I was applicating the dye, but I simply scrubbed the color off my skin with some soap, and it was gone! In addition, I swim at my local pool once every second week, and the color never bleeds:)&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only tried Plum, though. So the other colors may react differently on my hair, I&#x27;ve got some Flamingo Pink and Atlantic Blue to try out also. But so far, I&#x27;m overwhelmed with the dye!:)</li>
            <li> I recently switched to Punky after using Manic Panic for years. I LOVE how long this color lasted. I usually have to re-dye my hair every 2-3 weeks but my Punky color lasted over a month. I also love that this color is very bright and doesn&#x27;t bleed as badly as other dyes tend to do. The turquoise looked exactly like the picture even without toner.</li>
            <li> This dye lasts exceptionally long--especially for turquoise!&lt;br /&gt;Even after a month of washing, it survived and was still super bright.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had blue dye last so long in my hair, it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again... by the gallon! Haha</li>
            <li> lasts so long. People will constantly compliment you and think that your are dieing your hair many different colors because everytime you shower it fades a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dont lay ur head on anythign white!  will stane! lol</li>
            <li> I cannot rave about how fantastic this dye is. I didn&#x27;t even have to bleach my light brown hair. It dyed it blue and green strands (the color was turquoise), looking very mermaid-like. I love how it wasn&#x27;t all the same color. Also it smells fantastic. I didn&#x27;t actually believe it was the dye smelling that great. I highly recommend this dye. I can&#x27;t wait to try other colors!</li>
            <li> I loved the color achieved with this hair dye, it was beautiful but it didn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I love the pigment, and the way it fades is pretty cool.  But hell hath no fury like a little bit of sweat.</li>
            <li> Really nice color, very good dye. i love this brand it is definitely my favorite for semi permanent colors. The color is very vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li> I have natural dirty blonde hair that I dye VERY light ash blonde. It is 2 steps below Marilyn Monroe blonde, so maybe this is why, but I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff out of my hair! lol Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t mind but I did purchase it to be semi-permanent, as advertised because I am very fickle and like to change up my hair a lot. I gave it the 5 stars though, because most people are looking for a semi-permanent that lasts a long time and in that regard, I do recommend this. If you want it to fade after a few washes and your hair is light like mine, this isn&#x27;t for you. At a shop I worked at, girls would come up to me, having used other brands and ask me what I used. This one girl had grayish blue streaks and the dye she used was advertised as semi-permanent turquoise but faded to that color after one wash. I recommended this company to her.</li>
            <li> Love the dye, received the item fast!</li>
            <li> The first hair dye I bought when I first began bleaching my hair and totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The first few washes run, of course, and stained my face but can easily be solved by bending over in the shower and washing your hair away from your face. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this item again - it&#x27;s gorgeous!</li>
            <li> i luv punky color i have the rose red. i put it in the frist time and it semlled like bubble gum!!!   i got it at hot topic sadly they dont have it anymore the color is wonderful and stays for a while like i got it to stay for a month almost 2! i let it stay in for like an hour before i washed it out an i washed it in hot water with save professionals and it washed out but not alot. to get the color off ur skin us blackhead whips or rubbing achol and it comes right off. it will stain your skin if u dont et it off u will be the color of ur hair if i dont remove it XD</li>
            <li> Out of all the hair dye products ive used this has to be the best and arrived like 1 day after ordering  ima be ordering these from now on im in love guys.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on it all the time. Now to fill the required word limit with extra nonsense. (wink wink)</li>
            <li> Best semi permanent hair color for me!!! It lasts a lot!</li>
            <li> 10/10, would recommend. Love I adore Punky Colour. It has a vivid saturated color - obviously most vivid when the hair has been bleached and the dye has been slept-in. I find that this brand of colors lasts far longer than others I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s been ages since I&#x27;ve touched it up, and my turquoise has faded to a pretty pale turquoise. Also, I only did a few strands, not my whole head, but after retouching mine a few times, dying my boyfriend&#x27;s dreadlock, and letting my friends borrow it, I still have more than 2/3 of the container left!</li>
            <li> I wanted this as an alternative to directions turquoise and well I am satisfied! It is similar in color a little bluer than the directions turquoise but it is cheaper and is bigger. Let&#x27;s just hope it lasts as long. I had one jar of directions turquoise, which I bought i december and finished yesterday.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about 15 years, I&#x27;ve had it every color of the rainbow and have used  almost every product out there.&lt;br /&gt;It smells fruity, the color is very vibrant, doesn&#x27;t fade, doesn&#x27;t come off on my pillow case, and of course the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to people. And I have!</li>
            <li> I used this to dip dye my hair, about 4-5 inches. I did bleach it first, but since my hair was dark it didnt turn completely blonde and this product still worked awesome. It is very vibrant and the color lasts and lasts and did not fade quickly even though I wash my hair almost every day. In fact, when I wanted to re-dye my hair I had trouble getting this color out. It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> These colors condition you hair and are so vibrant. I love to use this stuff on me and my friends hair and it lasts forever. You will get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of fantasy color dyes and absolutely nothing has compared to Jerome russell punky colour. I&#x27;m hooked on the product and will never go back to any other. The vibrancy is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. And its lasted long than I expected. Just have to touch up my roots which is simple. I&#x27;m currently using \\&quot;turquoise\\&quot;, \\&quot;plum\\&quot;, and \\&quot;flamingo pink\\&quot;. These the colors together are gorgeous. I get compliments left and right. And of course I always recommend jerome russell to everyone.</li>
            <li> The item shipped very fast. Item was very messy and stained. Gave me a very bright turquoise which I loved. But the turquoise still runs out of your hair for about a week and it ran in to my blonde hair and messed it up so be carefull. Other than that one of the best products I ever had and smelled awesome :)</li>
            <li> Ame este producto, el olor es lo que mas me gusto, el color es simplemente perfecto lo recomiendo 100% Gracias - Love this product, the smell is what I liked, the color is just perfect I recommend 100% Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this, I loved the color and it has an awesome smell! It lasts around 5 washes getting greenish in time. The only annoying thing is that I cannot leave my hair wet cause my blouse or shirt gets blue at the contact with my hair, yes,predictable but really annoying :/</li>
            <li> I used so many semi-Blues.... and i prefur this one of all :D Lasts very long as well!!! AND SMELLS LIKE CANDY KOOL-AID :D LOVED it!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice greener toned blue.  It stains EVERYTHING though.  This color can definitely be thinned out with a good deal of white conditioner and still achieve a vibrant shade.</li>
            <li> i have used many products to dye my hair before, and this color works wonderfully and stays in for a very long time. i would recommend it to anyone who wants to dye their hair at a low cost for something that is very long-lasting and good. definitely try out this product-- it works wonderfully. but alike any other product, the intensity depends on how light your hair is to begin with, but i will swear by this product from now on.</li>
            <li> I used this product on the bleached underside of my hair. It is gorgeous, so bright and mermaid-like. I&#x27;ve received multiple compliments. The color does run and bleed when washed for a week or so after coloring, but stops after that. It was easy to apply. The jars are small, so if you have very long hair (mine is 26 inches, I only colored the underside and one jar was just barely enough), buy 2 or 3.</li>
            <li> Works really well and doesnt fade out really fast. It&#x27;s been three weeks since I&#x27;ve used it and it still hasn&#x27;t faded at all. Would definetly use this brand again.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s been about a month since I first used this hair dye. I recieved it before the ETD so that was nice. My hair is naturally a very dark brown, and I before using this product I bleached it to a very pale yellow, almost white. When I applied the dye I led it on for about 45 minutes, but definitely could of left it on for less. There&#x27;s no way I could if rinsed my hair until it ran clear, so I just did until I thought it was all out. My hair was an extremely bright shade of blue. It wast close to a turquoise colour, but I think that&#x27;s because I left it in so long. After a few washes it faded down to a nice turquoise colour. It is fading very nicely, and I&#x27;m very pleased. Also to keep it this colour, I mixed some of the dye with my normal conditioner and use it everytime I wash my har. It doesn&#x27;t really bleed onto my pillowcases or anything. Only did for the first week. But overall I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dye, and will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> i love this brand but had never tried this color. . . it  comes out great. . . takes forever to fade or wash out of your hair. . .i think everyone should use this brand when buying colored hair dye like this. . .</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing vibrancy. Easy to apply. Consistency is perfect. Leaves hair super smooth and luxurious. Way better than Ion. Lasts longer than Manic Panic. I only use Jerome Russell and Pravana.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dye on my hair consistently for the past two years or so. I always love the results and it always stays so well in my hair, even though I don&#x27;t usually wash it in cold water. I don&#x27;t have to lighten my medium-dark ash brown hair for it to show up. I&#x27;ll just put the dye in over my natural hair and let it sit for a few hours or overnight if I can manage it, rinse it out, and I&#x27;m good for a few months until I need to touch it up or do my roots. Lately I&#x27;ve been growing my roots out though, so I&#x27;ve gone over 4 months without a touch-up before. It starts as a really pretty teal blue color and fades to a vibrant alpine green on me. I get so many compliments on the color, it&#x27;s crazy. Especially in the sun, when it really shows. I&#x27;ve gotten comments saying that I had mermaid hair, etc. If you rinse the dye out completely, it won&#x27;t stain, but I&#x27;m lazy and impatient so I just don&#x27;t wear light clothes with wet hair for a few weeks. It smells just like grape soda, which I love, and my hair is always soft and shiny after I use it. It&#x27;s a thick conditioner-like consistency, so it&#x27;s pretty easy to put in your hair without making a mess. Won&#x27;t stain skin for more than a day or so, though, especially if you scrub at it. Basically, as long as I want my hair to be this color, I&#x27;ll keep buying this dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: If you have very thick or long hair, buy two jars and if you have any left over, you can keep it for touch-ups!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I purchased for my daughter after trying several other products and we were very pleased! You MUST be careful when applying because it will stain your skin and sink/tub but the product stays in the hair for a long time and your not stressed after two or three washes due to loss of color.  I did find a product called \\&quot;Zep\\&quot; that will easily remove stains from this product from the sink or tub.  I found it at home Depot and it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I typically let my hair dye sit for way longer than suggested (8 hours or so) because I like it to last a long time (3-4 months). And typically, if you let it sit for an hour, it&#x27;ll last a week. I let this sit for about two hours and it&#x27;s lasted me almost two months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I should also note that I&#x27;m naturally blonde and did not have to bleach my hair before dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerome Russell creates very vibrant, rich colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I approve.</li>
            <li> Stains like crazy but smells good and looks awesome.  To make it extra bright, rinse with white vinegar and don&#x27;t condition.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair and the color still comes out bright and vibrant. It washes out pretty quickly, but it fades nicely so it&#x27;s okay. Love the color and the product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> So I dyed my hair rainbow with Punky Poppy Red, Lagoon Blue, Bright Yellow, and mixed the yellow and blue to make green and yellow and red to make orange [the purple was a different brand].&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 4 months and it&#x27;s still practically perfect. My pictures are all over the internet because of how bright these colors were and still are despite that they&#x27;ve faded a tad bit.&lt;br /&gt;The dye smells AMAZING. My hair smelled like grape juice for like a week after dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments it&#x27;s not even funny anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is amazing especially if you want to keep your hair color. If you want to change it in a couple months? Not so much. I&#x27;ve tried so many different fading methods so I wont have to bleach the crap out of my hair, but this is just NOT coming out ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I left the dye in for an hour and when I washed out each section I dipped it in vinegar to stop the colors from blending into each other and to prolong the color. [probably not the best idea since now it wont come out..]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just gonna say I dunno. I left it in for the recommended time of 40 minutes. I bleached my hair.. It&#x27;s been a week and it&#x27;s green. People say it looks cool, which is nice, but honestly I was hoping more for a blue and not so much green. Immediately I got told &amp;#34;oh your hair is green&amp;#34;. I wanted blue, which is why I got blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color fades pretty quickly, which was unexpected. I had used manic panic SEVERAL times when I was younger and it had never faded so quickly. Actually, I had to get the color pulled out by a salonist and sitting in the chair for a few hours. This one.. not so much. It did smell good though. I was told for a while by my boyfriend that I smelled like the fruit bubblegum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Fades quickly, very quickly, I&#x27;ve washed my hair three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;...its so light that I won&#x27;t need the color pulled out and I&#x27;ll be able to do it over with just a brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*MOST*  of us know, when dying your hair a weird color to lighten it first. This is esppecciallly true with this stuff. The bottom of my hair, which was a dark brown lightened to a.. slightly lighter brown. (I used Splat) The bottom of my hair looks like puke green. I don&#x27;t mind because it fades out but it is a puke green and if it were the whole thing I think I would cry. This is obvious though, so I can&#x27;t blame the product. But I thought I would include a warning for those out there who thought they would try to skip this part. My hair is a light golden brown in the center, and it also looks like puke green.</li>
            <li> approximately a year and a half ago, I bought six different colors of this brand, to dye my hair rainbow. There is enough per container to do three recolors when it starts to fade. This shade was my little sister&#x27;s favorite, so around this time last year (right before halloween), I dyed her hair with streaks of it. there is still some in her hair! I still have bright pink streaks of the flamingo pink AND the teal in my hair, and I have attempted to dye my hair back to my natural blonde TWICE in the past 4 months. The last time I applied the color to my hair was about a year ago. This stuff just loves to stay xD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided that I&#x27;m gonna go rainbow again :D</li>
            <li> I have long black hair and wanted to add some color to the ends for the spring. I bleached the end of my hair before hand and then applied this. If you have dark colored hair you have to bleach it. I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because it only lasted for 4 washes, it started to look green instead of turquoise. I touched up this weekend and I have a bit more to do one more touch up.</li>
            <li> I love punky color, i have had my hair every shade of the rainbow imaginable and no dye, stays in the hair as long, lasts so long in a bottle and is so cheap. Literally the BEST, plus it doesn&#x27;t smell like icky hair dye, smells like yummy berries</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that this is a bad product, because it&#x27;s really not. I actually really like the color turn out, and it was very easy to use, and smells wonderful. Unfortunately, 1 in 10 people have an allergic skin reaction to this product, and I was one of those unlucky people. It only cause a small, barely noticeable rash. Not itchy, or bothersome. It looked like little purple freckles in clusters on my neck, and because I dyed the underside of my bangs, it was also on my eye lids. It seems to be going away now, after 2 days, so I am really not that disappointed. But this is just what happened to me. The allergic reaction could be better or worse for someone else. So my advice is to ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS do a strand test. With this product, do it somewhere it will touch your skin, so that you can see if you&#x27;ll have an allergic reaction or not. Wait it out the day, and then decide whether or not to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, this product shipped in two days, and is very pretty. :]</li>
            <li> Because of the way I wash my hair, the turquoise color lasted a full month dark, and two more months as a nice faded teal. I just re-dyed it after 4 months. I am blonde so I did not have to bleach my hair first, and I just did the underside of my hair, to have some streak effect, so the faded pastel color was nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the dye in my hair for 1 hour, and then washed it out with water, and using conditioner on the dyed area is fine. When I wash my hair, for the first few weeks, I use as LITTLE shampoo on the dyed area as possible, and only wash my hair every other day. I separate the dyed part from the natural part for the first few weeks, so my natural blonde is not stained in the shower, and I wash them separately. Like I said, conditioner is fine, but I would avoid using too much shampoo-just use a little and wash it out quickly for the first couple weeks if you are trying to make the color last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to dry your hair with a specific towel that you don&#x27;t mind dying. The dye comes out of the towel eventually, but just have a towel just for that for the first few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color in this dye, and if you wash your hair like I did, the dye should last a long time, and when it fades, it looks beautiful and pastel too, if you don&#x27;t mind that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this dye. Just be aware that whenever there is MOISTURE (sweat, shower, swimming, whatever) there will be bleeding. But since I knew that when I bought it, I am VERY happy with this dye. And I checked reviews for all kinds of color dye before buying this one, everyone seems to think this Punky Colour is the best! And I believe it! I would post pictures if I knew how, but believe me, it&#x27;s a very nice color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sorry because i didn&#x27;t rate u before, is just my order was delayed in my country. But thanksssss</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Before I had a pink streak that quickly turned to orange after every application. I didn&#x27;t even re-bleach the strip and just threw this on. Awesome! Over the last 3 months or so I have only re-applied once! Still looks vibrant and blue! Worth the couple dollars!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last forever, but it lasted longer than I would have liked, which felt like forever.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-dark brown hair, so the color was a very nice subtle green. I got a lot of compliments for it. The color was so subtle it never showed up in pictures, the vampire of hair colors. I had it in for about three months. It faded nicely, leaving a green tint before I colored over it (purple, these DO blend one on top of the other).&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: Punky Colour colors everything, the towels, the shower, your skin, the gloves you use to color. It wears off very slowly. I still have these green streaks on towels from when I colored it. Greased Lightning Orange Blast Super Strength cleaner helps get it off surfaces, but be prepared to make everything you touch green for a few days after.</li>
            <li> Great product, very easy to use.  I have a white patch of hair, and I doused it with peroxide for 30 min as suggested, so the dye will be more effective. The color fades in 4-6 shampoos even with this preparation, but it is quick to retouch.  Many compliments on the Lagoon Blue!</li>
            <li> Began using this when our local store stopped stocking Splat permanent in blue.  I was afraid it would be wimpy color, but it is beautiful, much easier to apply, and if I wash my hair every other day lasts several weeks.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on recommendation from a friend and was sooo pleased!  It smelled like grapes, made my hair soft and silky (even though I bleached the pieces I colored w/ this first, it felt better than the rest of my hair that I used regular dye on), and it has stayed in VERY well.  Its been almost 2 months now and its still in!  The only downsides were 1. It was darker than I had hoped and greener BUT i have red hair that turned true yellow when bleached so thats probly why! 2. For the first 3 weeks at least, any time I got even a tiny bit sweaty/wet/moist, I turned turquoise!  However, it was super easy to apply and a great product overall and it arrived very quickly so THUMBS UP!!!</li>
            <li> its been 3months and the color of my hair is still rocki&#x27;n awesome!</li>
            <li> I love it!  It smells wonderful and the color is BOLD! It didn&#x27;t leave my hair coarse feeling like some of the other dye&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used and the pricing was great. So far I&#x27;ve had it in for almost 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t had any fading issues. Really great product, highly recommend if you want the wow factor and true color.</li>
            <li> This dye lasted for a good few months in my hair. I have dark brown hair and had to bleach it first, and then this color was awesome. I did not have any staining on my clothes or pillows, although I was worried at first because it kept looking like it was washing out in the shower several times (blue water). But the color was awesome and lasted a while! And even as it started to fade, it still looked cool. ;)</li>
            <li> Bought this on whim (at a friend&#x27;s suggestion) and added a bit of color to my hair. I bleached certain sections first in order to remove some remaining purple coloring, and the Jerome Russell Semi Permanent Punky Colour Hair Cream in Turquoise was lovely. Started out as a very bright blue (thanks to the bleach), but faded into more of a green as time passed. I received plenty of compliments and re-applied after eight weeks when the color wasn&#x27;t as vibrant as I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this brand of hair coloring and most certainly this shade!</li>
            <li> color comes out how it was supposedc to im so in love with my hair now yayyyyy !!!!!! ;) must try</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product a 4 instead of a 5 is because it is VERY messy! If you dont wear a towel when you dye your hair, you will get it all over your clothes. I accidentally stained my mom&#x27;s white counter top. Now I know everyone says it bleeds all over everything. Well not \\&quot;everything.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it getting on my pillow or my clothes. I kept my hair in a pony tail the first couple days tho just to be on the safe side. And I only put 2 streaks in and did my tips. It does get all over the shower tho. It stained my shower blue for 3 weeks after I dyed it. So I bleached my shower. I used the turquoise color over red hair. Take my advice, bleach your hair first. Everyone asks me if I&#x27;m ready for Christmas because my turquoise turned out green! I am going to try the blue next and bleach my tips to be on the safe side. I don&#x27;t mind having green hair but I was really hoping for turquoise. So bleach it first. It has been almost a couple months now, and it still has barely faded. It doesnt get all over my shower anymore. This has to be the longest lasting temporary hair dye ever!</li>
            <li> I really like this hairdye, but the blue... After awhile it turns green. I died my hair blue LAST SUMMER, (almost 8 months ago) and there&#x27;s still green in my hair.</li>
            <li> I liked it but not what I expected the color was not very long lasting, kinda disappointed read good reviews about it but maybe it just wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> I would call this more rockstar electic blue than turquoise lol I still liked it but not what I thought it was! the color faded off significantly on my highlighted streak of hair after prob 3 weeks. It&#x27;s a good price for what you get and it faded to a more tasteful color quickly but you&#x27;d need to use it often and I don&#x27;t wash my hair but a few times a week. with sulfate free products to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> This is the best we&#x27;ve found, and we&#x27;ve tried them all. Colors are rich, pure, brilliant and the lasting power is greater than what is described on the label (&amp;#34;semi-permanent; lasts through 8 washes). We&#x27;ve found that it can last for several months, in fact. This product is much better than manic panic and actually smells okay (some dyes smell harshly chemical; JR has a pleasant smell, like a fruity conditioner). The dye is not damaging to the hair, and leaves it soft. The damage comes in when you use bleach first, but if your hair is dark and you want a purer shade of the color, you&#x27;ll have to bleach first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried turquoise, green, lagoon, hot pink, purple--all great!</li>
            <li> I have used this on both myself AND my DOG.&lt;br /&gt;It worked wonders on both! Faded to a nice green on my hair and parts of my dog&#x27;s, for his white areas (Obviously I did NO bleaching for him) it turned out BOLD and fabulous! On the white it seems to fade to lighter shade instead of a green.&lt;br /&gt;I had no issues with the color bleeding on either of us, which was wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This color last&#x27;s a LONG TIME compared to manic panic and other dyes!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say I will be using them again!-In red!</li>
            <li> love adding little highlights of color to my hair and this color looks just like the name, the color has lasted me a long time too. it is just as briht as it was when I put it on a month ago. I did lighten my hair first so it would shand out better love it  will use it again.</li>
            <li> I DON;T USE THIS STUFF, BUT MY 16 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES TO EXPERIMENT WITH HAIR COLOR AND STYLE AND SHE LOVES IT.  IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE ON LINE THAN FINDING A BEAUTY SUPPLY HOUSE THAT HAS IT.</li>
            <li> the product got here FAST and the color is really vibrant! This is by far, the best color I have used!</li>
            <li> love this color line. I&#x27;ve used several brands and have gone thru several colors. I have to say for the cost and quality, its one of my favorites. Plus you can mix to make your own customized color. The smell is probably as good as the color. Reminds me of blueberries. I will say, leave this color on as long as possible for bright result. Recommended 30 min barely tints my bleached hair. I also put a little color in some regular conditioner and use when i wash my hair to keep the color fresh</li>
            <li> I had my hair dyed using punky colors at a salon, just streaks here and there. The second time I went it didn&#x27;t turn out like I wanted so I bought some and redid the part I did not like.  I found it super easy to work with. If you get it on your skin or sink, etc, windex gets it off of you do it right away. I dropped some on my shirt and put some tide liquid in it before it dried and it ask came out. I have never had a problem with staining the sink, shower, clothes, etc. You just have to be vigilante and have the cleaning stuff on hand. I always have windex and tide in the bathroom anyway. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Okay so I wanted purple, pink, and blue streaks in my hair. I purchased Plum, Flamingo Pink, and Lagoon Blue. I went to the salon to have my hair professionally bleached to as light as my hair would go(can&#x27;t do it myself since I have jet black hair and don&#x27;t need it falling out). I am VERY satisfied with plum and flamingo pink. The colors are vivid and bright (not sure how long plum will last. But I tried just dying my hair flamingo pink at one point, and it stayed bright for weeks even though I was shampooing more often than I should and in warm water). Just a warning though: flamingo pink does bleed like crazy whenever you shampoo your hair. Wait until its all done before you hop out of the shower to prevent staining your belongings. Plum is a a true purple kind of color, flamingo pink looks like a bright fuchsia. Both are just gorgeous (and I received compliments on them). I am a tad disappointed with the lagoon blue though. I mean its pretty, but I don&#x27;t think it is gonna last long. The sky blue already faded a bit after the first wash. Also it looks slightly green in some parts of my hair (and that DEFINITELY wasn&#x27;t what I was aiming for). I am pretty happy for the most part though. This is cheaper than Manic Panic, and lasts longer. Also it smells like artificial grapes, so the smell was pleasant</li>
            <li> This stuff is insane, I freaking LOVEEE it, it gives vibrant color, it&#x27;s long lasting, and as it fades it gives the look of different shades of the color making it even prettier! It bleeds quite a bit and I only wash my hair in cold water, but it doesn&#x27;t fade very fast, I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed turquoise for almost two months and I dye it once a month, doesn&#x27;t even need to be that often, it could seriously go 3-4 months depending on how frequently you shower. I seriously adore this brand out of all I&#x27;ve tried (Manic Panic, Ion, N Rage color, and Raw) and Punky Colour certainly is the best.</li>
            <li> i loved the color it was very vibrant! long lasting too! it was also a very speedy delivery. a good blue dye is hard to find but i love this one!</li>
            <li> Used the violet and turquoise and the color and quality is awesome, it&#x27;s been over two weeks and its just now slightly fading. Still beautiful and sooo many compliments. Washing it every 2-3 days. Color moves a bit when wet at first..but only moves after that when washed with shampoo. Was using manic panic..but never will again. Love this stuff and will be recommending to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dye! I have darkish blond hair with some red in it. I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair or anything to get the exact color out of this hair dye. I did leave the dye in for two hours a little longer than the recommended time. But it turned out perfect! It was very easy to use and as everyone says it smells really good. Like grapes. My hair feels nice and soft too not brittle or dry at all. I will definitely try more of these hair dyes. Love it!</li>
            <li> although I have not dyed my hair yet I am impressed that it came early and it looks just like the picture</li>
            <li> will never buy again after each wash it bled out</li>
