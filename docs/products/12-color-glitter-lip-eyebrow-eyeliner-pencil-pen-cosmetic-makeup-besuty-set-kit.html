            <li>HOW DO I GET MORE MAKEUP!??</li>
            <li>But they glide on so nicely.</li>
            <li>I love using these lip and eyebrow pencil pens but it needs more lead.</li>
            <li>Go on smooth, not dry, very nice!</li>
            <li>and I just love how smooth they go on and love how pigmented they are.</li>
            <li>These made a great gift for a 7 year old who just wanted makeup for playing dress-up with!</li>
            <li>fast service, love the colors great price too thank you very much if when I wear tem and like it even more I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay on an smudge easily.</li>
            <li>when I open the package I was so happy to see them.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>but it was free.</li>
            <li>These actually aren&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>I opened these and accidentally popped the bottom off of one, quickly realizing that there was, in fact, makeup going all the way to the bottom.</li>
            <li>It was a fun gift for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Was worth what I paid.</li>
            <li>Right away I started playing with them</li>
            <li>Overall I love them.</li>
            <li>Even if it didn&#x27;t have more makeup, the part that is pre-sharpened lasts a long while.</li>
            <li>It comes fast.</li>
            <li>There is also not much too them and they are extremely easy to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colours are quite vibrant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft to the touch and not harsh on the eyelids.</li>
            <li>Since they are a little over $2.00 they are still worth buying if you don&#x27;t need now.</li>

            <li> The colors are nice and pencils are of good quality!!!!</li>
            <li> I got them in the mail the other day and when I open the package I was so happy to see them. Right away I started playing with them and I just love how smooth they go on and love how pigmented they are. I also used one of the pencils as a lip liner and there weren&#x27;t any bleeding from the lipstick. Overall I love them.</li>
            <li> This product has excellent quality. It comes fast. Not one thing wrong with them. I got them In perfect condition. I do recommend this eye liner/lip liner.</li>
            <li> Came in great condition. Goes on smooth. Do need to set with powder. Can not sharpen, what little you get on the tip is it. Colors are bright. Shipping did take forever but it was free. Since they are a little over $2.00 they are still worth buying if you don&#x27;t need now.</li>
            <li> I thought they were the spring loaded pencils, Once you used what was on the tips that is it, it was done with. The colors didn&#x27;t stay well on my eye lids either. I suggest passing on this product</li>
            <li> The colours are quite vibrant. It&#x27;s soft to the touch and not harsh on the eyelids. Also sharpens with a pencil sharpener. I will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> the only reason i gave one stgar is because there are no instructions on how to use it! it does not wind up, or out. i emailed them for instructions but have not heard from them. wont be buying from them again if i do not hear from them</li>
            <li> This product caused some confusion all over the place; did i get a defective product? Why won&#x27;t the bottom twist? HOW DO I GET MORE MAKEUP!?? Well, you sharpen these like you would eyeliner. I opened these and accidentally popped the bottom off of one, quickly realizing that there was, in fact, makeup going all the way to the bottom. Even if it didn&#x27;t have more makeup, the part that is pre-sharpened lasts a long while. Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> fast service, love the colors great price too thank you very much if when I wear tem and like it even more I will be ordering more I was wondering do you give discounts on multiple orders</li>
            <li> These made a great gift for a 7 year old who just wanted makeup for playing dress-up with! However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for anything other than play. They don&#x27;t stay on an smudge easily. There is also not much too them and they are extremely easy to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the colors are fun and these are PERFECT for detailing face paint for events like children&#x27;s parties and Halloween.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!! Best Eyeliners I have ever purchased.  I have not figured out how to sharpen them.  But they glide on so nicely.</li>
            <li> These actually aren&#x27;t that good. The color doesn&#x27;t show up well, they can&#x27;t be sharpened or pushed up or anything. Idk what they&#x27;re good for l ol</li>
            <li> The colors are not good.I am not satisfied with this product for the below reasons:-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.I am not sure, if this can be sharpen further.&lt;br /&gt;2.Pink color was damaged for me.&lt;br /&gt;3.Blue/Green/Brown/Black(almost all colors) are not showing on Skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.Quality is not good&lt;br /&gt;5.When I asked for return and refund, the seller asked me to pay the shipment fee. Which was ~$14. I did not returned bcoz, it is not a wise idea to pay $14 for a product of ~$7.&lt;br /&gt;Please Be aware.</li>
            <li> some of the liners were dried out and did not work</li>
            <li> Love the colors but very disappointed they did not sharpen or roll up or any of the sort will not be buying again</li>
            <li> Dont us alot, i prefer urban decay, but works well when im playing dress up with my nieces.</li>
            <li> I love using these lip and eyebrow pencil pens but it needs more lead. So I will have to rate it low because what you see is basically what you get and when it run out, that&#x27;s it! So the brand need to upgrade, soon!</li>
            <li> They work great and have great color. If u get rhem though it only has a tip that is eyeliner there is none in the pencil. So once the tip is used up thats all.</li>
            <li> It was a fun gift for my daughter.  Had a hood time playing with different colors. Was worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> Go on smooth, not dry, very nice!</li>
            <li> It was very hard to get it to work right away but after it worked good!</li>
