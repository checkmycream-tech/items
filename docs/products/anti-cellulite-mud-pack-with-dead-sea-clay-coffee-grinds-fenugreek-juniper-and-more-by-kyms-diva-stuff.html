            <li>I will suffer through it though because the results really are noticeable!!</li>
            <li>After the first time I saw results!</li>
            <li>nothing has let me down yet, and this works wonders, I&#x27;ve also used the soap bar and loved it</li>

            <li>Thanks for the samples!</li>
            <li>And my skin smelled so good, even a few hours after I used the mud pack.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million to Kym for her kindness and sending me samples to make up for the first time when I got none.</li>
            <li>Maybe my face is just super sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This product really does work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very concentrated smell.</li>
            <li>Thanks Kym</li>

            <li> A small bar of their cellulite soap and small trial of blue bubblegum cuticle cream that smelt sensational.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin due to lymphedema, and this product only aggravated the skin on my legs and thighs.  </li>
            <li> it should last me a long while.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, you have to apply it when you have time to let it dry.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had them for so long they may stay with me for life</li>
            <li> Came in a smaller container than expected but bc its a mud mask</li>
            <li> The product might work on someone younger who has tight skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone over 40 or someone with skin issues such as myself.</li>
            <li> Just massage it on and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I have used it 3x and to finish the rest will only cover about half of what I want it to.</li>
            <li> The jar should be a little bigger to accommodate that.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that the jar is so small..</li>
            <li> so I leave a sheet down in front of the tv and wrap myself in it once applied.</li>
            <li> It is thick and dries tight, almost instantly firming the skin.</li>
            <li> - It is about half the size I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The skin is smoother and less cellulite.</li>
            <li> , i also like the smell of the product, i could notice a little difference on my hips the cellulite is going away, but i been applying it for over 2 weeks 2 times a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> Yes it can be a lil messy</li>
            <li> Messy</li>
            <li> I had to use a shower puff to scrub the dried mud pack off my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it is small.</li>
            <li> Thats not very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The one downfall is that the product is thick so you need a generous amount depending on which area you&#x27;re covering.</li>
            <li> It dried very slowly and it got very messy - the area I used for waiting to dry got very dirty.  </li>
            <li> Once I got past the smell and applied the product, I found it was very difficult to wash off, even in the shower.  </li>
            <li> But didn&#x27;t feel anything bad on my legs.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this mud pack was atrocious.  </li>
            <li> But this one definitely shocked me!</li>

            <li> I love their products nothing has let me down yet, and this works wonders, I&#x27;ve also used the soap bar and loved it</li>
            <li> This product really does work and I paid full price for it so you know my review has not been paid for by this seller. It&#x27;s messy. I put it on (full thigh knees to butt, front and back) and stand in my tub while it dries - about 15 minutes - It is about half the size I was expecting. I was envisioning a body butter size tub and it is small. I have used it 3x and to finish the rest will only cover about half of what I want it to. SO, I mean, it&#x27;s worth is because it works, but honestly I am a pretty small person (120 lbs 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;) so if you truly need this and are any bigger than me trying to get results you probably only get 2 applications on your upper thighs and it&#x27;s gone. The smell, others have commented on and yes, it is pungent in a tolerable way at first and then it just gets overwhelming. It&#x27;s a very concentrated smell. I will suffer through it though because the results really are noticeable!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of cellulite items and this was by far the most effective. Absolutely amazing. Try it</li>
            <li> I love the smell and dries well. Will add more when I see difference.</li>
            <li> It dried very slowly and it got very messy - the area I used for waiting to dry got very dirty.  I threw away the rest away</li>
            <li> I brought this product from another site because I like to buy in bulk. This product works!! Yes it can be a lil messy so I leave a sheet down in front of the tv and wrap myself in it once applied. The drying is a good thing because the mud helps tighten the skin when it dries. Then after an hour I rinse off in the shower and apply a lotion.  I noticed a difference after 2 applications. The skin is smoother and less cellulite. No difference in the deep dimples but I&#x27;ve had them for so long they may stay with me for life</li>
            <li> It got here before the estimated delivery date which was great. I&#x27;m not to sure if they product works yet, I&#x27;ve used it 3 times after the gym but it smells great!</li>
            <li> Messy but it works. I had read that the smell was amazing I don&#x27;t agree but wow you can see instant results and feel it working as it drys</li>
            <li> Love the Mud Pack!  The texture and of the product is perfect.  Results are seen after the 1st application.  Thanks Kym</li>
            <li> I LOVE this so much! After the first time I saw results! Now I am not usually someone who goes for the &amp;#34;try it! It really works!&amp;#34; ads.. But this one definitely shocked me! My husband and mom were so amazed how my legs looked after just one use. I already ordered my second jar.. The only downfall is that the jar is so small.. Thanks a million to Kym for her kindness and sending me samples to make up for the first time when I got none. You truly do know how to please your customers! For those with cellulite, try this! Seriously, it is magic in a jar!</li>
            <li> This mud mask is awesome! The only thing is, you have to apply it when you have time to let it dry. Good to use once/week.</li>
            <li> Do not see any results</li>
            <li> Only used it once....</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after I wash the mud off. And my skin smelled so good, even a few hours after I used the mud pack.</li>
            <li> I Love how my skin feel after i wash t off, it is so silky smooth, i also like the smell of the product, i could notice a little difference on my hips the cellulite is going away, but i been applying it for over 2 weeks 2 times a week plus i do massage everyday :)</li>

            <li> love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Another great product! Just massage it on and let it dry. It is thick and dries tight, almost instantly firming the skin. I follow with the pineapple orchid cellulite soap and moraccan mint cream. After one use my skin already looks smoother! The one downfall is that the product is thick so you need a generous amount depending on which area you&#x27;re covering. The jar should be a little bigger to accommodate that. Other than that a fantastic product and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.  Came in a smaller container than expected but bc its a mud mask it should last me a long while.  Strong smell when u open it but in the shower or smells like an amazing cafe for coffee with like exotic beans lol.  Felt fabulous on my thighs.  Theres no warning ⚠ just be careful not to get it on sensitive skin like your face.  Thats not very pleasant.  But didn&#x27;t feel anything bad on my legs.  Maybe my face is just super sensitive.  Came with free samples!!!!!!  A small bar of their cellulite soap and small trial of blue bubblegum cuticle cream that smelt sensational.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old abd I&#x27;ve suffer from cellulite all my life. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and about 50% of my cellulite are gone!!! Thank you kym for all the free samples.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the samples! This is amazing. I&#x27;m in shock of how good this is. I give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Works great just receive it this week an try it the minute I took out of the package felt it working fast an also thank you so much  for the samples love the watermelon face scrub an Thai coconut face cream definitely know what I&#x27;m a Ordering next time (-:</li>
            <li> allergic to something in it!! broke out, thought my skin was on fire and turned bright red!!</li>
