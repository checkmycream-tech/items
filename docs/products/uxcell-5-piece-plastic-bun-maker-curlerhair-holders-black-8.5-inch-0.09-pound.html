    <ol>
            <li>These things are wonderful.</li>
            <li>another manufacturer made these before, and they worked great...</li>
            <li>This plastic hair holders are great.</li>
            <li>It stays in place and works great.</li>
            <li>VALUE cost wise.</li>
            <li>I loved being able to forget about my hair and just do my job.</li>
            <li>This was perfect though, and super cheap.</li>
            <li>So just in case I will keep a good stock of these available.</li>
            <li>and I guess the price is ok too.</li>
            <li>These are ok in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they would work better on thinner hair.  </li>
            <li>: once you get used to it the softer hold can actually be better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes when I purchased these Plastic Magic Bun Makers, but honest feedback will save you kind folks frustration and wasting your money, so</li>
            <li>so it frustrates me very good product overall</li>
            <li>all the way to the top when I go to sleep and in the morning I can take it off and have fabulous wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>These work fine</li>
            <li>I have to put a barrett under the bottom to secure</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold anything, no grip, cheap plastic</li>
            <li>It is made of cheap plastic, though, but it does the job</li>
            <li>It so comfortable, I can make a bun</li>
            <li>I used to use something similarly that worked great, but these are so flimsy that they will not hold my hair at all without collapsing.</li>
            <li>One day at work two different coworkers asked how my bun stayed so perfect the whole day.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to look friendly and</li>
            <li>You could wash them with soap and water to keep them clean also.</li>
            <li>and for people with curly, hard to manage hair, these will work great!</li>
            <li>Very brittle and crack easily.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what they advertise.</li>
            <li>I got three of these, and they&#x27;re super fun to play with, there are so many different hairstyles you can do with them, yu can also part your hair into several sections and sleep with these in and wake up with wavy curls too.</li>
            <li>No directions on how to get them to work easily- might always need a second person.</li>
            <li>It is easy to follow the instructioms r in chinese</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Normally as swimmers we&#x27;d just throw it up in a cap and forget about it</li>
            <li>They work fairly well one used once to get broken in.</li>
            <li>(I will humbly revise this review if someone shows me a better way to use this product, but so far it just does not work as claimed!)</li>
            <li>took 6 weeks for delivery as it came from China...comes in paper with NO INSTRUCTIONS or even a guide on how to use.....very flimsy and typical made in china cheap product..</li>
            <li>Completely unusable if you have thinner/straight hair.</li>
            <li>This size is too big for my hair, maybe because my hair is VERY layered.</li>
            <li>but I still have to pin the sides a bit to make it look not messy.  </li>
            <li>but it works very well the only reasin</li>
            <li>I would just squeeze the bun in a towel and not mess with it until I&#x27;d driven home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair and not much</li>
            <li>But this product does not lock together securely and will not hold our hair tight enough to stay up all day:-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to roll it a few times before getting it right.</li>
            <li>I find them simple to use if I put my hair in a ponytail first, but if I want a really tight bun</li>

            <li> (1 Corinthians 11), and we have been doing this for quite a long while...</li>
            <li> My hair is too long.</li>
            <li> My hair is about armpit-length, straight, coarse, and very thick by the way.</li>
            <li> as I have VERY long</li>
            <li> Despite having the right kind of hair (thick, wavy, long) and watching all of the YouTube videos on how to use these clips, they are difficult to put into place, as well as uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> No more, no less.</li>
            <li> Not good for African American hair.</li>
            <li> Everybody with long hair had trouble keeping it up and out of the way.</li>
            <li> , they seem harsh on my hair and they are not very flexible.</li>
            <li> Once it is really tight though, they keep my hair up extremely well, I even sleep in them and they hold all night and are confortable (I have to roll it downward thought</li>
            <li> I have only used one and it dosent brake or crack just a little hard ro clip in</li>
            <li> even if is long, is hard to keep anything on it without sliding all the time.</li>
            <li> bought the set of five because i have thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, so I thought I needed the biggest size.  </li>
            <li> I put one of this, make my little bun, which it doesn&#x27;t look so little with the body this bun maker gives it.</li>
            <li> This is a bit of a nuisance when trying to keep your hair firmly in a bun all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Sadly I can not recommend this product, and honestly \\&quot;we are as close to experts as you are going to get on this subject of hair buns\\&quot;:-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t as stiff as one would expect and it can take some time to get them in a position for a firm hold.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get stiff and painful and it does hold all day once you learn how to do it right.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure your hair could be any shorter than shoulder-length and useable with this item, but perhaps it could still work.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch, just in case, usually when I find something I like either gets discontinued or I cannot longer find it.</li>
            <li> Mine is almost too thick for them.</li>
            <li> They are a thin and flexible hard plastic, but not flimsy.</li>
            <li> have broken 2 of them already, and the hooks on the others wont stay together.  </li>
            <li> I was worried a cap might look scary to the littler ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> works terrible  and requires a ton of bobby pins</li>

            <li> bought the set of five because i have thick long hair.  have broken 2 of them already, and the hooks on the others wont stay together.  another manufacturer made these before, and they worked great... still looking</li>
            <li> Awful. Completely unusable if you have thinner/straight hair.</li>
            <li> They work fairly well one used once to get broken in. I have to put a barrett under the bottom to secure as I have VERY long hair.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT VALUE cost wise.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but will order a smaller size next time.  I have long, thick hair, so I thought I needed the biggest size.  This size is too big for my hair, maybe because my hair is VERY layered.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold anything, no grip, cheap plastic</li>
            <li> This is a big help, and I can put my hair up in a jiffy. Got compliments on the bun. It is made of cheap plastic, though, but it does the job and I guess the price is ok too.</li>
            <li> Very brittle and crack easily.</li>
            <li> That hair bun maker helps a lot while fixing hair.</li>
            <li> took 6 weeks for delivery as it came from China...comes in paper with NO INSTRUCTIONS or even a guide on how to use.....very flimsy and typical made in china cheap product..</li>
            <li> I bought 5 and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to use them, they seem harsh on my hair and they are not very flexible.</li>
            <li> These are ok in a pinch.  They keep my hair back and out of the way but I still have to pin the sides a bit to make it look not messy.  Maybe they would work better on thinner hair.  Mine is almost too thick for them.</li>
            <li> I got three of these, and they&#x27;re super fun to play with, there are so many different hairstyles you can do with them, yu can also part your hair into several sections and sleep with these in and wake up with wavy curls too. I like these alot. and for people with curly, hard to manage hair, these will work great!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes when I purchased these Plastic Magic Bun Makers, but honest feedback will save you kind folks frustration and wasting your money, so here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My sister and I put our hair up in buns and bun covers whenever we leave the house (1 Corinthians 11), and we have been doing this for quite a long while...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But this product does not lock together securely and will not hold our hair tight enough to stay up all day:-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We have grown our hair well below our waist, so if this product was going to work, it should work for us...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Still with no instructions in English (looks like Chinese), there is no way to confirm if there is some secret way to securely lock a \\&quot;neat\\&quot; hair bun in, for all day use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sadly I can not recommend this product, and honestly \\&quot;we are as close to experts as you are going to get on this subject of hair buns\\&quot;:-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; PS (I will humbly revise this review if someone shows me a better way to use this product, but so far it just does not work as claimed!)</li>
            <li> Not good for African American hair.</li>
            <li> No directions on how to get them to work easily- might always need a second person.</li>
            <li> I ordered these hoping that they would be like one I had ordered before. These work fine but they aren&#x27;t as stiff as one would expect and it can take some time to get them in a position for a firm hold. This is a bit of a nuisance when trying to keep your hair firmly in a bun all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: once you get used to it the softer hold can actually be better. It doesn&#x27;t get stiff and painful and it does hold all day once you learn how to do it right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use it, or maybe I need a Lil help to put in my Hair.. I followed the step but wont work on me..</li>
            <li> It is exactly what they advertise. No more, no less. Cheaper than others like the Amaranth twist because the Rosallini sends 5 holders.</li>
            <li> My hair is too long. It doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair. I can only use it for part of my hair.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good. It is easy to follow the instructioms r in chinese but u can look at youtube vids to follow it just pull ur hair through and roll. I have only used one and it dosent brake or crack just a little hard ro clip in but it works very well the only reasin i didnr give it a 5 was because my hair which is not totally even falls oit as i roll it up so it frustrates me very good product overall</li>
            <li> These things are wonderful. I find them simple to use if I put my hair in a ponytail first, but if I want a really tight bun I have to roll it a few times before getting it right. Once it is really tight though, they keep my hair up extremely well, I even sleep in them and they hold all night and are confortable (I have to roll it downward thought so it doesn&#x27;t prevent me from sleeping on my back). They also seem to be lasting well too. They are a thin and flexible hard plastic, but not flimsy. You could wash them with soap and water to keep them clean also. My hair is about armpit-length, straight, coarse, and very thick by the way. I&#x27;m not sure your hair could be any shorter than shoulder-length and useable with this item, but perhaps it could still work.</li>
            <li> works terrible  and requires a ton of bobby pins</li>
            <li> They stay bent, won&#x27;t hold my hair. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Despite having the right kind of hair (thick, wavy, long) and watching all of the YouTube videos on how to use these clips, they are difficult to put into place, as well as uncomfortable. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I was working as a swimming instructor when I bought these. I was working two hours at a time splashing around in the water with a bunch of kids and some coworkers. Everybody with long hair had trouble keeping it up and out of the way. Normally as swimmers we&#x27;d just throw it up in a cap and forget about it but I wanted to look friendly and I was worried a cap might look scary to the littler ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sock bun or foam roller was out because I didn&#x27;t want it to absorb extra water. This was perfect though, and super cheap. One day at work two different coworkers asked how my bun stayed so perfect the whole day. I loved being able to forget about my hair and just do my job. Sometimes at the end of class I would just squeeze the bun in a towel and not mess with it until I&#x27;d driven home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thickness wavy hair to about my armpit. It holds really well for a really long time, and it&#x27;s only as tight as the ponytail you thread it with. I love it.</li>
            <li> This plastic hair holders are great. I have very straight hair and not much even if is long, is hard to keep anything on it without sliding all the time. Mos standard hair claws are too big for the amount of hair I have. I put one of this, make my little bun, which it doesn&#x27;t look so little with the body this bun maker gives it. It so comfortable, I can make a bun all the way to the top when I go to sleep and in the morning I can take it off and have fabulous wavy hair.  I bought a bunch, just in case, usually when I find something I like either gets discontinued or I cannot longer find it. So just in case I will keep a good stock of these available.</li>
            <li> I love these. My hair is thin and long so it works well putting my hair up in a bun. It stays in place and works great. I would order again from this seller. I gave it a five star because they work just as I hope they would.</li>
            <li> I used to use something similarly that worked great, but these are so flimsy that they will not hold my hair at all without collapsing.</li>
