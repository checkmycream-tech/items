    <ol>
            <li>Excellent tea.</li>
            <li>Amazon you are the Best</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff for chest congestion.  </li>
            <li>It works great, is soothing and helps stuffiness.</li>
            <li>It also has a great taste, I think.</li>
            <li>Tea was great but the box was all smashed up in shipping.</li>
            <li>and it was very effective, so</li>
            <li>But HOW NICE, it was not!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taste is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>It works and tastes good.</li>
            <li>Love this tea!</li>
            <li>I have to say that this is the best natural product I&#x27;ve ever had that did what it described on the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to work, makes breathing kind of easy.</li>
            <li>I love this tea.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and my husband and neighbor both find it helpful for breathing.</li>
            <li>The flavor is okay, I always add honey to help with the sore throat.</li>
            <li>Would definately buy more.</li>
            <li>They help him breathe better, easier.</li>
            <li>I love TM teas and this is one of my favorites....</li>
            <li>great tea and also very tasty.</li>
            <li>I love the taste of the tea.  </li>
            <li>We love this product for its flavor, health benefits, and its availability.</li>
            <li>this tea is just plain delicious and good for you as a plus.</li>
            <li>This makes a huge difference for those who struggle to breathe.</li>
            <li>However, after trying this product&#x27;s newly reformulation (re: removal of \\&quot;ephedra\\&quot;) for four months, all I can say that for asthmatic relief, today&#x27;s \\&quot;Breath Easy\\&quot; tea no longer effectively works for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I have allergies as well as asthma, and this tea really does make me feel better.  </li>
            <li>Just as described, delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this tea many years and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I have asked our local pharmacy to carry the product along with the Throat Ease (which also works great for sore throats) made by the same company.  </li>
            <li>a cup or two a day did me good on a typical congestive day.</li>
            <li>I felt great after, and I could finally sleep peacefully, since the allergy medicine didn&#x27;t work for me after a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Oxygen is the most important thing you can get in your system and if you are not breathing right, colds, or other issues this can really help.</li>
            <li>However it has pretty distinctive taste but does the trick.</li>
            <li>I brew it in a big mug to ensure getting plenty of fluids to help it loosen congestion more readily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, easy, fast remedy when you feel like &#x27;heck&#x27; all over.</li>
            <li>So very grateful I found it here....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll really help you breath easier.</li>
            <li>It certainly seems to open up my passage way, and moreso clears my chest fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>As a tea, it&#x27;s fine, but I was looking for that sense of easier breathing that the other tea provided.  </li>
            <li>While unfortunate for those with real respiratory illness that the minor ephedra component was removed due to abuse by other people, Breathe Easy remains one of the best natural medicinals for effective clearing of congestion in the lungs due to non-cardiac causes, such as allergic or intrinsic asthma, and infectious bronchitis.</li>
            <li>In the past, I regularly used Taditional Medicinals&#x27; \\&quot;Breath Easy\\&quot; herbal tea for years with great therapeutic success in controlling my asthma symptoms since it had a small amount of \\&quot;ephedra\\&quot; in it.  </li>
            <li>Just great for the cold and coughðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>For centuries, the herb \\&quot;ephedra\\&quot; traditionally was used in herbal teas and other health products to help ease and alleviate asthma attacks because of its unique and beneficial antispasmodic properties that facilitated in opening bronchial air passages.  </li>
            <li>Several years ago teenagers in sports were especially using energy-enhancing supplements and drinks containing large amounts of \\&quot;ephedra\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this for people with allergies, chest colds, head colds, common colds, and mild sinus infections.</li>
            <li>I have light asthma and have never had serious issues with it.</li>
            <li>Yummy and really does help one breathe better through allergy season and cold and flu season.</li>

            <li> Yummy and really does help one breathe better through allergy season and cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> To protect consumers from what they deem dangerous chemicals, and sometimes in their control in banning and outlawing certain additives put into foodstuff, the FDA acts over-zealous and over-reaching.  Several years ago teenagers in sports were especially using energy-enhancing supplements and drinks containing large amounts of \\&quot;ephedra\\&quot;.  A significant number of these adolescents abusively overdosed on such supplements and drinks that caused many to become serious ill where some unfortunately died.  To counter this harmful trend, and instead of being selective in creating pragmatic regulations concerning quantity, the FDA altogether banned \\&quot;ephedra\\&quot; (aka: \\&quot;endphdrine\\&quot;).  For centuries, the herb \\&quot;ephedra\\&quot; traditionally was used in herbal teas and other health products to help ease and alleviate asthma attacks because of its unique and beneficial antispasmodic properties that facilitated in opening bronchial air passages.  In the past, I regularly used Taditional Medicinals&#x27; \\&quot;Breath Easy\\&quot; herbal tea for years with great therapeutic success in controlling my asthma symptoms since it had a small amount of \\&quot;ephedra\\&quot; in it.  However, after trying this product&#x27;s newly reformulation (re: removal of \\&quot;ephedra\\&quot;) for four months, all I can say that for asthmatic relief, today&#x27;s \\&quot;Breath Easy\\&quot; tea no longer effectively works for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I have allergy issues, which sometime turn into asthma issues. Sometimes I drink this tea if my inhaler isn&#x27;t doing the trick. It clears me up for a couple of days. I have light asthma and have never had serious issues with it. I use their other teas too.</li>
            <li> I love this tea. I have to say that this is the best natural product I&#x27;ve ever had that did what it described on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in Colorado (originally from Texas) and had mad allergies. My lover gave me a cup of the tea and it tasted fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halfway through the tea, I was already blowing everything out of my nose and was already expectorating. I felt great after, and I could finally sleep peacefully, since the allergy medicine didn&#x27;t work for me after a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for people with allergies, chest colds, head colds, common colds, and mild sinus infections.</li>
            <li> It was 4 stars for effectiveness, but 1 star for side effects.  I got very sick with severe stomach cramping.  I went onto the company website and saw that this can be a side effect so discontinued use.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and my husband and neighbor both find it helpful for breathing.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, makes breathing kind of easy. However it has pretty distinctive taste but does the trick. Not much else to monetion.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the tea that helps you breathe easier - you probably want to try it.</li>
            <li> Tasty tea.... will buy again!</li>
            <li> I happened to try this when our local Safeway used to carry it.  It opens up the lungs when you have a bad chest cold and relaxes you at the same time.  I almost panicked when Safeway quit carrying it, so went in search, finally finding it at online sites like Amazon and at a grocery in a neighboring town.  I have asked our local pharmacy to carry the product along with the Throat Ease (which also works great for sore throats) made by the same company.  This stuff works!</li>
            <li> It works great, is soothing and helps stuffiness. The flavor is okay, I always add honey to help with the sore throat.</li>
            <li> I have allergies as well as asthma, and this tea really does make me feel better.  Highly recommended.  Licorice taste.</li>
            <li> While unfortunate for those with real respiratory illness that the minor ephedra component was removed due to abuse by other people, Breathe Easy remains one of the best natural medicinals for effective clearing of congestion in the lungs due to non-cardiac causes, such as allergic or intrinsic asthma, and infectious bronchitis. It&#x27;s taste is quite pleasant. I brew it in a big mug to ensure getting plenty of fluids to help it loosen congestion more readily.</li>
            <li> It does have the ability to open up the nose somewhat. It also has a great taste, I think. Would definately buy more.</li>
            <li> Excellent tea. This makes a huge difference for those who struggle to breathe. Oxygen is the most important thing you can get in your system and if you are not breathing right, colds, or other issues this can really help.</li>
            <li> Ive used this tea in the past and have found it to be beneficial with nasal congestion and respiratory issues.</li>
            <li> I got these for my father~n~law. He has sever copd. They help him breathe better, easier. Just drink one cup a day is all he does.</li>
            <li> I love TM teas and this is one of my favorites....I was afraid that had took it off the market.....So very grateful I found it here....Amazon you are the Best</li>
            <li> great tea and also very tasty. this tea is just plain delicious and good for you as a plus. Good stuff</li>
            <li> I use it instead of over the counter expectorants unless I have severe congestion.  I still use this tea as well.  It works and tastes good.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of the tea.  It has a relaxing effect on me which helps my asthma.</li>
            <li> This tea tastes so bad that I cannot drink it.  The two times that I managed to get it down did not seem to help my breathing at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for chest congestion.  You just have to drink it and drink it and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad either.  I always have some on hand.</li>
            <li> I use this tea with a bit of lemon and honey (and sometimes Hibiscus tea) when recording vocals. Makes a noticeable difference in opening things up! Love this tea!</li>
            <li> Tea was great but the box was all smashed up in shipping.</li>
            <li> I tried Yogi Tea&#x27;s version of this and it was very effective, so I thought I would give this a try. Not good. As a tea, it&#x27;s fine, but I was looking for that sense of easier breathing that the other tea provided.  The majority of the teabags have remained unused for months.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> We love this product for its flavor, health benefits, and its availability. Makes me want to possibly open a Variety Tea store. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this tea many years and highly recommend it.  Breath it and get relief, sip it and it&#x27;ll really help you breath easier.</li>
            <li> I steep in half the water for 15 min and drink it down. It certainly seems to open up my passage way, and moreso clears my chest fairly quickly. It&#x27;s a simple, easy, fast remedy when you feel like &#x27;heck&#x27; all over. I was shocked how it opened up my airways.. as if I took a shot of an inhaler. But HOW NICE, it was not! I didn&#x27;t need to drink it all day either... a cup or two a day did me good on a typical congestive day. Try it at least once as an alternative to heavier drugs.</li>
            <li> Just great for the cold and coughðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Just as described, delivered quickly.</li>
