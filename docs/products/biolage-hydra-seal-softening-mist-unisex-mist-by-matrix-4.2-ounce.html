            <li>I totally love this product...</li>
            <li>, I love it.</li>
            <li>I use another detangler, but I decided to try this for more shine.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to def order more.</li>
            <li>The best way to use it of any race, is once u wash your hair then blow dry.</li>
            <li>This product makes the hair so silky and so easy to get your comb or fingers through it</li>
            <li>I purchased this item and I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>I question how well a product can truly soften hair when it contains that strong of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt like it had a fine coating of glue on it.</li>
            <li>It may be because I have a fine texture to my hair</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft smelling good And stops your hair being statically</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product from my hairstylist but we moved</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it made my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>it makes hair smell amazing and super soft.</li>
            <li>It also made my hair tangle more and made it look more coarse.</li>
            <li>Love this product it makes your hair feel so soft!  </li>
            <li>right after I wash my hair and use my fingers to comb it throughout.</li>
            <li>I bought this right before I went on vaction</li>
            <li>It protects really well during summer months too!</li>
            <li>I usually only use one or two sprays and that is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only issue with this product though is that the pump sprays out a lot at a time and sometimes it can spray in more of a line than in a mist.</li>
            <li>This is a product that was first put on my hair by my stylist.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair baby soft and light.</li>
            <li>I wish this stuff had worked for me, I usually have good experiences with Biolage products.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair super soft without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>Really helps to soften hair.</li>
            <li>or you will get too much in one place.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to make hair manageable and super soft A+.....</li>
            <li>It really gives a new life to your hair.</li>
            <li>but most of these products have the typical Biolage  smell.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>However, this spray felt nice as long as my hair was still wet</li>
            <li>It was in the same bottle but didn&#x27;t have the same results  on my hair ad the original I purchased.</li>
            <li>It leaves me hair feeling soft, silky, and not product build uped.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>but this product does make it soft and health</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft &amp; shiny...but not overkill or greasy looking at all.  </li>
            <li>It holds in the moisture so well that the amount of hair loss has decreased A-LOT and my hair is visibly healthier and moisturized without feeling greasy or like it&#x27;s been glued when it dries - plus no more fly aways and my curls have bounced back all after the first use!</li>
            <li>but if I do I always add this spray first and dry on cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are other items on the  market, like Biosilk, that seem to work better and leave less residue.</li>
            <li>I have been going gray since I was about 20 years old and over the last year I have started to get highlights to reduce the visibility of my gray hair.  </li>
            <li>no matter how little or how much I used my hair felt coated and oily.</li>

            <li> -- doesn&#x27;t weigh down even naturally oily hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair after the last time I colored it started falling out at the root, it was so dry that after I washed it</li>
            <li> The only negative i guess would be if you put too much in hair can look greasy.</li>
            <li> and when you run fingers through it; your hair feels so silky especially when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> Of course getting this done every 7 weeks, along with blow drying and flat ironing, my hair became very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and when I spray it on after the shower and sleep overnight, the next morning it&#x27;s so soft and bouncy and non-frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and work out a lot, so I have to be careful when washing/combing it out.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not course or dry and rough feeling anymore.</li>
            <li> The Pros:  it seems to soften my hair and works well when my hair is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my hair wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews have said a little goes a long way, and I will totally agree with that.  </li>
            <li> I could feel how course it was when it was wet</li>
            <li> so be careful with that.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> I am always very skeptical of products claiming to make your hair smooth and soft, I have straight color treated hair and recently my hairdresser really dried it out bad,  </li>
            <li> I also use other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; to add shine and control, but none of them have done the trick this does.  </li>
            <li> Very subtle spray, for my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> Just squirt it, and rub it down your hair strands to blend it.  </li>
            <li> As someone whose hair doesn&#x27;t allow for a lot of conditioning (it gets greasy and weighed down)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, course and dry.</li>
            <li> leave the hair damp just a little then spray the hair with biolage, finish blow drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall... I don&#x27;t use the product everyday</li>
            <li> Spray on after washing and towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> usually spray in the Hydra-Seal</li>
            <li> Style as usual, ur hair will blow in the wind.</li>
            <li> I have hair that goes past my shoulders and is quite thick.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately quantity is not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers through it even after conditioning with an expensive salon conditioner.</li>
            <li> but after it dried it was awful.</li>
            <li> I was sick when my salon quit carrying the line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff</li>

            <li> Made my hair super soft without feeling oily. Nice smell too!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft smelling good And stops your hair being statically</li>
            <li> My hair after the last time I colored it started falling out at the root, it was so dry that after I washed it I could feel how course it was when it was wet and I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers through it even after conditioning with an expensive salon conditioner. This product makes the hair so silky and so easy to get your comb or fingers through it and when you run fingers through it; your hair feels so silky especially when it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s not course or dry and rough feeling anymore. It holds in the moisture so well that the amount of hair loss has decreased A-LOT and my hair is visibly healthier and moisturized without feeling greasy or like it&#x27;s been glued when it dries - plus no more fly aways and my curls have bounced back all after the first use! This product does what it says and I just bought two more bottles!! Oh yeah and it&#x27;s smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I have been going gray since I was about 20 years old and over the last year I have started to get highlights to reduce the visibility of my gray hair.  Of course getting this done every 7 weeks, along with blow drying and flat ironing, my hair became very dry.  I began using Biolage Hydrating conditioner and purchased this softening mist about a month ago to try.  The Pros:  it seems to soften my hair and works well when my hair is wet or dry.  The Cons:  1) it has alcohol in it and there is a warning on the bottle that warns to \\&quot;stay away from open flame until hair is dry\\&quot;.  I question how well a product can truly soften hair when it contains that strong of alcohol.  2)It does seem to be on the greasy side and because the product is in a spray bottle residue gets all over my bathroom from the sink to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall... I don&#x27;t use the product everyday but when I do use it my hair is softer.  I will finish this bottle but I do not think I will purchase this again.  There are other items on the  market, like Biosilk, that seem to work better and leave less residue.</li>
            <li> Great product Loved and I will buy  always</li>
            <li> Love this product it makes your hair feel so soft!  I think biolage has many great prodcuts and the spary shipped quite fast.</li>
            <li> It helps to manage my hair in style without fussy with it.  It is cheaper to get it through than beauty salon.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used on my hair, leaves it smooth, no frizz and shiny. Would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> -- doesn&#x27;t weigh down even naturally oily hair.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ll use.  It protects really well during summer months too!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It really gives a new life to your hair. I originally bought this product from my hairstylist but we moved and I had to find another place to purchase from. The best price was on Amazon which is great because we are always ordering from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually spray in the Hydra-Seal right after I wash my hair and use my fingers to comb it throughout. I don&#x27;t usually blow dry my hair but if I do I always add this spray first and dry on cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle of this spray will last me about a year. I have hair that goes past my shoulders and is quite thick. I usually only use one or two sprays and that is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell I love this product and will continue to order it.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this product though is that the pump sprays out a lot at a time and sometimes it can spray in more of a line than in a mist. It all has to do with the pressure so be careful with that.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair feel like silk. I also use other products. This is the one I use as a finisher and touch up. It leaves me hair feeling soft, silky, and not product build uped.</li>
            <li> I actually spray it into my hand, rub them together, then into my hair. Saves on product as well! It doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy look, as most &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; sprays do. Very subtle spray, for my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.  My hair is so soft and shiny and manageable. I was sick when my salon quit carrying the line. I was so happy to find Amazon.com had it.</li>
            <li> I wish this stuff had worked for me, I usually have good experiences with Biolage products.  However, this spray felt nice as long as my hair was still wet but after it dried it was awful. My hair felt like it had a fine coating of glue on it. It also made my hair tangle more and made it look more coarse. It didn&#x27;t even do anything for the frizz in my hair! I tried it again several times both air drying and blow drying with no change. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product...It works...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and I received it very quickly. When I opened the package I realized it had been smashed by the</li>
            <li> This is really a great product. Really helps to soften hair. Spray on after washing and towel dried hair. Nice scent.</li>
            <li> I bought my original bottle from a hair salon and it was really impressive but what they sent me was not the same product. It was in the same bottle but didn&#x27;t have the same results  on my hair ad the original I purchased. My hair is the same and the texture  will always remain the same! No telling what they put in that bottle they sent me.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff no matter how little or how much I used my hair felt coated and oily. It may be because I have a fine texture to my hair and I&#x27;m not used to real true texture. I gave this to a friend and she really liked it. I do not recall the smell but most of these products have the typical Biolage  smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this right before I went on vaction so I decided to take it with me. I have thick, course and dry. It works great after the pool and sun exposure. The reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Liked the product alot. Unfortunately quantity is not worth the price in my opinion. Usually a big fan of biolage products.</li>
            <li> I am always very skeptical of products claiming to make your hair smooth and soft, I have straight color treated hair and recently my hairdresser really dried it out bad,  but this product does make it soft and health, I love it.

            <li> I have long hair, and work out a lot, so I have to be careful when washing/combing it out.  I use another detangler, but I decided to try this for more shine.

I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; to add shine and control, but none of them have done the trick this does.  I&#x27;ve used this on my hair wet and dry.  Love it.  But just keep in mind, it sprays, and you don&#x27;t want to hold it too close or you will get too much in one place.  Just squirt it, and rub it down your hair strands to blend it.  My hair is so soft &amp; shiny...but not overkill or greasy looking at all.  I&#x27;m going to def order more.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and it made my hair shiny and soft. A little bit goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> This spray is awesome it makes hair smell amazing and super soft. The only negative i guess would be if you put too much in hair can look greasy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. If your looking for the fly away hair, this is it. The best way to use it of any race, is once u wash your hair then blow dry. leave the hair damp just a little then spray the hair with biolage, finish blow drying. Style as usual, ur hair will blow in the wind.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of this I wanted to try something different so I bought some after the party by beadhead. After trying out a couple of times I went back and bought another bottle of this product. I have thick curly hair and when I spray it on after the shower and sleep overnight, the next morning it&#x27;s so soft and bouncy and non-frizzy. Nothing else that I have tried give me that result</li>
            <li> This is a product that was first put on my hair by my stylist. As someone whose hair doesn&#x27;t allow for a lot of conditioning (it gets greasy and weighed down) this is perfect. It makes your hair baby soft and light. It&#x27;s become my go-to product.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice and leaves my hair feeling soft with a beautiful, healthy sheen.  Also helps with fly-always during the humid months.</li>
