            <li>Love site!</li>
            <li>Nice sampler.</li>
            <li>I love Estee Lauder and was very happy with the company seem to have shipped fast got it on time and was pleased</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for your purse, and because each perfume has it&#x27;s own box I was able to get two sets (one complete one for my mom, and another that I split among my sisters and aunts) to get all my shopping done.</li>
            <li>Easy way to track package!</li>
            <li>fortunately the others are pretty good!</li>
            <li>like the pleasures exotic, bloom, and delight.</li>
            <li>way she can choose the one she likes best and order a larger quantity!</li>
            <li>Like them all except the exotic.</li>
            <li>The exotic smells like bug spray.</li>
            <li>My mother and I go shopping for perfume every Christmas, and these were always our favorite.</li>
            <li>My wife will really enjoy being able to try her favorite fragrances!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Pleasures and have been wanting to try the new scents.  </li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t have to carry a huge bottle around.</li>
            <li>These 5 mini perfumes smell fantastic</li>
            <li>This set is great as a gift either as a set or individually.</li>
            <li>I love Estee Lauder Pleasures and thought this purchase would be great to try the other Pleasures products without getting 1 or 1.7oz bottles in the event I did not like them.</li>
            <li>I like some of the version of Pleasures, but I still prefer the original Pleasures.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great pack, and I highly recommend it, but I&#x27;d suggest going to a Macy&#x27;s or perfume shop and make sure that you actually like the Pleasure&#x27;s Collection first!</li>
            <li>They all smell fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Or for personal use, these trial sizes are perfect to check out which scent matches your personal preference .</li>
            <li>They are all fantastic smelling; my husband agrees and his opinion is the one that really counts!</li>
            <li>liked the several samples</li>
            <li>I passed the ones that weren&#x27;t right for me on to friends.</li>
            <li>I liked three, the other two I could have done without</li>
            <li>The fragrances last all day and are lightly scented enough without overwhelming others.</li>
            <li>Nice little set to get an idea of which fragrances will work for you.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to change the name that much.</li>
            <li>The pleasures bloom and intense are my favorites.</li>
            <li>i must say though that for some reason i expected it to be bigger but still love it!</li>
            <li>Always love Estee Lauder and these little bottles will do well for Christmas</li>
            <li>for a new one they have brought out.  </li>
            <li>Thus, these made the perfect gift, and were much less expensive than getting them from anywhere else.</li>
            <li>no less.</li>
            <li>This gave me the ability to experience all the different ones at a price I can definitely live with.</li>

            <li> It introduced me to other varieties of estee lauder pleasures.</li>
            <li> I truly recommend purchasing these small size before purchasing a larger bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> However, you can&#x27;t find these varieties in the stores anymore, and getting them online is surprisingly difficult.</li>

            <li> I have always loved estee lauder scents. so i was happy when i found miniature bottles so i didn&#x27;t have to carry a huge bottle around. It introduced me to other varieties of estee lauder pleasures. like the pleasures exotic, bloom, and delight. it fits into any clutch. i must say though that for some reason i expected it to be bigger but still love it!</li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder Pleasures and thought this purchase would be great to try the other Pleasures products without getting 1 or 1.7oz bottles in the event I did not like them.

            <li> Estée Lauder for Monday thru Friday, for me ! Slightly different but Pleasure no less. I mind washing these off . I recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder and was very happy with the company seem to have shipped fast got it on time and was pleased</li>
            <li> My wife will really enjoy being able to try her favorite fragrances!&lt;br /&gt;This way she can choose the one she likes best and order a larger quantity!</li>
            <li> This is the best way to find out which of the scents you like best and to differentiate between the varieties.  I&#x27;m not a fan of a recent trend in scents of taking an already known name and tacking on additions like &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; etc. for a new one they have brought out.  I guess it helps with the marketing.  You don&#x27;t have to change the name that much.</li>
            <li> Like them all except the exotic. The exotic smells like bug spray. The pleasures bloom and intense are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I like some of the version of Pleasures, but I still prefer the original Pleasures.</li>

            <li> Love the variety!  Easy way to track package! Love site!</li>
            <li> What I received was not what&#x27;s pictured. Only two of the fragrances were Pleasures. Amazon customer service took care of it, but beware of the substitution.</li>
            <li> one of these five little ones leaked out .. maybe during delivery or in storage,, so I only got 4 .. fortunately the others are pretty good!</li>
            <li> i just love these, the sizes are perfect for me</li>

            <li> These are the perfect size bottles to carry with me in my purse, my car and my locker at work. This is also a cheaper way to test out all 5 of the different pleasures scents. Great deal!</li>
            <li> This was a great deal. I was very happy with the item and it came just as described. The person I gave it too for their birthday loved it. Very good quality items.</li>
