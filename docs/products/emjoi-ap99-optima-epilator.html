            <li>But for arms and legs - it&#x27;s perfect!   </li>
            <li>I was VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS</li>
            <li>The Optima Epilator has been the best in removing hair than any of the ones I have used before.</li>

            <li>I did this Thursday night and on Monday afternoon (today) its still great!  </li>

            <li>I do not need the shaver afterwards because it is excellent!</li>

            <li>Very effective!  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>Great lady&#x27;s shaver, the best I ever had.</li>
            <li>&quot; It was incredible.</li>
            <li>I would of been happier with a good electric razor for the money!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>COME IN A BEAUTIFUL CASE.AND</li>
            <li>If you can tolerate the pain go for it because it does work beautifully.</li>
            <li>It works great on underarms.</li>
            <li>Over all I am happy with my choice.</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m so happy that i invested in this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this Emjoi for about 3 months now and am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It works great though.  </li>
            <li>it is great</li>
            <li>my pain tolerance is not all that great.  </li>
            <li>This product works great</li>
            <li>This was a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it works.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m extremely happy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really happy with this.  </li>
            <li>I think its great for someone, like myself, who has never used one before.  </li>
            <li>They work great when they work.</li>
            <li>and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>and you will have a great product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great product that does everything its supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Emjoi is a great epilator</li>
            <li>I have tried these types of products before, and have never been happy with them.</li>
            <li>The OPTIMA is great.  </li>
            <li>(you probably shouldnt do that, either, lol.)    </li>
            <li>This is a great hair remover.  </li>
            <li>However, I soon learned that shorter/trimmed hair diminishes the pain factor a great deal.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be happy you kept at it.&lt;br /&gt;-Ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>This is a great product which reduces the need to shave to once a week.</li>
            <li>It worked great on my arms and under arms.</li>
            <li>because I got great results on my arms.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to use this just for your legs - great.  </li>
            <li>So I would say great for legs</li>
            <li>A great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li>To add to the positives, the AP99 comes in a great pro looking carry case, and includes a Remington-Style shave attachment.</li>
            <li>and i was happy with the outcome</li>
            <li>This product also works great on the bikini line.  </li>
            <li>Results, great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend it anybody who is spending more than 30 dollars per visit to a beautician and needs to go atleast twice a month!!</li>
            <li>its very effective and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>the emjoi removed the hair from my legs very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I can say I own just about EVERY hair removal product out, and this is my all time FAV!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Tea Tree Soap and a good lotion after the shower helps the pain subside greatly as well.</li>
            <li>This is also an environmentally friendly product, as there&#x27;s nothing to throw away!!!</li>
            <li>works great on the top of my feet too for sandals!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and in my opinion it works the best on fine hair.</li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>a good addition.    </li>
            <li>Why change a good thing?</li>
            <li>Hope this helps, and good luck to you.</li>
            <li>I recommended this shaver to my friend, and she purchased the cordless version, not as good as it does not seem to have the power of the corded version.</li>
            <li>This shaver is really good for about one year.  </li>
            <li>Good choice for an epilator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s particularly good for underarms - for decades</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that this unit is not cordless, although it is a good length.</li>
            <li>And the hair \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; for a good couple of weeks without having to remove it again...</li>
            <li>However, it has worked really good for all of this time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pain tolerance is fairly good.</li>
            <li>Waxing never sounded so good.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I have had my Emjoi for over two years now, and it still does a good job for me.</li>
            <li>For me good products meant forty to fifty bucks every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>good items to have</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good alternative to shaving.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would make a good all-in-one.</li>
            <li>The design is really nice, and the set includes a shaver head, so my boyfriend liked this thing too!   </li>
            <li>a good tip is to use the Emjoi, then take a good warm shower.  </li>
            <li>However, I found a good angle to use it in about 20 mins of struggling and now I love it!</li>
            <li>It comes in a very pretty case, which makes it a perfect gift.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator after using an Epilady for a couple of years (off and on), and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>After doing my legs, I did my armpits - very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did try it.  </li>
            <li>i am in love with it and am noticing I am wearing shorts and skirts more often because I don&#x27;t have to wait!!</li>
            <li>It takes quite a while to do a good job -- you will have to make many passes over your legs in order to do a good job</li>
            <li>I am smooth all over!!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this item!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love my Emjoi!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the Emjoi!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS EPILATOR !</li>
            <li>Although, I still have to use the Emjoi every couple of days - its still a lot better than shaving!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with Amazons customer service!</li>
            <li>and I was really pleased w/ it!</li>
            <li>I use this product every week and love it, my husband loves it too!  </li>
            <li>i am absolutely in love with this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>(Make sure you do both!)</li>
            <li>(And it looks lovely on my bookshelf too!)    </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>it will make it much more pleasant.</li>
            <li>This one works great on the fine hairs without a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li>Size and shape fits comfortably in the hand and helps give maximum angle versatility, power/strength is great</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a way to keep your legs free of hair longer and is cheaper than getting a wax.</li>
            <li>It works great for me but that might be because I enjoy pain.</li>
            <li>THis product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I just find it easier to use my handy no frills tweezer.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this unit is corded, I don&#x27;t lose power like I would with battery operated ones.  </li>
            <li>I will say I tried this on my bikini line, I personnally could not get pased the pain, so I purchased a intimate shaver called the e-razor, very great product.</li>
            <li>I liked that I could finish both legs a lot quicker than when I was using my Epilady.  </li>
            <li>I have been waxing my own legs &amp; armpits for a year, so I am used to the feeling of hair being ripped out.</li>
            <li>It pays for itself compared to wax prices (even if you do your own).</li>
            <li>It is indeed the best epilator ever, I had it many years ago and last for many years too, and was very happy with the product and the result...  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews here I felt that I had something to contribute so decided to post my own experience after 3 years of use with this product.     </li>
            <li>but it is still effective in removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>but it sure works good.  </li>
            <li>Also I followed advice that others gave; I took a warm shower and exfoliated beforehand.</li>
            <li>I think that it&#x27;s effective,  </li>
            <li>a guy would be allowed to own it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I use it to give myself a full brazil monthly and am mostly happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>The product works great for it&#x27;s purpose, I would love more it if it had a better way to handle-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product to get rid of most of the hair, but if you want that smooth feeling you get when you wax or shave then</li>
            <li>I do not shave because I get cut very easily.  </li>
            <li>love it!    &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>It had the best reviews by far and with a 43% savings, I decided not to pass it by.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best method of body hair-removal I&#x27;ve found (I&#x27;ve tried shaving, waxing, depilitory creams, etc.)  </li>
            <li>Have friends who have used this product for years and sung it&#x27;s praises -- it was all true!!   </li>
            <li>Ingrown hairs were the only problem I experienced, but I found a great solution to that problem..</li>
            <li>I had the original Emjoi for many years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I would say it got 85 percent of the hair which for me was a tremendous improvement!!</li>
            <li>The results on my legs and underarms was very smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Most of these reviews are by people who&#x27;ve just opened the box.  </li>
            <li>Sexy on a guy.  </li>
            <li>I still fought problem 1 for a couple years more; but it was getting better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, I would either break out which made it more noticable or it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>did it again and then once more.</li>
            <li>In my case I think  it is a worthwhile buy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping that with more uses the pain will lessen with each hair removal process.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made me feel a lot better about my arms, and now i can wear t-shirts without being so self-concious :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have continued to replace it over many years.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came in a zipped pouch like most of the others do.</li>
            <li>But overall, I am very happy wiht the way it performs.</li>
            <li>Also waxing doesn&#x27;t work if hair is short and while I&#x27;m waiting for it to grow, my legs don&#x27;t look their best.    </li>
            <li>If not then you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li>If you want to buy it, buy this one for sure and you will never regret your decision.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure will work for you too.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m learning how to make it work better.  </li>
            <li>Again, I believe a change in technique might help produce a better result.</li>
            <li>I was able to tolerate it.</li>
            <li>: let your hair grow out a bit to make sure you get all of it, it pulls it from the root.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>again - LOVE it -</li>
            <li>After they&#x27;re cut though, the hairs get pulled out much more</li>
            <li>One thing that I love about the Emjoi epilators is that their tweezers are metal.  </li>
            <li>My only wish is that I could find a company that incorporates the best of many brands.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad with my decision.  </li>
            <li>and the more I use it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing my best to get my teenage daughter to use it, to save her from all the hassless.  </li>
            <li>I find the size and shape refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with changeable heads</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about 18 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>so she asked me to give it to her, so I gladly obliged.  </li>
            <li>I have not gotten any ingrown hair, I&#x27;m sure because I listened to all of the greats posts on this forum suggesting exfoliation, with a loofa, or salt scrub, or Glycolic acid lotions.  </li>
            <li>The Gently Gold works great, but I prefer this newer model.</li>
            <li>I love having the interchangeable shave head, too.</li>
            <li>But that being said, when I was done my legs were smooth!</li>
            <li>Optima epilator cuts more than it removes hairs.</li>
            <li>Ordered this and love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this.</li>
            <li>I would say waxing does hurt more than this product, though not pain-free.</li>
            <li>The two headed shaver is great, it&#x27;s fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that I will.</li>
            <li>It removes hair better than waxing..with the convenience of shaving.  </li>
            <li>but I think most folks could hang with it).  </li>
            <li>Not as good as wax, but worth the trade off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a cordless version, but the battery would run out before I finish shaving my legs from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li>the more I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely in love with it--it works so much better than the Optima</li>
            <li>I would continue using it if the product was more durable and perhaps faster.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>They have a better reputation.  </li>
            <li>I then skipped two days to see what it would be like with more growth, and it didn&#x27;t hurt more then before.</li>
            <li>i love that even when the hair starts to grow in it is not as prickly as with shaving.</li>
            <li>it works better than my braun.</li>
            <li>That aside I will continue to use until I find a better product.  </li>
            <li>I read what the users of the product had to say and then decided to give epilation one more shot.</li>
            <li>I do remain hairless for as many as 4 to 5 days at a time.</li>
            <li>If you are on the fence about it, take it from me, buy this product and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I love my epilator.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it does hurt, but not any more than waxing.  </li>
            <li>Even when I have more hair it works.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe to use.     </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure everybody knows that already.)</li>
            <li>It makes you feel better.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it does not hurt and it grabs all of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>So over all, I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>it does hurt more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- entertaining if you&#x27;re bored&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>no matter how many times you use it, the pain does not go away</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have read many of the reviews but none specifically mention the chin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product b/c it gets rid of underarm hair, and the regrowth is often finer and easier to get rid of.</li>
            <li>(In fact, the shorter the hair, the better).  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M IN LOVE.  </li>
            <li>I have been using epilators for many years</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried a epilator in many years you need to try it again.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It has been more than a year</li>
            <li>couple more times to see if that stops.</li>
            <li>More like plucking?</li>
            <li>and I was 100% hair free!  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a razor just didn&#x27;t remove all the hairs and the more I tried to shave it the more the bumps would appear from shaving.</li>
            <li>Actually, I kind of enjoy making him squirm.</li>
            <li>- you had better have some time to devote when you use this product.</li>
            <li>the end, I do still use it and it is better than the Braun I bought in between the two, but I wish I had the Gold Caress instead.  </li>
            <li>However, after receiving this product, I am glad I switched.  </li>
            <li>This product performs outstanding and the curved head is a plus.  </li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer and have recommended this product to others.</li>
            <li>I was so confident went to my underarm.  </li>
            <li>It for the most part removes the hair at the root.</li>
            <li>I plan on using it for many more years.</li>
            <li>, they just know you look better.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>MUCH better than waxing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a replacement with a better design.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I also LOVE the shaver attachment.</li>
            <li>will to do it&#x27;s magic -</li>
            <li>I love this product and recomend it for men also.</li>
            <li>Like most of them you can&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>It really works great.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get this product with all the tweezers.  </li>
            <li>It got virtually all of the hair (the Light Caress frequently misses hairs) and cut the time by about 1/3, which is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the razor part yet, but am sure I will like it.    </li>
            <li>I love this product, I already have an epliator</li>
            <li>Well, once I built up the courage to try it (on my legs first) I was SOLD!!!</li>
            <li>But when It arrived and I tried it for the first time, it didn&#x27;t hurt?!?!?!</li>
            <li>About epilators in general, it&#x27;s the best method I found to keep my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>There are no replacement parts or service programs that I am aware of that do a good job.</li>
            <li>Well, I decided that using a heating pad on the area should work pretty good.  </li>
            <li>But its well worth it!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>It is quick with amazing results.</li>
            <li>The heads pop out very easily, so this is the easiest to clean of any epilators I have used.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>It grabs more hairs the first time you pass over them and pulls them out more effectively.</li>
            <li>Like waxing, over the years your hair may gradually get more fine (mine did).  </li>
            <li>good on large areas</li>
            <li>I bought this because I liked emjoi&#x27;s older eplilator products, which I used to own.</li>
            <li>Oh, and if you do the bikini area, make sure you watch what you&#x27;re doing, the head is huge on this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most comfortable model model of the two.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to take a warm bath/shower before to open up the pores so you don&#x27;t feel the yanking as much.</li>
            <li>and it helps keep me from sweating and it helps the tweezers head move more smoothly along my skin.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, every time I used this product I would also have to shave the areas that the epilator missed.</li>
            <li>Again, the product may be a good one, maybe it is supposed to hurt this much.</li>
            <li>This product really works as good as it says it does.  </li>
            <li>This does do a good, fast job of removing hair but has a couple of drawbacks: &lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have any kind of grip problems, or large hands, I can&#x27;t imagine you would be able to use this.  </li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;ve been using an Emjoi for so many years, I do not experience any significant pain.  </li>
            <li>Such a good investment!</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator in years, and I love it!</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T use it on hair that is full length!</li>
            <li>I have used the exact epilator for 7 years before it  broke, I am very pleased with my purchase, for 60.00 I will be hair free for another 7 years.</li>
            <li>I found the shape easy to hold, but the power cord does get in the way sometimes.  </li>
            <li>The directions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>The shape is easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>this product was everything that i hoped it would be so thank you for the swift and easy transaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Quick, easy, and lasts longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>This epilator glides against your skin; it is as easy as shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to be pegged as a metrosexual</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy,</li>
            <li>Strong Buy</li>
            <li>On top of that, it is far more effective.</li>
            <li>It is not painful, the feeling is more like the \\&quot;pins and</li>
            <li>And its easy to use and removes most hair quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Now they are really fine and not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>It works just fine</li>
            <li>It was working fine for a bit, but then began to run slower and slower with each use.  </li>
            <li>It was working fine for a bit, but then began to run slower and slower with each use.  </li>
            <li>it worked fine for three years until I had to replace it with another emjoi.  </li>
            <li>It works fine at the moment</li>
            <li>I have used it on my under arm area without the  skin getting caught, works fine.  </li>
            <li>Laser works best on light skin with dark hair.  </li>
            <li>It is not for fine hair.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>so I have baby fine regrowth.  </li>
            <li>the epilator doesn&#x27;t pick up fine hair - if it does, it just rips it.</li>
            <li>but once you get used to it its fine.  </li>
            <li>For the people who are worried that it will hurt, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>so I had fine hair</li>
            <li>Ok, as a woman that has never waxed nor used an epilator before, the first time I used this was one of the most excruciating experiences ever.</li>
            <li>Today, I epilated, then quickly finished off with a shave, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the smoothest my legs have ever been.</li>
            <li>and I was amazed at how quickly and efficiently this thing pulled the hair from underneath the skin!</li>
            <li>But what i really love about it is that it removes all the hairs and quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the wet/dry option of some epilators and the cordless ability, but the Optima has the best curves to get into tight places.</li>
            <li>Huge mistake.   </li>
            <li>I see a huge difference after 4-5 uses over a 2 month period.  </li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t cause as much discomfort to the skin of my underarms as the Light Caress did, which was also nice.    </li>
            <li>Make sure to match the power units when purchasing; it uses a rare amperage.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I finally got the nerve to spend the money.</li>
            <li>I can never grip it comfortably.</li>
            <li>AP99 IS FANTASTIC HAVE 2 HEAD ONE FOR LEGS</li>
            <li>I gave it only four stars because the shape is not all that great.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great purchase.</li>
            <li>(hair free) legs, bikini and underarms.</li>
            <li>My arms are silky smooth and stay that way even when the hair grows in.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s no point to going through all of this if you can&#x27;t then slide your hand along your leg and have it be smooth.</li>
            <li>my underarms and legs are soooooo smooth.</li>
            <li>I got it a week ago and my legs are still smooth.  </li>
            <li>I used it 2 weeks ago and still am stubble free.  </li>
            <li>(I admit I had a glass or two of wine before doing it the second time lol)</li>
            <li>My legs are soooo smooth.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi products truly are cheap.</li>
            <li>I use the epilator and the leg hair has thinned and is easier to maintain a smooth touch.</li>
            <li>I can go about 3 days with perfectly smooth legs, and about day 4 I begin to feel stub.</li>
            <li>A few days growth after shaving is best.</li>
            <li>I have not been brave enough to use it on my armpits</li>
            <li>hair free</li>
            <li>your legs look great, hair grows back finer, and no nicks, scrapes of cuts!</li>
            <li>on- a bunch of metal tweezers making a hideous sound.  </li>
            <li>Works great all this time later.</li>
            <li>If you want totally smooth legs, this product is NOT for you.</li>
            <li>Although this was efficient, I didn&#x27;t get the smooth feeling you get when you wax or shave.</li>
            <li>My legs and underarms are smooth and the shaver feature keeps my bikini area</li>
            <li>(Free shipping too.)</li>
            <li>I think today I&#x27;ve experienced enough.  </li>
            <li>Optima doesn&#x27;t fit well in my hand and the cord often comes out while I&#x27;m using it on my legs since my hand is brushing up against the spot where the cord is attached to the epilator</li>
            <li>It fit well in my hand and because it is cordless</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to the person who does not have time, space, or energy for the self-waxing production and has tried everything else to get smooth legs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a wonderful quarter of a century not to have to shave everyday....</li>
            <li>I like the Emjoi Light Caress</li>
            <li>It feels closer to being flayed alive than a \\&quot;tingle.\\&quot; The good news,</li>
            <li>My first experience on the legs was pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to others that I have tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>I love the product line, wore out my former Gold Touch epilator in the course of 8 years and hoped this model would be just as good.  </li>
            <li>I love this machine and can&#x27;t say enough good about it.  </li>
            <li>Just received my new Emjoi Optima and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>If you can stand the pain it does pull those hairs right out, if not try somthing you will enjoy for awhile!</li>
            <li>But my husband put the tweezing section right up to the palm of his hand to show me it was perfectly safe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other epilators and find this the best and worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After much care and cleaning, I am happy to report that the epilator now runs like new!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective for underarm and facial hair removal.</li>
            <li>The Optima is powerful, easy to clean, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about the job this product does - it pulls the hair from the root quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>However, after about a month and half of continued use, I can happily say that I am absolutely in love with this thing.</li>
            <li>I had been using my original Emjoi</li>
            <li>I agree with most reviews, it does hurt at first.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>(and if you&#x27;re creative like me, a whole lotta expletives as well!)  </li>
            <li>This is worth the cost because it will save you time!</li>
            <li>I have owned a variety of these products over the past 20 years and this is the best.  </li>
            <li>you may love it at first</li>
            <li>Here was my original review 6 months ago:    </li>
            <li>For the most part it does exactly what I need it to do......</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of the Emjoi line and of epilators in gen&#x27;l, so .. if you don&#x27;t mind the mild pain (in time, you do get used to it)</li>
            <li>The price was most reasonable, the performance is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>so you can clean up any hairs that you decided</li>
            <li>That makes it easier to clean the unit because the cord doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
            <li>That makes it easier to clean the unit because the cord doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re gonna try it on your underarms, which are more sensitive, it is definitely safe to touch it with your finger.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews before buying this product and there wasn&#x27;t many out there about sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The brush they give you to clean it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>love the fact that the whole thing is super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Ok it was not the most wonderful experience but really waxing is worse.</li>
            <li>Waxing is too costly for large areas, more pain to wallet than me.  </li>
            <li>It is more of a quick tugging kind of sensation, much like what you would have with tweezing only it does more hairs at one time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to get a good comfortable grip without fear of catching your fingertips in it.</li>
            <li>I cant say enough on how good this thing is, and im not exxagerating</li>
            <li>I love the cordless one and the travel size one so much.</li>
            <li>This Optima one is so much faster, but that cord is uninspiring after you&#x27;ve been cord-free for so many years.</li>
            <li>Not painful for me</li>
            <li>This is a good product, sturdily made, that will last for years.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought one for my daughter and my sister.  </li>
            <li>What doesn&#x27;t even get done satisfactorily in 45 mins of electrolysis is done in 15 minutes with the Enjoi...and the pain subsides much quicker, and the skin is a LOT more smoother.</li>
            <li>But after I used it only twice, I loved the difference that I felt.  </li>
            <li>It took me a full week to get the courage to try it on myself.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li>The emjoi is the only thing i used to remove leg and underarm hair, so i&#x27;d say 3 years is a good lifespan.     </li>
            <li>I have graduated to the bikini &amp; underarms and its not painful at all.  </li>
            <li>A friend recommended the Epilady Optima, and life is back to good.</li>
            <li>This may work out better for womens legs because their legs are used to being shaved so the skin is much tougher.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It is far from painless, but it is also effective and quick.  </li>
            <li>Even underarms are easy now, and fast!  </li>
            <li>The other reviews are true in regards to the pain lessening over time and the shaver attachment is great for underarms.</li>
            <li>It was simple, easy, and it did not hurt !!</li>
            <li>Compared to other epilators, this one is great at removing hair.  </li>
            <li>I was super suprised to find that it got all the hair on my face.</li>
            <li>and after about a minute of holding this my hand was cramping up in pain - it was the same pain I experienced after writing by hand for about 3 hours straight.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m able to do my legs and much more in the same amount of time.  </li>
            <li>that can be quickly gotten used to.  </li>
            <li>Two wheels of fast-spinning tweezer blades is super intimidating.</li>
            <li>It worked just the way I thought it would, and I used it nearly twice a week because I felt more comfortable</li>
            <li>really quick</li>
            <li>I did investigate the different epilators and this one rated as one of the best, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li>I received it in a quick and efficient manner with no problems what so ever.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with this unit I purchased another, smaller size for my upper lip.</li>
            <li>But, for quick, do it yourself hair removal, I still recommend it.</li>
            <li>I noticed that this epilator was the one with the most high reviews</li>
            <li>I used to own an, Epilady, the coiled hair remover; I bought it brand new when they first came out.  </li>
            <li>I had 2 days worth of growth and it ripped the hair out right from the roots, shaft and all!  </li>
            <li>I am very thrilled with the Optima Epilator, ans compared to the prices of other shavers I looked at ....</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life my skin looks and feels smooth..</li>
            <li>i had an other emjoi epilator, but this one is more effective</li>
            <li>This is my very first epilator</li>
            <li>The very first day I did this</li>
            <li>I hope it doesn&#x27;t break down as some folks experienced.    </li>
            <li>Forget the splashy ads that tell you that their product works under water (it doesn&#x27;t, I own it), or a spring works (it doesn&#x27;t, I own it), or a sanding disk works (it doesn&#x27;t, I own it, and you don&#x27;t want to see my legs after that fiasco!), or a green gel from Down</li>
            <li>I used to have an Emjoi that was battery powered, and that ended up lasting 3 years which I think is pretty good for the price.  </li>
            <li>thanks emjoi!!</li>
            <li>I use this to remove the hair from my Italian arms and love it for that!</li>
            <li>I used it for awhile, it removed the hair on my legs pretty well, but, OUCH!  </li>
            <li>I will say that the first time I used the Emjoi, IT HURT!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, the first time you use it, it kills!</li>
            <li>So if you do experience a lot of pain during the first time...don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li>First time user, just can&#x27;t stand the pain!</li>
            <li>On my first try, I did my legs AND my bikini line!</li>
            <li>If I was brave enough to try my bikini line on the first day AFTER doing my legs, that should tell you something, haha.     </li>
            <li>Combined with the right clothes,  and some mild working out</li>
            <li>First of all, I started getting ingrown hairs that were an extreme annoyance and didn&#x27;t look attractive.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a light, but I don&#x27;t really care about that.  </li>
            <li>It looks and sounds very scary/intimidating, but it is really a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have had many different types of epilators before from rubber band types to coiled metal springs, none of them ever pulled out much hair and the i ended up just tweezing most of them anyways.</li>
            <li>This one, with its spinning motors in diff directions, actually got stuck and broke (after a bit more than a year, when I was totally hooked on its superior speed and efficiency).</li>
            <li>Hurts like #$$%^ Worth the pain.</li>
            <li>But 2 weeks, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>She claims the pain is minimal and 10 years out of this product seems like a good deal.</li>
            <li>, tweezer heads can be used at various angles and still epliate effectively.  </li>
            <li>but the outcome is worth it...</li>
            <li>There is a reason that manufacturers offer seemingly nice discount coupons, and the Emjoi reason is that their products just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>, it was okay, but it took awhile to completely remove all of the hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li>It hurts to use, but the results are completely worth it.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth it comes in a neat case for the unit and the attachments.</li>
            <li>And the service was good, the packaging and arrival date was as expected.</li>
            <li>but sooo worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the dough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be nice to have a cordless option, but it&#x27;s not a big deal for me.  </li>
            <li>If you are doing your full legs for the first time expect a couple of hours worth of work.</li>
            <li>I have been using hair removal systems for a few years, and this one is by far the best out there.  </li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t get that \\&quot;freshly shaved\\&quot; feeling for a while.</li>
            <li>To describe the pain, it kind of felt like my legs were getting rug burned, but withut the lasting pain.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>If you think you can handle the pain and discomfort, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, your underarm skin is much more sensitive.</li>
            <li>but after time it won&#x27;t be worth the money.    </li>
            <li>The only thing that would be an improvement would be a travel bag instead of the nice box in comes in.</li>
            <li>AND THAT THE PAIN WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>I am a 24 year old male in great shape(just</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>especially if there&#x27;s no outlet handy.  </li>
            <li>Still, the time saved was worth it.  </li>
            <li>took all hair off it hurt but its worth it.</li>
            <li>I use an old toothbrush instead with better results.</li>
            <li>If nothing else it is a fun toy, my family calls it the &amp;#34;toture machine&amp;#34; and we sneak up on eachother and pull thier hair out...</li>
            <li>This definitely seems like a well-timed flaw to me, and I will not be purchasing another Emjoi product./&gt;After much care and cleaning, I am happy to report that the epilator now runs like new!  </li>
            <li>I have owned other epilators before, and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, epilators work best when hair is short</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t shaved an area recently, do a quick shave over it first to minimize the pain.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product, since its so fast and has two times the coils, it gets the job done much quicker than my old epilator.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair make sure to put it in a ponytail before you begin, that is if you want to keep the hair you have on your head!</li>
            <li>right after I threw away the Optima...</li>
            <li>I will admit that the reviews before about the pain were right.  </li>
            <li>I searched online for th right hair removal product for me, and chose epilation.</li>
            <li>Gotta get used to it, since you already bought it, right.     </li>
            <li>If you try to put it on right after removing your hair, its going to sting A LOT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like shaving right?  </li>
            <li>And for the first few months, it was great.</li>
            <li>after reading the many other awesome reviews posted here, especially the person who said it worked well on thick  body hair better than all the others; I decided this was the one!</li>
            <li>I bought the Optima with the hopes that  the dual head would work better and be more efficient than my previous one</li>
            <li>If I used it more often, I am sure that after some time, I could use it even less than 1X per week.</li>
            <li>Just make sure u clean between tweezers when u see build of dead skin, so easy</li>
            <li>love the fact that this has so many tweezer heads as my old one only had two</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product I had 3 weeks worth of growth on my legs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I would use this on my bikini area, but it works great on legs.</li>
            <li>I found that the optima generally broke off the hair on my legs more often than it removed it from the root.</li>
            <li>I have thicker hair on my lower legs and very fine hair on my knees and upper legs.</li>
            <li>I just decided to use the epilator again real quick to get a little more growth that has started and it didn&#x27;t even hurt.</li>
            <li>The product removes hair at the root, leaving skin silky smooth for about a week or so until new growth begins.</li>
            <li>what she forgot to tell me was that I don&#x27;t have to wait for the hair to get to a certain length!</li>
            <li>If you have a low tolerance for pain, can&#x27;t pluck your brows without crying, or can&#x27;t even pull a hair on your head, it probably would be best to stick to a razor or nair.  </li>
            <li>The Gently Gold is rechargeable and can be operated without a cord -- a nice feature, but only lasted for about a year.  </li>
            <li>I also decided that the pain of using this wasn&#x27;t worth it as it never got better, even after multiple uses.</li>
            <li>Your hair free baby soft skin is worth the ouch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my epilator for about 2.5 weeks now, so not long, but I already love it.</li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t being very gentle when wrapping the cord).</li>
            <li>There is a key to helping yourself achieve very smooth legs.</li>
            <li>The positive is that this is a dual head system and it is effective at pulling even very short hairs or very course hairs.</li>
            <li>Purchased new one because oldest daughter off to college; original is still working after replacing shaver head 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>BUT there is a HUGE design flaw: the cord plugs in to the side, not the end of the device, which means you really cannot get a decent grip on it.  </li>
            <li>I used a much older epilator and really liked it, but it had seen its last days.  </li>
            <li>The multiple rows of tweezers make the job quick and easy.   </li>
            <li>But from a year of waxing, my hair grows back so thin &amp; fine, that this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I want to find whoever invented this and plant a big HUGE kiss on them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for 8 years.  </li>
            <li>So I shaved first, then used it every day for about a month.  </li>
            <li>Problem number 2 cleared up, first.  </li>
            <li>The power supply will go first.  </li>
            <li>and so it definitely works better than shaving and under the arms</li>
            <li>Stellar product line.  </li>
            <li>I can tell that I&#x27;ve bought only a couple more months...</li>
            <li>I bought my first epilator six years ago.</li>
            <li>since I am pretty used to the sensation, just takes a bit of practice for newbies.  </li>
            <li>Simply Gold for many years</li>
            <li>On top of all of this, it simply doesn&#x27;t remove hair.</li>
            <li>Since then I have purchased several epilators looking for the \\&quot;newest\\&quot; and the \\&quot;best\\&quot; thing as most claim.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it it supposed to do.</li>
            <li>For those first time buyers, yes it will hurt.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it hurts the first 2 to 3 uses</li>
            <li>Hers had finally given up after more than 10 years of use.</li>
            <li>You need to have courage or a margaritta before you do this, becuase it does hurt the first time-</li>
            <li>Though like any tweezing method it can be a lil bothersome at first.</li>
            <li>To top it off, the hair grew back baby-soft.</li>
            <li>First off--the thing works.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, I did not em-joy</li>
            <li>It smarts the first couple of times you use it</li>
            <li>(funny thing</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the performance I got yesterday more than makes up for its short falls.</li>
            <li>I wore out the first one because I used it for years.  </li>
            <li>daily in ORDER TO HAVE SMOOTH LEGS!</li>
            <li>I actually think it may be more reliable as is.  </li>
            <li>It hurts a lot, but that should be expected with any type of epilation, and you get used to it, and the sacrifice to be hair free and smooth is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Only thing better is Laser Hair removal, which I did on underarms and  </li>
            <li>but it really does work once you get brave enough to actually put it onto your skin.</li>
            <li>At first, it would happen maybe once every time I epilated.</li>
            <li>This is my first</li>
            <li>the instructions state to use the epilator after a shower when the pores are more open:  </li>
            <li>It took me about an hour to do my bikini area the first time</li>
            <li>At first there&#x27;s sort of a \\&quot;pinching\\&quot; feeling</li>
            <li>I swear the first day I used this</li>
            <li>I have waxed all my life and being a mother of 4, it is very time consuming and a headache to have to wait for the hair to grow before I wax!</li>
            <li>after the first time, you don&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I then used it every day for the first week, getting those hairs that were slower growing.  </li>
            <li>Even the first time using this product I didn&#x27;t feel any pain.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time two days ago</li>
            <li>I have to admit, the first couple of times it does hurt (it&#x27;s almost like waxing), but you get used to it and the pain goes away.</li>
            <li>Using on underarm for the first time:    </li>
            <li>: Try it on your legs first.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my first experience with Emjoi.</li>
            <li>This product may be exactly what it is supposed to be, however I used it for aproximately 2 minutes and could not stand it any longer.</li>
            <li>Gets the hair on the first couple of passes instead of trying over and over again till you want to scream and DO.  </li>
            <li>Been using removal systems for over 20 years since the first epilady (ouch remember that eeeeek)</li>
            <li>I feel no pain, only smooth legs!</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs when I first recieved it in the mail and</li>
            <li>The first time I epilated it took about an hour.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, it hurt...</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>The first couple times I used it</li>
            <li>My first one died so this is its replacement.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>First, I must say that I am not too fond of the shape and design.</li>
            <li>The first place I used this Emjoi Optima was on my underarms.</li>
            <li>this first episode</li>
            <li>This gives you a better chance of getting the job done faster, and if you&#x27;re doing guy-type hair removal, i.e. arms, chest, back, stomach, etc, you need all the horsepower you can get.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used an epilator and you are interested in trying one - just go for it.</li>
            <li>I find this design more efficient, especially with the underarms.    </li>
            <li>cuz I have a separate epilator for more smaller areas.     </li>
            <li>hurts at first, but then the burn just blends in and you get used to it.</li>
            <li>My old worn out Emjoi did a better job than this brand new Braun.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it not to hurt a little; it hurts a bit more than waxing, but it&#x27;s more than tolerable (I have a high pain tolerance</li>
            <li>really like this product, does a large are or skin at one time and is powerful.  </li>
            <li>This product also comes with a nice case to keep the epilator protected from the other items in your bathroom (or wherever you plan to store it).</li>
            <li>If your hair is long, it&#x27;s better to shave it first and wait for two days before trying this product.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that the first time you use the Emjoi, it hurts a whole lot, but using it afterwards is nothing (when compared to the first time).</li>
            <li>A good product overall, but didn&#x27;t like the following things about the product:  </li>
            <li>It works best if the hair isn&#x27;t too long (usually a day or two after shaving).  </li>
            <li>I purchased a different model from the same manufacturer but it is not as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Since I have dark hair after shaving with razors the hair below the skin shows through the top layers of skin making a dark appearance, whlie this item leaves my pits looking clean!!!</li>
            <li>Its extremely easy to clean, and comes with a fun little carrying case.  </li>
            <li>I expected to only use it on my legs but found it very effective for underarm and bikini line also.</li>
            <li>I found the first time I used it the dual heads were too much</li>
            <li>The exfoliation pad really does wonders for me, and the shaving attachment works quite well on my arm pits (shaved them first, and</li>
            <li>The exfoliation pad really does wonders for me, and the shaving attachment works quite well on my arm pits (shaved them first, and</li>
            <li>pain of the first two or three times is intense.</li>
            <li>At first I was very nervous about epilating.</li>
            <li>The rotating blades were very intimidating at first</li>
            <li>I would really appreciate a response, Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I first tried it - it REALLY hurted, but when I finished with both hands and feet - pain went away at all, and I started to search, where else could I use it.   </li>
            <li>Also, be sure not to have the hair be too long -</li>
            <li>and I find this product to be very easy to use and fast with the new double heads.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to get pinched since the rollers roll inward towards each other.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that when you do decide to take on the task of cleaning it that you are very careful in putting everything back as it was otherwise the tweezers won&#x27;t be able to line up and run properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just make sure that when you do decide to take on the task of cleaning it that you are very careful in putting everything back as it was otherwise the tweezers won&#x27;t be able to line up and run properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I use it on dry skin and then smooth on some lotion and good-bye razors!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve being using Emjoi for the past 7 years and they work great at the beginning but for some reason they start loosing speed until they die completely.</li>
            <li>WOW, it did the job quickly.</li>
            <li>When it heats up it is less effective because the gears no longer grab as well.     </li>
            <li>However it comes with a sensitive skin shaver attachment which is painless and removes unwanted hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I find it easy enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Kudos to Emjoi for making a long lasting superior product.</li>
            <li>The good options for guys are few and far between, even if you&#x27;re brave enough to wade through the pink and purple boxes to try and adapt a womens&#x27; product.  </li>
            <li>I will warn you though, when I got to areas on my leg that had more fat on them, ie., inner thighs it stun a little, as long as you pull you skin taught though, you&#x27;ll be fine!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend the machine, I love it so much, its made my life</li>
            <li>The new one breaks off more hair than it pulls and my hair grows back in stubbly - just like shaving.    </li>
            <li>Want to buy one more as a New Year present for my sis (and her boyfriend)</li>
            <li>a professional wax first and then start using this  -showering and exfoliating and then pulling hairs right after shower  </li>
            <li>This hair remover is great because it removes the hair faster and with less passes over the same area.  </li>
            <li>Free from daily shaving, free from bikini waxes, free from dark underarm shadows, and the list goes on.  </li>
            <li>Once you get a hang of it on the less sensitive side, you would have much more technique to use it on the more sensitive side.    </li>
            <li>so I definitely noticed a huge decrease in time.  </li>
            <li>This product saves so much time.</li>
            <li>I just purchase one separately for about $10 when that happens, rather than replacing the whole unit.  </li>
            <li>I use this product to keep the entire area between my legs hair-free and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really faster as promised.</li>
            <li>Shaving is cheap but the results won&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>- it lasted much longer than one might expect and performed well up until the day it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>but i dont think it hurt that much.  </li>
            <li>it comes with makes the whole process very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>It really hurt, but when it comes to being without hair on my legs, I will put up with just about any discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I really have no compaints.   </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>My epilady didn&#x27;t get them very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Much slower than shaving.</li>
            <li>I was tempted to put the epilator away and never use it again because it did hurt so much.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ask me how I know, though, haha.</li>
            <li>yeah, it really takes the hair off, but</li>
            <li>That seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>That seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>the whole process of touch up takes about 10 minutes and presto.</li>
            <li>It has two heads, so it seems to be twice as fast.  </li>
            <li>Go with the Braun silk epil, it works about as well, and you can get a grip on it, or the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress, which is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>You just need to learn to pull your skin really really taught.</li>
            <li>For that very reason, I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Works really well but hurts.</li>
            <li>I like using the epilators because the hair takes longer to grow in and is much finer over time.  </li>
            <li>A big swallow and 10 minutes later my legs were hair free and smooth.</li>
            <li>Or I would miss a whole section, causing me to have to heat everything up again, get the strips out, etc.  </li>
            <li>I dont have much leg hair.    </li>
            <li>Turn it on and gently touch the running head with your finger.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember when my legs were last this smooth.</li>
            <li>the product got to me in a reasonable fashion.</li>
            <li>the only thing is that i never feel completely smooth.</li>
            <li>You may have some hairs that are stubborn and repetition is necessary; however, It lasts longer than shaving and it has a smooth feeling to it.  </li>
            <li>, it lasts longer than shaving, but not by much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this product and haven&#x27;t ever considered discontinuing use.</li>
            <li>It works fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have that much hair because I had shaved just a couple of days before I decided to use this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand using this thing on my legs because it hurts way too much.</li>
            <li>We only need to use it about once a month to keep him completely smooth.</li>
            <li>I have light-colored, sparse hair, and I really don&#x27;t think it hurts at all to use - -</li>
            <li>and I really wish I&#x27;d just bought another Gold Caress.</li>
            <li>But after about a week (must have forgot how much it hurt) decided to do it agin.</li>
            <li>Much faster.</li>
            <li>And, really its not what I would call \\&quot;pain.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I owned the Emjoi gently gold caress for about a year before upgrading to this model.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone who wants to use this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li>The two rolls of tweezers make for fast removal, but if you don&#x27;t hold the skin really taut</li>
            <li>It took about three days of morning &amp; evening sessions to get nerve back to get job completed, but what smooth results.</li>
            <li>so so so much easier.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I was really thrilled about getting one at the time, but I didn&#x27;t find it practical enough for me to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Guys today have to tread a weird line between looking their best, while still remaining masculine.  </li>
            <li>Overall: Recommended for legs and large areas where skin is taut and easily accessible, do NOT buy this product in hopes of using it on your bikini line-</li>
            <li>It says it right in the description that it pulls the hair directly from the root.  </li>
            <li>So far I still have a \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; of the hair right below the skin</li>
            <li>The shaving attachment is great too, but be careful with the trimmer, it is sharp.</li>
            <li>Cord not that long, and it detaches easily from end of unit.</li>
            <li>Another thing I really like about the Optima is that the rounded edges are exposed more on this epilator than my other ones.  </li>
            <li>If you have used an epilator the initial discomfort will be familiar.</li>
            <li>In other words, when I have had it serviced it does not return in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Optima because my original Emjoi epilator finally quit working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used two different types of epilator products from them before, and I should have known better to buy this one in the first place, because both those others had similar problems.</li>
            <li>It came a day later and and I cannot tell you how excited I</li>
            <li>Trim the bikini line first -  DO NOT use it on full length hair -- I did a few full length hairs</li>
            <li>One of them is much more tolerant to pain than the other.</li>
            <li>IT WORKED BETTER THAN ANY OTHER.</li>
            <li>surprised at these problems as Emjoi usually makes a good product.</li>
            <li>I might add that I noticed that the best results would occur when the product was new, and that it actually seemed to gradually spin more and more slowly over the course of use, until it actually just stopped working just a few months later.  </li>
            <li>If more hair had been removed I might have suffered through but it was clear it would have taken at least an hour or more to complete the process.</li>
            <li>This is a definite timesaver and as long as the results last as long as waxing, I&#x27;ll be very happy!!  </li>
            <li>I had an Epilady epilator back in the 80&#x27;s and that was a true torture device.</li>
            <li>When my Emjoi Gently Gold Caress broke (after years of use - I whole-heartedly give it five stars), I bought this, thinking more expensive means better.  </li>
            <li>What I want to make clear is that you most certainly will feel persistent pain the first few times of use, afterwards your skin will get used to it, hopefully.</li>
            <li>I use it about every 2 weeks, as the hair that grows back is soft and fine.</li>
            <li>It is small, quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost completely painless, but I will note that I&#x27;ve got a pretty high tolerance for pain.  </li>
            <li>The shorter the hair and more times you have used the remover, the less pain you will feel.</li>
            <li>It works even better than Emjoi Gold, gets my legs smoother, with less noticeable grow out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to the one time I got my legs waxed, I feel that the pain was less, and that I could take the pain much better because I was in control of what happened.</li>
            <li>I got it less than a week ago and love it.  </li>
            <li>For me, the more I used it the less it hurt</li>
            <li>For legs and under arms area, I am satisfied with the result, everytime I use it there is lesser pain and lesser hair.</li>
            <li>[ also this kind was recommended by one of the transgender people in an online support group network] and so, being a transgender male [girl&#x27;s emotional spirit inside a physically male shell]who prefers that smooth, \\&quot;feminine-like\\&quot; feeling of having shaved legs, arms, and body; it definitely works even on the thickest hairs.</li>
            <li>Hold your skin taut and use this product frequently to keep your hair short and your legs smooth.</li>
            <li>I actually have no side effects any more (bumpy and red skin after use).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Braun silk-epil the last couple times and since I&#x27;ve had to replace it twice now because it simply stopped working, I thought I would try another product that I hoped would have a better lifespan.</li>
            <li>So here I am again, I&#x27;ve decided to give epilators another try, mainly because the cost of razors, and the awkwardness of shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I was using the Emjoi Gold, which I thought was great, but it was old and tired.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this device for over a year, and haven&#x27;t gotten the ingrown hairs that I got my older epilators.  </li>
            <li>Well, this emjoi is a replacement for my older emjoi, and now I wish I kept the older one.</li>
            <li>my older one used to do,</li>
            <li>This was my main focus.</li>
            <li>I purchased this epilator years ago and preferred this older model than</li>
            <li>I bought this to use mainly on my underarms and legs.</li>
            <li>However given my past experience, I&#x27;m more than willing to overlook the shape and size issue.</li>
            <li>Her last epilator was a different brand, and this performs much better than that one.</li>
            <li>It fits right in the palm of your hand to be held in a cupping manner rather than a traditional razor and most other electric removers.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had success in the bikini area at all, and the underarms are pretty painful, but it&#x27;s great for legs.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did, it made short work of the hair on my legs, 20 minutes on the first try; it hurt some, but now the pain is minimal.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always considered myself someone with a high tolerance for pain...</li>
            <li>On a scale of 1 to 10 it was a high 8. &lt;</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>But I figured since this one was so highly reviewed, by now they would have worked all the kinks out.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and can&#x27;t believe I have not bought one sooner - or why anyone would want to wax again after this.</li>
            <li>it works wonders though, and is highly recommended!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Emjoi AP99 Optima epilator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on my third Emjoi Optima Epilator after my previous two stopped operating properly so obviously I think they&#x27;re great epilators.</li>
            <li>The unit is cost effective, works extremely well, even for a guy like me, and comes in a case that allows me to keep my hair removal discrete and personal.</li>

            <li>I love this little machine.</li>
            <li>and I was sure that little bits of skin would be getting pulled out.</li>
            <li>This model is great too, and the extra blade for long hairs is a plus that the other did not have.  </li>
            <li>The little tweezers pull even the thickest of hair and leaves my legs feeling and looking smooth!  </li>
            <li>My thighs and bikini and one underarm never came back from the first treatment; scared to death I think!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The epilator is a bit bulky, but it just takes some minor manuevering adjustments to your old technique, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>A small amount of discomfort, but not as much as waxing and certainly more convenient... without the mess :-)</li>
            <li>I like how the unit has two rollers, which not only pulls out twice as much hair as compared to other units, but it also gives me a good visual for knowing when I have aligned the head in the correct position.</li>

            <li>With the Optima, I&#x27;m able to pick up the most annoying hairs, all except for the extremely fine ones.      </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get one thing straight here: I am a 22 yr old guy</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to expensive waxing.  </li>
            <li>because it works well, it&#x27;s actually much gentler on the skin in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I bought and it is better than my first (epilady) and third (braun) and even subsequent emjoi epilators.  </li>
            <li>I have more trouble with ingrown hairs than the epilator.  </li>
            <li>You do have to go over your legs quite a few times to get most the hairs</li>
            <li>People weren&#x27;t kidding about the pain, but it really DOES go away after the first or second time you use it!</li>
            <li>The underarm area had me scared because so many people said it was so much more painful than the legs, but I found it felt no worse than razor burn when using it at first.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I would have to shave every day.</li>
            <li>When i use the emjoi on my legs it takes about 2 weeks to grow back, and it doesnt seem to hurt as much on legs the first time.</li>
            <li>I love it because I can do it while sitting in front of the TV, rather than being trapped in the shower with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;-Your</li>
            <li>Waxing normally took me 20 min per underarm</li>
            <li>It does take some time but after a few days most of the hair is gone so it is quicker.</li>
            <li>This is GUARANTEED to happen if you are using any waxing kit from a normal retail store.          </li>
            <li>It is kind of slow nowadays</li>
            <li>Very good product - fast, less painful than Braun, i would even say cute, but it&#x27;s corded and the cord is attached to the side of the epilator</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do my legs with the laser because it was fairly new and the price was too high, also my legs are tan.</li>
            <li>One downside to this model from my previous model is that the Optima is not as adept at grabbing really short hairs</li>
            <li>Is it effective on the coarse black hairs?</li>
            <li>I can actually use it right before walking out the door.</li>
            <li>Well, after about 3 months, I noticed that it was becoming less reliable.</li>
            <li>However, each of my previous two stopped working correctly after about a year and a half, so I highly recommend these epilators with one caveat: expect to receive one to two years of great epilating action but don&#x27;t be surprised when it stops working after that time.</li>
            <li>is great too but a little bit messy)</li>
            <li>Although I have gone on to try other Emjoi models (Emagine, Light Caress), this one remains the undefeated champ for strength and angle flexibility.</li>
            <li>Waxing can work, but you better be using excellent wax and muslin cloth or it is POINTLESS and PAINFUL.</li>
            <li>The only con I can honestly admit to is that it takes a little time as opposed to shaving.  </li>
            <li>it works for about 5 years before I had to buy a new one</li>
            <li>A NEW \\&quot;EMJOI\\&quot; EPILATOR AGAIN</li>
            <li>After owning an Epilady for 5 years, I was hesitant to try a new brand.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps my experience is unique, but I will certainly not buy the Optima again.</li>
            <li>NOW,not only did I get my package in a super fast delivery speed of only two days</li>
            <li>I LOVE this little machine!</li>
            <li>you really have no other hand to hold the skin taut.</li>
            <li>The first time was not pleasant but not terrible.  </li>
            <li>Legs are easy to do and the results last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Wow, how they have changed!</li>
            <li>My first cordless one lasted several years</li>
            <li>so I bought another one exactly the same.</li>
            <li>A must have for busy moms with 5 minutes of shower time!</li>
            <li>I have a low pain tolorance and I have to say that it did hurt ALOT the first 2 times.  </li>
            <li>first time you use thing thing, the only thing coming out of your mouth will probably be AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHH!  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver and will NEVER go back to a wet razor!</li>
            <li>The shaver smoothes the skin by getting rid of the stubble after using the tweezer attachment, so hair removal is COMPLETE!</li>
            <li>and so far, no problems!</li>
            <li>I did bleed and the area was red and inflamed for almost a week after the first time</li>
            <li>or else you&#x27;ll go through the same amount of pain as you did the first time.</li>
            <li>Not the first or second time you use it.</li>
            <li>I am a seasoned waxer and used to wax myself on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I had the red bumps at first</li>
            <li>WHAT PAIN at first, esp on inner thighs,side of waist,underarm,and bikini area.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have owned 2 in the past 5 years.</li>
            <li>As far as pain, yes, it does hurt the first few times you use it but after that its not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>It works OK for underarms, OK for legs and is TOO CLUMSY for anything more delicate \\&quot;down</li>
            <li>Unlike the other reviews, I can&#x27;t say that his back hair has decreased or become more fine with use, but I can say that it works better than any other device we&#x27;ve tried and is much cleaner than sugars and waxes.</li>
            <li>the length that is right for waxing is a bit too long for this IMO.  </li>
            <li>Not a super smooth feel, but</li>
            <li>The next day I did my entire bikini area, I&#x27;m talking full brazilian.</li>
            <li>I had this product for 8 years or so and used it throughout the entire summer each year, it just stopped working not bad for a product that only cost $63.  </li>
            <li>Back to this Epilator - I chose it over the Braun because of mostly positive reviews here</li>
            <li>When I finished, my legs were smooth as if they had been waxed w/o the mess and w/o the hassle of going to a salon.</li>
            <li>though, is that the hair grows back at different rates, so if you use it often, like once a week, it won&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as it did the first time you used it.  </li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re really lucky, you may even have a few little pinpoints of blood where more stubborn hairs used to reside.  </li>
            <li>but it does not work any better than my previous model that only had one head instead of two.  </li>
            <li>the more often you do it, the less hairs that are grown back and the easier the removal.    </li>
            <li>She also had an original single barreled emjoy in the past, and this double barreled one is much better.</li>
            <li>It also has a bigger surface area, so its much quicker than her old one!</li>
            <li>It does hurt a little, not as much as I thought, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>If you do decide to buy one then make sure that you are able to return it for a refund in case it hurts you as badly as it did me.</li>
            <li>After only using it twice for the underarms I find it painless and literally just as fast as shaving with a razor if not faster and no messy shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li>You read this far; so I&#x27;ll reward you with what some may consider TMI:  </li>
            <li>Although my 1st review was basically saying how much it hurt and that after I was finally done removing the hair</li>
            <li>My old Satinelle is still working</li>
            <li>You may find that these areas are not as sensitive as you thought they would be and epilated underarms look smoother than shaved ones.</li>
            <li>Unit is light, though must use heavy plug.  </li>
            <li>The motor action also has a solid feel and sound (rather than hollow, shakey, and rickety like some.)  </li>
            <li>were too sensitive to be removed by the foil shaver head.</li>
            <li>I thought about buying a Braun, but the heads didn&#x27;t look very big, and I don&#x27;t want to be spending so much time removing hair.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t expect that to last though, and I don&#x27;t really care if it doesn&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a  Gently Gold model for about 3 years and will never go back to shaving.</li>
            <li>I thought my old one had stopped working, but it was just the cord that had worn out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to use it for a few days in a row to get 100% smooth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and my skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li>Now I use the epilator once every 8-10 days and my legs no longer feel stubbly, the hair is baby soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never done any waxing before and it was on the sensitive underarm.</li>
            <li>hair doesn&#x27;t grow back that much slower than shaving (after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Prevents ingrown hairs, and reactions to creams and razors to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But it was completely bearable.  </li>
            <li>you can help keep the ingrown hairs at bay by using a natural loofah with some grainy scrub when you shower, as well as using a lotion with alpha-hydroxy in it.  </li>
            <li>I do my forearms completely, and just keep my chest and stomach in check.  </li>
            <li>Once I made a rule and stuck to the emjoi it went away completely.  </li>
            <li>Word of advice: If you have a very low pain tolerance (i.e. waxing is too much for you), either take aspirin an hour before you use it or stick to shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how it works.</li>
            <li>This one works, does take 2-3 times for the complete job.  </li>
            <li>Having used an epilator for a number of years (15+), there was no other option than to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>BUT I do use a loofa daily in the shower, and pay special attention to my legs and arms when I know I am going to use the emjoi, I shower dry of then shave.</li>
            <li>It takes me about one hour to do my full legs with my old epilator, but with this one it take half the time.     </li>
            <li>You also should be careful not to apply lotion right after using the emjoi.</li>
            <li>On the other hand the electric razor that is included is fabulous, I actually use that feature all the time</li>
            <li>I have super dark hair and when I shave I still have that \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; in my armpits and have always been embarrassed by it.</li>
            <li>I love this little machine, yes its hard to hold but not impossible.</li>
            <li>No mess like with shaving.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about fine hair.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the results that I&#x27;m seriously kicking myself for not buying one of these sooner.  </li>
            <li>: when trying it on the underarm for the first time, if you notice your underarm is getting red, switch to a different underarm.</li>
            <li>although the first couple times i used it, i was kind of afraid of this contraption, i have gotten use to it.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that it will take a few hair growing cycles to notice a real difference.</li>
            <li>I just hope that by using this product no more bumps will show up and that I will just have smooth soft underarms.</li>
            <li>You want to get rid of a huge amount of hair from the root, this little baby will work wonders!  </li>
            <li>I also figured that since I was getting a new product, I may as well try to fix some of the other flaws I&#x27;ve found with the Braun product - hair grows back too quickly, hair isn&#x27;t removed fast enough, it is extremely loud, it sometimes simply does not pick up hair.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t hurt like hell, then the technician isn&#x27;t putting it high enough.</li>
            <li>I had an earlier model and it seemed to be a little easier to grip, but this one works fine.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Emjoi Light Caress for the past year.  </li>
            <li>At first, it was a little prickly, but after the initial time, it wasn&#x27;t so bad;I love this little machine.  </li>
            <li>a few times before you have the full effect of hair removal.  </li>
            <li>It is more an issue with technique as I can make it work in hard to reach areas, I just have to adapt my technique to accommodate the different size of the unit.  </li>
            <li>I mustered up some courage and tried my new epilator last night.  </li>
            <li>I am ordering a new one today - my second one this year.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t hurt, just a very minor pinch and removed about 90% of the hair in about a 20 minute period.</li>
            <li>I feel confident enough to use it on the delicate skin under my arms and know that I won&#x27;t hurt myself.  </li>
            <li>I would have prevented cuts and several scars from shaving, not metion having to shave everyday to keep smooth</li>
            <li>but after that the hair is much finer and since it grows back at different speeds its not as concetraited in one area...</li>
            <li>The unit plugs quickly and is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>Also the new hairs seem to be much finer than when I use a razor or conventional shaver...</li>
            <li>It is much faster to use than the single rotating tweezer model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one of its type that I have found that is relatively painless (after the initial &#x27;exposure&#x27;) and performs fairly consistently.</li>
            <li>Also, it got most of the little hairs that the other Emjois often miss.  </li>
            <li>With the past epilators I used I would have to go over the same spot many times and would still have hairs left.</li>
            <li>I had gone a few months without using it after it died, and when i first used my new one it did hurt a bit.</li>
            <li>you get a smooth, non-prickly feel for days, but much faster and less messy.  </li>
            <li>The underarms were a bit more painful, but completely worth it!  </li>
            <li>Evidently the person below this got a defective one cause mine barely hurts compared to the other devices I have used.  </li>
            <li>Trust me, the little annoyance is worth it.</li>
            <li>It quickly tears all of his back hair in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Finally, as long as my current Emjoi lasts at least two years, I&#x27;ll buy a third one; I&#x27;m just that pleased with it!</li>
            <li>If I find I am using  the long hair blade, then I would replace with the same, and if not using the long hair blade, I would replace with one similar to the original.  </li>
            <li>And even though they tell you not to in instructions, I&#x27;ve learned to VERY carefully use on my lower face - looks more natural to take out the long fine hairs (using at a slight angle) and leave the small, short ones</li>
            <li>That was also a great but painful choice.  </li>
            <li>general comment..</li>
            <li>No worse than waxing, at least you know it comes off the first time, unlike waxing that sometimes sticks and does not come off-ouch.</li>
            <li>just for the record, i&#x27;m a 17 year old girl, and embarrassingly enough i have(or had)</li>
            <li>I definitely noticed a difference in speed from my old Emjoi</li>
            <li>It actually lasts for 3/4 weeks or so however since hair grows back at different speeds and depending upon how much of the hair was taken out by the root or if it just broke off I like to use it weekly.  </li>
            <li>When your hair grows back after epilating, it&#x27;s never stubbly, just soft.</li>
            <li>Take it out again a week later and you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I had never used my old one on my underarms-just a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>Now I use it probably once a month and when the hair grows back its so soft that you will NEVER feel prickly stubble again.  </li>
            <li>:O</li>
            <li>I never expected these results.  </li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t worth the hassle of shaving everyday.</li>
            <li>The emjoi has no joy involved, but it does most of the job.</li>
            <li>The cord is placed right on the side of the squatty little thing, so it is always in the way.  </li>
            <li>If you have thick hair, or long hair, it might be a good idea to trim it down a bit before you begin.  </li>
            <li>Well worth expense and slight initial pain.  </li>
            <li>I think when this goes bad after many years of use, I&#x27;ll think which I will purchase next, this one or the one closes to the original.  </li>
            <li>The Epilator is very easy to use, but annoying to clean after use.  </li>
            <li>I opted for using it a day or so after shaving so it was pulling less hair out at a first.  </li>
            <li>Also - if you&#x27;ve ever noticed, with waxing they usually start half way between your knees and ankle... do the same when epilating because it is much more sensitive around your ankles!</li>
            <li>but it died rather quickly and was not able to be used with the cord.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and as long as I use soothing lotion after, I have no problems with irritation.  </li>
            <li>Compare to other brand I used before, I am much happier with this one.</li>
            <li>It does the job twice as fast as any other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used two old coil Epiladies for over 20 years, and the last one finally started dying.  </li>
            <li>,the short fuzzys come right out, one or two you missed that are a little longer</li>
            <li>The first time it was a little intimidating.</li>
            <li>this little thing is also pretty intimidating as well...</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was a little time consuming</li>
            <li>My tips if you do Laser - pay a flat price for hair removal usually 6 treatments so the incentive is to get rid of your hair, if you pay per session - the incentive is to drag it out for more $$.  </li>
            <li>At first it was a little intimidating -</li>
            <li>I thought with this having two heads I wouldn&#x27;t have to go over the same area again and again, but I do, this is a major drawback.</li>
            <li>It DOES hurt a little at first.</li>
            <li>just be sure to keep the skin pulled tight, otherwise it will be more painful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-By far the BIGGEST MOST FRUSTRATING drawback is the fact that this product does not last long.</li>
            <li>long enough for me to replace it and receive the new one in the mail.     </li>
            <li>The first day I used it it hurt a little, but I got used to it within the first few minutes.  </li>
            <li>After frequent use, the hairs definitely come back in less numbers and much softer.  </li>
            <li>There are two speeds, which would make sense, except that the device is not designed for the user to be able to guide the device to the necessary areas and still hold onto the epilator - the motor power sends all the energy into the head, which means that if you depress at 90 degrees as you are meant to do, all the pressure of a modulating motor is on the skin and in order to keep the epilator in place, you have to push it and hold it in place like you&#x27;re doing a serious exercise.   </li>
            <li>I will start off by saying that I have very corse dark hair on my legs, until now I have had to shAVE</li>
            <li>I, on the other hand, have sensitive skin to go along with my sensitive soul and couldn&#x27;t tolerate this devil devise.  </li>
            <li>My hair was not extremely long</li>
            <li>By about the fourth time though, you&#x27;ll barely feel it at all</li>
            <li>Believe me, this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve had trouble with Emjoi products.</li>
            <li>However, it my underarms were completely smooth for 9 days before any signs of hair regrowth, AND the hair is thinner and blonder (i have thick dark hair, normally.)</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used and good god it was painful!</li>
            <li>Ingrown hair bumps; particularly in my bikini region, but other places I shaved, as well  2.</li>
            <li>I have had several surgeries and managed high pain levels with minimal pain meds.</li>
            <li>First let me say I have very dark, very coarse leg hair and even after shaving you can still see the hair on my legs and a couple hours after, it is already prickly again.</li>
            <li>are jerked right out like a small pin prick.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;ve hardly got any hair or it&#x27;s very fine, you&#x27;ll still find yourself doing this every few days if you want to stay</li>
            <li>I had a previous Emjoi gentle caress epilator, which lasted for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>the plastic parts next to the blades do not depress.</li>
            <li>Also, I learned that if you start with the most painful areas and then move onto other areas, it will make the whole experience much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This helps me get into tight curved corners without much problem.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty high tolerance of pain and this was tough to bear.</li>
            <li>It is a little noisy but no worse than an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t like having to spend my money on new razors, shaving creams, waxes, or other hair removal</li>
            <li>This system is better than shaving, since instead of cutting the hair it pulls it out completely.</li>

            <li> I was VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS</li>
            <li> The Optima Epilator has been the best in removing hair than any of the ones I have used before.</li>

            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> COME IN A BEAUTIFUL CASE.AND</li>
            <li> If you can tolerate the pain go for it because it does work beautifully.</li>
            <li> It works great on underarms.</li>
            <li> Over all I am happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;m so happy that i invested in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Emjoi for about 3 months now and am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It works great though.  </li>
            <li> it is great</li>
            <li> my pain tolerance is not all that great.  </li>
            <li> This product works great</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it works.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m extremely happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with this.  </li>
            <li> I think its great for someone, like myself, who has never used one before.  </li>
            <li> They work great when they work.</li>
            <li> and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> and you will have a great product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a great product that does everything its supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Emjoi is a great epilator</li>
            <li> I have tried these types of products before, and have never been happy with them.</li>
            <li> The OPTIMA is great.  </li>
            <li> (you probably shouldnt do that, either, lol.)    </li>
            <li> This is a great hair remover.  </li>
            <li> However, I soon learned that shorter/trimmed hair diminishes the pain factor a great deal.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be happy you kept at it.&lt;br /&gt;-Ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This is a great product which reduces the need to shave to once a week.</li>
            <li> It worked great on my arms and under arms.</li>
            <li> because I got great results on my arms.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to use this just for your legs - great.  </li>
            <li> So I would say great for legs</li>
            <li> A great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li> To add to the positives, the AP99 comes in a great pro looking carry case, and includes a Remington-Style shave attachment.</li>
            <li> and i was happy with the outcome</li>
            <li> This product also works great on the bikini line.  </li>
            <li> Results, great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend it anybody who is spending more than 30 dollars per visit to a beautician and needs to go atleast twice a month!!</li>
            <li> its very effective and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> the emjoi removed the hair from my legs very nicely.  </li>
            <li> I can say I own just about EVERY hair removal product out, and this is my all time FAV!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Tea Tree Soap and a good lotion after the shower helps the pain subside greatly as well.</li>
            <li> This is also an environmentally friendly product, as there&#x27;s nothing to throw away!!!</li>
            <li> works great on the top of my feet too for sandals!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and in my opinion it works the best on fine hair.</li>
            <li> GOOD</li>
            <li> a good addition.    </li>
            <li> Why change a good thing?</li>
            <li> Hope this helps, and good luck to you.</li>
            <li> I recommended this shaver to my friend, and she purchased the cordless version, not as good as it does not seem to have the power of the corded version.</li>
            <li> This shaver is really good for about one year.  </li>
            <li> Good choice for an epilator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly good for underarms - for decades</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that this unit is not cordless, although it is a good length.</li>
            <li> And the hair \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; for a good couple of weeks without having to remove it again...</li>
            <li> However, it has worked really good for all of this time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pain tolerance is fairly good.</li>
            <li> Waxing never sounded so good.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> I have had my Emjoi for over two years now, and it still does a good job for me.</li>
            <li> For me good products meant forty to fifty bucks every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> good items to have</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good alternative to shaving.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would make a good all-in-one.</li>
            <li> The design is really nice, and the set includes a shaver head, so my boyfriend liked this thing too!   </li>
            <li> a good tip is to use the Emjoi, then take a good warm shower.  </li>
            <li> However, I found a good angle to use it in about 20 mins of struggling and now I love it!</li>
            <li> It comes in a very pretty case, which makes it a perfect gift.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator after using an Epilady for a couple of years (off and on), and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> After doing my legs, I did my armpits - very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I did try it.  </li>
            <li> i am in love with it and am noticing I am wearing shorts and skirts more often because I don&#x27;t have to wait!!</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to do a good job -- you will have to make many passes over your legs in order to do a good job</li>
            <li> I am smooth all over!!  </li>
            <li> LOVE this item!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I love my Emjoi!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS EPILATOR !</li>
            <li> Although, I still have to use the Emjoi every couple of days - its still a lot better than shaving!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with Amazons customer service!</li>
            <li> and I was really pleased w/ it!</li>
            <li> I use this product every week and love it, my husband loves it too!  </li>
            <li> i am absolutely in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> (Make sure you do both!)</li>
            <li> (And it looks lovely on my bookshelf too!)    </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> it will make it much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> This one works great on the fine hairs without a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li> Size and shape fits comfortably in the hand and helps give maximum angle versatility, power/strength is great</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a way to keep your legs free of hair longer and is cheaper than getting a wax.</li>
            <li> It works great for me but that might be because I enjoy pain.</li>
            <li> THis product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I just find it easier to use my handy no frills tweezer.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this unit is corded, I don&#x27;t lose power like I would with battery operated ones.  </li>
            <li> I will say I tried this on my bikini line, I personnally could not get pased the pain, so I purchased a intimate shaver called the e-razor, very great product.</li>
            <li> I liked that I could finish both legs a lot quicker than when I was using my Epilady.  </li>
            <li> I have been waxing my own legs &amp; armpits for a year, so I am used to the feeling of hair being ripped out.</li>
            <li> It pays for itself compared to wax prices (even if you do your own).</li>
            <li> It is indeed the best epilator ever, I had it many years ago and last for many years too, and was very happy with the product and the result...  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here I felt that I had something to contribute so decided to post my own experience after 3 years of use with this product.     </li>
            <li> but it is still effective in removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> but it sure works good.  </li>
            <li> Also I followed advice that others gave; I took a warm shower and exfoliated beforehand.</li>
            <li> I think that it&#x27;s effective,  </li>
            <li> a guy would be allowed to own it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I use it to give myself a full brazil monthly and am mostly happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> The product works great for it&#x27;s purpose, I would love more it if it had a better way to handle-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product to get rid of most of the hair, but if you want that smooth feeling you get when you wax or shave then</li>
            <li> I do not shave because I get cut very easily.  </li>
            <li> love it!    &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> It had the best reviews by far and with a 43% savings, I decided not to pass it by.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best method of body hair-removal I&#x27;ve found (I&#x27;ve tried shaving, waxing, depilitory creams, etc.)  </li>
            <li> Have friends who have used this product for years and sung it&#x27;s praises -- it was all true!!   </li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs were the only problem I experienced, but I found a great solution to that problem..</li>
            <li> I had the original Emjoi for many years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I would say it got 85 percent of the hair which for me was a tremendous improvement!!</li>
            <li> The results on my legs and underarms was very smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Most of these reviews are by people who&#x27;ve just opened the box.  </li>
            <li> Sexy on a guy.  </li>
            <li> I still fought problem 1 for a couple years more; but it was getting better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , I would either break out which made it more noticable or it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> did it again and then once more.</li>
            <li> In my case I think  it is a worthwhile buy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping that with more uses the pain will lessen with each hair removal process.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made me feel a lot better about my arms, and now i can wear t-shirts without being so self-concious :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have continued to replace it over many years.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came in a zipped pouch like most of the others do.</li>
            <li> But overall, I am very happy wiht the way it performs.</li>
            <li> Also waxing doesn&#x27;t work if hair is short and while I&#x27;m waiting for it to grow, my legs don&#x27;t look their best.    </li>
            <li> If not then you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li> If you want to buy it, buy this one for sure and you will never regret your decision.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure will work for you too.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m learning how to make it work better.  </li>
            <li> Again, I believe a change in technique might help produce a better result.</li>
            <li> I was able to tolerate it.</li>
            <li> : let your hair grow out a bit to make sure you get all of it, it pulls it from the root.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> again - LOVE it -</li>
            <li> After they&#x27;re cut though, the hairs get pulled out much more</li>
            <li> One thing that I love about the Emjoi epilators is that their tweezers are metal.  </li>
            <li> My only wish is that I could find a company that incorporates the best of many brands.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad with my decision.  </li>
            <li> and the more I use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing my best to get my teenage daughter to use it, to save her from all the hassless.  </li>
            <li> I find the size and shape refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with changeable heads</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 18 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> so she asked me to give it to her, so I gladly obliged.  </li>
            <li> I have not gotten any ingrown hair, I&#x27;m sure because I listened to all of the greats posts on this forum suggesting exfoliation, with a loofa, or salt scrub, or Glycolic acid lotions.  </li>
            <li> The Gently Gold works great, but I prefer this newer model.</li>
            <li> I love having the interchangeable shave head, too.</li>
            <li> But that being said, when I was done my legs were smooth!</li>
            <li> Optima epilator cuts more than it removes hairs.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I would say waxing does hurt more than this product, though not pain-free.</li>
            <li> The two headed shaver is great, it&#x27;s fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that I will.</li>
            <li> It removes hair better than waxing..with the convenience of shaving.  </li>
            <li> but I think most folks could hang with it).  </li>
            <li> Not as good as wax, but worth the trade off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a cordless version, but the battery would run out before I finish shaving my legs from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li> the more I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely in love with it--it works so much better than the Optima</li>
            <li> I would continue using it if the product was more durable and perhaps faster.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> They have a better reputation.  </li>
            <li> I then skipped two days to see what it would be like with more growth, and it didn&#x27;t hurt more then before.</li>
            <li> i love that even when the hair starts to grow in it is not as prickly as with shaving.</li>
            <li> it works better than my braun.</li>
            <li> That aside I will continue to use until I find a better product.  </li>
            <li> I read what the users of the product had to say and then decided to give epilation one more shot.</li>
            <li> I do remain hairless for as many as 4 to 5 days at a time.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about it, take it from me, buy this product and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I love my epilator.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it does hurt, but not any more than waxing.  </li>
            <li> Even when I have more hair it works.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safe to use.     </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure everybody knows that already.)</li>
            <li> It makes you feel better.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it does not hurt and it grabs all of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> So over all, I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> it does hurt more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- entertaining if you&#x27;re bored&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> no matter how many times you use it, the pain does not go away</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have read many of the reviews but none specifically mention the chin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product b/c it gets rid of underarm hair, and the regrowth is often finer and easier to get rid of.</li>
            <li> (In fact, the shorter the hair, the better).  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M IN LOVE.  </li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for many years</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried a epilator in many years you need to try it again.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It has been more than a year</li>
            <li> couple more times to see if that stops.</li>
            <li> More like plucking?</li>
            <li> and I was 100% hair free!  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a razor just didn&#x27;t remove all the hairs and the more I tried to shave it the more the bumps would appear from shaving.</li>
            <li> Actually, I kind of enjoy making him squirm.</li>
            <li> - you had better have some time to devote when you use this product.</li>
            <li> the end, I do still use it and it is better than the Braun I bought in between the two, but I wish I had the Gold Caress instead.  </li>
            <li> However, after receiving this product, I am glad I switched.  </li>
            <li> This product performs outstanding and the curved head is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer and have recommended this product to others.</li>
            <li> I was so confident went to my underarm.  </li>
            <li> It for the most part removes the hair at the root.</li>
            <li> I plan on using it for many more years.</li>
            <li> , they just know you look better.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> MUCH better than waxing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a replacement with a better design.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I also LOVE the shaver attachment.</li>
            <li> will to do it&#x27;s magic -</li>
            <li> I love this product and recomend it for men also.</li>
            <li> Like most of them you can&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> It really works great.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to get this product with all the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> It got virtually all of the hair (the Light Caress frequently misses hairs) and cut the time by about 1/3, which is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the razor part yet, but am sure I will like it.    </li>
            <li> I love this product, I already have an epliator</li>
            <li> Well, once I built up the courage to try it (on my legs first) I was SOLD!!!</li>
            <li> But when It arrived and I tried it for the first time, it didn&#x27;t hurt?!?!?!</li>
            <li> About epilators in general, it&#x27;s the best method I found to keep my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> There are no replacement parts or service programs that I am aware of that do a good job.</li>
            <li> Well, I decided that using a heating pad on the area should work pretty good.  </li>
            <li> But its well worth it!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> It is quick with amazing results.</li>
            <li> The heads pop out very easily, so this is the easiest to clean of any epilators I have used.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> It grabs more hairs the first time you pass over them and pulls them out more effectively.</li>
            <li> Like waxing, over the years your hair may gradually get more fine (mine did).  </li>
            <li> good on large areas</li>
            <li> I bought this because I liked emjoi&#x27;s older eplilator products, which I used to own.</li>
            <li> Oh, and if you do the bikini area, make sure you watch what you&#x27;re doing, the head is huge on this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most comfortable model model of the two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to take a warm bath/shower before to open up the pores so you don&#x27;t feel the yanking as much.</li>
            <li> and it helps keep me from sweating and it helps the tweezers head move more smoothly along my skin.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, every time I used this product I would also have to shave the areas that the epilator missed.</li>
            <li> Again, the product may be a good one, maybe it is supposed to hurt this much.</li>
            <li> This product really works as good as it says it does.  </li>
            <li> This does do a good, fast job of removing hair but has a couple of drawbacks: &lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have any kind of grip problems, or large hands, I can&#x27;t imagine you would be able to use this.  </li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve been using an Emjoi for so many years, I do not experience any significant pain.  </li>
            <li> Such a good investment!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator in years, and I love it!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T use it on hair that is full length!</li>
            <li> I have used the exact epilator for 7 years before it  broke, I am very pleased with my purchase, for 60.00 I will be hair free for another 7 years.</li>
            <li> I found the shape easy to hold, but the power cord does get in the way sometimes.  </li>
            <li> The directions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li> The shape is easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> this product was everything that i hoped it would be so thank you for the swift and easy transaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Quick, easy, and lasts longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> This epilator glides against your skin; it is as easy as shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to be pegged as a metrosexual</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy,</li>
            <li> Strong Buy</li>
            <li> On top of that, it is far more effective.</li>
            <li> It is not painful, the feeling is more like the \\&quot;pins and</li>
            <li> And its easy to use and removes most hair quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Now they are really fine and not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> It works just fine</li>
            <li> It was working fine for a bit, but then began to run slower and slower with each use.  </li>
            <li> It was working fine for a bit, but then began to run slower and slower with each use.  </li>
            <li> it worked fine for three years until I had to replace it with another emjoi.  </li>
            <li> It works fine at the moment</li>
            <li> I have used it on my under arm area without the  skin getting caught, works fine.  </li>
            <li> Laser works best on light skin with dark hair.  </li>
            <li> It is not for fine hair.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> so I have baby fine regrowth.  </li>
            <li> the epilator doesn&#x27;t pick up fine hair - if it does, it just rips it.</li>
            <li> but once you get used to it its fine.  </li>
            <li> For the people who are worried that it will hurt, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> so I had fine hair</li>
            <li> Ok, as a woman that has never waxed nor used an epilator before, the first time I used this was one of the most excruciating experiences ever.</li>
            <li> Today, I epilated, then quickly finished off with a shave, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the smoothest my legs have ever been.</li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how quickly and efficiently this thing pulled the hair from underneath the skin!</li>
            <li> But what i really love about it is that it removes all the hairs and quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the wet/dry option of some epilators and the cordless ability, but the Optima has the best curves to get into tight places.</li>
            <li> Huge mistake.   </li>
            <li> I see a huge difference after 4-5 uses over a 2 month period.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t cause as much discomfort to the skin of my underarms as the Light Caress did, which was also nice.    </li>
            <li> Make sure to match the power units when purchasing; it uses a rare amperage.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy that I finally got the nerve to spend the money.</li>
            <li> I can never grip it comfortably.</li>
            <li> AP99 IS FANTASTIC HAVE 2 HEAD ONE FOR LEGS</li>
            <li> I gave it only four stars because the shape is not all that great.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great purchase.</li>
            <li> (hair free) legs, bikini and underarms.</li>
            <li> My arms are silky smooth and stay that way even when the hair grows in.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s no point to going through all of this if you can&#x27;t then slide your hand along your leg and have it be smooth.</li>
            <li> my underarms and legs are soooooo smooth.</li>
            <li> I got it a week ago and my legs are still smooth.  </li>
            <li> I used it 2 weeks ago and still am stubble free.  </li>
            <li> (I admit I had a glass or two of wine before doing it the second time lol)</li>
            <li> My legs are soooo smooth.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Emjoi products truly are cheap.</li>
            <li> I use the epilator and the leg hair has thinned and is easier to maintain a smooth touch.</li>
            <li> I can go about 3 days with perfectly smooth legs, and about day 4 I begin to feel stub.</li>
            <li> A few days growth after shaving is best.</li>
            <li> I have not been brave enough to use it on my armpits</li>
            <li> hair free</li>
            <li> your legs look great, hair grows back finer, and no nicks, scrapes of cuts!</li>
            <li> on- a bunch of metal tweezers making a hideous sound.  </li>
            <li> Works great all this time later.</li>
            <li> If you want totally smooth legs, this product is NOT for you.</li>
            <li> Although this was efficient, I didn&#x27;t get the smooth feeling you get when you wax or shave.</li>
            <li> My legs and underarms are smooth and the shaver feature keeps my bikini area</li>
            <li> (Free shipping too.)</li>
            <li> I think today I&#x27;ve experienced enough.  </li>
            <li> Optima doesn&#x27;t fit well in my hand and the cord often comes out while I&#x27;m using it on my legs since my hand is brushing up against the spot where the cord is attached to the epilator</li>
            <li> It fit well in my hand and because it is cordless</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to the person who does not have time, space, or energy for the self-waxing production and has tried everything else to get smooth legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a wonderful quarter of a century not to have to shave everyday....</li>
            <li> I like the Emjoi Light Caress</li>
            <li> It feels closer to being flayed alive than a \\&quot;tingle.\\&quot; The good news,</li>
            <li> My first experience on the legs was pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is far superior to others that I have tried over the years.  </li>
            <li> I love the product line, wore out my former Gold Touch epilator in the course of 8 years and hoped this model would be just as good.  </li>
            <li> I love this machine and can&#x27;t say enough good about it.  </li>
            <li> Just received my new Emjoi Optima and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> If you can stand the pain it does pull those hairs right out, if not try somthing you will enjoy for awhile!</li>
            <li> But my husband put the tweezing section right up to the palm of his hand to show me it was perfectly safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other epilators and find this the best and worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After much care and cleaning, I am happy to report that the epilator now runs like new!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective for underarm and facial hair removal.</li>
            <li> The Optima is powerful, easy to clean, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the job this product does - it pulls the hair from the root quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> However, after about a month and half of continued use, I can happily say that I am absolutely in love with this thing.</li>
            <li> I had been using my original Emjoi</li>
            <li> I agree with most reviews, it does hurt at first.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> (and if you&#x27;re creative like me, a whole lotta expletives as well!)  </li>
            <li> This is worth the cost because it will save you time!</li>
            <li> I have owned a variety of these products over the past 20 years and this is the best.  </li>
            <li> you may love it at first</li>
            <li> Here was my original review 6 months ago:    </li>
            <li> For the most part it does exactly what I need it to do......</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of the Emjoi line and of epilators in gen&#x27;l, so .. if you don&#x27;t mind the mild pain (in time, you do get used to it)</li>
            <li> The price was most reasonable, the performance is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> so you can clean up any hairs that you decided</li>
            <li> That makes it easier to clean the unit because the cord doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
            <li> That makes it easier to clean the unit because the cord doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna try it on your underarms, which are more sensitive, it is definitely safe to touch it with your finger.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews before buying this product and there wasn&#x27;t many out there about sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The brush they give you to clean it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> love the fact that the whole thing is super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Ok it was not the most wonderful experience but really waxing is worse.</li>
            <li> Waxing is too costly for large areas, more pain to wallet than me.  </li>
            <li> It is more of a quick tugging kind of sensation, much like what you would have with tweezing only it does more hairs at one time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get a good comfortable grip without fear of catching your fingertips in it.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough on how good this thing is, and im not exxagerating</li>
            <li> I love the cordless one and the travel size one so much.</li>
            <li> This Optima one is so much faster, but that cord is uninspiring after you&#x27;ve been cord-free for so many years.</li>
            <li> Not painful for me</li>
            <li> This is a good product, sturdily made, that will last for years.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought one for my daughter and my sister.  </li>
            <li> What doesn&#x27;t even get done satisfactorily in 45 mins of electrolysis is done in 15 minutes with the Enjoi...and the pain subsides much quicker, and the skin is a LOT more smoother.</li>
            <li> But after I used it only twice, I loved the difference that I felt.  </li>
            <li> It took me a full week to get the courage to try it on myself.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> The emjoi is the only thing i used to remove leg and underarm hair, so i&#x27;d say 3 years is a good lifespan.     </li>
            <li> I have graduated to the bikini &amp; underarms and its not painful at all.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended the Epilady Optima, and life is back to good.</li>
            <li> This may work out better for womens legs because their legs are used to being shaved so the skin is much tougher.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It is far from painless, but it is also effective and quick.  </li>
            <li> Even underarms are easy now, and fast!  </li>
            <li> The other reviews are true in regards to the pain lessening over time and the shaver attachment is great for underarms.</li>
            <li> It was simple, easy, and it did not hurt !!</li>
            <li> Compared to other epilators, this one is great at removing hair.  </li>
            <li> I was super suprised to find that it got all the hair on my face.</li>
            <li> and after about a minute of holding this my hand was cramping up in pain - it was the same pain I experienced after writing by hand for about 3 hours straight.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m able to do my legs and much more in the same amount of time.  </li>
            <li> that can be quickly gotten used to.  </li>
            <li> Two wheels of fast-spinning tweezer blades is super intimidating.</li>
            <li> It worked just the way I thought it would, and I used it nearly twice a week because I felt more comfortable</li>
            <li> really quick</li>
            <li> I did investigate the different epilators and this one rated as one of the best, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li> I received it in a quick and efficient manner with no problems what so ever.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with this unit I purchased another, smaller size for my upper lip.</li>
            <li> But, for quick, do it yourself hair removal, I still recommend it.</li>
            <li> I noticed that this epilator was the one with the most high reviews</li>
            <li> I used to own an, Epilady, the coiled hair remover; I bought it brand new when they first came out.  </li>
            <li> I had 2 days worth of growth and it ripped the hair out right from the roots, shaft and all!  </li>
            <li> I am very thrilled with the Optima Epilator, ans compared to the prices of other shavers I looked at ....</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life my skin looks and feels smooth..</li>
            <li> i had an other emjoi epilator, but this one is more effective</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator</li>
            <li> The very first day I did this</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t break down as some folks experienced.    </li>
            <li> Forget the splashy ads that tell you that their product works under water (it doesn&#x27;t, I own it), or a spring works (it doesn&#x27;t, I own it), or a sanding disk works (it doesn&#x27;t, I own it, and you don&#x27;t want to see my legs after that fiasco!), or a green gel from Down</li>
            <li> I used to have an Emjoi that was battery powered, and that ended up lasting 3 years which I think is pretty good for the price.  </li>
            <li> thanks emjoi!!</li>
            <li> I use this to remove the hair from my Italian arms and love it for that!</li>
            <li> I used it for awhile, it removed the hair on my legs pretty well, but, OUCH!  </li>
            <li> I will say that the first time I used the Emjoi, IT HURT!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, the first time you use it, it kills!</li>
            <li> So if you do experience a lot of pain during the first time...don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li> First time user, just can&#x27;t stand the pain!</li>
            <li> On my first try, I did my legs AND my bikini line!</li>
            <li> If I was brave enough to try my bikini line on the first day AFTER doing my legs, that should tell you something, haha.     </li>
            <li> Combined with the right clothes,  and some mild working out</li>
            <li> First of all, I started getting ingrown hairs that were an extreme annoyance and didn&#x27;t look attractive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a light, but I don&#x27;t really care about that.  </li>
            <li> It looks and sounds very scary/intimidating, but it is really a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have had many different types of epilators before from rubber band types to coiled metal springs, none of them ever pulled out much hair and the i ended up just tweezing most of them anyways.</li>
            <li> This one, with its spinning motors in diff directions, actually got stuck and broke (after a bit more than a year, when I was totally hooked on its superior speed and efficiency).</li>
            <li> Hurts like #$$%^ Worth the pain.</li>
            <li> But 2 weeks, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> She claims the pain is minimal and 10 years out of this product seems like a good deal.</li>
            <li> , tweezer heads can be used at various angles and still epliate effectively.  </li>
            <li> but the outcome is worth it...</li>
            <li> There is a reason that manufacturers offer seemingly nice discount coupons, and the Emjoi reason is that their products just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> , it was okay, but it took awhile to completely remove all of the hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li> It hurts to use, but the results are completely worth it.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth it comes in a neat case for the unit and the attachments.</li>
            <li> And the service was good, the packaging and arrival date was as expected.</li>
            <li> but sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the dough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nice to have a cordless option, but it&#x27;s not a big deal for me.  </li>
            <li> If you are doing your full legs for the first time expect a couple of hours worth of work.</li>
            <li> I have been using hair removal systems for a few years, and this one is by far the best out there.  </li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t get that \\&quot;freshly shaved\\&quot; feeling for a while.</li>
            <li> To describe the pain, it kind of felt like my legs were getting rug burned, but withut the lasting pain.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> If you think you can handle the pain and discomfort, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, your underarm skin is much more sensitive.</li>
            <li> but after time it won&#x27;t be worth the money.    </li>
            <li> The only thing that would be an improvement would be a travel bag instead of the nice box in comes in.</li>
            <li> AND THAT THE PAIN WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old male in great shape(just</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> especially if there&#x27;s no outlet handy.  </li>
            <li> Still, the time saved was worth it.  </li>
            <li> took all hair off it hurt but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I use an old toothbrush instead with better results.</li>
            <li> If nothing else it is a fun toy, my family calls it the &amp;#34;toture machine&amp;#34; and we sneak up on eachother and pull thier hair out...</li>
            <li> This definitely seems like a well-timed flaw to me, and I will not be purchasing another Emjoi product./&gt;After much care and cleaning, I am happy to report that the epilator now runs like new!  </li>
            <li> I have owned other epilators before, and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, epilators work best when hair is short</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t shaved an area recently, do a quick shave over it first to minimize the pain.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product, since its so fast and has two times the coils, it gets the job done much quicker than my old epilator.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair make sure to put it in a ponytail before you begin, that is if you want to keep the hair you have on your head!</li>
            <li> right after I threw away the Optima...</li>
            <li> I will admit that the reviews before about the pain were right.  </li>
            <li> I searched online for th right hair removal product for me, and chose epilation.</li>
            <li> Gotta get used to it, since you already bought it, right.     </li>
            <li> If you try to put it on right after removing your hair, its going to sting A LOT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like shaving right?  </li>
            <li> And for the first few months, it was great.</li>
            <li> after reading the many other awesome reviews posted here, especially the person who said it worked well on thick  body hair better than all the others; I decided this was the one!</li>
            <li> I bought the Optima with the hopes that  the dual head would work better and be more efficient than my previous one</li>
            <li> If I used it more often, I am sure that after some time, I could use it even less than 1X per week.</li>
            <li> Just make sure u clean between tweezers when u see build of dead skin, so easy</li>
            <li> love the fact that this has so many tweezer heads as my old one only had two</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I had 3 weeks worth of growth on my legs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would use this on my bikini area, but it works great on legs.</li>
            <li> I found that the optima generally broke off the hair on my legs more often than it removed it from the root.</li>
            <li> I have thicker hair on my lower legs and very fine hair on my knees and upper legs.</li>
            <li> I just decided to use the epilator again real quick to get a little more growth that has started and it didn&#x27;t even hurt.</li>
            <li> The product removes hair at the root, leaving skin silky smooth for about a week or so until new growth begins.</li>
            <li> what she forgot to tell me was that I don&#x27;t have to wait for the hair to get to a certain length!</li>
            <li> If you have a low tolerance for pain, can&#x27;t pluck your brows without crying, or can&#x27;t even pull a hair on your head, it probably would be best to stick to a razor or nair.  </li>
            <li> The Gently Gold is rechargeable and can be operated without a cord -- a nice feature, but only lasted for about a year.  </li>
            <li> I also decided that the pain of using this wasn&#x27;t worth it as it never got better, even after multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Your hair free baby soft skin is worth the ouch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my epilator for about 2.5 weeks now, so not long, but I already love it.</li>
            <li> (I wasn&#x27;t being very gentle when wrapping the cord).</li>
            <li> There is a key to helping yourself achieve very smooth legs.</li>
            <li> The positive is that this is a dual head system and it is effective at pulling even very short hairs or very course hairs.</li>
            <li> Purchased new one because oldest daughter off to college; original is still working after replacing shaver head 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> BUT there is a HUGE design flaw: the cord plugs in to the side, not the end of the device, which means you really cannot get a decent grip on it.  </li>
            <li> I used a much older epilator and really liked it, but it had seen its last days.  </li>
            <li> The multiple rows of tweezers make the job quick and easy.   </li>
            <li> But from a year of waxing, my hair grows back so thin &amp; fine, that this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I want to find whoever invented this and plant a big HUGE kiss on them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for 8 years.  </li>
            <li> So I shaved first, then used it every day for about a month.  </li>
            <li> Problem number 2 cleared up, first.  </li>
            <li> The power supply will go first.  </li>
            <li> and so it definitely works better than shaving and under the arms</li>
            <li> Stellar product line.  </li>
            <li> I can tell that I&#x27;ve bought only a couple more months...</li>
            <li> I bought my first epilator six years ago.</li>
            <li> since I am pretty used to the sensation, just takes a bit of practice for newbies.  </li>
            <li> Simply Gold for many years</li>
            <li> On top of all of this, it simply doesn&#x27;t remove hair.</li>
            <li> Since then I have purchased several epilators looking for the \\&quot;newest\\&quot; and the \\&quot;best\\&quot; thing as most claim.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> For those first time buyers, yes it will hurt.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> it hurts the first 2 to 3 uses</li>
            <li> Hers had finally given up after more than 10 years of use.</li>
            <li> You need to have courage or a margaritta before you do this, becuase it does hurt the first time-</li>
            <li> Though like any tweezing method it can be a lil bothersome at first.</li>
            <li> To top it off, the hair grew back baby-soft.</li>
            <li> First off--the thing works.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, I did not em-joy</li>
            <li> It smarts the first couple of times you use it</li>
            <li> (funny thing</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the performance I got yesterday more than makes up for its short falls.</li>
            <li> I wore out the first one because I used it for years.  </li>
            <li> daily in ORDER TO HAVE SMOOTH LEGS!</li>
            <li> I actually think it may be more reliable as is.  </li>
            <li> It hurts a lot, but that should be expected with any type of epilation, and you get used to it, and the sacrifice to be hair free and smooth is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Only thing better is Laser Hair removal, which I did on underarms and  </li>
            <li> but it really does work once you get brave enough to actually put it onto your skin.</li>
            <li> At first, it would happen maybe once every time I epilated.</li>
            <li> This is my first</li>
            <li> the instructions state to use the epilator after a shower when the pores are more open:  </li>
            <li> It took me about an hour to do my bikini area the first time</li>
            <li> At first there&#x27;s sort of a \\&quot;pinching\\&quot; feeling</li>
            <li> I swear the first day I used this</li>
            <li> I have waxed all my life and being a mother of 4, it is very time consuming and a headache to have to wait for the hair to grow before I wax!</li>
            <li> after the first time, you don&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I then used it every day for the first week, getting those hairs that were slower growing.  </li>
            <li> Even the first time using this product I didn&#x27;t feel any pain.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time two days ago</li>
            <li> I have to admit, the first couple of times it does hurt (it&#x27;s almost like waxing), but you get used to it and the pain goes away.</li>
            <li> Using on underarm for the first time:    </li>
            <li> : Try it on your legs first.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my first experience with Emjoi.</li>
            <li> This product may be exactly what it is supposed to be, however I used it for aproximately 2 minutes and could not stand it any longer.</li>
            <li> Gets the hair on the first couple of passes instead of trying over and over again till you want to scream and DO.  </li>
            <li> Been using removal systems for over 20 years since the first epilady (ouch remember that eeeeek)</li>
            <li> I feel no pain, only smooth legs!</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs when I first recieved it in the mail and</li>
            <li> The first time I epilated it took about an hour.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, it hurt...</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> The first couple times I used it</li>
            <li> My first one died so this is its replacement.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> First, I must say that I am not too fond of the shape and design.</li>
            <li> The first place I used this Emjoi Optima was on my underarms.</li>
            <li> this first episode</li>
            <li> This gives you a better chance of getting the job done faster, and if you&#x27;re doing guy-type hair removal, i.e. arms, chest, back, stomach, etc, you need all the horsepower you can get.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used an epilator and you are interested in trying one - just go for it.</li>
            <li> I find this design more efficient, especially with the underarms.    </li>
            <li> cuz I have a separate epilator for more smaller areas.     </li>
            <li> hurts at first, but then the burn just blends in and you get used to it.</li>
            <li> My old worn out Emjoi did a better job than this brand new Braun.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it not to hurt a little; it hurts a bit more than waxing, but it&#x27;s more than tolerable (I have a high pain tolerance</li>
            <li> really like this product, does a large are or skin at one time and is powerful.  </li>
            <li> This product also comes with a nice case to keep the epilator protected from the other items in your bathroom (or wherever you plan to store it).</li>
            <li> If your hair is long, it&#x27;s better to shave it first and wait for two days before trying this product.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that the first time you use the Emjoi, it hurts a whole lot, but using it afterwards is nothing (when compared to the first time).</li>
            <li> A good product overall, but didn&#x27;t like the following things about the product:  </li>
            <li> It works best if the hair isn&#x27;t too long (usually a day or two after shaving).  </li>
            <li> I purchased a different model from the same manufacturer but it is not as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Since I have dark hair after shaving with razors the hair below the skin shows through the top layers of skin making a dark appearance, whlie this item leaves my pits looking clean!!!</li>
            <li> Its extremely easy to clean, and comes with a fun little carrying case.  </li>
            <li> I expected to only use it on my legs but found it very effective for underarm and bikini line also.</li>
            <li> I found the first time I used it the dual heads were too much</li>
            <li> The exfoliation pad really does wonders for me, and the shaving attachment works quite well on my arm pits (shaved them first, and</li>
            <li> The exfoliation pad really does wonders for me, and the shaving attachment works quite well on my arm pits (shaved them first, and</li>
            <li> pain of the first two or three times is intense.</li>
            <li> At first I was very nervous about epilating.</li>
            <li> The rotating blades were very intimidating at first</li>
            <li> I would really appreciate a response, Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I first tried it - it REALLY hurted, but when I finished with both hands and feet - pain went away at all, and I started to search, where else could I use it.   </li>
            <li> Also, be sure not to have the hair be too long -</li>
            <li> and I find this product to be very easy to use and fast with the new double heads.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy to get pinched since the rollers roll inward towards each other.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that when you do decide to take on the task of cleaning it that you are very careful in putting everything back as it was otherwise the tweezers won&#x27;t be able to line up and run properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> So I use it on dry skin and then smooth on some lotion and good-bye razors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve being using Emjoi for the past 7 years and they work great at the beginning but for some reason they start loosing speed until they die completely.</li>
            <li> WOW, it did the job quickly.</li>
            <li> When it heats up it is less effective because the gears no longer grab as well.     </li>
            <li> However it comes with a sensitive skin shaver attachment which is painless and removes unwanted hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I find it easy enough to handle.</li>
            <li> Kudos to Emjoi for making a long lasting superior product.</li>
            <li> The good options for guys are few and far between, even if you&#x27;re brave enough to wade through the pink and purple boxes to try and adapt a womens&#x27; product.  </li>
            <li> I will warn you though, when I got to areas on my leg that had more fat on them, ie., inner thighs it stun a little, as long as you pull you skin taught though, you&#x27;ll be fine!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend the machine, I love it so much, its made my life</li>
            <li> The new one breaks off more hair than it pulls and my hair grows back in stubbly - just like shaving.    </li>
            <li> Want to buy one more as a New Year present for my sis (and her boyfriend)</li>
            <li> a professional wax first and then start using this  -showering and exfoliating and then pulling hairs right after shower  </li>
            <li> This hair remover is great because it removes the hair faster and with less passes over the same area.  </li>
            <li> Free from daily shaving, free from bikini waxes, free from dark underarm shadows, and the list goes on.  </li>
            <li> Once you get a hang of it on the less sensitive side, you would have much more technique to use it on the more sensitive side.    </li>
            <li> so I definitely noticed a huge decrease in time.  </li>
            <li> This product saves so much time.</li>
            <li> I just purchase one separately for about $10 when that happens, rather than replacing the whole unit.  </li>
            <li> I use this product to keep the entire area between my legs hair-free and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really faster as promised.</li>
            <li> Shaving is cheap but the results won&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> - it lasted much longer than one might expect and performed well up until the day it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> but i dont think it hurt that much.  </li>
            <li> it comes with makes the whole process very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> It really hurt, but when it comes to being without hair on my legs, I will put up with just about any discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I really have no compaints.   </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> My epilady didn&#x27;t get them very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Much slower than shaving.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to put the epilator away and never use it again because it did hurt so much.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask me how I know, though, haha.</li>
            <li> yeah, it really takes the hair off, but</li>
            <li> That seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> That seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> the whole process of touch up takes about 10 minutes and presto.</li>
            <li> It has two heads, so it seems to be twice as fast.  </li>
            <li> Go with the Braun silk epil, it works about as well, and you can get a grip on it, or the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress, which is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> You just need to learn to pull your skin really really taught.</li>
            <li> For that very reason, I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works really well but hurts.</li>
            <li> I like using the epilators because the hair takes longer to grow in and is much finer over time.  </li>
            <li> A big swallow and 10 minutes later my legs were hair free and smooth.</li>
            <li> Or I would miss a whole section, causing me to have to heat everything up again, get the strips out, etc.  </li>
            <li> I dont have much leg hair.    </li>
            <li> Turn it on and gently touch the running head with your finger.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember when my legs were last this smooth.</li>
            <li> the product got to me in a reasonable fashion.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that i never feel completely smooth.</li>
            <li> You may have some hairs that are stubborn and repetition is necessary; however, It lasts longer than shaving and it has a smooth feeling to it.  </li>
            <li> , it lasts longer than shaving, but not by much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this product and haven&#x27;t ever considered discontinuing use.</li>
            <li> It works fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have that much hair because I had shaved just a couple of days before I decided to use this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand using this thing on my legs because it hurts way too much.</li>
            <li> We only need to use it about once a month to keep him completely smooth.</li>
            <li> I have light-colored, sparse hair, and I really don&#x27;t think it hurts at all to use - -</li>
            <li> and I really wish I&#x27;d just bought another Gold Caress.</li>
            <li> But after about a week (must have forgot how much it hurt) decided to do it agin.</li>
            <li> Much faster.</li>
            <li> And, really its not what I would call \\&quot;pain.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I owned the Emjoi gently gold caress for about a year before upgrading to this model.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone who wants to use this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li> The two rolls of tweezers make for fast removal, but if you don&#x27;t hold the skin really taut</li>
            <li> It took about three days of morning &amp; evening sessions to get nerve back to get job completed, but what smooth results.</li>
            <li> so so so much easier.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I was really thrilled about getting one at the time, but I didn&#x27;t find it practical enough for me to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Guys today have to tread a weird line between looking their best, while still remaining masculine.  </li>
            <li> Overall: Recommended for legs and large areas where skin is taut and easily accessible, do NOT buy this product in hopes of using it on your bikini line-</li>
            <li> It says it right in the description that it pulls the hair directly from the root.  </li>
            <li> So far I still have a \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; of the hair right below the skin</li>
            <li> The shaving attachment is great too, but be careful with the trimmer, it is sharp.</li>
            <li> Cord not that long, and it detaches easily from end of unit.</li>
            <li> Another thing I really like about the Optima is that the rounded edges are exposed more on this epilator than my other ones.  </li>
            <li> If you have used an epilator the initial discomfort will be familiar.</li>
            <li> In other words, when I have had it serviced it does not return in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Optima because my original Emjoi epilator finally quit working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two different types of epilator products from them before, and I should have known better to buy this one in the first place, because both those others had similar problems.</li>
            <li> It came a day later and and I cannot tell you how excited I</li>
            <li> Trim the bikini line first -  DO NOT use it on full length hair -- I did a few full length hairs</li>
            <li> One of them is much more tolerant to pain than the other.</li>
            <li> IT WORKED BETTER THAN ANY OTHER.</li>
            <li> surprised at these problems as Emjoi usually makes a good product.</li>
            <li> I might add that I noticed that the best results would occur when the product was new, and that it actually seemed to gradually spin more and more slowly over the course of use, until it actually just stopped working just a few months later.  </li>
            <li> If more hair had been removed I might have suffered through but it was clear it would have taken at least an hour or more to complete the process.</li>
            <li> This is a definite timesaver and as long as the results last as long as waxing, I&#x27;ll be very happy!!  </li>
            <li> I had an Epilady epilator back in the 80&#x27;s and that was a true torture device.</li>
            <li> When my Emjoi Gently Gold Caress broke (after years of use - I whole-heartedly give it five stars), I bought this, thinking more expensive means better.  </li>
            <li> What I want to make clear is that you most certainly will feel persistent pain the first few times of use, afterwards your skin will get used to it, hopefully.</li>
            <li> I use it about every 2 weeks, as the hair that grows back is soft and fine.</li>
            <li> It is small, quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost completely painless, but I will note that I&#x27;ve got a pretty high tolerance for pain.  </li>
            <li> The shorter the hair and more times you have used the remover, the less pain you will feel.</li>
            <li> It works even better than Emjoi Gold, gets my legs smoother, with less noticeable grow out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to the one time I got my legs waxed, I feel that the pain was less, and that I could take the pain much better because I was in control of what happened.</li>
            <li> I got it less than a week ago and love it.  </li>
            <li> For me, the more I used it the less it hurt</li>
            <li> For legs and under arms area, I am satisfied with the result, everytime I use it there is lesser pain and lesser hair.</li>
            <li> [ also this kind was recommended by one of the transgender people in an online support group network] and so, being a transgender male [girl&#x27;s emotional spirit inside a physically male shell]who prefers that smooth, \\&quot;feminine-like\\&quot; feeling of having shaved legs, arms, and body; it definitely works even on the thickest hairs.</li>
            <li> Hold your skin taut and use this product frequently to keep your hair short and your legs smooth.</li>
            <li> I actually have no side effects any more (bumpy and red skin after use).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Braun silk-epil the last couple times and since I&#x27;ve had to replace it twice now because it simply stopped working, I thought I would try another product that I hoped would have a better lifespan.</li>
            <li> So here I am again, I&#x27;ve decided to give epilators another try, mainly because the cost of razors, and the awkwardness of shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I was using the Emjoi Gold, which I thought was great, but it was old and tired.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this device for over a year, and haven&#x27;t gotten the ingrown hairs that I got my older epilators.  </li>
            <li> Well, this emjoi is a replacement for my older emjoi, and now I wish I kept the older one.</li>
            <li> my older one used to do,</li>
            <li> This was my main focus.</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator years ago and preferred this older model than</li>
            <li> I bought this to use mainly on my underarms and legs.</li>
            <li> However given my past experience, I&#x27;m more than willing to overlook the shape and size issue.</li>
            <li> Her last epilator was a different brand, and this performs much better than that one.</li>
            <li> It fits right in the palm of your hand to be held in a cupping manner rather than a traditional razor and most other electric removers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had success in the bikini area at all, and the underarms are pretty painful, but it&#x27;s great for legs.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did, it made short work of the hair on my legs, 20 minutes on the first try; it hurt some, but now the pain is minimal.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always considered myself someone with a high tolerance for pain...</li>
            <li> On a scale of 1 to 10 it was a high 8. &lt;</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> But I figured since this one was so highly reviewed, by now they would have worked all the kinks out.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it highly to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and can&#x27;t believe I have not bought one sooner - or why anyone would want to wax again after this.</li>
            <li> it works wonders though, and is highly recommended!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Emjoi AP99 Optima epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my third Emjoi Optima Epilator after my previous two stopped operating properly so obviously I think they&#x27;re great epilators.</li>
            <li> The unit is cost effective, works extremely well, even for a guy like me, and comes in a case that allows me to keep my hair removal discrete and personal.</li>

            <li> I love this little machine.</li>
            <li> and I was sure that little bits of skin would be getting pulled out.</li>
            <li> This model is great too, and the extra blade for long hairs is a plus that the other did not have.  </li>
            <li> The little tweezers pull even the thickest of hair and leaves my legs feeling and looking smooth!  </li>
            <li> My thighs and bikini and one underarm never came back from the first treatment; scared to death I think!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The epilator is a bit bulky, but it just takes some minor manuevering adjustments to your old technique, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> A small amount of discomfort, but not as much as waxing and certainly more convenient... without the mess :-)</li>
            <li> I like how the unit has two rollers, which not only pulls out twice as much hair as compared to other units, but it also gives me a good visual for knowing when I have aligned the head in the correct position.</li>

            <li> With the Optima, I&#x27;m able to pick up the most annoying hairs, all except for the extremely fine ones.      </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get one thing straight here: I am a 22 yr old guy</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to expensive waxing.  </li>
            <li> because it works well, it&#x27;s actually much gentler on the skin in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought and it is better than my first (epilady) and third (braun) and even subsequent emjoi epilators.  </li>
            <li> I have more trouble with ingrown hairs than the epilator.  </li>
            <li> You do have to go over your legs quite a few times to get most the hairs</li>
            <li> People weren&#x27;t kidding about the pain, but it really DOES go away after the first or second time you use it!</li>
            <li> The underarm area had me scared because so many people said it was so much more painful than the legs, but I found it felt no worse than razor burn when using it at first.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I would have to shave every day.</li>
            <li> When i use the emjoi on my legs it takes about 2 weeks to grow back, and it doesnt seem to hurt as much on legs the first time.</li>
            <li> I love it because I can do it while sitting in front of the TV, rather than being trapped in the shower with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;-Your</li>
            <li> Waxing normally took me 20 min per underarm</li>
            <li> It does take some time but after a few days most of the hair is gone so it is quicker.</li>
            <li> This is GUARANTEED to happen if you are using any waxing kit from a normal retail store.          </li>
            <li> It is kind of slow nowadays</li>
            <li> Very good product - fast, less painful than Braun, i would even say cute, but it&#x27;s corded and the cord is attached to the side of the epilator</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do my legs with the laser because it was fairly new and the price was too high, also my legs are tan.</li>
            <li> One downside to this model from my previous model is that the Optima is not as adept at grabbing really short hairs</li>
            <li> Is it effective on the coarse black hairs?</li>
            <li> I can actually use it right before walking out the door.</li>
            <li> Well, after about 3 months, I noticed that it was becoming less reliable.</li>
            <li> However, each of my previous two stopped working correctly after about a year and a half, so I highly recommend these epilators with one caveat: expect to receive one to two years of great epilating action but don&#x27;t be surprised when it stops working after that time.</li>
            <li> is great too but a little bit messy)</li>
            <li> Although I have gone on to try other Emjoi models (Emagine, Light Caress), this one remains the undefeated champ for strength and angle flexibility.</li>
            <li> Waxing can work, but you better be using excellent wax and muslin cloth or it is POINTLESS and PAINFUL.</li>
            <li> The only con I can honestly admit to is that it takes a little time as opposed to shaving.  </li>
            <li> it works for about 5 years before I had to buy a new one</li>
            <li> A NEW \\&quot;EMJOI\\&quot; EPILATOR AGAIN</li>
            <li> After owning an Epilady for 5 years, I was hesitant to try a new brand.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my experience is unique, but I will certainly not buy the Optima again.</li>
            <li> NOW,not only did I get my package in a super fast delivery speed of only two days</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little machine!</li>
            <li> you really have no other hand to hold the skin taut.</li>
            <li> The first time was not pleasant but not terrible.  </li>
            <li> Legs are easy to do and the results last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Wow, how they have changed!</li>
            <li> My first cordless one lasted several years</li>
            <li> so I bought another one exactly the same.</li>
            <li> A must have for busy moms with 5 minutes of shower time!</li>
            <li> I have a low pain tolorance and I have to say that it did hurt ALOT the first 2 times.  </li>
            <li> first time you use thing thing, the only thing coming out of your mouth will probably be AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHH!  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver and will NEVER go back to a wet razor!</li>
            <li> The shaver smoothes the skin by getting rid of the stubble after using the tweezer attachment, so hair removal is COMPLETE!</li>
            <li> and so far, no problems!</li>
            <li> I did bleed and the area was red and inflamed for almost a week after the first time</li>
            <li> or else you&#x27;ll go through the same amount of pain as you did the first time.</li>
            <li> Not the first or second time you use it.</li>
            <li> I am a seasoned waxer and used to wax myself on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I had the red bumps at first</li>
            <li> WHAT PAIN at first, esp on inner thighs,side of waist,underarm,and bikini area.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have owned 2 in the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> As far as pain, yes, it does hurt the first few times you use it but after that its not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> It works OK for underarms, OK for legs and is TOO CLUMSY for anything more delicate \\&quot;down</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviews, I can&#x27;t say that his back hair has decreased or become more fine with use, but I can say that it works better than any other device we&#x27;ve tried and is much cleaner than sugars and waxes.</li>
            <li> the length that is right for waxing is a bit too long for this IMO.  </li>
            <li> Not a super smooth feel, but</li>
            <li> The next day I did my entire bikini area, I&#x27;m talking full brazilian.</li>
            <li> I had this product for 8 years or so and used it throughout the entire summer each year, it just stopped working not bad for a product that only cost $63.  </li>
            <li> Back to this Epilator - I chose it over the Braun because of mostly positive reviews here</li>
            <li> When I finished, my legs were smooth as if they had been waxed w/o the mess and w/o the hassle of going to a salon.</li>
            <li> though, is that the hair grows back at different rates, so if you use it often, like once a week, it won&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as it did the first time you used it.  </li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re really lucky, you may even have a few little pinpoints of blood where more stubborn hairs used to reside.  </li>
            <li> but it does not work any better than my previous model that only had one head instead of two.  </li>
            <li> the more often you do it, the less hairs that are grown back and the easier the removal.    </li>
            <li> She also had an original single barreled emjoy in the past, and this double barreled one is much better.</li>
            <li> It also has a bigger surface area, so its much quicker than her old one!</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little, not as much as I thought, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> If you do decide to buy one then make sure that you are able to return it for a refund in case it hurts you as badly as it did me.</li>
            <li> After only using it twice for the underarms I find it painless and literally just as fast as shaving with a razor if not faster and no messy shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li> You read this far; so I&#x27;ll reward you with what some may consider TMI:  </li>
            <li> Although my 1st review was basically saying how much it hurt and that after I was finally done removing the hair</li>
            <li> My old Satinelle is still working</li>
            <li> You may find that these areas are not as sensitive as you thought they would be and epilated underarms look smoother than shaved ones.</li>
            <li> Unit is light, though must use heavy plug.  </li>
            <li> The motor action also has a solid feel and sound (rather than hollow, shakey, and rickety like some.)  </li>
            <li> were too sensitive to be removed by the foil shaver head.</li>
            <li> I thought about buying a Braun, but the heads didn&#x27;t look very big, and I don&#x27;t want to be spending so much time removing hair.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t expect that to last though, and I don&#x27;t really care if it doesn&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a  Gently Gold model for about 3 years and will never go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> I thought my old one had stopped working, but it was just the cord that had worn out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use it for a few days in a row to get 100% smooth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and my skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li> Now I use the epilator once every 8-10 days and my legs no longer feel stubbly, the hair is baby soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done any waxing before and it was on the sensitive underarm.</li>
            <li> hair doesn&#x27;t grow back that much slower than shaving (after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Prevents ingrown hairs, and reactions to creams and razors to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But it was completely bearable.  </li>
            <li> you can help keep the ingrown hairs at bay by using a natural loofah with some grainy scrub when you shower, as well as using a lotion with alpha-hydroxy in it.  </li>
            <li> I do my forearms completely, and just keep my chest and stomach in check.  </li>
            <li> Once I made a rule and stuck to the emjoi it went away completely.  </li>
            <li> Word of advice: If you have a very low pain tolerance (i.e. waxing is too much for you), either take aspirin an hour before you use it or stick to shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how it works.</li>
            <li> This one works, does take 2-3 times for the complete job.  </li>
            <li> Having used an epilator for a number of years (15+), there was no other option than to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> BUT I do use a loofa daily in the shower, and pay special attention to my legs and arms when I know I am going to use the emjoi, I shower dry of then shave.</li>
            <li> It takes me about one hour to do my full legs with my old epilator, but with this one it take half the time.     </li>
            <li> You also should be careful not to apply lotion right after using the emjoi.</li>
            <li> On the other hand the electric razor that is included is fabulous, I actually use that feature all the time</li>
            <li> I have super dark hair and when I shave I still have that \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; in my armpits and have always been embarrassed by it.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine, yes its hard to hold but not impossible.</li>
            <li> No mess like with shaving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about fine hair.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results that I&#x27;m seriously kicking myself for not buying one of these sooner.  </li>
            <li> : when trying it on the underarm for the first time, if you notice your underarm is getting red, switch to a different underarm.</li>
            <li> although the first couple times i used it, i was kind of afraid of this contraption, i have gotten use to it.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that it will take a few hair growing cycles to notice a real difference.</li>
            <li> I just hope that by using this product no more bumps will show up and that I will just have smooth soft underarms.</li>
            <li> You want to get rid of a huge amount of hair from the root, this little baby will work wonders!  </li>
            <li> I also figured that since I was getting a new product, I may as well try to fix some of the other flaws I&#x27;ve found with the Braun product - hair grows back too quickly, hair isn&#x27;t removed fast enough, it is extremely loud, it sometimes simply does not pick up hair.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t hurt like hell, then the technician isn&#x27;t putting it high enough.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model and it seemed to be a little easier to grip, but this one works fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Emjoi Light Caress for the past year.  </li>
            <li> At first, it was a little prickly, but after the initial time, it wasn&#x27;t so bad;I love this little machine.  </li>
            <li> a few times before you have the full effect of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> It is more an issue with technique as I can make it work in hard to reach areas, I just have to adapt my technique to accommodate the different size of the unit.  </li>
            <li> I mustered up some courage and tried my new epilator last night.  </li>
            <li> I am ordering a new one today - my second one this year.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t hurt, just a very minor pinch and removed about 90% of the hair in about a 20 minute period.</li>
            <li> I feel confident enough to use it on the delicate skin under my arms and know that I won&#x27;t hurt myself.  </li>
            <li> I would have prevented cuts and several scars from shaving, not metion having to shave everyday to keep smooth</li>
            <li> but after that the hair is much finer and since it grows back at different speeds its not as concetraited in one area...</li>
            <li> The unit plugs quickly and is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Also the new hairs seem to be much finer than when I use a razor or conventional shaver...</li>
            <li> It is much faster to use than the single rotating tweezer model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one of its type that I have found that is relatively painless (after the initial &#x27;exposure&#x27;) and performs fairly consistently.</li>
            <li> Also, it got most of the little hairs that the other Emjois often miss.  </li>
            <li> With the past epilators I used I would have to go over the same spot many times and would still have hairs left.</li>
            <li> I had gone a few months without using it after it died, and when i first used my new one it did hurt a bit.</li>
            <li> you get a smooth, non-prickly feel for days, but much faster and less messy.  </li>
            <li> The underarms were a bit more painful, but completely worth it!  </li>
            <li> Evidently the person below this got a defective one cause mine barely hurts compared to the other devices I have used.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, the little annoyance is worth it.</li>
            <li> It quickly tears all of his back hair in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Finally, as long as my current Emjoi lasts at least two years, I&#x27;ll buy a third one; I&#x27;m just that pleased with it!</li>
            <li> If I find I am using  the long hair blade, then I would replace with the same, and if not using the long hair blade, I would replace with one similar to the original.  </li>
            <li> And even though they tell you not to in instructions, I&#x27;ve learned to VERY carefully use on my lower face - looks more natural to take out the long fine hairs (using at a slight angle) and leave the small, short ones</li>
            <li> That was also a great but painful choice.  </li>
            <li> general comment..</li>
            <li> No worse than waxing, at least you know it comes off the first time, unlike waxing that sometimes sticks and does not come off-ouch.</li>
            <li> just for the record, i&#x27;m a 17 year old girl, and embarrassingly enough i have(or had)</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference in speed from my old Emjoi</li>
            <li> It actually lasts for 3/4 weeks or so however since hair grows back at different speeds and depending upon how much of the hair was taken out by the root or if it just broke off I like to use it weekly.  </li>
            <li> When your hair grows back after epilating, it&#x27;s never stubbly, just soft.</li>
            <li> Take it out again a week later and you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I had never used my old one on my underarms-just a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Now I use it probably once a month and when the hair grows back its so soft that you will NEVER feel prickly stubble again.  </li>
            <li> :O</li>
            <li> I never expected these results.  </li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t worth the hassle of shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> The emjoi has no joy involved, but it does most of the job.</li>
            <li> The cord is placed right on the side of the squatty little thing, so it is always in the way.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, or long hair, it might be a good idea to trim it down a bit before you begin.  </li>
            <li> Well worth expense and slight initial pain.  </li>
            <li> I think when this goes bad after many years of use, I&#x27;ll think which I will purchase next, this one or the one closes to the original.  </li>
            <li> The Epilator is very easy to use, but annoying to clean after use.  </li>
            <li> I opted for using it a day or so after shaving so it was pulling less hair out at a first.  </li>
            <li> Also - if you&#x27;ve ever noticed, with waxing they usually start half way between your knees and ankle... do the same when epilating because it is much more sensitive around your ankles!</li>
            <li> but it died rather quickly and was not able to be used with the cord.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and as long as I use soothing lotion after, I have no problems with irritation.  </li>
            <li> Compare to other brand I used before, I am much happier with this one.</li>
            <li> It does the job twice as fast as any other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used two old coil Epiladies for over 20 years, and the last one finally started dying.  </li>
            <li> ,the short fuzzys come right out, one or two you missed that are a little longer</li>
            <li> The first time it was a little intimidating.</li>
            <li> this little thing is also pretty intimidating as well...</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was a little time consuming</li>
            <li> My tips if you do Laser - pay a flat price for hair removal usually 6 treatments so the incentive is to get rid of your hair, if you pay per session - the incentive is to drag it out for more $$.  </li>
            <li> At first it was a little intimidating -</li>
            <li> I thought with this having two heads I wouldn&#x27;t have to go over the same area again and again, but I do, this is a major drawback.</li>
            <li> It DOES hurt a little at first.</li>
            <li> just be sure to keep the skin pulled tight, otherwise it will be more painful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-By far the BIGGEST MOST FRUSTRATING drawback is the fact that this product does not last long.</li>
            <li> long enough for me to replace it and receive the new one in the mail.     </li>
            <li> The first day I used it it hurt a little, but I got used to it within the first few minutes.  </li>
            <li> After frequent use, the hairs definitely come back in less numbers and much softer.  </li>
            <li> There are two speeds, which would make sense, except that the device is not designed for the user to be able to guide the device to the necessary areas and still hold onto the epilator - the motor power sends all the energy into the head, which means that if you depress at 90 degrees as you are meant to do, all the pressure of a modulating motor is on the skin and in order to keep the epilator in place, you have to push it and hold it in place like you&#x27;re doing a serious exercise.   </li>
            <li> I will start off by saying that I have very corse dark hair on my legs, until now I have had to shAVE</li>
            <li> I, on the other hand, have sensitive skin to go along with my sensitive soul and couldn&#x27;t tolerate this devil devise.  </li>
            <li> My hair was not extremely long</li>
            <li> By about the fourth time though, you&#x27;ll barely feel it at all</li>
            <li> Believe me, this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve had trouble with Emjoi products.</li>
            <li> However, it my underarms were completely smooth for 9 days before any signs of hair regrowth, AND the hair is thinner and blonder (i have thick dark hair, normally.)</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used and good god it was painful!</li>
            <li> Ingrown hair bumps; particularly in my bikini region, but other places I shaved, as well  2.</li>
            <li> I have had several surgeries and managed high pain levels with minimal pain meds.</li>
            <li> First let me say I have very dark, very coarse leg hair and even after shaving you can still see the hair on my legs and a couple hours after, it is already prickly again.</li>
            <li> are jerked right out like a small pin prick.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;ve hardly got any hair or it&#x27;s very fine, you&#x27;ll still find yourself doing this every few days if you want to stay</li>
            <li> I had a previous Emjoi gentle caress epilator, which lasted for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> the plastic parts next to the blades do not depress.</li>
            <li> Also, I learned that if you start with the most painful areas and then move onto other areas, it will make the whole experience much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This helps me get into tight curved corners without much problem.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty high tolerance of pain and this was tough to bear.</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy but no worse than an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like having to spend my money on new razors, shaving creams, waxes, or other hair removal</li>
            <li> This system is better than shaving, since instead of cutting the hair it pulls it out completely.</li>
            <li> , I am a fair skinned, with dark brown hair on my head, but my body hair is not thick and dark, it is medium brown and not too thick; so for someone with thick, dark hair, I couldn&#x27;t really tell you if it would work as well as it has for me.  </li>
            <li> But having large hands, this sometimes is tricky to hold, and because the cord comes out from the side, instead of the bottom like the original, it gets awkward at times handling.  </li>
            <li> While I found the device to be somewhat effective in removing hair (I did eventually grow accustomed to the sensation and it did indeed become much less painful than the first experience)</li>
            <li> I also find it hard to use in the bikini area simply because the head of the unit is very large.</li>
            <li> Bikini line tough due to angles but works ok with a bit of manuevering.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other &amp;quot;epilators&amp;quot; and I liked this one least for several reasons.</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging is too much, and it is not easy to put the cord away, and it is not portable.</li>
            <li> so I had to get used to how fast this new one was which can make it a little more painful than before.  </li>
            <li> it may just have been because it was my first time using it, or because my hair was so thick and long, but don&#x27;t believe the whole \\&quot;you&#x27;ll only feel a slight prickling sensation\\&quot; deal.</li>
            <li> very painful the first time, even made me bleed, but I love the results!</li>
            <li> As other people have posted, Emjoi products die early deaths.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair on my legs and it grows very fast; shaving doesn&#x27;t last long enough</li>
            <li> It hurts a little yes, but nothing, NOTHING like that old epilator!!</li>
            <li> Yes, the first time is painful, but after that its smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li> The cord is the only drawback (I was used to a cordless), but really it&#x27;s only a minor detail.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever left such a long and thorough review for anything before.</li>
            <li> I also prefer the epilators with a cord because that last one I had the battery didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it hurts a lot less on the bikini line than wax as it doesn&#x27;t pull your sensitive skin there.  </li>
            <li> The blades are only in the middle of the device and they depress and need to touch the skin in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> so I have dark hair in my arms and it removed them completely</li>
            <li> First of all it at least looks like</li>
            <li> but until recently i&#x27;ve just been sticking to long sleeves.</li>
            <li> Long lasting results.</li>
            <li> With waxing, you have to wait until the hairs get long enough, and them you don&#x27;t get 100% of them.  </li>
            <li> You definitely do not want your hair to be long.</li>
            <li> It removes unwanted hairs efficiently and it takes a long time for the hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> bad design makes it tough to hold and easy to drop (hence break); loud; no multiple voltage for international use; case is waste of materials, better to have a simple bag.  </li>
            <li> Later, the spinning twizzer wheels would constantly get jammed and would just stop until I turned it off and readjusted them.</li>
            <li> Amazon quickly replaced the broken one-</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s because it is picking out every single hair, even those that might be too short to cut with a razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plucking out multiple hairs at a time from areas that we do not normally pluck.  </li>
            <li> I have used this same epilator for several years, and this purchase was because my other one was worn out.  </li>
            <li> (my opinion: a bald upper lip looks icky)  HIGHLY recommended.  </li>
            <li> Loving the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find this product to be painful at all.  </li>
            <li> Painful but effective.</li>
            <li> Never try to use it on long hair, because it hurts a lot and the hair will break before it gets pulled from the root.</li>
            <li> There is minimal pain (it IS pulling out multiple hairs at once after all)</li>
            <li> THAT long then what&#x27;s the point??</li>
            <li> I think it is faster -- and epilating can take a long time.</li>
            <li> I didnt feel any pain, probably because I had been using one for so long.  </li>
            <li> and I did have a minor bleeding.</li>
            <li> I was unwillingly to endure the pain for that long.</li>
            <li> It is also a reliable product since I&#x27;ve had it for a long time</li>
            <li> I also had minor bleeding at the follicle site.  </li>
            <li> I expected the treatment to last 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t need to be really long (like it does when you wax).  </li>
            <li> Second, it&#x27;s corded and not cordless; I personally think batteries are a pain, and go down hill with age.  </li>
            <li> It is far less painful, far less messy, far less of a hassle and works much better!</li>
            <li> I DID.I SHAVE MY LEGS FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS WITH EPILADY.I DECEIDED THAT WAS TIME TO HAVE A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> Since the hair was so short, it felt more strange than painful.  </li>
            <li> This little emjoi epilator gets out any hair that you could tweeze with a tweezer, the only hairs left are the ingrown ones which of course is under the skin and cant be pulled unless u get a needle and lift if out.</li>
            <li> Please note per some of the other reviewers about red razor bumps and ingrown hairs??</li>
            <li> I should have bought this unit a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I should have bought this unit a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I bought this product shortly after my son was born - with no time to do anything other than take care of him, my beauty regime was out the door and my hair removal schedule was no existant.</li>
            <li> The noise does not help either - same with the power of such a little device.  </li>
            <li> Due to the different types of hair I have, I went over my legs at both speeds to get all hairs.</li>
            <li> Hers finally died on her the other day (which prompted me to go on Amazon to get her another one)</li>
            <li> After thinking about it, I also think it is the same pain level as waxing, however, it seems worse at the time because you are doing it to yourself and can stop and agonize over how much it hurts instead of someone just ripping away.</li>
            <li> No more blood in the shower, and it takes so long for hair to grow back, that when it finally does it&#x27;s a surprise.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not remove short hairs, so if you&#x27;ve shaved recently it may not get all the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> so it was generally just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who has dark, coarse hair, and she couldn&#x27;t stand to use it, so be advised.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that if you have dark hair, it will likely hurt, and be prepared to spend some time when you use it.</li>
            <li> Epilators are designed almost exclusively for the person with dark coarse haired.  </li>
            <li> my hand slips down it all the time turning the unit off, so I have to turn it back on again.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have commented on it&#x27;s poor ergonomics, and they are right.</li>
            <li> Plus, the underarm area doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;dark\\&quot; (due to the dark hair under the skin) and the results last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I use both at least once every other week, though I can really go 3 weeks or so without needing any major touch ups (which is a small miracle in itself because I couldn&#x27;t go 3 days without shaving).  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I did my armpits and it was absolutely beyond painful.</li>
            <li> When I shave, the results only last a day and regrowth is too noticeable to not shave everyday!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Emjoi Optima, because not only are the hair growth on my legs less noticeable, I also don&#x27;t have to go through the hassle of shaving EVERY day.</li>
            <li> It was picking up less hair, and I would have to go over the same spots over and over again.</li>
            <li> The units last less than one year.</li>
            <li> The next day I epilated again to continue to get my legs used to it, and to get other hairs in other growth cycles.</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted several years without my doing any preventive maintenance...</li>
            <li> It covers a larger area so it takes half the time.  </li>
            <li> The effects are useless on fine hair because they break the hair in half rather than pull our the shaft below the surface.   </li>
            <li> My other underarm came back thin and soft and since lost the battle and decided not to come back either.  </li>
            <li> My leg and underarm hair to grow in so thick, that even right after shaving, I still had small visible hairs (under the skin).  </li>
            <li> I expected to have a few small hairs left, but so far my skinfeels like I&#x27;ve shaved my legs with a blade razor,</li>
            <li> Problem number 1 has finally disappeared; the hair in the regions I epilate has become light and thin, like peach fuzz, rather than black and thick.  </li>
            <li> It simply feels like little pin pricks.  </li>
            <li> I could actually see the little hairs with the routes on the epilator.</li>
            <li> Also, you only need a little bit of hair length for it to work</li>
            <li> It is very short, about half as long as other epilators, and very wide and squat, since it has two heads.</li>
            <li> My doctor says its very common and he does not recommend me using it again, because obviously my skin was too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I was wondering if this product would be better being that it doesn&#x27;t include putting oil on your face or will it give you bad in-grown hairs?  </li>
            <li> , that is WAY more painful.  </li>
            <li> it does hurt duh but not like the old ones.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful and pay close attention when working in that area.  </li>
            <li> it seems to miss a few spots sometimes, but overall it does work quite well.</li>
            <li> Since getting this model, I&#x27;ve branched out to legs because of the wide coverage area.  </li>
            <li> I would take a few minutes in between strokes to take a deep breath!</li>
            <li> It is money well spent.</li>
            <li> real key is to exfoliate everyday.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product roughly a year ago.</li>
            <li> The optima is harder to handle, (no grips on it)</li>
            <li> so I find it harder to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways</li>
            <li> I spent years waxing before this</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my Emjoi with another epilator, biggest waste of money ever.  </li>
            <li> So I used a wet towel.</li>
            <li> : I have a few red bumps afterward</li>
            <li> I am curious where this money has been going all these years.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago to use on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> My mother has been using one of these for 10 years and she only has to do \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot; every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;-Great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this epilator for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I purposely chose one that was NOT battery operated (I read a few reviews that the battery life is short on these.)</li>
            <li> I plan to give an update after a few weeks or when the hairs grow back.</li>
            <li> It also takes a few times of going over the same spot before it gets everything.</li>
            <li> Must go over same spot a few times to remove hair.</li>
            <li> No thanks.  </li>
            <li> I think it was harder to get rid of because of all the superficial blood supply to the skin.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it does take a few tries, what I am doing is, I did it once, waited an hour</li>
            <li> was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this epilator was actually not as bad as I had expected (because of all the people who had said how horrible it feels in the reviews), but that may be because I had shaved two days prior.</li>
            <li> The little roller bar that is meant to dull the sensation does dull the prickly feeling, but for me epilators are not painful anyway.  </li>
            <li> And it takes forever because you have to repeat areas endlessly to get the same result you would get on one round with the Braun device.   </li>
            <li> The epilator picked up hairs less than 1mm long.  </li>
            <li> It also hurts less if the hair is not too long.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is that it was a little scary when I first turned the thing</li>
            <li> Shaving is a joke, time consuming, and a day or so later the ugly little things are back and irritating, and no matter how many blades electric or hand, I got cut or scrapped and red.   </li>
            <li> Sorry,  I had such High hopes, but this just hurts.</li>
            <li> Horrible for the bikini line, don&#x27;t even think about it, the pain goes from feeling like little prickles to feeling like great tufts of hair are being pulled out at once, when it&#x27;s really only getting a few; it also seemed to skip over my skin and pinch me as well, and we all know you don&#x27;t want to be pinched there.</li>
            <li> The charging chord is a little short than my previous Braun Epilator.  </li>
            <li> I do notice that if the hairs are a little too long that the Emjoi will cut the hair rather than pull it out</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have complained about the size and shape of the machine, but I actually really like that it&#x27;s small and compact.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a different epilator product recently and was very disappointed, then I AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li> it is not painless, but it gets less painful the more you use it.  </li>
            <li> I have finally found a product that I can use without having to use it everyday!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t even get to the 6-month death that other reviewers speak of.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure how reliable it is overall.</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic pieces at ends (bordering the tweezers) were sharp and often scratched my skin.</li>
            <li> The results are extremely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> It is extremely detrimental to my self esteem.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine removing hair any other way.  </li>
            <li> We wish the chord was connected like in other Epilators at the rear.</li>
            <li> I purchased other epilators but they didn&#x27;t come close to doing</li>
            <li> There are no thumb grips or any other things that might help.  </li>
            <li> I remove hair on my legs and arms and this does it faster and neater than the other emjoy units I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll repeat what I&#x27;ve read from other consumers; EXFOLIATE, EXFOLIATE, EXFOLIATE...</li>
            <li> In the meanwhile, try it on the other underarm.</li>
            <li> I only did small sections</li>
            <li> I actually got lazy</li>
            <li> The biggest issue is the curve of tweezers has an angle that does not match other parts.</li>
            <li> Well, if you&#x27;re a guy, don&#x27;t roll your dice (or cash) at anything other than an AP99.         </li>
            <li> Some people are afraid to use an epilator, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;ve taken my time, I have often found myself looking down at my legs when I&#x27;m at work,  looking at a wide swath of hairy leg.</li>
            <li> It is a little painful, but gets better with practice.</li>
            <li> Even with very careful use and cleaning every time you use it, you will probably find yourself replacing this once or twice within a year, and they aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is to progress very slowly in a given skin area until there is no hair left on that patch of skin, then move on to the next area of skin on your leg or wherever you are epilating.    </li>
            <li> Holy Cow Batman</li>
            <li> I hate hair, my family make fun of me because I seem to have an obsession with always being completely hairless on my legs and armpits.</li>
            <li> The individual tweezer plucking was ten times worse.</li>
            <li> After a while these things slow down and barely work.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this product is the odd shape and small size.  </li>
            <li> Another problem that others mind find is that its a little too big for small areas like the bikini area, but this was not an issue for me</li>
            <li> The charging chord connects at an uneasy place on the Epilator; this causes the handling of the epilator a little difficult especially if they are on the sensitive areas of the body.</li>
            <li> The only negative is</li>
            <li> (Dark Course Hair)</li>
            <li> About 1 x per week; average about 15 minutes  &lt;br /&gt;Hardly any pain, just a kinda \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; feeling when it grabs the hair.</li>
            <li> I consider myself to have average body hair.  </li>
            <li> Some people have complained that the tweezers spin in different directions.  </li>
            <li> I have hirsutism where I grow an thick unsightly patch of coarse hair on the underside of my chin.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I had to thrown it out because it would get jammed after every 10 seconds</li>
            <li> The unit is fairly slow overall.</li>
            <li> life is easier, good bye nasty wax lady!</li>
            <li> Also, the hairs slowly began to grow back within a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given up on legs, I get the worst hair bumps whenever I use this machine and it takes a while for my legs to look good again.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair but wanted to take it off with out shaving and having it grow back thicker.</li>
            <li> If i shave with a razor, the hair comes back black and thick.</li>
            <li> Now the down side.  </li>
            <li> So the Epilady gets my vote, hands down.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and a lot of it, so perhaps less time for others..</li>
            <li> Less hair does not necessary mean less pain.</li>
            <li> I have had to use it every other day on the ones that grow unevenly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and thick and difficult to hold comfortably, often grazing my fingers during use.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, it took soooo long to do and hurt SOOO bad</li>
            <li> It took a few months for the product to make a difference with the thickness of my hair; I had been shaving daily for at least 5 years, so I&#x27;d done plenty of damage.  </li>
            <li> You spend less time achieving #1  3.</li>
            <li> There is pain but the pain is less.</li>
            <li> Pulling hair from the root always hurts, but it will hurt less and less with time.</li>
            <li> Also, I thought the shaver attachment was useless but have actually used it several times already-</li>
            <li> and I find some frustration when it won&#x27;t work as quickly as my previous model.  </li>
            <li> Less pain than waxing.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t see all the black hair stubs like you do with shaving.  </li>
            <li> But rest assured, all of those pesky side effect will go away--and yes, the pain does get less each time you use it afterwards.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being a epilator newbie, the pain was definitely less than waxing.  </li>
            <li> I had this item previously, and was searching for a replacement.</li>
            <li> that was soft/fine from previous waxings.  </li>
            <li> I use it weekly so there is less hair</li>
            <li> Less than 2 min per arm</li>
            <li> Maybe the pain seemed less for me since I was used to waxing.</li>
            <li> I do not know about this particular product but someone needs to inform SI that charging state sales tax on federal postage rates is illegal.</li>
            <li> The shaver attachment is worthless and the brush that comes with it for cleaning the head loses its stiffness and no longer effectively cleans out the head.    </li>
            <li> (I agree that this little round shape is a little harder to hold.)  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, black hair and skin as pale as death.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is sick of shaving and wants to try something different!</li>
            <li> I wanted the results of waxing without waiting for the wax to heat, the mess of cleaning wax off of my skin and the bathroom floor, or the expense of paying someone else to do it.  </li>
            <li> Hurt like CRAZY the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> No sticky mess, no burning skin or unbearable smell.  </li>
            <li> , I found that the rotating tweezers would break down and stop spinning after just a few months.  </li>
            <li> should have bought it a long time ago - no more shaving or waxing for me!  </li>
            <li> I suggest doing little spots at a time and holding the skin tight, it helps.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leary about some of the reviews mentioning that it was a little painful at first, so I mentally prepaired myself for that.</li>
            <li> I found it stung a little when I tried to use it, out of the box.  </li>
            <li> but, when I saw it, it was a little frighting.</li>
            <li> i was a little nervous because of all the reviews saying it hurt to use</li>
            <li> like lots of little pinches.  </li>
            <li> It may hurt a little in the beginning</li>
            <li> the amount of pain issued by this little</li>
            <li> Well, I was dumb enough to try this epilator again.</li>
            <li> Not just a little, but with a passion.</li>
            <li> It leaves little spots of lifted skin and some hair breakage.</li>
            <li> and you are done - without the stubble or little hairs</li>
            <li> Legs and arms were little to no pain.</li>
            <li> Underarms are a little tougher. . .</li>
            <li> I found it very hard to get my knees, but I feel like I&#x27;ll catch on soon enough.</li>
            <li> I just had to purchase another because it&#x27;s the only device that removes my tough leg hairs...</li>
            <li> Shopping locally at a retail store like Target, Walgreens, etc is tough, as everything in this category is geared towards women.</li>
            <li> Waxing used to leave behind little tiny hairs that I would have to go in and pull one by one.</li>
            <li> Tip 4: have a cold towel ready.</li>
            <li> Your eyes WILL water, your skin WILL turn red (and possibly bleed) and you WILL begin to think you&#x27;re crazy for continuing.</li>
            <li> After that, I could go a few days, and then use it without any pain.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I am now getting rid of ALL my messy wax.</li>
            <li> The charger is a heavy one compared to the one from Braun.  </li>
            <li> I am on my third broken unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking sweating, shaking, crying.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve read that after a few hair cycles it will all even out and go away.</li>
            <li> but I gave it 3 stars because it is not comfortable to hold and it quit working after 1 week.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice on the knees and round areas but it works.</li>
            <li> I had patches by my ankles that I would have to shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> I even plucked a few hairs from my leg with a tweezer before I ordered the item to see if I could stand the pain.</li>
            <li> I was shaving almost everyday and would have stubble within hours.  </li>
            <li> Once you use it a few times it doesnt hurt.  </li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money for now.  </li>
            <li> I received this product a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I am not brave enough to use it in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I dont have to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female who does not have baby thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I gave up using it there as I got pinched a few times.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s a breeze about once a week because there are few to any hairs</li>
            <li> It certainly is disappointing to waste so much money.</li>
            <li> i always have a few stubbles that are too short or thin</li>
            <li> -it does hurt at first, but gets less painful, but there is always a little pain with it.  </li>
            <li> The first time it&#x27;s a bit painful, but it gets less so each time.</li>
            <li> I usually took me about 20 minutes, and I did it in less than 10.</li>
            <li> I felt a lot less pain!  </li>
            <li> Anyway, even when I started, it hurted less, then laser epilation (and is also a way cheaper!)   </li>
            <li> It is somewhat difficult to hold because it is so different from other epilators.</li>
            <li> I received it a little over a week ago and my first experience with it was painful.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they even just plain break.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained about the small size of this model and the position of the cord, but I am not really experiencing any issues with either.  </li>
            <li> If in doubt, buy the Emjoi with the caveat that the Emjoi Optima is too bulky for optimal use underarms and in the bikini area (can be done, but not easily).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little small.  </li>
            <li> It is much less painful and MUCH</li>
            <li> I would say, however, that previously I did not use it as much for underarms and bikini area and I now use it for those areas all the time (probably because it&#x27;s summer) and it still is not overly painful.  </li>
            <li> but I stupidly shaved a few times in between to avoid the pain and leave the house quick.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad experiance with an epilator when they first came on the market and have yet to try hers.</li>
            <li> Because the price was pretty steep and epilating seemed painful, I waited a while to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Trying it on underarm for the first time, was painful.</li>
            <li> So first time using this product to pluck my underarm hair was painful.</li>
            <li> Using it is painful at first</li>
            <li> for those of us with thick or dark hair.</li>
            <li> So if you have parts of your body that have, say, bones, it is very difficult to get the epilator to remove hair without taking off slices of skin (a most unpleasant experience, and one I have never had with any other epilator).   </li>
            <li> I do not have problems with the tweezing being too painful, but I do have to go over the same area multiple times for it to pluck all of the hairs.</li>
            <li> I also had a difficult time with ingrown hair; so you can see where this is going, I quit using it, and finally gave it away a few years ago,</li>
            <li> I used to have thick black hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> By doing it once a week, there&#x27;s really very little discomfort.</li>
            <li> Very little</li>
            <li> That said I am very pale and my hair is very black.  </li>
            <li> So thank goodness it comes with an electric razor head, to bad it does not work real well.</li>
            <li> NOT sexy on a girl.  </li>
            <li> If you are not satisfied with your epilator&#x27;s performance, I recommend this model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators, almost exclusively, for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> I usually do this once a week while watching tv.  </li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> the product is not safe to use.</li>
            <li> Its a bit uncomfortable to use in curvy location such as underarms and bikini line.  </li>
            <li> Like past reviewers felt like a mix between rubber band snaps and electrical shocks.  </li>
            <li> The technology is better: the design is DREADFUL.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, for the past 20 years</li>
            <li> Once you get rid of the initial hair, it seems to get less and less painful.</li>
            <li> Note: be very careful with the tweezers as they can be very tedious to put back in order, and come off the rotating rod</li>
            <li> The shape makes it a little difficult to hold without it slipping once in a while</li>
            <li> Not as painful as I thought it would be on the legs, just some slight prickling, like little pins, you can definitely tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> it scared the crap out of me when i first turned it on XD but all in all</li>
            <li> I bought my Emjoi epilator two years ago, and I hardly use it.</li>
            <li> I have done my kneecaps, feet, toes (sometimes I get ingrown hairs on my toes since it pulls it out so hard)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to use on my shin bones and knees probably because there is not a lot of skin to press the unit against.</li>
            <li> If it were not superior in hair removing abilities, I would return it due to poor ergonomics.</li>
            <li> The reason I did not give it 5 stars is cuz, the device is a little hard to hold and my hand gets tired and cramped sometimes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up on epilators because of this poorly designed little thing.&lt;BR&gt;Emjoi, fix this design</li>
            <li> Also I was a little confused-  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is to have the cord come out of the bottom rather than the side because it can make using it a bit awkward at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, one of the gears was jammed on something, and I then began my disassembling project.&lt;br</li>
            <li> reviewers complained about the design of the Optima.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to try it, actually.</li>
            <li> I am curious if the states have been collecting this illegal tax.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use this product on face (at least its not recommended.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s slow, so I bought this model</li>
            <li> but it is SLOW.</li>
            <li> Prohibitively slow.    </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t let the growth get too thick again</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be avoided no matter how slowly you go over the skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been slow if it dies I won&#x27;t be replacing it.</li>
            <li> This product says for women so because I have thick hair did not know if it would work</li>
            <li> in the time it takes me to wax one leg from the knee down!!!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how painful it would be!</li>
            <li> No more nubs!  </li>
            <li> No more waxing!</li>
            <li> No more waiting for the wax to heat up or anything!</li>
            <li> Of the products commonly found on the market, I prefer the emjoi &amp;quot;Gold Caress.&amp;quot; It&#x27;s easier to hold and use, and it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> Also, do NOT try to use it on your face (serious ingrown hairs).</li>
            <li> One serious drawback though is ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> that I seriously considered returning the machine.  </li>
            <li> Is a little bit uncomfortable but I don&#x27;t have to shave so often.</li>
            <li> I found it less painful and with less side effects than electrolysis which is unbearable and requires longer treatment time in one sitting.</li>
            <li> It actually didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as my armpits.</li>
            <li> my hair issue bad enough to warrant putting myself on fire?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Anyways, I hated it so much, and started waxing.</li>
            <li> When you start to feel any discomfort or redness, use a cold wet towel to dab around your underarm.</li>
            <li> Not only is it painful to use...</li>
            <li> BUT....underarms and bikini not good.  </li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t do the entire leg, too painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who is sick of being hairy and have tried chemical,causing skin damage because of leaving on too long trying to get hair off and the smelly stink, found that it won&#x27;t work on stubble and is not efficient.  </li>
            <li> I would have given a five rating but the cord placement is a little awkward.</li>
            <li> I found it way too rough for my face and made me break out and extremely painful at the bikini line.    </li>
            <li> It is not even remotely close to as painful as waxing.  </li>
            <li> Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s really not that painful</li>
            <li> (I hate the cords and these two seem to last a bit longer.)</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, after a few months, the crazy thing stopped working ... already.</li>
            <li> It does well on the bikini area, but the legs is where it&#x27;s not great for me.  </li>
            <li> This unit is comparatively very expensive and the durability makes it not worth the investment.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had woolly mammoth arm hair, so that hurt way worse than doing my legs.  </li>
            <li> Also I really hate the design I&#x27;ve dropped this machine several times because it just slipps off my hands.</li>
            <li> I know some people are into pain (you dirty little sadists!)</li>
            <li> Then I got lured by the high ratings of the Braun 5270... and bought it...and hated it!  </li>
            <li> The unit is a little awkwardly shaped which makes it difficult to get into the nooks and crannies.    </li>
            <li> the less painful it is.  </li>
            <li> the bikini line is less painful than that.  </li>
            <li> Optima was significantly less painful that I even tried it on the bikini line.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews had mentioned the ergonomics are not ideal.</li>
            <li> letting your hair get that long stinks, and $50 a visit began to drive me crazy!</li>
            <li> Now just to let you know, my leg hair is dark and thick, and in my opinion looks disgusting.</li>
            <li> i do recommende it to the ladies who hate the mess of waxing(the waxing</li>
            <li> in the past, i&#x27;ve stupidly tried to shave them, bleach the hair, use nair, and other crap like that..</li>
            <li> I would like a battery/rechargeable option though as working with the chord can be a little annoying -</li>
            <li> I could have been holding the machine wrong.</li>
            <li> Waxing gives long-lasting results but it&#x27;s expensive and when I&#x27;m over, my fingers are all sticky.</li>
            <li> I horribly regret having purchased this device and wish some of the reviews would have been more explicit about what a terrible product it is.</li>
            <li> The product was purchased ealier that year but failed so I had to get a replacement since it was still under the warranty period.  </li>
            <li> I found the tweezing plates revolving in 2 directions, as opposed to one, rather uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t find epilating to be as tedious as shaving.</li>
            <li> I find the shaver attachment useless, but don&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li> Nope, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> needles\\&quot; you get if you sleep on your arm wrong at night.  </li>
            <li> The company is not responsive when the unit fails and will not sell you replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the tweezer head gears break too soon in both units.</li>
            <li> but now it takes mere minutes.</li>
            <li> I told everyone how horrible they are and said I&#x27;d never be singing it&#x27;s praises, but two weeks later I&#x27;m telling everyone I know to get one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what others are talking about when they said it was uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> To all guys thinking of gettin an epilator, you can&#x27;t go wrong with his one, and to the ladies, if it works well on a guy then it should work just as well for you!said</li>
            <li> it was uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Could I have been using it wrong?</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I followed the directions given for maximum efficiency and for least amount of pain, it was extremely painful.</li>
            <li> Oops, sorry for yelling.</li>
            <li> (you have to be drunk to use it on your bilini and use tranquilizers to use on your armpits)&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s expensive over time.  </li>
            <li> I feel silly not to have found this sooner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting two products in one, as cheesy as that sounds.</li>
            <li> Also, the cord is in a weird spot and so it accidentally comes out sometimes.</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH THE EMJOI SAYS NOT TO USE IT ON THE FACE, I use the Emjoi on my chin because the hair is very tough.</li>
            <li> The cord comes out of the side which makes it very awkward to hold and since it&#x27;s quite small</li>
            <li> Waxing is painful and expensive.</li>
            <li> so i tried cold laser and electrolysis treatment</li>
            <li> and I always end up cutting myself.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t be afraid to try it on your underarms and bikini area.</li>
            <li> To all guys thinking of gettin an epilator, you can&#x27;t go wrong with his one, and to the ladies, if it works well on a guy then it should work just as well for you!</li>
            <li> I found it to be not that unpleasant</li>
            <li> Thus I would say it is not that the ergonomics are not ideal, they are so terrible that it is difficult to use the product.</li>
            <li> For me, impossible.  </li>
            <li> BAD</li>
            <li> Too bad the year warranty ran out.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the year warranty ran out.  </li>
            <li> I bled really bad.</li>
            <li> if you wanna go with this bad boy, you have to ask yourself, \\&quot;Is</li>
            <li> This was unfortunately a bad assumption</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad</li>
            <li> When I used the trimmer on my Arms the pain was so bad I about passed out(not joking).</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts, but not so bad that you need to stop.  </li>
            <li> This product works well but hurts soooooo bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster,less painful, and easier than waxing.</li>
            <li> Now it painfully turns the tweezers at a snail&#x27;s pace.  </li>
            <li> Now it painfully turns the tweezers at a snail&#x27;s pace.  </li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s painful, if you&#x27;ve never used one before,</li>
            <li> &quot;  Before PFB Vanish, I was frustrated with ingrown hairs and the sores that it created.  </li>
            <li> I read a million reviews and knew it would be painful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scarier just getting started than it is painful.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE ON THE FENCE ABOUT IT BEING PAINFUL, TRUST ME, IT&#x27;S NOT THAT BAD</li>
            <li> They are not that painful as before.</li>
            <li> The legs were a bit painful, but nothing too bad.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS PAINFUL.</li>
            <li> On a scale of 1-10, 10 being so painful you would never do it again, I&#x27;d say about a 6.  </li>
            <li> Even the afore mentioned painful areas are nothing at this point.</li>
            <li> Painful, yes.  </li>
            <li> , however I was getting frustrated with the amount of time it took to do both legs, bikini, underarms and arms.    </li>
            <li> I was so sick of shaving that I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> While this wasn&#x27;t painful it was certainly annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving</li>
            <li> With patches of psoriasis on my legs, razors often irritate not to mention the bloody ankles or knees from a nic.</li>
            <li> and I personally hate my leg and armpit hair.</li>
            <li> I then began to hate that...</li>
            <li> Like I said, \\&quot;I HATE TO SHAVE\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> i hate bull crap reviews on worthless products like anyone else.</li>
            <li> Painful plucking was, but I hate shaving!  </li>
            <li> As a guy, buying any hair removal product beyond a razor, is just brutal.  </li>
            <li> : Ergonomics are horrible-</li>
            <li> that was painful!!!</li>
            <li> , wich is very annoying.</li>
            <li> Awful, stay away...</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible ergonimics!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wife and 3 daughters have used this product for over 10 years. Purchased new one because oldest daughter off to college; original is still working after replacing shaver head 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  If you have used an epilator the initial discomfort will be familiar. This product saves so much time. I can do my bikini area in minutes versus an hour waxing.  It&#x27;s faster,less painful, and easier than waxing. I wish I had purchased it sooner.</li>
            <li> The epilator did everything it was supposed to..  eliminated ALL of the hair on my legs and underarms without pain .  I am smooth all over!!  I will never shave again!  I am recommending it to all of my friends because of it&#x27;s ease of use and the best hair remover I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Most of these reviews are by people who&#x27;ve just opened the box.  Mine is different.  I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for 8 years.  I purchased this model because razors were causing:  1. Ingrown hair bumps; particularly in my bikini region, but other places I shaved, as well  2. My leg and underarm hair to grow in so thick, that even right after shaving, I still had small visible hairs (under the skin).  Like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  Sexy on a guy.  NOT sexy on a girl.  I found it stung a little when I tried to use it, out of the box.  So I shaved first, then used it every day for about a month.  Since the hair was so short, it felt more strange than painful.  After that, I could go a few days, and then use it without any pain.  It took a few months for the product to make a difference with the thickness of my hair; I had been shaving daily for at least 5 years, so I&#x27;d done plenty of damage.  But it DID change.  Problem number 2 cleared up, first.  I still fought problem 1 for a couple years more; but it was getting better.  I recommend Tweezerman - Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze, for those.  Problem number 1 has finally disappeared; the hair in the regions I epilate has become light and thin, like peach fuzz, rather than black and thick.  I find the unit lasts about 3 years, before you need to replace the blades.  So you save lots of money over using razors and cream.  The power supply will go first.  I just purchase one separately for about $10 when that happens, rather than replacing the whole unit.  Make sure to match the power units when purchasing; it uses a rare amperage.  Conclusion:  1. You look and feel sexier  2. You spend less time achieving #1  3. You save money  4. You read this far; so I&#x27;ll reward you with what some may consider TMI:  I use this product to keep the entire area between my legs hair-free and smooth.  Just be careful and pay close attention when working in that area.  Don&#x27;t try this half-asleep, people.</li>
            <li> It has been a couple decades since I have used an epilator. Wow, how they have changed! I am wishing I had tried this one years ago. I love it. I have thick coarse hair on my legs and it grows very fast; shaving doesn&#x27;t last long enough and I do not like the stubble. Waxing is painful and expensive. This device did&#x27;t hurt. It is more of a quick tugging kind of sensation, much like what you would have with tweezing only it does more hairs at one time. The results on my legs and underarms was very smooth skin. I recommend exfoliating before and a couple days after to help prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this item yesterday. I tried it today, I couldn&#x27;t wait but, when I saw it, it was a little frighting. Let me tell you it is great!!!! I have hair on my chin that I have used everything to get rid of and nothing worked, I would either break out which made it more noticable or it didn&#x27;t work at all. It does hurt a little, not as much as I thought, but the results are worth it. The only drawback is that it does take a few tries, what I am doing is, I did it once, waited an hour did it again and then once more. I would say it got 85 percent of the hair which for me was a tremendous improvement!! I am so happy that I finally got the nerve to spend the money.</li>
            <li> I used to pay for waxing. I chanced upon this product at a Sharper Image store and paid 99.99:-(. In my case I think  it is a worthwhile buy. LIke it says, it pulls out hair by the roots. It does its work. The first time it was a little intimidating. Now it is a breeze. I used to have thick black hair on my legs. Now they are really fine and not as noticeable. I dont have to shave or wax at all. It works great on underarms. It requires courage(HA HA HA) to pull out the underarm hair!!!! OUCH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it anybody who is spending more than 30 dollars per visit to a beautician and needs to go atleast twice a month!!</li>
            <li> I bought my Emjoi epilator two years ago, and I hardly use it. I was really thrilled about getting one at the time, but I didn&#x27;t find it practical enough for me to use it on a regular basis. Other reviewers have commented on it&#x27;s poor ergonomics, and they are right. I can never grip it comfortably. I do not have problems with the tweezing being too painful, but I do have to go over the same area multiple times for it to pluck all of the hairs. Sometimes I just find it easier to use my handy no frills tweezer. This isn&#x27;t a product that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Although my 1st review was basically saying how much it hurt and that after I was finally done removing the hair I was very pleased with the results. That was last night when I wrote it, but this morning is a different story. I&#x27;m feeling soreness and its still showing redness. Maybe its because I didn&#x27;t put anything afterwards to soothe the skin after having hair being pulled out like that.  I also wanted to mention that during the hair removal process I was bleeding from the hair being riped out. I could have been holding the machine wrong. Nonetheless which ever way I tried to hold it I still bled until I pulled out all the hairs and then it stop.  I still like this product and I&#x27;m hoping that with more uses the pain will lessen with each hair removal process.</li>
            <li> THEY EMJOI AP99 IS THE BEST PURCHASED I DID.I SHAVE MY LEGS FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS WITH EPILADY.I DECEIDED THAT WAS TIME TO HAVE A NEW ONE THEY EMJOI AP99 IS FANTASTIC HAVE 2 HEAD ONE FOR LEGS AND THEY ORDER FOR REGULAR SHAVING.THE PRESENTATION OF THIS ITEM COME IN A BEAUTIFUL CASE.AND MY LEGS STILL OUT OF HAIR FOR WEEKS.</li>
            <li> Compare to other brand I used before, I am much happier with this one.There is pain but the pain is less. For legs and under arms area, I am satisfied with the result, everytime I use it there is lesser pain and lesser hair. Over all I am happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> the emjoi AP 99 epilator seems to be probably the best one on the market. after reading the many other awesome reviews posted here, especially the person who said it worked well on thick  body hair better than all the others; I decided this was the one! [ also this kind was recommended by one of the transgender people in an online support group network] and so, being a transgender male [girl&#x27;s emotional spirit inside a physically male shell]who prefers that smooth, \\&quot;feminine-like\\&quot; feeling of having shaved legs, arms, and body; it definitely works even on the thickest hairs. it seems to miss a few spots sometimes, but overall it does work quite well. after a while, about a month or maybe 4 times, already the hairs seem to be growing in thinner and thinner, and in fewer places. and so it definitely works better than shaving and under the arms it does not even cause irritation at all and no irritation along the \\&quot; bikini line\\&quot; either.</li>
            <li> I have had many different types of epilators before from rubber band types to coiled metal springs, none of them ever pulled out much hair and the i ended up just tweezing most of them anyways. My sister had this emjoi optima epilator sitting on the bathroom counter and i just happened to try it. I was super suprised to find that it got all the hair on my face. I hate shaving so i tried cold laser and electrolysis treatment but none were permanent, all they did was make my face all red and turned the hairs white. This little emjoi epilator gets out any hair that you could tweeze with a tweezer, the only hairs left are the ingrown ones which of course is under the skin and cant be pulled unless u get a needle and lift if out. BELIEVE ME when i say this emjoi AP99 also known emjoi optima gold is the BEST DAMN EPILATOR U WILL EVER GET !! Just make sure u clean between tweezers when u see build of dead skin, so easy, i just hold a toothbrush on the lower outer edges on both sides while its on and it cleans itself. I cant say enough on how good this thing is, and im not exxagerating cuz i hate bull crap reviews on worthless products like anyone else.</li>
            <li> just for the record, i&#x27;m a 17 year old girl, and embarrassingly enough i have(or had) the pleasure of walking around with overly hairy arms. in the past, i&#x27;ve stupidly tried to shave them, bleach the hair, use nair, and other crap like that..but until recently i&#x27;ve just been sticking to long sleeves. a majority of the reviewers here only talk about using this epilator on their legs, pits, and bikini area..but let me just say it works just as well on arms, too. just a warning though, this thing hurts like hell! it may just have been because it was my first time using it, or because my hair was so thick and long, but don&#x27;t believe the whole \\&quot;you&#x27;ll only feel a slight prickling sensation\\&quot; deal. this little thing is also pretty intimidating as well...it scared the crap out of me when i first turned it on XD but all in all, i&#x27;m so happy that i invested in this product. it&#x27;s made me feel a lot better about my arms, and now i can wear t-shirts without being so self-concious :) thanks emjoi!!</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of the Emjoi line and of epilators in gen&#x27;l, so .. if you don&#x27;t mind the mild pain (in time, you do get used to it) then this is a quality product line. HOWEVER, I am a much bigger fan of the cordless one. This one, with its spinning motors in diff directions, actually got stuck and broke (after a bit more than a year, when I was totally hooked on its superior speed and efficiency). I haven&#x27;t bought it again b/c I love the cordless one and the travel size one so much. (I hate the cords and these two seem to last a bit longer.) My first cordless one lasted several years so I had to replace it. This Optima one is so much faster, but that cord is uninspiring after you&#x27;ve been cord-free for so many years. Stellar product line.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the only one of its type that I have found that is relatively painless (after the initial &#x27;exposure&#x27;) and performs fairly consistently. I have continued to replace it over many years.  The downside of this product is that it does have a finite lifespan, which is about 2 years. There are no replacement parts or service programs that I am aware of that do a good job. In other words, when I have had it serviced it does not return in tip top shape. I can tell that I&#x27;ve bought only a couple more months... long enough for me to replace it and receive the new one in the mail.     LOVE this item!</li>
            <li> I have owned other epilators before, and this one is definitely the best. It does the job twice as fast as any other. I usually took me about 20 minutes, and I did it in less than 10. I gave it only four stars because the shape is not all that great. It is somewhat difficult to hold because it is so different from other epilators. But eventually you probably get used to it. Also, the packaging is too much, and it is not easy to put the cord away, and it is not portable. I wish it came in a zipped pouch like most of the others do. But overall, I am very happy wiht the way it performs. It is the best epilator I have owned.</li>
            <li> I bought my first epilator six years ago. My old Satinelle is still working but it&#x27;s slow, so I bought this model and it&#x27;s really faster as promised. If you are not satisfied with your epilator&#x27;s performance, I recommend this model. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that the cord is attached to the side and sometimes it gets in the way.    About epilators in general, it&#x27;s the best method I found to keep my legs smooth. Shaving is cheap but the results won&#x27;t last and I always end up cutting myself. Waxing gives long-lasting results but it&#x27;s expensive and when I&#x27;m over, my fingers are all sticky. Also waxing doesn&#x27;t work if hair is short and while I&#x27;m waiting for it to grow, my legs don&#x27;t look their best.    On the other hand, epilators work best when hair is short (1-2 mm). Never try to use it on long hair, because it hurts a lot and the hair will break before it gets pulled from the root. If your hair is long, it&#x27;s better to shave it first and wait for two days before trying this product. Pulling hair from the root always hurts, but it will hurt less and less with time. Hold your skin taut and use this product frequently to keep your hair short and your legs smooth. You will save money (compared to waxing) and time (compared to shaving). And don&#x27;t be afraid to try it on your underarms and bikini area. You may find that these areas are not as sensitive as you thought they would be and epilated underarms look smoother than shaved ones.</li>
            <li> It works well at removing the hair.  If you have a tendency to have ingrown hairs then you&#x27;ll have them.  If not then you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used two old coil Epiladies for over 20 years, and the last one finally started dying.  I&#x27;ve had this Emjoi for about 3 months now and am happy with it.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t break down as some folks experienced.    GOOD: Works well.  Even underarms are easy now, and fast!  Not painful for me since I am pretty used to the sensation, just takes a bit of practice for newbies.  Bikini line tough due to angles but works ok with a bit of manuevering.  Well worth expense and slight initial pain.  Unit is light, though must use heavy plug.  Also, I thought the shaver attachment was useless but have actually used it several times already- a good addition.    BAD: Ergonomics are horrible- bad design makes it tough to hold and easy to drop (hence break); loud; no multiple voltage for international use; case is waste of materials, better to have a simple bag.  Overall, a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Emjoi gentle caress epilator, which lasted for over 10 years. It&#x27;s very effective for underarm and facial hair removal. Since getting this model, I&#x27;ve branched out to legs because of the wide coverage area.  The shorter the hair and more times you have used the remover, the less pain you will feel. The longer hair shaver attachment is perfect for this. I actually have no side effects any more (bumpy and red skin after use).  I can actually use it right before walking out the door. It&#x27;s the most comfortable model model of the two.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product and decided to give it a go and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  Yes, it hurts a bit.  No hair removal treatment is without discomfort but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable.  It simply feels like little pin pricks.  I use it every night.  The directions say to use it after a shower but for me that made it more uncomfortable.  So I use it on dry skin and then smooth on some lotion and good-bye razors!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products to tweeze the hair from my underarms and legs.  This is the best product I have used.  It is far from painless, but it is also effective and quick.  I feel confident enough to use it on the delicate skin under my arms and know that I won&#x27;t hurt myself.  I have worn two of these out over the years and given others as gifts.  I rate this as highly as possible.  Forget razors.  Forget the splashy ads that tell you that their product works under water (it doesn&#x27;t, I own it), or a spring works (it doesn&#x27;t, I own it), or a sanding disk works (it doesn&#x27;t, I own it, and you don&#x27;t want to see my legs after that fiasco!), or a green gel from Down Under will pull your hair off (it didn&#x27;t pull the hair but it did pull the skin!).  This is a good product, sturdily made, that will last for years.</li>
            <li> This is the one that I have been using for years until I ruined it pinching my sleeve in it. It never worked the same anymore.   If you want to buy it, buy this one for sure and you will never regret your decision. Works for me and I&#x27;m sure will work for you too.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Optima because my original Emjoi epilator finally quit working.  I had been using my original Emjoi Simply Gold for many years - it lasted much longer than one might expect and performed well up until the day it stopped working.  Having used an epilator for a number of years (15+), there was no other option than to buy a new one.  I bought the Optima with the hopes that  the dual head would work better and be more efficient than my previous one but that was not the case.  It works just fine but it does not work any better than my previous model that only had one head instead of two.  Some people have complained about the small size of this model and the position of the cord, but I am not really experiencing any issues with either.  The head itself it a bit bulky and does make it more difficult to use under my arms and on the bikini line but I&#x27;m learning how to make it work better.  It is more an issue with technique as I can make it work in hard to reach areas, I just have to adapt my technique to accommodate the different size of the unit.  Because I&#x27;ve been using an Emjoi for so many years, I do not experience any significant pain.  I would say, however, that previously I did not use it as much for underarms and bikini area and I now use it for those areas all the time (probably because it&#x27;s summer) and it still is not overly painful.  One downside to this model from my previous model is that the Optima is not as adept at grabbing really short hairs and I find some frustration when it won&#x27;t work as quickly as my previous model.  Again, I believe a change in technique might help produce a better result.</li>
            <li> I received my epilator approx. two weeks ago. I wish I would have known about this years ago as a teen. I would have prevented cuts and several scars from shaving, not metion having to shave everyday to keep smooth (hair free) legs, bikini and underarms. I agree with most reviews, it does hurt at first. I was able to tolerate it. No worse than waxing, at least you know it comes off the first time, unlike waxing that sometimes sticks and does not come off-ouch. Advice: let your hair grow out a bit to make sure you get all of it, it pulls it from the root. I removed the bikini area, legs and underarms. It&#x27;s been a 7 days and I have not had to use the epilator since. The legs is a bit different. I have had to use it every other day on the ones that grow unevenly. Absolutely worth every penny! The hair that is growing back is smoother and finer. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I use this to remove the hair from my Italian arms and love it for that! My arms are silky smooth and stay that way even when the hair grows in. I have had this product for 10 years and it still works great! I recommend:     -getting a professional wax first and then start using this  -showering and exfoliating and then pulling hairs right after shower  -it does hurt at first, but gets less painful, but there is always a little pain with it.  the more often you do it, the less hairs that are grown back and the easier the removal.    I have done my kneecaps, feet, toes (sometimes I get ingrown hairs on my toes since it pulls it out so hard) and that is the only place besides arms/hands/fingers that I can tolerate it.  I found it way too rough for my face and made me break out and extremely painful at the bikini line.    It works great though.  So if you can take the pain, buy it. It has saved me a ton of money on waxing my arms!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my third Emjoi Optima Epilator after my previous two stopped operating properly so obviously I think they&#x27;re great epilators. However, each of my previous two stopped working correctly after about a year and a half, so I highly recommend these epilators with one caveat: expect to receive one to two years of great epilating action but don&#x27;t be surprised when it stops working after that time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had this item before.  it works for about 5 years before I had to buy a new one and i use it often.  it is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators, almost exclusively, for the past 10 years. It just isn&#x27;t worth the hassle of shaving everyday. I&#x27;ve used the Braun silk-epil the last couple times and since I&#x27;ve had to replace it twice now because it simply stopped working, I thought I would try another product that I hoped would have a better lifespan. I also figured that since I was getting a new product, I may as well try to fix some of the other flaws I&#x27;ve found with the Braun product - hair grows back too quickly, hair isn&#x27;t removed fast enough, it is extremely loud, it sometimes simply does not pick up hair. So I tried the emjoi optima.   Huge mistake.   Some reviews had mentioned the ergonomics are not ideal. I have small hands but I am a grown woman (albeit, 5 foot 2) and after about a minute of holding this my hand was cramping up in pain - it was the same pain I experienced after writing by hand for about 3 hours straight. Thus I would say it is not that the ergonomics are not ideal, they are so terrible that it is difficult to use the product. For me, impossible.  The design of the head is also off. The blades are only in the middle of the device and they depress and need to touch the skin in order for it to work. the plastic parts next to the blades do not depress. So if you have parts of your body that have, say, bones, it is very difficult to get the epilator to remove hair without taking off slices of skin (a most unpleasant experience, and one I have never had with any other epilator).   There are two speeds, which would make sense, except that the device is not designed for the user to be able to guide the device to the necessary areas and still hold onto the epilator - the motor power sends all the energy into the head, which means that if you depress at 90 degrees as you are meant to do, all the pressure of a modulating motor is on the skin and in order to keep the epilator in place, you have to push it and hold it in place like you&#x27;re doing a serious exercise.   On top of all of this, it simply doesn&#x27;t remove hair. It leaves all kinds of stubble, not massive stubble but there&#x27;s no point to going through all of this if you can&#x27;t then slide your hand along your leg and have it be smooth. And it takes forever because you have to repeat areas endlessly to get the same result you would get on one round with the Braun device.   I horribly regret having purchased this device and wish some of the reviews would have been more explicit about what a terrible product it is.</li>
            <li> I have used the exact epilator for 7 years before it  broke, I am very pleased with my purchase, for 60.00 I will be hair free for another 7 years.</li>
            <li> Hurts like #$$%^ Worth the pain. I don&#x27;t have to sahve under my arms for 2 weeks!!!! Love it. Still hurts never got used to it. But 2 weeks, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> should have bought it a long time ago - no more shaving or waxing for me!  i was a little nervous because of all the reviews saying it hurt to use but i dont think it hurt that much.  like lots of little pinches.  i think to test your pain level you can try tweezing out some hairs without the emjoi.    again - LOVE it - my underarms and legs are soooooo smooth.</li>
            <li> I used to have an Emjoi that was battery powered, and that ended up lasting 3 years which I think is pretty good for the price.  Eventually, changing the batteries didn&#x27;t help anymore so I was determined to find an Emjoi that was electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this has so many tweezer heads as my old one only had two so I definitely noticed a huge decrease in time.  Now I&#x27;m able to do my legs and much more in the same amount of time.  I definitely noticed a difference in speed from my old Emjoi so I had to get used to how fast this new one was which can make it a little more painful than before.  I do notice that if the hairs are a little too long that the Emjoi will cut the hair rather than pull it out so it tends to leave red bumps because of that.  After they&#x27;re cut though, the hairs get pulled out much more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that the whole thing is super easy to clean.  Every part of it is detachable: both the epilator and razor heads, and the brush it comes with makes the whole process very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator is a bit bulky, but it just takes some minor manuevering adjustments to your old technique, and it works just fine.  The only thing I would change is to have the cord come out of the bottom rather than the side because it can make using it a bit awkward at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 9/19/12: After a couple of months of repeated use, I did notice that it was running as well as it once did, and while using it, I accidentally dropped it.  Needless to say, one of the gears was jammed on something, and I then began my disassembling project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off the plastic housing for the tweezers and the gears.  After taking the cleaning brush to all of the parts that had accumulated gunk and hair over time, I then began the process of reassembling all of the bits together again.  *Note: be very careful with the tweezers as they can be very tedious to put back in order, and come off the rotating rod very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much care and cleaning, I am happy to report that the epilator now runs like new!  Just make sure that when you do decide to take on the task of cleaning it that you are very careful in putting everything back as it was otherwise the tweezers won&#x27;t be able to line up and run properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/11/13:  RIP epilator.  My Emjoi has officially kicked the bucket.  It was working fine for a bit, but then began to run slower and slower with each use.  Now it painfully turns the tweezers at a snail&#x27;s pace.  Too bad the year warranty ran out.  This definitely seems like a well-timed flaw to me, and I will not be purchasing another Emjoi product./&gt;After much care and cleaning, I am happy to report that the epilator now runs like new!

            <li> I bought the Optima several years ago at Sharper Image when it was still a store.  Since then I have purchased several epilators looking for the \\&quot;newest\\&quot; and the \\&quot;best\\&quot; thing as most claim.  I have tried Epilady and Braun but I still keep coming back to the Optima.      One thing that I love about the Emjoi epilators is that their tweezers are metal.  Some other epilator companies do have models that use metal tweezers, but their higher end ones actually have one metal tweezer flap and the other side is plastic.  I find that those epilators don&#x27;t seem to grab my hairs as well as the ones with metal tweezers.  With the Optima, I&#x27;m able to pick up the most annoying hairs, all except for the extremely fine ones.      Another thing I really like about the Optima is that the rounded edges are exposed more on this epilator than my other ones.  This helps me get into tight curved corners without much problem.  I use this epilator everywhere I need hair removed and it gets the job done wonderfully.  My only wish is that I could find a company that incorporates the best of many brands.  I like the wet/dry option of some epilators and the cordless ability, but the Optima has the best curves to get into tight places.</li>
            <li> I had an Emjoi Optima for about 5 years. It finally died on me so I bought another one exactly the same. Why change a good thing? It does exactly what it it supposed to do. It may hurt a little in the beginning but if you&#x27;re like me you should get used to it. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all now. I love my Emjoi!</li>
            <li> I owned another emjoi before.  it worked fine for three years until I had to replace it with another emjoi.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> With patches of psoriasis on my legs, razors often irritate not to mention the bloody ankles or knees from a nic. The other reviews are true in regards to the pain lessening over time and the shaver attachment is great for underarms.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used and good god it was painful! However if you get the hang of it.. its very effective and works like a charm. Hope I get used to it soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for years, so this was a replacement. The price was most reasonable, the performance is fantastic.  This one works great on the fine hairs without a lot of breakage. For those first time buyers, yes it will hurt. But with every use the pain diminishes and the hair becomes finer.  Pays for itself in a short period of time.  I would have given a five rating but the cord placement is a little awkward. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I researched all kinds of products and stumbled upon this one.  It had the best reviews by far and with a 43% savings, I decided not to pass it by.  I am so glad with my decision.  It is the best method I have found for removing all those unwanted hair.  There is minimal pain (it IS pulling out multiple hairs at once after all) that can be quickly gotten used to.  Less pain than waxing. No mess like with shaving.  The first time I used it was a little time consuming but I think that&#x27;s because it is picking out every single hair, even those that might be too short to cut with a razor.  But after that, the time will get shorter.  I got it a week ago and my legs are still smooth.  Hair removal has always been a pet peeve of mine.  I have finally found a product that I can use without having to use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I am very hairy, for years I shaved everyday only to feel stubbly, my sister showed me this a year ago.  We started with my armpits..very painful the first time, even made me bleed, but I love the results! and the more I use it the less painful it is.  For the first time in my life my skin looks and feels smooth..you don&#x27;t see all the black hair stubs like you do with shaving.  So until I find a permenant hair removal solution I&#x27;ll keep using it...Thanks!</li>
            <li> i had an other emjoi epilator, but this one is more effective it hurts the first 2 to 3 uses but you get use to it.beauty does not come sheap  i do recommende it to the ladies who hate the mess of waxing(the waxing is great too but a little bit messy)</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend that had one. Hers had finally given up after more than 10 years of use. She claims it is the best. I had a bad experiance with an epilator when they first came on the market and have yet to try hers. She claims the pain is minimal and 10 years out of this product seems like a good deal.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought and it is better than my first (epilady) and third (braun) and even subsequent emjoi epilators.  Size and shape fits comfortably in the hand and helps give maximum angle versatility, power/strength is great, tweezer heads can be used at various angles and still epliate effectively.  The motor action also has a solid feel and sound (rather than hollow, shakey, and rickety like some.)  Although I have gone on to try other Emjoi models (Emagine, Light Caress), this one remains the undefeated champ for strength and angle flexibility.</li>
            <li> Have friends who have used this product for years and sung it&#x27;s praises -- it was all true!!   Free from daily shaving, free from bikini waxes, free from dark underarm shadows, and the list goes on.  I&#x27;m doing my best to get my teenage daughter to use it, to save her from all the hassless.  After frequent use, the hairs definitely come back in less numbers and much softer.  I see a huge difference after 4-5 uses over a 2 month period.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever. I am 8 months pregnant and since I can&#x27;t reach my legs anymore in the shower, I was having serious stubble issues.  This epilator is the best.  It is not even remotely close to as painful as waxing.  Definitely tolerable and my pain tolerance is not all that great.  I used it 2 weeks ago and still am stubble free.  A must have for busy moms with 5 minutes of shower time!</li>
            <li> You need to have courage or a margaritta before you do this, becuase it does hurt the first time- but after that its a breeze. Long lasting results. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I can say I own just about EVERY hair removal product out, and this is my all time FAV! I find the size and shape refreshing. It fits right in the palm of your hand to be held in a cupping manner rather than a traditional razor and most other electric removers. It is quick with amazing results. Though like any tweezing method it can be a lil bothersome at first. With regular use that lessons. After only using it twice for the underarms I find it painless and literally just as fast as shaving with a razor if not faster and no messy shaving cream/gel. To top it off, the hair grew back baby-soft. Since I have dark hair after shaving with razors the hair below the skin shows through the top layers of skin making a dark appearance, whlie this item leaves my pits looking clean!!! I love that it comes with changeable heads so you can clean up any hairs that you decided were too sensitive to be removed by the foil shaver head. I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I was so sick of shaving that I decided to give this a try.  I have a low pain tolorance and I have to say that it did hurt ALOT the first 2 times.  (I admit I had a glass or two of wine before doing it the second time lol) but after that the hair is much finer and since it grows back at different speeds its not as concetraited in one area...which is why it hurts.  I use this all the time now.  My legs are soooo smooth.  I usually do this once a week while watching tv.  It actually lasts for 3/4 weeks or so however since hair grows back at different speeds and depending upon how much of the hair was taken out by the root or if it just broke off I like to use it weekly.  It doesnt hurt at all now...although I read someone used this on their underarms.  I tried it and will NEVER do that again...that was painful!!! the bikini line is less painful than that.  This product works great and I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product - fast, less painful than Braun, i would even say cute, but it&#x27;s corded and the cord is attached to the side of the epilator, wich is very annoying. If it was AC/rechargable, i would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always considered myself someone with a high tolerance for pain...but after getting this thing, I may have to rethink that.  First off--the thing works.  You want to get rid of a huge amount of hair from the root, this little baby will work wonders!  You want it to be painless...FAT CHANCE.  When I first used it, I did not em-joy the amount of pain issued by this little bugger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use thing thing, the only thing coming out of your mouth will probably be AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHH!  (and if you&#x27;re creative like me, a whole lotta expletives as well!)  You *will* have red, and possibly bumpy skin afterwards...and if you&#x27;re really lucky, you may even have a few little pinpoints of blood where more stubborn hairs used to reside.  But rest assured, all of those pesky side effect will go away--and yes, the pain does get less each time you use it afterwards.  If you have a low tolerance for pain, can&#x27;t pluck your brows without crying, or can&#x27;t even pull a hair on your head, it probably would be best to stick to a razor or nair.  I&#x27;ve had my Emjoi for over 2 years now, and I have graduated into bikini area and underarms Emjoi-ing...a good tip is to use the Emjoi, then take a good warm shower.  I&#x27;ve found that Tea Tree Soap and a good lotion after the shower helps the pain subside greatly as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 18 years and love it.  It smarts the first couple of times you use it but the outcome is worth it...no stubbles.  After the use of the hair remover you will not go back to shaving your legs.  I can sleep at night in comfort without the hairs on my legs sticking me.</li>
            <li> Well, I was dumb enough to try this epilator again. Lo and behold, after a few months, the crazy thing stopped working ... already. My friend purchased a Emjoi facial product six months ago which sounds like it is on its last leg as well. We definitely won&#x27;t make the Emjoi mistake again, and we won&#x27;t be lured into Emjoi again with discount coupon deals. There is a reason that manufacturers offer seemingly nice discount coupons, and the Emjoi reason is that their products just don&#x27;t last. As other people have posted, Emjoi products die early deaths. It certainly is disappointing to waste so much money.</li>
            <li> This epilator is the only one I have tried.  It does well on the bikini area, but the legs is where it&#x27;s not great for me.  It seems to break a lot of the hair off rather than remove it from the root.  I don&#x27;t know if the hair needs to be longer before I remove it, but if it has to get THAT long then what&#x27;s the point??</li>
            <li> This item arrived DOA -- didn&#x27;t even get to the 6-month death that other reviewers speak of. What a waste of time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emjoi products truly are cheap. AVOID!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product on December of 2006.  The product was purchased ealier that year but failed so I had to get a replacement since it was still under the warranty period.  It works fine at the moment but I am not sure how reliable it is overall.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really works.  The only downside is that it only runs for about a year.  I&#x27;m now on my fourth one.</li>
            <li> I used to own an, Epilady, the coiled hair remover; I bought it brand new when they first came out.  I used it for awhile, it removed the hair on my legs pretty well, but, OUCH!  It really hurt, but when it comes to being without hair on my legs, I will put up with just about any discomfort.  The problem was, I could not use it on my under arms, it would catch and pinch my skin.  I also had a difficult time with ingrown hair; so you can see where this is going, I quit using it, and finally gave it away a few years ago, (funny thing, it still worked after almost 20 years of sitting).  Then a friend gave me her Phillips brand epilator, (she used it once, couldn&#x27;t take the pain), it was okay, but it took awhile to completely remove all of the hair on my legs.  This unit had a cord, and transferable head for a razor attachment, just like this Emjoi product does.  I kept getting ingrown hair, and stopped using the tweezer attachment, and just used the razor part.  My daughter wanted to try the tweezer head so she asked me to give it to her, so I gladly obliged.  So here I am again, I&#x27;ve decided to give epilators another try, mainly because the cost of razors, and the awkwardness of shaving in the shower.  I liked the fact that this unit is corded, I don&#x27;t lose power like I would with battery operated ones.  I thought about buying a Braun, but the heads didn&#x27;t look very big, and I don&#x27;t want to be spending so much time removing hair.  I decided on this model, Emjoi AP99, because of the 36 tweezers, and it is corded.  I am glad I did, it made short work of the hair on my legs, 20 minutes on the first try; it hurt some, but now the pain is minimal.  I have used it on my under arm area without the  skin getting caught, works fine.  I have not gotten any ingrown hair, I&#x27;m sure because I listened to all of the greats posts on this forum suggesting exfoliation, with a loofa, or salt scrub, or Glycolic acid lotions.  I expected to have a few small hairs left, but so far my skinfeels like I&#x27;ve shaved my legs with a blade razor, (I don&#x27;t expect that to last though, and I don&#x27;t really care if it doesn&#x27;t).  I am so happy with this product!  It doesn&#x27;t have a light, but I don&#x27;t really care about that.  Mind you, I am a fair skinned, with dark brown hair on my head, but my body hair is not thick and dark, it is medium brown and not too thick; so for someone with thick, dark hair, I couldn&#x27;t really tell you if it would work as well as it has for me.  I bought this product elsewhere, not even thinking about buying here on Amazon; one day I decided to look, and it was here, so when it goes out, I hope they still have it, because the price is great!  Hope this helps, and good luck to you.</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing since zip up wallets.  I love it so much I bought one for my daughter and my sister.  No more blood in the shower, and it takes so long for hair to grow back, that when it finally does it&#x27;s a surprise.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I had this product for 8 years or so and used it throughout the entire summer each year, it just stopped working not bad for a product that only cost $63.  It hurts to use, but the results are completely worth it.  Kudos to Emjoi for making a long lasting superior product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other &amp;quot;epilators&amp;quot; and I liked this one least for several reasons. I found the tweezing plates revolving in 2 directions, as opposed to one, rather uncomfortable. Also, the plastic pieces at ends (bordering the tweezers) were sharp and often scratched my skin. The biggest reason that I don&#x27;t care for this product is it&#x27;s size and shape. It&#x27;s small and thick and difficult to hold comfortably, often grazing my fingers during use. While this wasn&#x27;t painful it was certainly annoying. Of the products commonly found on the market, I prefer the emjoi &amp;quot;Gold Caress.&amp;quot; It&#x27;s easier to hold and use, and it&#x27;s less expensive. (The Gold Caress, however, doesn&#x27;t include a shaving head.)With this model you also have the choice of AC or rechargeable. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I mustered up some courage and tried my new epilator last night.  The results are extremely satisfactory. Although it did require several passes over the area.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being a epilator newbie, the pain was definitely less than waxing.  Optima was significantly less painful that I even tried it on the bikini line.  The epilator picked up hairs less than 1mm long.  Waxing cannot do that! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Many reviewers complained about the design of the Optima.  I found the shape easy to hold, but the power cord does get in the way sometimes.  Nonetheless, the performance I got yesterday more than makes up for its short falls. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall recommendation: Strong Buy</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator.  I wore out the first one because I used it for years.  I don&#x27;t shave my legs.  I use the epilator and the leg hair has thinned and is easier to maintain a smooth touch.</li>
            <li> Just received my new Emjoi Optima and am very pleased. I&#x27;ve owned a  Gently Gold model for about 3 years and will never go back to shaving. I&#x27;m writing this review to compare the 2 models, for anyone who is trying to decide which one to buy. The Gently Gold works great, but I prefer this newer model. I think it is faster -- and epilating can take a long time. I love having the interchangeable shave head, too. Even when I&#x27;ve taken my time, I have often found myself looking down at my legs when I&#x27;m at work,  looking at a wide swath of hairy leg. Today, I epilated, then quickly finished off with a shave, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the smoothest my legs have ever been. The Gently Gold is rechargeable and can be operated without a cord -- a nice feature, but only lasted for about a year.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A general comment.. I never wait 5-6 weeks between epilating. By doing it once a week, there&#x27;s really very little discomfort. So why not just shave? Can&#x27;t explain why, but I just don&#x27;t find epilating to be as tedious as shaving. When your hair grows back after epilating, it&#x27;s never stubbly, just soft.</li>
            <li> I am very thrilled with the Optima Epilator, ans compared to the prices of other shavers I looked at ....This was a great buy for the money. I will start off by saying that I have very corse dark hair on my legs, until now I have had to shAVE daily in ORDER TO HAVE SMOOTH LEGS! I had been shaving in the shower with shaving gel &amp; a Venus Razor. I ordered the Emjoi Optima, and decided I would quit shaving my legs, so that when the Emjoi arrived I would have leg stubble. The emjoi came on day three and my legs felt like prickly pears! I will say that the first time I used the Emjoi, IT HURT! Regardless of what the manufacture says, it hurt. On a scale of 1 to 10 it was a high 8. &lt;br /&gt;I pulled my skin taunt and used the shave in circular motions and it took me about 2 hours, beacuse I would take a few minutes in between strokes to take a deep breath! But that being said, when I was done my legs were smooth! I can go about 3 days with perfectly smooth legs, and about day 4 I begin to feel stub. I have found that if I use the emjoi every 3-4 days it is painless, and it only takes about 15 minutes. Once you get rid of the initial hair, it seems to get less and less painful. I use the emjoi optima then I use the goil foil shaver head to do a final pass over takes about 1 minute, and I am set for 3-4 days. I love this shaver and will NEVER go back to a wet razor! Please note per some of the other reviewers about red razor bumps and ingrown hairs?? I have had neither, BUT I do use a loofa daily in the shower, and pay special attention to my legs and arms when I know I am going to use the emjoi, I shower dry of then shave. I will say I tried this on my bikini line, I personnally could not get pased the pain, so I purchased a intimate shaver called the e-razor, very great product. I recommended this shaver to my friend, and she purchased the cordless version, not as good as it does not seem to have the power of the corded version. So I recommend the Corded Emjoi Optima.</li>
            <li> This shaver is really good for about one year.  I use it once every 10 days, but after one year of use, it gets worn out.  I wish it would last longer...  This is the second time this has happened to my razor...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve being using Emjoi for the past 7 years and they work great at the beginning but for some reason they start loosing speed until they die completely. This is probably the reason why they only give a one year warranty.</li>
            <li> Optima epilator cuts more than it removes hairs. Plus it didn&#x27;t catch all hairs. Awful, stay away...</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator after using an Epilady for a couple of years (off and on), and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  Of course it&#x27;s painful, if you&#x27;ve never used one before, but after even one use it gets easier.  I liked that I could finish both legs a lot quicker than when I was using my Epilady.  The cord is the only drawback (I was used to a cordless), but really it&#x27;s only a minor detail.  Good choice for an epilator.</li>
            <li> I was using the Emjoi Gold, which I thought was great, but it was old and tired.  Ordered this and love it.  It works even better than Emjoi Gold, gets my legs smoother, with less noticeable grow out.  I find the shaver attachment useless, but don&#x27;t need it.  The fact that it&#x27;s corded and not battery run doesn&#x27;t bother me either.  I actually think it may be more reliable as is.  I&#x27;ve tried other epilators and find this the best and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ok, this item is not for the faint of heart. Two wheels of fast-spinning tweezer blades is super intimidating. I was afraid to try it, actually. I have been waxing my own legs &amp; armpits for a year, so I am used to the feeling of hair being ripped out. Well, once I built up the courage to try it (on my legs first) I was SOLD!!! I epilated both legs (ankle to upper thigh) in the time it takes me to wax one leg from the knee down!!! It pays for itself compared to wax prices (even if you do your own). After doing my legs, I did my armpits - very pleased. I am now getting rid of ALL my messy wax. This is also an environmentally friendly product, as there&#x27;s nothing to throw away!!! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this. Just beware: if you have never waxed before, you definitely should before trying this product. There is NO way that ripping hair out at the root could be pain-free. Logic should tell you that. Also, I would never use this on \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair. But from a year of waxing, my hair grows back so thin &amp; fine, that this is perfect. I would say waxing does hurt more than this product, though not pain-free. If you&#x27;re used to waxing, BUY this!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi! It is money well spent. I have hirsutism where I grow an thick unsightly patch of coarse hair on the underside of my chin. It is extremely detrimental to my self esteem. Waxing, shaving, and dipilitories all leave stubble within a matter of 24 hours. ALTHOUGH THE EMJOI SAYS NOT TO USE IT ON THE FACE, I use the Emjoi on my chin because the hair is very tough. (Even facial depilatories do not work for me) It hurts a lot, but that should be expected with any type of epilation, and you get used to it, and the sacrifice to be hair free and smooth is totally worth it. I found it less painful and with less side effects than electrolysis which is unbearable and requires longer treatment time in one sitting. What doesn&#x27;t even get done satisfactorily in 45 mins of electrolysis is done in 15 minutes with the Enjoi...and the pain subsides much quicker, and the skin is a LOT more smoother. The directions are easy to follow. The shaver smoothes the skin by getting rid of the stubble after using the tweezer attachment, so hair removal is COMPLETE! I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it works. I have tried EVERYTHING. I want to find whoever invented this and plant a big HUGE kiss on them! I will always rely on my Emjoi. I really have no compaints.   For what it&#x27;s worth it comes in a neat case for the unit and the attachments.</li>
            <li> Great lady&#x27;s shaver, the best I ever had. The two headed shaver is great, it&#x27;s fast and efficient. And the service was good, the packaging and arrival date was as expected.</li>
            <li> This is my second Emjoi product - bought this one b/c I thought my old one had stopped working, but it was just the cord that had worn out (I wasn&#x27;t being very gentle when wrapping the cord). Definitely go with a corded model: don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of juice.  (I agree that this little round shape is a little harder to hold.)  This is JUST LIKE getting your legs waxed in terms of prep &amp; care for potential ingrowns but WAY cheaper!  Like waxing, over the years your hair may gradually get more fine (mine did).  It&#x27;s particularly good for underarms - for decades I had the \\&quot;nubby\\&quot; look unless I had JUST shaved; now I am no longer paranoid about lifting up my arms.   And even though they tell you not to in instructions, I&#x27;ve learned to VERY carefully use on my lower face - looks more natural to take out the long fine hairs (using at a slight angle) and leave the small, short ones (my opinion: a bald upper lip looks icky)  HIGHLY recommended.  Wish I knew about it when I was in my 20s.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Is a little bit uncomfortable but I don&#x27;t have to shave so often.</li>
            <li> Holy Cow Batman - IT HURTS ! But it also works ! Wish I had tried this years ago. Did my legs and arms in about 30 mins. Only thing better is Laser Hair removal, which I did on underarms and  bikini about 7 years ago and still no hair regrowth. That is no joke also, it feels like someone is snapping a rubber band on you but sooo worth it. My tips if you do Laser - pay a flat price for hair removal usually 6 treatments so the incentive is to get rid of your hair, if you pay per session - the incentive is to drag it out for more $$.  If it doesn&#x27;t hurt like hell, then the technician isn&#x27;t putting it high enough. That&#x27;s just my opinion.  I didn&#x27;t do my legs with the laser because it was fairly new and the price was too high, also my legs are tan. Laser works best on light skin with dark hair.  Back to this Epilator - I chose it over the Braun because of mostly positive reviews here so THANK YOU to all of you who took the time to review.  LOVE THIS EPILATOR !</li>
            <li> I have used an epilady for about 30 yrs. My leg hair does not grow back anymore except on the knees. My epilady didn&#x27;t get them very well. I decided to purchase an emjoi optima. WOW, it did the job quickly. I love it!!! It is small, quick and easy to use. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now. Such a good investment!</li>
            <li> I have used this same epilator for several years, and this purchase was because my other one was worn out.  For me this product works, does what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> When I shave, the results only last a day and regrowth is too noticeable to not shave everyday! Because the price was pretty steep and epilating seemed painful, I waited a while to purchase this product. However, I&#x27;m extremely happy I purchased the Emjoi Optima, because not only are the hair growth on my legs less noticeable, I also don&#x27;t have to go through the hassle of shaving EVERY day. Although, I still have to use the Emjoi every couple of days - its still a lot better than shaving! Keep in mind that the first time you use the Emjoi, it hurts a whole lot, but using it afterwards is nothing (when compared to the first time).</li>
            <li> It works great!     Let me start by saying that this unit is not cordless, although it is a good length. All the pictures I have seen show it without the cord. Turning it on is the scariest noise in the world. It sounds like some sort of torture device but it really does work once you get brave enough to actually put it onto your skin. It is not for fine hair. It will just break the hair but if the hair has a thickness to it, it will pull it out by the roots. It&#x27;s best to take a warm bath/shower before to open up the pores so you don&#x27;t feel the yanking as much. It also hurts less if the hair is not too long. A few days growth after shaving is best. If you have long hair make sure to put it in a ponytail before you begin, that is if you want to keep the hair you have on your head! You will have redness afterwards and it does hurt but you do get used to the sensation of having the hair ripped out by the roots. I use hydrocortisone cream afterwards to soothe the redness and the stinging and that seems to help. I have not been brave enough to use it on my armpits but I&#x27;m sure that I will. It&#x27;s a bit hard to use on my shin bones and knees probably because there is not a lot of skin to press the unit against. I also find it hard to use in the bikini area simply because the head of the unit is very large. The shaving attachment is great too, but be careful with the trimmer, it is sharp. Hope this helps all of you that have been on the fence about purchasing this epilator! I will never use a razor again!</li>
            <li> This is my third epilator.  I can&#x27;t imagine removing hair any other way.  It removes hair better than waxing..with the convenience of shaving.  I use it for underarms, legs and bikini line.  Yes, the first time is painful, but after that its smooth sailing.  The Emjoi can remove very short hairs.  If I can see a hair, I can remove it.   With waxing, you have to wait until the hairs get long enough, and them you don&#x27;t get 100% of them.  I&#x27;ve been using this device for over a year, and haven&#x27;t gotten the ingrown hairs that I got my older epilators.  The shape is easy to hold and use.  Stop shaving, stop waxing..but this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted the results of waxing without waiting for the wax to heat, the mess of cleaning wax off of my skin and the bathroom floor, or the expense of paying someone else to do it.  I read reviews and went for this one.  Don&#x27;t expect it not to hurt a little; it hurts a bit more than waxing, but it&#x27;s more than tolerable (I have a high pain tolerance but I think most folks could hang with it).  I use it to give myself a full brazil monthly and am mostly happy with the results.  Not as good as wax, but worth the trade off. &lt;br /&gt;The real key is to exfoliate everyday.  I have more trouble with ingrown hairs than the epilator.  Worth the dough.</li>
            <li> It is indeed the best epilator ever, I had it many years ago and last for many years too, and was very happy with the product and the result...  I decided to try a different epilator product recently and was very disappointed, then I AM SO GLAD TO PURCHACE A NEW \\&quot;EMJOI\\&quot; EPILATOR AGAIN TO HAVE THAT EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE AGAIN.  Thank you Amazon!  Sha, California</li>
            <li> A good product overall, but didn&#x27;t like the following things about the product:  1&gt; The charging chord is a little short than my previous Braun Epilator.  2&gt; The charger is a heavy one compared to the one from Braun.  3&gt; The charging chord connects at an uneasy place on the Epilator; this causes the handling of the epilator a little difficult especially if they are on the sensitive areas of the body. We wish the chord was connected like in other Epilators at the rear.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve owned a cordless version, but the battery would run out before I finish shaving my legs from top to bottom.  If the buyer tends to be hairy, I recommend this model.</li>
            <li> I had this item previously, and was searching for a replacement. I purchased other epilators but they didn&#x27;t come close to doing the job emjoi did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with this.  I&#x27;ve never waxed or used anything like this before, and still the pain is not unbearable.  It works best if the hair isn&#x27;t too long (usually a day or two after shaving).  I haven&#x27;t had success in the bikini area at all, and the underarms are pretty painful, but it&#x27;s great for legs.  It&#x27;d be nice to have a cordless option, but it&#x27;s not a big deal for me.  It is a little noisy but no worse than an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this product roughly a year ago. And for the first few months, it was great. It worked just the way I thought it would, and I used it nearly twice a week because I felt more comfortable the more I used it. I hate hair, my family make fun of me because I seem to have an obsession with always being completely hairless on my legs and armpits. Well, after about 3 months, I noticed that it was becoming less reliable. It was picking up less hair, and I would have to go over the same spots over and over again. Later, the spinning twizzer wheels would constantly get jammed and would just stop until I turned it off and readjusted them. At first, it would happen maybe once every time I epilated. After a few weeks, I had to thrown it out because it would get jammed after every 10 seconds and I&#x27;d have to constantly readjust it. Believe me, this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve had trouble with Emjoi products. I&#x27;ve used two different types of epilator products from them before, and I should have known better to buy this one in the first place, because both those others had similar problems. But I figured since this one was so highly reviewed, by now they would have worked all the kinks out. Nope, I was wrong. But you don&#x27;t have to be. I purchased the Braun Silk-epil Xelle Body System, Model 5270 right after I threw away the Optima... and so far, no problems! I&#x27;m completely in love with it--it works so much better than the Optima and I recommend it highly to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator and I love it!  I think its great for someone, like myself, who has never used one before.  It is not painful, the feeling is more like the \\&quot;pins and needles\\&quot; you get if you sleep on your arm wrong at night.  And its easy to use and removes most hair quickly and efficiently.  Its extremely easy to clean, and comes with a fun little carrying case.  My only complaint is that it does not remove short hairs, so if you&#x27;ve shaved recently it may not get all the hairs out.  I&#x27;ve had to use it for a few days in a row to get 100% smooth.  But its well worth it!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here I felt that I had something to contribute so decided to post my own experience after 3 years of use with this product.     1) I am on my third broken unit. The units last less than one year. The company is not responsive when the unit fails and will not sell you replacement heads. The gears are made of nylon and the inherent weakness results in the gears stripping. The unit plugs quickly and is difficult to clean. When it heats up it is less effective because the gears no longer grab as well.     2) The unit is fairly slow overall. Much slower than shaving. If you are doing your full legs for the first time expect a couple of hours worth of work. I have dark hair and a lot of it, so perhaps less time for others..but it is SLOW. Prohibitively slow.    3) The unit is a little awkwardly shaped which makes it difficult to get into the nooks and crannies.    4) This unit is comparatively very expensive and the durability makes it not worth the investment.    5) The shaver attachment is worthless and the brush that comes with it for cleaning the head loses its stiffness and no longer effectively cleans out the head.    The positive is that this is a dual head system and it is effective at pulling even very short hairs or very course hairs. I would continue using it if the product was more durable and perhaps faster.</li>
            <li> I have been using hair removal systems for a few years, and this one is by far the best out there.  Ingrown hairs were the only problem I experienced, but I found a great solution to that problem.. \\&quot;PFB Vanish\\&quot;  Before PFB Vanish, I was frustrated with ingrown hairs and the sores that it created.  PFB Vanish and emjoi together were the perfect solution!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first and I love it.  I will admit that the reviews before about the pain were right.  I have come up with a tip though:  the instructions state to use the epilator after a shower when the pores are more open:  Well, I decided that using a heating pad on the area should work pretty good.  IT DID!  On the areas I don&#x27;t use the heat pad I can&#x27;t stand to use the epilator, but on the areas of the heat pad, what a difference.  I can tolerate it.  I was tempted to put the epilator away and never use it again because it did hurt so much.  But not anymore.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> 25May2008  Paula here in Phoenix. Don&#x27;t buy the Emjoi AP99 or the Emjoi AP98. Sadly, the tweezer head gears break too soon in both units. In just 5 months I went through 3 AP99 tweezer heads, and one AP98 head with a second about to go. They work great when they work. I&#x27;m trying the Braun units, next. They have a better reputation.  Paula</li>
            <li> It hurts like the dickens, but what do you expect?  It says it right in the description that it pulls the hair directly from the root.  If you have thick hair, or long hair, it might be a good idea to trim it down a bit before you begin.  I&#x27;ve always had woolly mammoth arm hair, so that hurt way worse than doing my legs.  I let my leg hair grow out a week before I tried it and it worked great.  Not a super smooth feel, but I figure that each hair is growing at a different stage, so it will probably take a couple of times before I get that \\&quot;silky\\&quot; feeling.  It&#x27;s been several weeks and I feel like I have the \\&quot;day after\\&quot; feel on my legs, but my arms are still silky.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I liked emjoi&#x27;s older eplilator products, which I used to own. Well, this emjoi is a replacement for my older emjoi, and now I wish I kept the older one. The optima is harder to handle, (no grips on it) my hand slips down it all the time turning the unit off, so I have to turn it back on again. I have small hands so I find it harder to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, it does the same job my older one used to do, and I must admit I have gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my epilator for about 2.5 weeks now, so not long, but I already love it. The first time I used it I did my armpits and it was absolutely beyond painful. I&#x27;m talking sweating, shaking, crying. I bled really bad. It was horrible. I read a million reviews and knew it would be painful but I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how painful it would be! You definitely do not want your hair to be long. I shaved then two days later used the epilator. I found the first time I used it the dual heads were too much so I tipped it up and only used one tweezers head. It took away some of the pain. I have super dark hair and when I shave I still have that \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; in my armpits and have always been embarrassed by it. So far I still have a \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; of the hair right below the skin but I&#x27;ve read that after a few hair cycles it will all even out and go away. I hope so! The next day I did my entire bikini area, I&#x27;m talking full brazilian. It actually didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as my armpits. I did bleed and the area was red and inflamed for almost a week after the first time but now it&#x27;s fine. It took me about an hour to do my bikini area the first time but now it takes mere minutes. Now on to legs on day three. Legs didn&#x27;t hurt at all. At first there&#x27;s sort of a \\&quot;pinching\\&quot; feeling but you get used to it really quick then you&#x27;re fine. You do have to go over your legs quite a few times to get most the hairs and you won&#x27;t get that \\&quot;freshly shaved\\&quot; feeling for a while. I still don&#x27;t get it, but I have read that it&#x27;ll eventually get there. Either way, I *look* hair free so that&#x27;s all that matters! I swear the first day I used this I told everyone how horrible they are and said I&#x27;d never be singing it&#x27;s praises, but two weeks later I&#x27;m telling everyone I know to get one! One trick I learned, I put a generous amount of baby powder over the area I&#x27;m epilating (except my legs) and it helps keep me from sweating and it helps the tweezers head move more smoothly along my skin. Also keep the skin pulled as tightly as possible. Oh, and if you do the bikini area, make sure you watch what you&#x27;re doing, the head is huge on this and it is very possible to get your lady parts sucked into the head and stuck. It HURTS. Don&#x27;t ask me how I know, though, haha. People weren&#x27;t kidding about the pain, but it really DOES go away after the first or second time you use it!</li>
            <li> Hoo yeah, it really takes the hair off, but if you wanna go with this bad boy, you have to ask yourself, \\&quot;Is my hair issue bad enough to warrant putting myself on fire?\\&quot; For me, the answer was yes. I have thick, coarse, black hair and skin as pale as death. After I shave you can see my 6-minutes-after-i-shave-shadow, and that has always burned my biscuits.  So, instead of selling myself on a street corner in order to raise the money to afford laser hair removal treatments, I bought this, and boy-howdy does it hurt! The brochure that comes with it says you might feel a tingling sensation.  Seriously?  It&#x27;s plucking out multiple hairs at a time from areas that we do not normally pluck.  It feels closer to being flayed alive than a \\&quot;tingle.\\&quot; The good news, though, is that the hair grows back at different rates, so if you use it often, like once a week, it won&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as it did the first time you used it.  Don&#x27;t kid yourself, though; it&#x27;s always gonna suck.  But hey, I&#x27;ve never been smoother!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get one thing straight here: I am a 22 yr old guy and I personally hate my leg and armpit hair. Because of this, I started shaving those areas two years ago. I shaved them every day but my hair would keep coming back so I would have to do it again. I also didn&#x27;t like having to spend my money on new razors, shaving creams, waxes, or other hair removal products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I searched online for th right hair removal product for me, and chose epilation. I noticed that this epilator was the one with the most high reviews so I decided to get it with the gift certificates I got this Christmas. It came a day later and and I cannot tell you how excited I was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this epilator was actually not as bad as I had expected (because of all the people who had said how horrible it feels in the reviews), but that may be because I had shaved two days prior. To describe the pain, it kind of felt like my legs were getting rug burned, but withut the lasting pain. Now just to let you know, my leg hair is dark and thick, and in my opinion looks disgusting. The next day I epilated again to continue to get my legs used to it, and to get other hairs in other growth cycles. It still hurt to remov the hair, but it went a lot faster because I was starting to know what I was doing. I then skipped two days to see what it would be like with more growth, and it didn&#x27;t hurt more then before. Overall, my legs turned out smoother then ever before, ad I didn&#x27;t notice any red bumps (might be because of my brown Hispanic skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the one time I got my legs waxed, I feel that the pain was less, and that I could take the pain much better because I was in control of what happened. Also, I learned that if you start with the most painful areas and then move onto other areas, it will make the whole experience much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I think of the unit? I think it fits quite well in my hand. I don&#x27;t know what others are talking about when they said it was uncomfortable to hold. Maybe it is because I have larger guy hands or something. What I do is grasp the unit on each smaller side with a pinching grasp. That seems to work very well. I like how the unit has two rollers, which not only pulls out twice as much hair as compared to other units, but it also gives me a good visual for knowing when I have aligned the head in the correct position. I like how the cord unplugs both from the wall and the unit. That makes it easier to clean the unit because the cord doesn&#x27;t get in the way. The exfoliation pad really does wonders for me, and the shaving attachment works quite well on my arm pits (shaved them first, and then epilad later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this unit to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to shave, and doesn&#x27;t want to spend the money on waxing, laser, or electrolysis. The unit is cost effective, works extremely well, even for a guy like me, and comes in a case that allows me to keep my hair removal discrete and personal. I should have bought this unit a long time ago! To all guys thinking of gettin an epilator, you can&#x27;t go wrong with his one, and to the ladies, if it works well on a guy then it should work just as well for you!said it was uncomfortable to hold.

            <li> really like this product, does a large are or skin at one time and is powerful.  this is my third optima and maybe my sixth epilator (all from emjoi).  they only last 2-3 years but that is all i use on my legs (no shaving).  i love that even when the hair starts to grow in it is not as prickly as with shaving. works great on the top of my feet too for sandals!</li>
            <li> I have waxed all my life and being a mother of 4, it is very time consuming and a headache to have to wait for the hair to grow before I wax! I tried Emjoi optima because a friend told me she doesn&#x27;t wax anymore. what she forgot to tell me was that I don&#x27;t have to wait for the hair to get to a certain length! I tried Emjoi two days after I had shaved and I had tiny hairs starting to regrow and I was amazed at how quickly and efficiently this thing pulled the hair from underneath the skin! i am in love with it and am noticing I am wearing shorts and skirts more often because I don&#x27;t have to wait!! the whole process of touch up takes about 10 minutes and presto. done. I don&#x27;t feel pain because of years of waxing. I tried under arms and the pain was tolerable although I have been shaving it. I don&#x27;t think I have ever left such a long and thorough review for anything before. If you are hesitating you should give it a try. I love this little machine. life is easier, good bye nasty wax lady!</li>
            <li> i have been using the braun hair remover for some time now after a my shins were threatening to sue me for manslaughter. i needed a safer way for hair removal.      i purchase this after reading reviews. it works better than my braun. after the first time, you don&#x27;t feel a thing. i&#x27;m even now using it on my underarms.       the only caution is ingrown hairs, which will happen with any of these types of devices. there are lotions to use to avoid that (look in the men&#x27;s shaving section).      your legs look great, hair grows back finer, and no nicks, scrapes of cuts!</li>
            <li> I purchased my emjoi optima from sharper image for $100.  At first it was a little intimidating - It&#x27;s scarier just getting started than it is painful.  The first day I used it it hurt a little, but I got used to it within the first few minutes.  It felt as if I was receiving small shocks at first with every hair being pulled, but once I convinced myself that it was hair being tweezed and not shocks I felt a lot less pain!  My skin feels so soft and smooth.  I opted for using it a day or so after shaving so it was pulling less hair out at a first.  I then used it every day for the first week, getting those hairs that were slower growing.  I will never go back to shaving again.  The underarm area had me scared because so many people said it was so much more painful than the legs, but I found it felt no worse than razor burn when using it at first.  Unlike razor burn, though, the discomfort didn&#x27;t last after I was done removing the hair from that area.</li>
            <li> Compared to other epilators, this one is great at removing hair.  It has two heads, so it seems to be twice as fast.  The little roller bar that is meant to dull the sensation does dull the prickly feeling, but for me epilators are not painful anyway.  Also, it got most of the little hairs that the other Emjois often miss.  The heads pop out very easily, so this is the easiest to clean of any epilators I have used.&lt;BR&gt;Now the down side.  Terrible ergonimics!  It is very short, about half as long as other epilators, and very wide and squat, since it has two heads. The cord is placed right on the side of the squatty little thing, so it is always in the way.  There are no thumb grips or any other things that might help.  I found that the cord got in the way, especially for the underarms and bikini areas.  I dropped the thing three times in one session, and kept getting my fingers in the way of the tweezer heads.  If it were not superior in hair removing abilities, I would return it due to poor ergonomics. If you have any kind of grip problems, or large hands, I can&#x27;t imagine you would be able to use this.  Go with the Braun silk epil, it works about as well, and you can get a grip on it, or the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress, which is rechargeable. Don&#x27;t give up on epilators because of this poorly designed little thing.&lt;BR&gt;Emjoi, fix this design and you will have a great product.</li>
            <li> First let me say I have very dark, very coarse leg hair and even after shaving you can still see the hair on my legs and a couple hours after, it is already prickly again. So this product does work with coarse hair...I&#x27;m not sure about fine hair. Anyways, I hated it so much, and started waxing. I then began to hate that...letting your hair get that long stinks, and $50 a visit began to drive me crazy! After doing some research I decided to invest in this product and have never been happier. I received it a little over a week ago and my first experience with it was painful. Let me tell you, the first time you use it, it kills! This may be because I have such coarse hair though. After thinking about it, I also think it is the same pain level as waxing, however, it seems worse at the time because you are doing it to yourself and can stop and agonize over how much it hurts instead of someone just ripping away. Anyways...a week later...as with waxing you do have a very tiny bit of growth...not even noticable but I have always just glided a razor over it but it&#x27;s not necessary. I just decided to use the epilator again real quick to get a little more growth that has started and it didn&#x27;t even hurt. You just need to learn to pull your skin really really taught. The only negative is I found it very hard to get my knees, but I feel like I&#x27;ll catch on soon enough. Also - if you&#x27;ve ever noticed, with waxing they usually start half way between your knees and ankle... do the same when epilating because it is much more sensitive around your ankles! So if you do experience a lot of pain during the first time...don&#x27;t give up! Take it out again a week later and you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised. Just don&#x27;t let the growth get too thick again or else you&#x27;ll go through the same amount of pain as you did the first time. By epilating every week that shouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I am used to doing home waxing, so I guess I am used to having the hair removed by the root.  Even the first time using this product I didn&#x27;t feel any pain.  The only thing I can say is that it was a little scary when I first turned the thing on- a bunch of metal tweezers making a hideous sound.  But it&#x27;s a great product that does everything its supposed to.  Personally, I think it hurts a lot less on the bikini line than wax as it doesn&#x27;t pull your sensitive skin there.  I use it on my legs, bikini line and underarms without problems.  Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Emjoi is a great epilator but I gave it 3 stars because it is not comfortable to hold and it quit working after 1 week.  The product works great for it&#x27;s purpose, I would love more it if it had a better way to handle- it&#x27;s a little small.  That aside I will continue to use until I find a better product.  Amazon quickly replaced the broken one- I am pleased with Amazons customer service!</li>
            <li> At first, it was a little prickly, but after the initial time, it wasn&#x27;t so bad;I love this little machine.  I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and my skin is so soft.  I will never go back to shaving again.</li>
            <li> (4.27.09) Still using it.  Works great all this time later. Loving the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find this product to be painful at all.  I had sensitivity around the ankles, but nothing that made me want to stop using it.  You have you use it a few times before you have the full effect of hair removal.  But after I used it only twice, I loved the difference that I felt.  Very effective!  It looks and sounds very scary/intimidating, but it is really a fantastic product.  I am reccommending it to all of the women in my life.</li>
            <li> This is my second Emjoi Epilator...My previous one lasted several years without my doing any preventive maintenance...I just had to purchase another because it&#x27;s the only device that removes my tough leg hairs...And the hair \\&quot;disappears\\&quot; for a good couple of weeks without having to remove it again...Also the new hairs seem to be much finer than when I use a razor or conventional shaver...Finally, as long as my current Emjoi lasts at least two years, I&#x27;ll buy a third one; I&#x27;m just that pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Still using with no problems after years of use.</li>
            <li> This hair remover is great because it removes the hair faster and with less passes over the same area.  I remove hair on my legs and arms and this does it faster and neater than the other emjoy units I have.</li>
            <li> I have tried these types of products before, and have never been happy with them. Then I decided to do some research and find out what the &#x27;reports&#x27; said were best. This product was listed as one of the best... I read what the users of the product had to say and then decided to give epilation one more shot. I have to admit... I HATE TO SHAVE!!! Not just a little, but with a passion. So, with that being said I&#x27;ll commence with my review. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Do your research. If you have a lot of hair, like me, you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time epilating. Shaving is quicker, but epilation last longer. &lt;br /&gt;2. If you want totally smooth legs, this product is NOT for you. It leaves little spots of lifted skin and some hair breakage. It can&#x27;t be avoided no matter how slowly you go over the skin. &lt;br /&gt;3. You DO get used to the discomfort after a while. Not the first or second time you use it. But it does go away and you get used to it. I haven&#x27;t used it under my arms yet but on my legs I am used to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. In the beginning, I used Tylenol and that seemed to work. &lt;br /&gt;4. I&#x27;ll repeat what I&#x27;ve read from other consumers; EXFOLIATE, EXFOLIATE, EXFOLIATE... ingrown hairs are a problem. &lt;br /&gt;5. I do remain hairless for as many as 4 to 5 days at a time. Normally, I would have to shave every day. For that very reason, I would recommend this product to anyone. Like I said, \\&quot;I HATE TO SHAVE\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping.</li>
            <li> First time user, just can&#x27;t stand the pain! So thank goodness it comes with an electric razor head, to bad it does not work real well. I would of been happier with a good electric razor for the money! If you can stand the pain it does pull those hairs right out, if not try somthing you will enjoy for awhile!</li>
            <li> Not as painful as I thought it would be on the legs, just some slight prickling, like little pins, you can definitely tell it&#x27;s working. I thought with this having two heads I wouldn&#x27;t have to go over the same area again and again, but I do, this is a major drawback. Horrible for the bikini line, don&#x27;t even think about it, the pain goes from feeling like little prickles to feeling like great tufts of hair are being pulled out at once, when it&#x27;s really only getting a few; it also seemed to skip over my skin and pinch me as well, and we all know you don&#x27;t want to be pinched there. Overall: Recommended for legs and large areas where skin is taut and easily accessible, do NOT buy this product in hopes of using it on your bikini line- Buy the Braun Silk Epil Xelle for that instead.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I had 3 weeks worth of growth on my legs that was soft/fine from previous waxings.  It really didn&#x27;t hurt, just a very minor pinch and removed about 90% of the hair in about a 20 minute period. Although this was efficient, I didn&#x27;t get the smooth feeling you get when you wax or shave. Also, the hairs slowly began to grow back within a week so I had to go through the process again.  It&#x27;s a great product to get rid of most of the hair, but if you want that smooth feeling you get when you wax or shave then it probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator in years, and I love it! My legs and underarms are smooth and the shaver feature keeps my bikini area just the way I like it.  I spent years waxing before this so I have baby fine regrowth.  I am saving money and time.  The Optima is powerful, easy to clean, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time two days ago and I was really pleased w/ it! Too soon to know if ingrown hairs will be an issue, so that&#x27;s why I only gave it a 4 and not a 5.  On my first try, I did my legs AND my bikini line! I had an Epilady epilator back in the 80&#x27;s and that was a true torture device. I tried it twice and never used it again.  The Emjoi is NOTHING compared to that! If I was brave enough to try my bikini line on the first day AFTER doing my legs, that should tell you something, haha.     I would stress 2 things:     #1: DON&#x27;T use it on hair that is full length! I believe that makes a BIG difference it the amount of pain people experience. I shaved my legs and then let them get a bit \\&quot;stubbly\\&quot; THEN used the emjoi.   #2 Hold the skin taut and just take your time - dont&#x27; try to rush.     When I finished, my legs were smooth as if they had been waxed w/o the mess and w/o the hassle of going to a salon. Trim the bikini line first -  DO NOT use it on full length hair -- I did a few full length hairs and I definitely felt a difference! If you can stand the pain of waxing or the pain of tweezing your eyebrows - then you can totally do this! It hurts a little yes, but nothing, NOTHING like that old epilator!!</li>
            <li> Works really well but hurts. I have a pretty high tolerance of pain and this was tough to bear. It feels like someone is scratching and pinching your skin all over. I&#x27;m DREADING doing my underarms. If you think you can handle the pain and discomfort, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This system is better than shaving, since instead of cutting the hair it pulls it out completely. The hair then takes longer to regrow and over time will grow back thinner. I have to admit, the first couple of times it does hurt (it&#x27;s almost like waxing), but you get used to it and the pain goes away. I&#x27;m not sure if I would use this on my bikini area, but it works great on legs. This is a great product if you&#x27;re looking for a way to keep your legs free of hair longer and is cheaper than getting a wax.</li>
            <li> I used a much older epilator and really liked it, but it had seen its last days.  So I got this one.  I didnt feel any pain, probably because I had been using one for so long.  The OPTIMA is great.  Its small-fits in the palm of your hand and is contoured.  It&#x27;s not for the face just the body. I had never used my old one on my underarms-just a regular razor.  But I did use this OPTIMA under my arms and had no pain at all.  Bye the way, in the years that I&#x27;ve used an epilator I&#x27;ve never had an ingrown hair.  I like using the epilators because the hair takes longer to grow in and is much finer over time.  When the companines say that it&#x27;s not just a selling ploy-its the truth.  A definite bonus.</li>
            <li> I bought this product shortly after my son was born - with no time to do anything other than take care of him, my beauty regime was out the door and my hair removal schedule was no existant. It took me a full week to get the courage to try it on myself. The thing looks terrifing and I was sure that little bits of skin would be getting pulled out. The noise does not help either - same with the power of such a little device.  But my husband put the tweezing section right up to the palm of his hand to show me it was perfectly safe. A big swallow and 10 minutes later my legs were hair free and smooth. This epilator works and works well. I am a seasoned waxer and used to wax myself on a regular basis. No more. This is worth the cost because it will save you time! On top of that, it is far more effective. Waxing used to leave behind little tiny hairs that I would have to go in and pull one by one. Or I would miss a whole section, causing me to have to heat everything up again, get the strips out, etc.  Now with this, just plug it in, zip zip like a razor and you are done - without the stubble or little hairs cause this will get them out. It takes a bit of practice on the knees and round areas but it works. I highly recommend this product and can&#x27;t believe I have not bought one sooner - or why anyone would want to wax again after this. It is far less painful, far less messy, far less of a hassle and works much better! If you are on the fence about it, take it from me, buy this product and you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I love my epilator.  I have owned this for about six months and my legs have never felt smoother.  I had patches by my ankles that I would have to shave everyday.  Now I use the epilator once every 8-10 days and my legs no longer feel stubbly, the hair is baby soft.  My skin is very sensitive and as long as I use soothing lotion after, I have no problems with irritation.  Great product!      EDIT 07-14-2010.    I recently replaced my Emjoi with another epilator, biggest waste of money ever.  My old worn out Emjoi did a better job than this brand new Braun.  The new one breaks off more hair than it pulls and my hair grows back in stubbly - just like shaving.    If in doubt, buy the Emjoi with the caveat that the Emjoi Optima is too bulky for optimal use underarms and in the bikini area (can be done, but not easily).</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on this product and about how great it was about removing hair, I figured I give it a try!!! I was a little leary about some of the reviews mentioning that it was a little painful at first, so I mentally prepaired myself for that. I even plucked a few hairs from my leg with a tweezer before I ordered the item to see if I could stand the pain. Painful plucking was, but I hate shaving!  &lt;br /&gt;  NOW,not only did I get my package in a super fast delivery speed of only two days (Free shipping too.) But when It arrived and I tried it for the first time, it didn&#x27;t hurt?!?!?! The individual tweezer plucking was ten times worse. Could I have been using it wrong? I wasn&#x27;t cause I could actually see the little hairs with the routes on the epilator. LADY&#x27;S IF YOU ARE ON THE FENCE ABOUT IT BEING PAINFUL, TRUST ME, IT&#x27;S NOT THAT BAD AT ALL. I will warn you though, when I got to areas on my leg that had more fat on them, ie., inner thighs it stun a little, as long as you pull you skin taught though, you&#x27;ll be fine!!! By the way IT WORKS, IT WORKS, IT WORKS. I AM EXTREMELY IMPRESSED! BRAVO TO THE INVENTOR. THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT! A+</li>
            <li> I found that the optima generally broke off the hair on my legs more often than it removed it from the root. This results in a need to either shave or use the epilator again within a short period of time. I also found that it wouldn&#x27;t even pick up some hairs despite my going over the area repeatedly. Overall I had hoped that this would replace shaving which it hasn&#x27;t so it was generally just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Painful but effective.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 09/2010&lt;br /&gt;My epilator stopped working and I decided to buy a different brand.  However, it has worked really good for all of this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really great!!!  Sure, it does hurt, but not any more than waxing.  I do not shave because I get cut very easily.  This is a great alternative to expensive waxing.  Even when I have more hair it works.  I would buy this product again, and again.</li>
            <li> Purpose of the purchase: underarm. I dont have much leg hair.    My personal experience:  Trying it on underarm for the first time, was painful. I&#x27;ve never done waxing before. Always used a razor. So first time using this product to pluck my underarm hair was painful. However, I found a good angle to use it in about 20 mins of struggling and now I love it! Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s really not that painful and it&#x27;s safe to use.     Using on underarm for the first time:    Tip 1: Turn it on and gently touch the running head with your finger. Just to see how it feels like. If you&#x27;re gonna try it on your underarms, which are more sensitive, it is definitely safe to touch it with your finger. This is just so you know how it feels like against your skin.     Tip 2: Try it on your legs first. Just to see how it feels. Keep in mind, your underarm skin is much more sensitive. (I&#x27;m sure everybody knows that already.) My first experience on the legs was pretty good. It felt like scratching an itch.     Tip 3: when trying it on the underarm for the first time, if you notice your underarm is getting red, switch to a different underarm. I find that both of my underarms have different sensitivity levels. One of them is much more tolerant to pain than the other. Once you get a hang of it on the less sensitive side, you would have much more technique to use it on the more sensitive side.    Tip 4: have a cold towel ready. No Aloe Vera gel yet. The instruction says only use it afterward.  So I used a wet towel. When you start to feel any discomfort or redness, use a cold wet towel to dab around your underarm. It makes you feel better. Give your underarm a rest. In the meanwhile, try it on the other underarm. Gotta get used to it, since you already bought it, right.     Tip 5: I have a few red bumps afterward and I did have a minor bleeding. Very little and that&#x27;s not bc the product is not safe to use. It&#x27;s bc I&#x27;ve never done any waxing before and it was on the sensitive underarm.My skin was getting used of something plucking hair out of the skin! Everyone will probably experience things differently.    That&#x27;s my first experience with Emjoi. I dont think I will go back to using razor again. I hope these tips somewhat helps you if you are thinking to use an epilator on the underarms.    I havent tried it on the bikini line yet. I think today I&#x27;ve experienced enough.  Anybody has any tip for that?</li>
            <li> This product may be exactly what it is supposed to be, however I used it for aproximately 2 minutes and could not stand it any longer. Despite the fact that I followed the directions given for maximum efficiency and for least amount of pain, it was extremely painful. The amount of hair that was removed was almost unnoticable and I was bleeding to the point that it was on the epilator. If more hair had been removed I might have suffered through but it was clear it would have taken at least an hour or more to complete the process. I was unwillingly to endure the pain for that long. My hair was not extremely long and so this could not have been the problem.   Again, the product may be a good one, maybe it is supposed to hurt this much. My pain tolerance is fairly good. I have had several surgeries and managed high pain levels with minimal pain meds. I cannot imagine anyone enduring the epilator process though. Waxing never sounded so good.</li>
            <li> Evidently the person below this got a defective one cause mine barely hurts compared to the other devices I have used.  I use it even under the arm to get rid of hair it does hurt duh but not like the old ones.  Gets the hair on the first couple of passes instead of trying over and over again till you want to scream and DO.  I used to have the rechargeable Emjoi but it died rather quickly and was not able to be used with the cord.  Been using removal systems for over 20 years since the first epilady (ouch remember that eeeeek)</li>
            <li> The Epilator is very easy to use, but annoying to clean after use.  Not only is it painful to use... but I also got a rash on my legs from using it.  My doctor says its very common and he does not recommend me using it again, because obviously my skin was too sensitive.  My sister, however, uses one and has not had a problem.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands.  I love this product because it does not hurt and it grabs all of the hairs.  With the past epilators I used I would have to go over the same spot many times and would still have hairs left. With this product one pass and all of the hairs are gone.  I can&#x27;t remember when my legs were last this smooth. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I had the original Emjoi for many years and loved it.  This model is great too, and the extra blade for long hairs is a plus that the other did not have.  But having large hands, this sometimes is tricky to hold, and because the cord comes out from the side, instead of the bottom like the original, it gets awkward at times handling.  But I still think Emjoi makes an excellent product.    I think when this goes bad after many years of use, I&#x27;ll think which I will purchase next, this one or the one closes to the original.  If I find I am using  the long hair blade, then I would replace with the same, and if not using the long hair blade, I would replace with one similar to the original.  So over all, I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> PLEASE MAKE THIS MODEL AGAIN. IT WORKED BETTER THAN ANY OTHER. Oops, sorry for yelling. Please. Loved it.</li>
            <li> this product was everything that i hoped it would be so thank you for the swift and easy transaction. the product got to me in a reasonable fashion.</li>
            <li> I use this product every week and love it, my husband loves it too!  No more nubs!  I have owned a variety of these products over the past 20 years and this is the best.  I feel no pain, only smooth legs!</li>
            <li> i am absolutely in love with this product! although the first couple times i used it, i was kind of afraid of this contraption, i have gotten use to it. the pain is barable, on you&#x27;re thighs it does hurt more. the only thing is that i never feel completely smooth. i always have a few stubbles that are too short or thin and this epilator cant get it..</li>
            <li> I do not know about this particular product but someone needs to inform SI that charging state sales tax on federal postage rates is illegal. I am curious if the states have been collecting this illegal tax. Yes, I called SI and was told that not only are you charged state sales tax for handling but also for the postage as it says when one checkouts, and since states do not charge sales tax on stamps I am curious where this money has been going all these years.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator about 3 months ago and here are my thoughts on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- saves money on razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- good on large areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- entertaining if you&#x27;re bored&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- no matter how many times you use it, the pain does not go away (you have to be drunk to use it on your bilini and use tranquilizers to use on your armpits)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- ingrown hair can be a problem (especially in the bikini area)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- hair doesn&#x27;t grow back that much slower than shaving (after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the epilator doesn&#x27;t pick up fine hair - if it does, it just rips it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these 3 years ago and it finally died. I love it so much I bought another. The emjoi is the only thing i used to remove leg and underarm hair, so i&#x27;d say 3 years is a good lifespan.     It DOES hurt a little at first. I had gone a few months without using it after it died, and when i first used my new one it did hurt a bit. However, it my underarms were completely smooth for 9 days before any signs of hair regrowth, AND the hair is thinner and blonder (i have thick dark hair, normally.) I know a lot of people say these things cant make hair grow back thinner, but mine always does. If i shave with a razor, the hair comes back black and thick. When i use the emjoi on my legs it takes about 2 weeks to grow back, and it doesnt seem to hurt as much on legs the first time. The trick is to hold the skin taught.    also- if youre going to use it on your underarms, you should do so at night, or at a time where you will not need to apply deodorant soon after. If you try to put it on right after removing your hair, its going to sting A LOT. i put deodorant on before if i have to do it in the morning, and then use it to remove the hair. You also should be careful not to apply lotion right after using the emjoi. sort of like not using salt scrubs if youve just shaved (you probably shouldnt do that, either, lol.)    I recommend this product to EVERYONE. i&#x27;ve told all my relatives and friends to get one. it beats having to buy razors and shaving cream and shave all the time... AND its $30 cheaper on amazon than anywhere else!</li>
            <li> I have had my Emjoi AP99 for about a year now and it is the best investment I ever made!  I was shaving almost everyday and would have stubble within hours.  Now I use it probably once a month and when the hair grows back its so soft that you will NEVER feel prickly stubble again.  In fact, I cant even tell when I need to shave except by looking because you cant feel the hair on your legs.  This product really works as good as it says it does.  The shape makes it a little difficult to hold without it slipping once in a while but once you get used to it its fine.  As far as pain, yes, it does hurt the first few times you use it but after that its not bad at all.  I suggest doing little spots at a time and holding the skin tight, it helps.  Once you use it a few times it doesnt hurt.  I have graduated to the bikini &amp; underarms and its not painful at all.  This is a great product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago to use on my upper lip.  I&#x27;m still waxxing, I just can&#x27;t get myself to use this thing.  I&#x27;ve tried several times, but dang it looks like it&#x27;s going to chew me up and spit me out! Maybe someday.  I feel I wasted my money for now.  I did investigate the different epilators and this one rated as one of the best, especially for the money.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair remover.  I am not going to lie it is not painless, but it gets less painful the more you use it.  I use it weekly so there is less hair and it is finer.  Also, use a exfoliating sponge daily to prevent ingrown hairs.  I had an earlier model and it seemed to be a little easier to grip, but this one works fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator since 1989.  This is my third Emjoi Epilator.  It is far superior to others that I have tried over the years.  The multiple rows of tweezers make the job quick and easy.   Prevents ingrown hairs, and reactions to creams and razors to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  Sorry,  I had such High hopes, but this just hurts.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I used it on my legs when I first recieved it in the mail and the emjoi removed the hair from my legs very nicely.  There is a key to helping yourself achieve very smooth legs. That is to progress very slowly in a given skin area until there is no hair left on that patch of skin, then move on to the next area of skin on your leg or wherever you are epilating.    What I want to make clear is that you most certainly will feel persistent pain the first few times of use, afterwards your skin will get used to it, hopefully.</li>
            <li> I like this product. The only con I can honestly admit to is that it takes a little time as opposed to shaving.  You may have some hairs that are stubborn and repetition is necessary; however, It lasts longer than shaving and it has a smooth feeling to it.  My husband loves it. Also, the hairs grow back thinner so therefore if you are pressing for time you basically wont look like \\&quot;Wolverine\\&quot;.  Try it! I love it.</li>
            <li> So, six months later I decided I should update my review. I haven&#x27;t used this in about 5 months and I would no longer recommend it. First of all, I started getting ingrown hairs that were an extreme annoyance and didn&#x27;t look attractive. I also decided that the pain of using this wasn&#x27;t worth it as it never got better, even after multiple uses. Most importantly, every time I used this product I would also have to shave the areas that the epilator missed. Shaving just became a bigger deal than just using a razor in the shower. Don&#x27;t waist your money... you may love it at first but after time it won&#x27;t be worth the money.    Here was my original review 6 months ago:    I love this product! Prior to buying the Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator I was either shaving every day or walking around like a Wooley Mammoth. :O) I have thicker hair on my lower legs and very fine hair on my knees and upper legs. I tried this product a week ago and my hair is still gone! I&#x27;m amazed. For the people who are worried that it will hurt, you&#x27;ll be fine. Trust me, the little annoyance is worth it. Due to the different types of hair I have, I went over my legs at both speeds to get all hairs. The first time I epilated it took about an hour. I have recommended this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have read many of the reviews but none specifically mention the chin.  Can you use it on the chin/face?  Is it effective on the coarse black hairs?</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, it hurt...A LOT. However, I soon learned that shorter/trimmed hair diminishes the pain factor a great deal. I love this product b/c it gets rid of underarm hair, and the regrowth is often finer and easier to get rid of. Just be aware that it will take a few hair growing cycles to notice a real difference. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best method of body hair-removal I&#x27;ve found (I&#x27;ve tried shaving, waxing, depilitory creams, etc.)  It has the advantages of things like Nads--you get a smooth, non-prickly feel for days, but much faster and less messy.  Also, you only need a little bit of hair length for it to work (In fact, the shorter the hair, the better).  If you haven&#x27;t shaved an area recently, do a quick shave over it first to minimize the pain.  Also, do NOT try to use it on your face (serious ingrown hairs).</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I love it. It works great for me but that might be because I enjoy pain.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews before buying this product and there wasn&#x27;t many out there about sensitive skin.  I decided to give it a try and if it didn&#x27;t work I&#x27;d send it back.  I&#x27;M IN LOVE.  I works wonderfully.  The first couple times I used it I only did small sections, I wanted to see if I would break out in rashes, which I do when shaving(no matter what I&#x27;ve tried).  I had the red bumps at first but they were gone within a hour.  With shaving I would have to shave every two days or the hair would irritate my skin.  I actually got lazy an went two weeks, and it did not bother me!!!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the job this product does - it pulls the hair from the root quickly and easily. I would take this over shaving any day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Quick, easy, and lasts longer than shaving. I love it because I can do it while sitting in front of the TV, rather than being trapped in the shower with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;-Your hair will begin to grow in thinner and sparser as time goes by. My mother has been using one of these for 10 years and she only has to do \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot; every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;-Great for those of us with thick or dark hair. You don&#x27;t get that \\&quot;hair under the skin\\&quot; look that shaving gives you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The pain of the first two or three times is intense. Your eyes WILL water, your skin WILL turn red (and possibly bleed) and you WILL begin to think you&#x27;re crazy for continuing. By about the fourth time though, you&#x27;ll barely feel it at all and you&#x27;ll be happy you kept at it.&lt;br /&gt;-Ingrown hairs. Since the hairs become weaker as you use this, they might start having a problem breaking the skin. Rubbing the area you&#x27;ll be using it on with the included loofa in the shower before you do it works wonders though, and is highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;-Yes, it lasts longer than shaving, but not by much. Unless you&#x27;ve hardly got any hair or it&#x27;s very fine, you&#x27;ll still find yourself doing this every few days if you want to stay smooth.&lt;br /&gt;-By far the BIGGEST MOST FRUSTRATING drawback is the fact that this product does not last long. I am ordering a new one today - my second one this year. After a while these things slow down and barely work. Sometimes they even just plain break. I am on my 4th one in only two years. Even with very careful use and cleaning every time you use it, you will probably find yourself replacing this once or twice within a year, and they aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product and haven&#x27;t ever considered discontinuing use. I would recommend this to anyone who is sick of shaving and wants to try something different!</li>
            <li> This is a great product which reduces the need to shave to once a week. I recommend purchasing the one-year warranty when purchasing this product as weekly use tends to wear it out prior to one year.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  My first one died so this is its replacement.  I purchased a different model from the same manufacturer but it is not as good as this one.</li>
            <li> While I found the device to be somewhat effective in removing hair (I did eventually grow accustomed to the sensation and it did indeed become much less painful than the first experience), I found that the rotating tweezers would break down and stop spinning after just a few months.  I foolishly thought I would give it another try, so I bought another one and the same problem occurred.  I might add that I noticed that the best results would occur when the product was new, and that it actually seemed to gradually spin more and more slowly over the course of use, until it actually just stopped working just a few months later.  Perhaps my experience is unique, but I will certainly not buy the Optima again.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for many years and I find this product to be very easy to use and fast with the new double heads. The only thing that would be an improvement would be a travel bag instead of the nice box in comes in. I also prefer the epilators with a cord because that last one I had the battery didn&#x27;t last very long. If you haven&#x27;t tried a epilator in many years you need to try it again. They are not that painful as before. I received my product in a timely manor. I only wish Amazon would take paypal.  KRK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator for several years and I love it. It removes unwanted hairs efficiently and it takes a long time for the hair to grow back. Therefore, I would never go back to shaving. It is also a reliable product since I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and I never had problems with it. I highly recommend the Emjoi AP99 Optima epilator.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I would recommend it to anyone. I received it in a quick and efficient manner with no problems what so ever.</li>
            <li> It has been more than a year and it still works. It is kind of slow nowadays but it is still effective in removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine, yes its hard to hold but not impossible. But what i really love about it is that it removes all the hairs and quickly. It worked great on my arms and under arms.I&#x27;m spanish so I have dark hair in my arms and it removed them completely and I can go 2 weeks with out having to go over it. On my legs I did get hair bumps but I&#x27;m going to try it couple more times to see if that stops. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all on my legs, arms. stomach and underarms. But in the bikini line there was some pain but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable. I&#x27;d def recommended this product. Try if it doesn&#x27;t work for you return it but like I said in my title for me it exceeded all my expectations!  *****UPDATE******  I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and in my opinion it works the best on fine hair. My arms were never shaved so I had fine hair therefore I had the best results on my arms. I&#x27;ve given up on legs, I get the worst hair bumps whenever I use this machine and it takes a while for my legs to look good again. Also I really hate the design I&#x27;ve dropped this machine several times because it just slipps off my hands. Last time I used it I dropped it and it&#x27;s been slow if it dies I won&#x27;t be replacing it. I dont need to use it on my arm pits and bikini line anymore because I&#x27;ve been getting laser treatments.  Overall I&#x27;ll give it a 3 * because I got great results on my arms.</li>
            <li> I was a faithful Epilady user for years. Then I got lured by the high ratings of the Braun 5270... and bought it...and hated it!  A friend recommended the Epilady Optima, and life is back to good. It works fast and efficient. I can be done in 20 min (vs. over an hour with the Braun) and because it works well, it&#x27;s actually much gentler on the skin in sensitive areas. So the Epilady gets my vote, hands down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this epilator for a few weeks but it sure works good.  I did shave my legs the day before it&#x27;s arrival so I had to wait a day or two before using it.  I found it to be not that unpleasant so maybe the key is to start with stubble.  I was so impressed with this unit I purchased another, smaller size for my upper lip.</li>
            <li> It covers a larger area so it takes half the time.  Its a bit uncomfortable to use in curvy location such as underarms and bikini line.  However it comes with a sensitive skin shaver attachment which is painless and removes unwanted hair quickly.  Can&#x27;t use this product on face (at least its not recommended.    Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> At first I was very nervous about epilating. I have never bought/used one before. I read reviews for several epilators and I decided on this one. I purposely chose one that was NOT battery operated (I read a few reviews that the battery life is short on these.) Also I followed advice that others gave; I took a warm shower and exfoliated beforehand. (Make sure you do both!) The rotating blades were very intimidating at first but after I got over it, I realized that this was the best purchase I have ever made! It was simple, easy, and it did not hurt !! No more waxing! No more waiting for the wax to heat up or anything! This epilator glides against your skin; it is as easy as shaving. I will never shave or wax again! Granted, I have been waxing for a year before I bought this product. My hair is finer than it was a year ago and my hair follicles are probably used to the hair being pulled out; so it was painless and my skin was not red/pink afterwards. I wish I would have discovered this miracle product earlier! It would have saved me lots of time and money waxing! This product also comes with a nice case to keep the epilator protected from the other items in your bathroom (or wherever you plan to store it). I plan to give an update after a few weeks or when the hairs grow back.</li>
            <li> I currently use products like NAIR to remove facial hair on my upper lip and side-burn areas.  I think that it&#x27;s effective,  but I&#x27;m in those teenage years where if I put oil on my face I break out!  I was wondering if this product would be better being that it doesn&#x27;t include putting oil on your face or will it give you bad in-grown hairs?  Also I was a little confused-  It&#x27;s not like shaving right?  More like plucking? I would really appreciate a response, Thanks!</li>
            <li> It comes in a very pretty case, which makes it a perfect gift. (And it looks lovely on my bookshelf too!)    When I first tried it - it REALLY hurted, but when I finished with both hands and feet - pain went away at all, and I started to search, where else could I use it.   Anyway, even when I started, it hurted less, then laser epilation (and is also a way cheaper!)   Manufacturer claims that it suits for underarm area - for me, it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve got several wounds. But for arms and legs - it&#x27;s perfect!   The design is really nice, and the set includes a shaver head, so my boyfriend liked this thing too!   Want to buy one more as a New Year present for my sis (and her boyfriend)</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and had to rush home to try it out!  I tried it out on my underarms and one of my lower legs.  The legs were a bit painful, but nothing too bad.  Like past reviewers felt like a mix between rubber band snaps and electrical shocks.  But it was completely bearable.  The underarms were a bit more painful, but completely worth it!  I had 2 days worth of growth and it ripped the hair out right from the roots, shaft and all!  I was amazed at how thoroughly it removed the hair.  Less than 2 min per arm and I was 100% hair free!  Waxing normally took me 20 min per underarm and I had to spend another 20 tweezing out the missed hairs.   This is a definite timesaver and as long as the results last as long as waxing, I&#x27;ll be very happy!!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If you are looking to use this just for your legs - great.  I got it less than a week ago and love it.  The first time was not pleasant but not terrible.  It does take some time but after a few days most of the hair is gone so it is quicker. BUT....underarms and bikini not good.  The biggest issue is the curve of tweezers has an angle that does not match other parts. The hair that was removed left red bumps.  So I would say great for legs but that is all.</li>
            <li> I received this product a few days ago. I used it for the first time tonight. First, I must say that I am not too fond of the shape and design. But I worked with it. The first place I used this Emjoi Optima was on my underarms. IT WAS PAINFUL. On a scale of 1-10 I gave the pain a 20. I had to stop and start over and over again. I didn&#x27;t even have that much hair because I had shaved just a couple of days before I decided to use this product. Less hair does not necessary mean less pain.For me the pain was just unbearable. It took me  1 1/2 hours just to do under both underarms. After I was done with both armpits I was VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS AND THAT THE PAIN WAS WORTH IT. IT REMOVED ALL THE HAIRS. I will never use a razor on my underarms again. This product is it for me. This was my main focus. Shaving with a razor just didn&#x27;t remove all the hairs and the more I tried to shave it the more the bumps would appear from shaving. I just hope that by using this product no more bumps will show up and that I will just have smooth soft underarms.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand using this thing on my legs because it hurts way too much. But I started using it on my husband&#x27;s back hair about a year ago. It quickly tears all of his back hair in less than 10 minutes. I can&#x27;t say that it isn&#x27;t painless for him. Actually, I kind of enjoy making him squirm. We only need to use it about once a month to keep him completely smooth. Unlike the other reviews, I can&#x27;t say that his back hair has decreased or become more fine with use, but I can say that it works better than any other device we&#x27;ve tried and is much cleaner than sugars and waxes.</li>
            <li> The emjoi has no joy involved, but it does most of the job. You have to get used to the feeling of it. It also takes a few times of going over the same spot before it gets everything. I still can&#x27;t do the entire leg, too painful. But, for quick, do it yourself hair removal, I still recommend it. Just remember to exfoliate ladies!</li>
            <li> I have had my Emjoi for over two years now, and it still does a good job for me. The product removes hair at the root, leaving skin silky smooth for about a week or so until new growth begins. If I used it more often, I am sure that after some time, I could use it even less than 1X per week. It will even remove very short hairs. I use mine on my legs and underarms. I am not brave enough to use it in the bikini area. I have light-colored, sparse hair, and I really don&#x27;t think it hurts at all to use - - - I have a friend who has dark, coarse hair, and she couldn&#x27;t stand to use it, so be advised. For the times you need to be done in a hurry, it even includes a shaving head attachment.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Speaking of being in a hurry - - you had better have some time to devote when you use this product. It takes quite a while to do a good job -- you will have to make many passes over your legs in order to do a good job (of course, the benefit is smoother legs for a longer time than shaving, and hair grows in thinner and sparser with each use.) One serious drawback though is ingrown hairs. If you use this product, I guarantee you will get them.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, I guess all in all, it does what it says it will do. Just keep in mind that if you have dark hair, it will likely hurt, and be prepared to spend some time when you use it. Just a final thought - - you can help keep the ingrown hairs at bay by using a natural loofah with some grainy scrub when you shower, as well as using a lotion with alpha-hydroxy in it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If all that sounds like a big pain in the a*s to you, I would stick with your razor.</li>
            <li> When my Emjoi Gently Gold Caress broke (after years of use - I whole-heartedly give it five stars), I bought this, thinking more expensive means better.  This was unfortunately a bad assumption and I really wish I&#x27;d just bought another Gold Caress. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Optima doesn&#x27;t fit well in my hand and the cord often comes out while I&#x27;m using it on my legs since my hand is brushing up against the spot where the cord is attached to the epilator (if you&#x27;re going to make a non-cordless epilator, make the cord permanently attached!!!).  Also, because it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable to hold, I am not always able to hold the skin of my underarm taut and the skin gets pinched (one time it drew blood). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the end, I do still use it and it is better than the Braun I bought in between the two, but I wish I had the Gold Caress instead.  It fit well in my hand and because it is cordless I could use it without an outlet nearby.</li>
            <li> I think I will just start shaving with a machete.  This son-of-a-beach hurts.  I know some people are into pain (you dirty little sadists!) so you will probably like this thing.  I, on the other hand, have sensitive skin to go along with my sensitive soul and couldn&#x27;t tolerate this devil devise.  Be warned, friends. . .be warned.</li>
            <li> After owning an Epilady for 5 years, I was hesitant to try a new brand.  However, after receiving this product, I am glad I switched.  This product performs outstanding and the curved head is a plus.  The only thing that I need to mention, is that this epilator is not cordless, something that was a plus on the epilady.  However, that was an oversight on my reading the description of the item.  A great product at a great price.  I am a satisfied customer and have recommended this product to others.</li>
            <li> Hurt like CRAZY the first time I used it.  &lt;br /&gt;First time:  Took about 1 hour for both legs (Dark Course Hair) &lt;br /&gt;After this first episode I thought NO WAY!!!!!!!!I will shave 3 x a day before I do that again.  But after about a week (must have forgot how much it hurt) decided to do it agin. &lt;br /&gt;Touch-Up:  About 1 x per week; average about 15 minutes  &lt;br /&gt;Hardly any pain, just a kinda \\&quot;pinch\\&quot; feeling when it grabs the hair. but really NOT A BIG DEAL. &lt;br /&gt;After the leg&#x27;s I decided to do the bikini area.  SURPRISE!! Not bad at all. Ok it was not the most wonderful experience but really waxing is worse. I was so confident went to my underarm.  BIG MISTAKE!! I almost cried. It hurt so bad I only got 1/2 of one arm done. Too scared to try again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I dont like:   &lt;br /&gt;1.  THE CORD.  Get a cordless.  Cord not that long, and it detaches easily from end of unit. (no battery backup) &lt;br /&gt;2.  Must go over same spot a few times to remove hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I like: &lt;br /&gt;1.  I dont have to shave everyday. &lt;br /&gt;2.  Pulls hair leaving no \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.  For the most part it does exactly what I need it to do...... REMOVE HAIR!!</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old male in great shape(just so you all know im no wimp). When I used the trimmer on my Arms the pain was so bad I about passed out(not joking). This may work out better for womens legs because their legs are used to being shaved so the skin is much tougher. It will irritate your skin(similar to when you get waxed: red bumps). It for the most part removes the hair at the root. I myself am going to stick to waxing/Nair. It is much less painful and MUCH Much faster. I would recommend taking some pain pills prior to trying this it will make it much more pleasant. If you do decide to buy one then make sure that you are able to return it for a refund in case it hurts you as badly as it did me. Hope this helps you all out.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now and a similar product several years before. The Optima Epilator has been the best in removing hair than any of the ones I have used before. I plan on using it for many more years.</li>
            <li> As a guy, buying any hair removal product beyond a razor, is just brutal.  Shopping locally at a retail store like Target, Walgreens, etc is tough, as everything in this category is geared towards women. The good options for guys are few and far between, even if you&#x27;re brave enough to wade through the pink and purple boxes to try and adapt a womens&#x27; product.  That being said, unless you are in a city with one of those \\&quot;professional\\&quot; cosmetics supply places, you have to role your dice on the internet.  Well, if you&#x27;re a guy, don&#x27;t roll your dice (or cash) at anything other than an AP99.         Debate #1: Epilator or Wax?  I&#x27;ve done both.  Waxing can work, but you better be using excellent wax and muslin cloth or it is POINTLESS and PAINFUL. For me good products meant forty to fifty bucks every 6 weeks. That&#x27;s expensive over time.  So, now to the next question...         Debate #2: Does the AP99 hurt?:  On a scale of 1-10, 10 being so painful you would never do it again, I&#x27;d say about a 6.  Some will disagree, but personally I&#x27;ve found if you miss a lot of hair waxing and have to do the same spot OVER again, that is WAY more painful.  This is GUARANTEED to happen if you are using any waxing kit from a normal retail store.          Debate #3: Why the AP99?:  First of all it at least looks like a guy would be allowed to own it.  Second, it&#x27;s corded and not cordless; I personally think batteries are a pain, and go down hill with age.  A device like this needs power to work. Imagine being halfway through the job and running out of juice. No thanks.  Last of all it has two sets of heads. This gives you a better chance of getting the job done faster, and if you&#x27;re doing guy-type hair removal, i.e. arms, chest, back, stomach, etc, you need all the horsepower you can get.  To add to the positives, the AP99 comes in a great pro looking carry case, and includes a Remington-Style shave attachment. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but will definitely try it out soon.         Debate #4: the Rewards?: Guys today have to tread a weird line between looking their best, while still remaining masculine.  It&#x27;s so easy to be pegged as a metrosexual if you do anything beyond shaving and getting a haircut.  Let me tell you, the day you break through that barrier the rewards are almost immediate.  I do my forearms completely, and just keep my chest and stomach in check.  The very first day I did this I was asked several times whether I had been lifting or if I had \\&quot;lost weight.\\&quot; It was incredible. All from some basic hair removal.  Not one person asked me if I had shaved or waxed.  They can&#x27;t quite tell what it is, they just know you look better.  Combined with the right clothes,  and some mild working out (chest and arms) you will give your look a 1 or 2 notch upgrade that will pay you back every time you go out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Emjoi for about 5 years now and it&#x27;s saved me time, $$$ and energy!  AND it&#x27;s awesome!  I love it!  I purchased one for my daughter and she&#x27;s been using it for 4 years and refuses to use anything else.  Hers finally died on her the other day (which prompted me to go on Amazon to get her another one) and she was frantic and S.O.S.&#x27;ed texted me.      THis product is amazing.  It allows me to go sleeveless the ENTIRE summer.  I used to wax every 2 weeks and in between waxings I would gradually start wearing sleeves in the summer.  Not anymore.  Love it! love it! love it!    &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  MUCH better than waxing.  I used it on both legs and a substantial area in the bikini zone.  Yes, it hurts, but not so bad that you need to stop.  Also, be sure not to have the hair be too long - the length that is right for waxing is a bit too long for this IMO.  Once the longest hairs are removed/thinned, the pain subsides.  And, really its not what I would call \\&quot;pain.\\&quot;  I did this Thursday night and on Monday afternoon (today) its still great!  If I&#x27;d gotten waxed, I would already have regrowth.  I will post again after my next experience.</li>
            <li> The epilator heads work well BUT there is a HUGE design flaw: the cord plugs in to the side, not the end of the device, which means you really cannot get a decent grip on it.  It works OK for underarms, OK for legs and is TOO CLUMSY for anything more delicate \\&quot;down there.\\&quot;  I love the product line, wore out my former Gold Touch epilator in the course of 8 years and hoped this model would be just as good.  The technology is better: the design is DREADFUL.  After 4 months of struggling with it I&#x27;m looking for a replacement with a better design.</li>
            <li> It is grate she loves it, it dose what it clams, I will recommenced to others. good items to have</li>
            <li> The Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator actually works.  I&#x27;m a female who does not have baby thin hair.  I&#x27;ve purchased everything from a wax system to a hair removal \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; and nothing works like this method.  The little tweezers pull even the thickest of hair and leaves my legs feeling and looking smooth!  No sticky mess, no burning skin or unbearable smell.  It&#x27;s so easy, I feel silly not to have found this sooner.  It&#x27;s almost completely painless, but I will note that I&#x27;ve got a pretty high tolerance for pain.  I would recommend this to the person who does not have time, space, or energy for the self-waxing production and has tried everything else to get smooth legs.</li>
            <li> I had to review this product when I saw it on line again.  I have owned this since 1990.  I bought it to remove hair.  BOY DOES IT!  I thought it would be a good alternative to shaving.  It was the end of shaving for me.  I consider myself to have average body hair.  That said I am very pale and my hair is very black.  I felt like I had a five o&#x27;clock shadow at 3.  I never expected these results.  It hurts....but it&#x27;s worth it.  I also had minor bleeding at the follicle site.  I expected the treatment to last 3 weeks. My thighs and bikini and one underarm never came back from the first treatment; scared to death I think!  My other underarm came back thin and soft and since lost the battle and decided not to come back either.  I think it took 2 years...but I stupidly shaved a few times in between to avoid the pain and leave the house quick.  Once I made a rule and stuck to the emjoi it went away completely.  My legs from the knee came back for about the same time. I think it was harder to get rid of because of all the superficial blood supply to the skin.  Anyways, for the past 20 years or so I only get an occasional straggler hair that I pluck from my leg.  Maybe one hair in a 5 inch area?! I love this machine and can&#x27;t say enough good about it.  It&#x27;s been a wonderful quarter of a century not to have to shave everyday....I only wish I had ordered it before my 28th birthday.  Got my eyeliner tatoo(ed) on too.  That was also a great but painful choice.  I consider myself a low maintenance female(if such an animal exists).  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator years ago and preferred this older model than the newer Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator.</li>
            <li> Ok, as a woman that has never waxed nor used an epilator before, the first time I used this was one of the most excruciating experiences ever. I bought this to use mainly on my underarms and legs. After using it for the first time, it took soooo long to do and hurt SOOO bad that I seriously considered returning the machine.  However, after about a month and half of continued use, I can happily say that I am absolutely in love with this thing. For me, the more I used it the less it hurt and (because I wasn&#x27;t in such agonizing pain) the faster the process became. I am so pleased with the results that I&#x27;m seriously kicking myself for not buying one of these sooner.  Other reviewers have complained about the size and shape of the machine, but I actually really like that it&#x27;s small and compact. I can maneuver it into every nook and cranny and I find it easy enough to handle. I would like a battery/rechargeable option though as working with the chord can be a little annoying - especially if there&#x27;s no outlet handy.  I also LOVE the shaver attachment. It&#x27;s like getting two products in one, as cheesy as that sounds. I use both at least once every other week, though I can really go 3 weeks or so without needing any major touch ups (which is a small miracle in itself because I couldn&#x27;t go 3 days without shaving).  If you&#x27;ve never used an epilator and you are interested in trying one - just go for it. Word of advice: If you have a very low pain tolerance (i.e. waxing is too much for you), either take aspirin an hour before you use it or stick to shaving. If you&#x27;re a bit of wimp (like me) this machine requires perseverance and sheer iron will to do it&#x27;s magic - but it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> I owned the Emjoi gently gold caress for about a year before upgrading to this model.  It is much faster to use than the single rotating tweezer model.  Of course that means it&#x27;s pulling out hairs faster, so I found it a bit more uncomfortable.  Still, the time saved was worth it.  I recommend this for anyone who wants to use this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I did not see any men writing on here so i thought I would write somthing..   I just recieved it for christmas asked for this product i was desprite because I have hair on my back shoulders and arms. I have thick hair but wanted to take it off with out shaving and having it grow back thicker. I could not wait to use it. This product says for women so because I have thick hair did not know if it would work I tried it and i was happy with the outcome took all hair off it hurt but its worth it. I love this product and recomend it for men also.</li>
            <li> I use epilators for 13 years.I&#x27;ve had brands:\\&quot;Epilady\\&quot;, \\&quot;Braun\\&quot;-2 different kinds and so from my experience I can tell Emjoi Optima is the best.I&#x27;m surprised how it works.</li>
            <li> Using it is painful at first but it gets easier over time. Works well. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This does do a good, fast job of removing hair but has a couple of drawbacks: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. The cord comes out of the side which makes it very awkward to hold and since it&#x27;s quite small it&#x27;s hard to get a good comfortable grip without fear of catching your fingertips in it. It takes a lot of practice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. The two rolls of tweezers make for fast removal, but if you don&#x27;t hold the skin really taut it&#x27;s very easy to get pinched since the rollers roll inward towards each other. You need one hand to hold the machine and if you try to do your underarms you really have no other hand to hold the skin taut. I gave up using it there as I got pinched a few times. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. The brush they give you to clean it doesn&#x27;t work well. It gets stuck between the tweezers. I use an old toothbrush instead with better results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4. Like most of them you can&#x27;t use it on your face. I had to buy a separate one for that. I wish they would make a good all-in-one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised at these problems as Emjoi usually makes a good product. I think I would go back to Norellco Satinelle or Braun Silk Epil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an epilator for almost two years and have never had problems with it! My friend wanted one and I ordered her one from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who is sick of being hairy and have tried chemical,causing skin damage because of leaving on too long trying to get hair off and the smelly stink, found that it won&#x27;t work on stubble and is not efficient.  &lt;br /&gt; Waxing is too costly for large areas, more pain to wallet than me.  &lt;br /&gt; Shaving is a joke, time consuming, and a day or so later the ugly little things are back and irritating, and no matter how many blades electric or hand, I got cut or scrapped and red.   &lt;br /&gt; As a last resort I tried this method. WHAT PAIN at first, esp on inner thighs,side of waist,underarm,and bikini area. Legs and arms were little to no pain. Chest was about middle level. It took about three days of morning &amp; evening sessions to get nerve back to get job completed, but what smooth results. Now it&#x27;s a breeze about once a week because there are few to any hairs so the pain factor is NOTHING,the short fuzzys come right out, one or two you missed that are a little longer are jerked right out like a small pin prick. Even the afore mentioned painful areas are nothing at this point. I just LOVE IT.  &lt;br /&gt; I wish I had done this a zillion years ago. This thing works.</li>
            <li> Epilators are designed almost exclusively for the person with dark coarse haired.  The effects are useless on fine hair because they break the hair in half rather than pull our the shaft below the surface.   This one works, does take 2-3 times for the complete job.  Now am feeling for hair and finding none. I do not need the shaver afterwards because it is excellent!</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for several years.  It really works great.  I use it on my legs, under arms, and bikini line.  The hair doesn&#x27;t need to be really long (like it does when you wax).  Legs are easy to do and the results last for a long time.  Underarms are a little tougher. . . just be sure to keep the skin pulled tight, otherwise it will be more painful.  I have a tendency to get ingrown hairs when shaving my underarms, but when I use this product, I don&#x27;t them at all.  Plus, the underarm area doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;dark\\&quot; (due to the dark hair under the skin) and the results last a long time.  This product also works great on the bikini line.  Painful, yes.  Results, great.  And I also do not get ingrown hair after using the Emjoi.    Be sure to get this product with all the tweezers.  Some people have complained that the tweezers spin in different directions.  I find this design more efficient, especially with the underarms.    The Emjoi Optima works great!  I recommend it all the time.  It is a little painful, but gets better with practice.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little machine! I expected to only use it on my legs but found it very effective for underarm and bikini line also. A small amount of discomfort, but not as much as waxing and certainly more convenient... without the mess :-) Maybe the pain seemed less for me since I was used to waxing.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Emjoi Light Caress for the past year.  I like the Emjoi Light Caress, however I was getting frustrated with the amount of time it took to do both legs, bikini, underarms and arms.    I decided to try the Emjoi Optima since it has the dual opposed heads.  I am very glad I did try it.  It got virtually all of the hair (the Light Caress frequently misses hairs) and cut the time by about 1/3, which is wonderful.  It also didn&#x27;t cause as much discomfort to the skin of my underarms as the Light Caress did, which was also nice.    I also like that you can remove the head for easier cleaning.  I haven&#x27;t tried the razor part yet, but am sure I will like it.    The only down side to this product is the odd shape and small size.  It is more difficult to hold because of it&#x27;s shape and size.  However given my past experience, I&#x27;m more than willing to overlook the shape and size issue.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I already have an epliator but I wanted something that was faster. I am very satisfied with this product, since its so fast and has two times the coils, it gets the job done much quicker than my old epilator.  It takes me about one hour to do my full legs with my old epilator, but with this one it take half the time.     The reason I did not give it 5 stars is cuz, the device is a little hard to hold and my hand gets tired and cramped sometimes. Also, the cord is in a weird spot and so it accidentally comes out sometimes. Another problem that others mind find is that its a little too big for small areas like the bikini area, but this was not an issue for me cuz I have a separate epilator for more smaller areas.     Overall, I would highly recommend the machine, I love it so much, its made my life so so so much easier.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my Mother, but she is raving about it! Her last epilator was a different brand, and this performs much better than that one. It grabs more hairs the first time you pass over them and pulls them out more effectively. It also has a bigger surface area, so its much quicker than her old one! She also had an original single barreled emjoy in the past, and this double barreled one is much better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have owned 2 in the past 5 years. Wipes out stubble and hair in an instant. It def. hurts at first, but then the burn just blends in and you get used to it. Your hair free baby soft skin is worth the ouch. Trust me.</li>
            <li> I have two epilators and this one works the best.</li>
            <li> I purchased this several years ago. It works really well. Some people are afraid to use an epilator, but it&#x27;s not bad at all. The first time it&#x27;s a bit painful, but it gets less so each time. I use it about every 2 weeks, as the hair that grows back is soft and fine. Using it does take longer than shaving, though. I heartily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product works well but hurts soooooo bad. If you can tolerate the pain go for it because it does work beautifully. If nothing else it is a fun toy, my family calls it the &amp;#34;toture machine&amp;#34; and we sneak up on eachother and pull thier hair out... On the other hand the electric razor that is included is fabulous, I actually use that feature all the time</li>
