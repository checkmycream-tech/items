            <li>received this for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Great quality and super easy to use!</li>
            <li>I lost the diffuser that came with my blow dryer and needed a good diffuser to fit on the dryer I already have.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to put anywhere!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to fit on most hotel hairdryers too!</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s say they are wanting to do more with their hair by styling it.</li>
            <li>Just pull it to expand it and pop it on your favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but I was able to make it work.</li>
            <li>I think that if you have curly hair, you might get better results than I did.</li>
            <li>and I really am enjoying the benefits of this collapsible diffuser.</li>
            <li>It seems to be made very sturdy and has a great feel.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers have stated that it collapses when being used.</li>
            <li>It blows the top and crown of my hair out straight-immediately.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because it is collapsible and can fit most hotel</li>
            <li>Once my hair grows a bit more, I will be able to use this diffuser all the time, which is why I still gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It collapses nicely for packing, cools off quickly, and now I can confidently wash my hair on the road.  </li>
            <li>But if you have long curly hair - this thing works awesome and will give you the look you want, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love how it can easily be collapsed for traveling!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please note that though this fits on most dryers, it won&#x27;t fit on all of them.</li>
            <li>Collapses easily.</li>
            <li>Fits my regular hairdryer perfectly (BaByliss) and surprisingly also fits my tiny BaByliss travel hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use, and will be great to pack in the future.</li>
            <li>Unique design makes it easy to store and carry in suitcase.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t fit well in my hair dryer</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer) &amp;amp; one of their blow driers.</li>
            <li>it probably won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I use a sea salt spray and then the diffuser and find that it gives me fantastic body without frizz.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my XTAVA Diffuser it showed up on time it is true to the picture it is very well made your blow-dryer needs to be 12inches or less to fit.</li>
            <li>As a hairstylist a diffuser is a godsend, but so many don&#x27;t fit on particular dryers, or are cumbersome and obnoxious to remove or handle.</li>
            <li>but the diffuser gave me much more lift and volume than normal drying.</li>
            <li>it is well worth the price</li>
            <li>It does sometimes close up on me with the weight of my hair but it is worth it</li>
            <li>If it only fits my home dryer, it completely defeats the purpose of being able to take it on trips and not need my own hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>So when I saw these I jumped right on it.</li>
            <li>Love this Diffuser, a few small issues but the best travel diffuser I have owned.</li>
            <li>I loved the color and it squished down very small which was great for traveling.  </li>
            <li>it was so hot burnt my fingers.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying a diffuser</li>
            <li>do I really like this one!</li>
            <li>I first thought it was the water</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and gives me no big problems.</li>
            <li>But with this diffuser, I was able to dry it and keep the curl pattern intact.</li>
            <li>I have had diffusers before and they are always large and chunky.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like that</li>
            <li>travel a lot so having a diffuser that I can take with me is really nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>FAST service.  </li>
            <li>I tried this with three different blow dryers and it wouldn&#x27;t fit any of them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know there could be that much difference in a diffuser.</li>
            <li>Fit my moderate size hair dryers</li>
            <li>Very compact.</li>
            <li>I loved the color (hot pink) but I love the ability to make it smaller and store it with less space.</li>
            <li>It has been too small to fit over the end of the dryers and there is no ability to stretch it to fit.  </li>
            <li>So if you have a normal or large sized hairdryer</li>
            <li>I really feel this is high quality product.</li>
            <li>Now I normally have very flat and fine hair</li>
            <li>and this enhances my natural wave pattern really well without having to use any type of product before!</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair curled better with less frizz and managed easier while I was away from home.</li>
            <li>I can either quickly pop it back up, or continue using it without an issue.</li>
            <li>and my hair is rather short on the top and longer in the back.  </li>
            <li>This fits in my drawer, travels well, fits all my dryers, and doesn&#x27;t get super hot to handle when removing, due to it being made of silicone.</li>
            <li>I travel for a living and the diffuser did not fit most of the hotel dryers..</li>
            <li>While that is a feature, it should not happen during normal use.  </li>
            <li>It gave me the look I wanted, but with my current length it wasn&#x27;t exactly right.</li>
            <li>I purchased another hairdryer that it worked with as I needed a new one anyway</li>
            <li>I went and purchased her a new dryer with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the product because it keeps my curls bouncing with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to those expensive ones only you can get at a licensed store.</li>
            <li>It does collapse a bit easier than I had hoped, but it&#x27;s not that much of a hassle since I have shorter hair and the weight of the wet hair isn&#x27;t that much.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it comes in several different colors (I got pink).</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this purchase and the collapsible part is very convenient especially because I travel a lot.</li>
            <li>By it opening completely up, it does not allow the curls to stay in place.  </li>
            <li>So, if you have very curly short hair - I might say hold off on a diffuser until your hair is longer.</li>
            <li>Not only is it small to fit in smalls spaces it is made up of silicon.</li>
            <li>with the hot air the black plastic will come off of it.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is it didn&#x27;t fit my regular hairdryer which has a larger end.</li>
            <li>I had no problem with it slipping off on my new dryer</li>
            <li>A small part in the center came off, even though it didn&#x27;t appear to be an important functional part, maybe cosmetic.</li>

            <li> A small part in the center came off, even though it didn&#x27;t appear to be an important functional part, maybe cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Will fit only those with the narrow opening, not the type you usually see in hotels.  </li>
            <li> Packs flat for travel also.  </li>
            <li> On all kinds of dryers, with long and short nozzles.  </li>
            <li> If I had really long hair again, I&#x27;d have to see whether it stayed open or not.</li>
            <li> but it ended up looking a little too wild for me.</li>
            <li> but really it&#x27;s not that big a deal.</li>
            <li> I have tried two other dryers that I have and witness the same results.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly coarse thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair still has the tendency to dry outwards instead of down, becuase it is not long enough yet to weigh down.</li>
            <li> While, my hair is too short yet for me to wear it down and curly, this diffuser still made all the difference.</li>
            <li> It also took longer than was expected to dry.</li>
            <li> I had previously was too big.</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> so I think its to be expected.  </li>
            <li> and I can squeeze it in-between other items.  </li>
            <li> I actually have hardly a wave in my hair and thought this may give me a &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; look, and it did create somewhat of a wave</li>
            <li> so of course if you&#x27;re pressing it against your head too hard or anything like that it will fall down but only on one side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just returned from 2 weeks of  using this diffuser on at least 5 different hotel hair dryers and it works!!!!  </li>
            <li> This diffuser collapses down</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and deal with flat, dull hair, try this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Usually I can&#x27;t blow dry it without it turning into an afro!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this Diffuser, a few small issues but the best travel diffuser I have owned.</li>
            <li> What a terrific idea for traveling and it fits all blow dryers!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product. I have had diffusers before and they are always large and chunky. They take up a lot of room in my drawer. So when I saw these I jumped right on it. It is a collapsible diffuser. Not only is it small to fit in smalls spaces it is made up of silicon. I can remember back in the day when I had one and made out of plastic.I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!  Well by the time I was finished diffusing my hair it was so hot burnt my fingers. While using this there is little to no heat burning my fingers after I was done diffusing my hair. Now I would suggest this for the teen in your life. Let&#x27;s say they are wanting to do more with their hair by styling it. Then this would be perfect for them. I think also if you are in the industry of hair stylist you need to look into this. I really feel this is high quality product. This is a great alternative to those expensive ones only you can get at a licensed store. Just pull it to expand it and pop it on your favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! Needed a diffuser that I could take with me when I travel without taking up a lot of space in my suitcase.  This diffuser collapses down and I can squeeze it in-between other items.  Fits my regular hairdryer perfectly (BaByliss) and surprisingly also fits my tiny BaByliss travel hairdryer.  Works great too!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit well in my hair dryer but I was able to make it work. If it fits the dryer, it&#x27;s a good product and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my XTAVA Diffuser it showed up on time it is true to the picture it is very well made your blow-dryer needs to be 12inches or less to fit. it is well worth the price</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy. Collapses easily. A small part in the center came off, even though it didn&#x27;t appear to be an important functional part, maybe cosmetic. I had to pull it way up on my hair dryer in order for it to hold, thereby defeating the purpose somewhat since the dryer head was so close to my hair. I actually have hardly a wave in my hair and thought this may give me a &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; look, and it did create somewhat of a wave but it ended up looking a little too wild for me. It also took longer than was expected to dry. I think that if you have curly hair, you might get better results than I did.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser to use at the gym; I didn&#x27;t want to have a big bulky plastic thing to carry around in addition to the hair dryer.  It fits well on the Revlon travel hair dryer.  I agree with other folks saying that it is a little frustrating when the product collapses while using it but it&#x27;s made of silicon and collapsible...so I think its to be expected.  Overall, I love the product because it keeps my curls bouncing with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li> Although the diffuser did not fit my hairdryer I purchased another hairdryer that it worked with as I needed a new one anyway and I really am enjoying the benefits of this collapsible diffuser. Now I normally have very flat and fine hair but the diffuser gave me much more lift and volume than normal drying. It&#x27;s not too heavy on the end of your hairdryer either. It seems to be made very sturdy and has a great feel. I had no problem with it slipping off on my new dryer so it seems to stay put until you take it off. I love the fact that it comes in several different colors (I got pink). If you&#x27;re like me and deal with flat, dull hair, try this diffuser. It will give your hair volume without the breakage. My only complaint is it didn&#x27;t fit my regular hairdryer which has a larger end. I received this product for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> with the hot air the black plastic will come off of it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like that this collapses.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews complained that it sometimes collapses into your hair while in use, but I don&#x27;t see that as a drawback and haven&#x27;t noticed a negative effect on my curls.&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot so having a diffuser that I can take with me is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to fit on most hotel hairdryers too!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a diffuser and man do I really like this one! It is so easy to use and gives me no big problems. It is made of silicone so of course if you&#x27;re pressing it against your head too hard or anything like that it will fall down but only on one side. This items works great and I definitely recommend it. I have naturally wavy hair and this enhances my natural wave pattern really well without having to use any type of product before! Not to mention its collapsible so it&#x27;s easy to put anywhere!</li>
            <li> Fits my hair dryer perfectly and is just what I needed.  Packs flat for travel also.  FAST service.  A+</li>
            <li> I tried this with three different blow dryers and it wouldn&#x27;t fit any of them. I like the idea but just didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> Collapses while you are drying</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! It is perfect for travel. I noticed my hair curled better with less frizz and managed easier while I was away from home. I first thought it was the water but soon realized it was the diffuser. I was using a conair diffuser. I didn&#x27;t know there could be that much difference in a diffuser. It does sometimes close up on me with the weight of my hair but it is worth it and I&#x27;ve been using it daily at home. I now have my eye on their tulip diffuser (I ordered it before but it didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer) &amp;amp; one of their blow driers.</li>
            <li> Fit my moderate size hair dryers</li>
            <li> I travel for a living and the diffuser did not fit most of the hotel dryers.. I sent it back</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  LOVE IT.  LOVE IT!!  Works as well as a &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; diffuser.  Very compact.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is awesome and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Yes, it is for a smaller hairdryer. I was given a small Revlon hairdryer as a gift and the diffuser I had previously was too big. So I was searching around for a smaller one and this fits snug but well. So if you have a normal or large sized hairdryer it probably won&#x27;t fit. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this purchase and the collapsible part is very convenient especially because I travel a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a curly-haired woman who travels a lot for business.  I&#x27;ve been afraid to wash my hair when I was out of town because I couldn&#x27;t pack my very big dryer with the diffuser - but no more!!  I&#x27;ve just returned from 2 weeks of  using this diffuser on at least 5 different hotel hair dryers and it works!!!!  On all kinds of dryers, with long and short nozzles.  It collapses nicely for packing, cools off quickly, and now I can confidently wash my hair on the road.  I wish I&#x27;d found this product 10 years ago!!  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!!</li>
            <li> Unique design makes it easy to store and carry in suitcase.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product because I moved and the weather here is starting to loosen my curls. I lost the diffuser that came with my blow dryer and needed a good diffuser to fit on the dryer I already have. I&#x27;m really glad I bought this one. I loved the color (hot pink) but I love the ability to make it smaller and store it with less space. It does collapse a bit easier than I had hoped, but it&#x27;s not that much of a hassle since I have shorter hair and the weight of the wet hair isn&#x27;t that much. If I had really long hair again, I&#x27;d have to see whether it stayed open or not.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this for my babyliss blowdryer that didn&#x27;t come with a diffuser. Many reviewers have stated that it collapses when being used. I have found that yes, it does. But there are three expandable levels and mine usually only collapses one. I can either quickly pop it back up, or continue using it without an issue. It collapses easily and is great for storage or for travel. I do find that it&#x27;s a big annoying to get on my blowdryer. Though that will depend on the size of your hair dryer. Please note that though this fits on most dryers, it won&#x27;t fit on all of them. I have very fine, wavy hair. I use a sea salt spray and then the diffuser and find that it gives me fantastic body without frizz. Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this diffuser.  I tried it on my hair dryer at home, and it fit and worked great.  However, I have traveled a few times since purchasing this travel diffuser and it has not fit on any of the hair dryers in any of the hotels.  It has been too small to fit over the end of the dryers and there is no ability to stretch it to fit.  If it only fits my home dryer, it completely defeats the purpose of being able to take it on trips and not need my own hair dryer.  I feel like it was a waste of money and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in that the plastic is so flimsy the diffuser will not stay closed and my hair is rather short on the top and longer in the back.  By it opening completely up, it does not allow the curls to stay in place.  It blows the top and crown of my hair out straight-immediately.  I am using product on my hair to try and keep the curl, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to help either.  I would not purchase this brand again unless I was assured the extension parts would stay in place when attached to my dryer.  I have tried two other dryers that I have and witness the same results.</li>
            <li> I love this! As a hairstylist a diffuser is a godsend, but so many don&#x27;t fit on particular dryers, or are cumbersome and obnoxious to remove or handle. This fits in my drawer, travels well, fits all my dryers, and doesn&#x27;t get super hot to handle when removing, due to it being made of silicone. I would definitely recommend this for professionals and clients alike!</li>
            <li> Light-weight, collapsible, works!  What more could you want?  I think anyone who needs a diffuser should have one.  Simply brilliant.</li>
            <li> My wife picked this out to replace one she left at a hotel.  It&#x27;s nice because it is collapsible and can fit most hotel dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this item is that the plastic part at the base of the diffuser continues to fall out.  The silicone lip that holds it in place does not do a very good job.  It needs to have a much larger protrusion to hold the plastic part in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem with this is that as my wife uses it, it will collapse into itself.  While that is a feature, it should not happen during normal use.  My wife has given up on it. It&#x27;s more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.  I went and purchased her a new dryer with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is great. It does collapse sometimes and occasionally fall of the hairdryer but really it&#x27;s not that big a deal. My hair looks great, it&#x27;s easy to use, and will be great to pack in the future. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I like the way it works, but it does not fit all hair dryers.  Will fit only those with the narrow opening, not the type you usually see in hotels.  Does collapse on its self.  I ended up getting another brand.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product! Great quality and super easy to use! Gorgeous color and I love how it can easily be collapsed for traveling!&lt;br /&gt;Check it out in my video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;yW2ooFey42I</li>
            <li> I loved the color and it squished down very small which was great for traveling.  I could see how someone with a bigger hair dryer might have issues getting it on, but I did not.  That being said, my hair was a little frizzy afterward, but I dont know if that was just the humidity.  We will see.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly coarse thick hair. Usually I can&#x27;t blow dry it without it turning into an afro! But with this diffuser, I was able to dry it and keep the curl pattern intact. While, my hair is too short yet for me to wear it down and curly, this diffuser still made all the difference. Once my hair grows a bit more, I will be able to use this diffuser all the time, which is why I still gave it 5 stars. It gave me the look I wanted, but with my current length it wasn&#x27;t exactly right. So, if you have very curly short hair - I might say hold off on a diffuser until your hair is longer. My hair still has the tendency to dry outwards instead of down, becuase it is not long enough yet to weigh down. But if you have long curly hair - this thing works awesome and will give you the look you want, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
