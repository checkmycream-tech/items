            <li>great pricing ....</li>
            <li>; GREAT QUALITY:</li>
            <li>Great product and even better price!</li>
            <li>This is a really good buy.</li>
            <li>They arrived three days after I ordered them and are as good as anything I&#x27;ve found at the store.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as brand name.</li>
            <li>Super excellent buy.</li>
            <li>Great Buy on a on these blades, I have been using Personna blades for years &amp; you can&#x27;t find a better razor blade for the price.</li>
            <li>Actually, to be honest they sent 11.  </li>
            <li>Gone are the days of straight razor shaving, where one good quality blade lasted you decades- or even a lifetime!</li>
            <li>From Personna&#x27;s website: &amp;#34;Founded in 1875 and proud to be the first to launch a safety razor in the US....</li>
            <li>Love the bulk packaging.</li>
            <li>My favorite blades which I could not find anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Love getting the volume discount.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these blades for more than 25 years.</li>
            <li>For most of us, shaving is a necessity, and they have capitalized on something that we all must pay for.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does add a couple more minutes to your shaving routine-</li>
            <li>Great Price, Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have used better blades, but you just can&#x27;t beat the price on these.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love Personna’s Twin II Plus replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Bulk packaging is part of why Personna can keep their prices lower than others.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; A reputable company that&#x27;s been around for over 135 years.</li>
            <li>Doing this allows you to buy 100 or more blade cartridges at a time and save money, and not have to worry they might rust while sitting in the closet or cabinet for months or years at a time.</li>
            <li>replacement for original Trac 2 blades at a fraction of the cost !</li>
            <li>The price is AMAZING, considering that they seem to be the same great quality I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as name brand, but good enough!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found them, as they fit my favorite razor ever</li>
            <li>For someone who only uses blade twice, these hold up very good</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good product.</li>
            <li>Good holds edge for a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li>Fortunately, there is still a way around paying too much for a good shave if you stock up while prices are this reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That said, everything about them works the way they should, blades are sharp and fit on the razor handle perfectly.  </li>
            <li>they fit they do the job ....</li>
            <li>Just 10 of the plastic clip cases filled with 10 blades each.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I found this 100 pack.  </li>
            <li>Not he quality of Trac II, but  super cheap and more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>My husband won&#x27;t use any other blades now that he knows these are as good as (or better than)</li>
            <li>The generic blades are just as good.</li>
            <li>So not only is the bulk sale good for the environment, it also saves money.</li>
            <li>If you can, you should also keep a silica gel packet (the kind that often comes inside bottles of vitamins) inside the sealed container to suck up any moisture than may be there naturally.</li>
            <li>Good shaving soap lather is much more slippery than canned shaving cream, so you will have much less skin irritation and a smoother shave.</li>
            <li>Blades came quickly and work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>you want an even better shave, try Williams shaving soap and a badger brush to use in combination with your new Personna Twin II blades.</li>
            <li>Fit my old Trac-II razor fine.</li>
            <li>As good as the original and at half the price.</li>
            <li>but they were kind enough to tell me to keep it.  </li>
            <li>(a solid brass razor that just feels good in my hands and shaves really well).</li>
            <li>I bought two of these bulk packs, so that will end up being something like 3 or 4 years worth of blades, for pennies</li>
            <li>Ridiculous savings since these are as good or better than the drug store brands.</li>
            <li>Very good shave and long lasting!</li>
            <li>Tried the new blades out and they work fine.</li>
            <li>I initially dug out my grandfather’s 50 year old spice mug, brush and cheap disposable razors, but when the soap was gone, I knew I liked the ceremony and results of the way of my ancestors.  </li>
            <li>These seem to be kind of hard to find any more.</li>
            <li>If you do not want to keep the blade endof your razor submerged in oil the second best way to keep used razors at their best is to: rinse well, shake dry, let air dry, store in a dry well ventilated area (not out in the open in a moist bathroom).</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of these from this seller when I need my next batch.  </li>
            <li>Plus but at a fantastic price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp and precisely cut, shaves evenly and smoothly, the lube strip is just as good quality as Gillette Trac II, and the blades last a long time.</li>
            <li>I can’t say enough good about the entire experience.</li>
            <li>This allows moisture to absorb into the cardboard much the same way it would with a cotton cloth or paper towel.in oil the second best way to keep used razors at their best is to: rinse well, shake dry, let air dry, store in a dry well ventilated area (not out in the open in a moist bathroom).</li>
            <li>They do a great job &amp; last a long time for me because my beard is not real heavy.</li>
            <li>As we all know, razor blades are a huge scam ran by the big razor companies that probably amount to a 500% plus profit on each blade they sell.</li>
            <li>great buy when they are getting harder and harder to find and in-fact are the simplist and smartest blade to use.</li>
            <li>How much do I like these blades?</li>
            <li>Shipping Was Fast.</li>
            <li>Like this so much I bought two.</li>
            <li>* Do not remove your blade/cartridge from the handle until you’re ready to discard.</li>
            <li>You may not be able to see them, but they can still be there and these rust spots can give you a rough shave or even cause rashes and cuts.</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, I found a nice supply being sourced in Poland and that worked for awhile until that supply dried up, too.  </li>
            <li>100 great razors for under $20, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>; KEEP NEW BLADES AWAY FROM MOISTURE:</li>
            <li>I have just begun using these blades, but they do fit my old TwinII razor, and their cost, even including the shipping charge, is only about 1/20 what similar blades would cost me locally.</li>
            <li>The results are a simple elegance that I want to share with every man and the woman who are ready for a cheaper and easier way of grooming.  </li>
            <li>I could not find the Personna blades anywhere (used to get them at Walmart, for a far cheaper price than Trac II).  </li>
            <li>The cloth/towel will naturally soak up some of the moisture that may be in the container while in storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; RINSE WELL AFTER EACH USE:</li>
            <li>Surrounding your blades in oil by submerging them protects the metal from water and air much the same way antibiotic cream protects a cut or scratch – the oil gives it a temporary protective coating.</li>
            <li>This allows moisture to absorb into the cardboard much the same way it would with a cotton cloth or paper towel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda old school.  </li>
            <li>am surprised to have found them.</li>
            <li>get dull very, very quickly</li>
            <li>Lately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in stores and I&#x27;m not paying $17 for a package of ten Gillette blades.</li>
            <li>I started buying Personna blades many years ago because I was tired of paying double or triple the cost for the manufacturer&#x27;s blades.</li>
            <li>No more buying new cartridges at ridiculously high prices, no more driving from store to store looking for a reputable brand replacements at a decent price, no more wasting time and money (including gas money).</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; SAVE TREES &amp; MONEY: These blades come as shown, in bulk packaging – they are seated in the same type of hard plastic tray you’re familiar with</li>
            <li>so imagine how much of a profit margin you are giving to Gillette or the other big name companies if you buy their overpriced blades!</li>
            <li>It prevents the flat head of my handle from sliding completely through the back side.  </li>
            <li>They are quality blades – sharp, even &amp; smooth cut, and last as long or longer than Twin II or any other brand we’ve</li>
            <li>Very sharp blades and priced very afford-ably.  </li>

            <li> it is at least triple for the same exact Personna Twin II blades that they sell on the shaving supplies</li>
            <li> With these, I easily get at least 3-4 shaves per blade, which pencils out out to only a few pennies per shave at this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased five products as a group after being less than enamored with the offerings from local stores, that included a high-dollar N-brand electric razor with goop that stopped being supported a year after purchase, and a gazillion-bladed KoRazor that cost as much for replacement blades that drag on your face like a boat anchor.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the bulk packaging. A lot less waste.</li>
            <li> Husband say work great</li>
            <li> As good as the original and at half the price. Excellent product</li>
            <li> Great deal for quality razor blades.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get a shave cheaper than this</li>
            <li> My favorite blades which I could not find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> These seem to be kind of hard to find any more. This is a really good buy. I don&#x27;t see any difference in shave quality. Very good shave and long lasting!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like. At this price and quantity, how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> A great razor blade cartridge at 10% cost of the name brand</li>
            <li> Great price.  Love getting the volume discount.  Tried the new blades out and they work fine.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades and priced very afford-ably.  Just as sharp as the 5 blade cartridges which would probably cost hundreds of dollars for this quantity.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. I have just begun using these blades, but they do fit my old TwinII razor, and their cost, even including the shipping charge, is only about 1/20 what similar blades would cost me locally. I don&#x27;t understand either how these blades can be so inexpensive, or how such blades can cost so much locally here.</li>
            <li> Are you kidding? I can now skip the blade aisle at the store.  This is a two year supply for 16 and change!</li>
            <li> These blades are very good. They give me a clean,close shave. You can also use these cartridges for Atra and Trac 2 handles.</li>
            <li> No better value to be found anywhere! Prompt delivery too!</li>
            <li> Super excellent buy. These same blades by Gillette sell for 14.97 for a 10 pack. I&#x27;ve been using these blades for more than 25 years.</li>
            <li> As we all know, razor blades are a huge scam ran by the big razor companies that probably amount to a 500% plus profit on each blade they sell. For most of us, shaving is a necessity, and they have capitalized on something that we all must pay for. Gone are the days of straight razor shaving, where one good quality blade lasted you decades- or even a lifetime! Fortunately, there is still a way around paying too much for a good shave if you stock up while prices are this reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just cannot beat this deal. I started buying Personna blades many years ago because I was tired of paying double or triple the cost for the manufacturer&#x27;s blades. Even the local discount store cannot compete with this price- it is at least triple for the same exact Personna Twin II blades that they sell on the shaving supplies aisle- so imagine how much of a profit margin you are giving to Gillette or the other big name companies if you buy their overpriced blades! With these, I easily get at least 3-4 shaves per blade, which pencils out out to only a few pennies per shave at this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an even better shave, try Williams shaving soap and a badger brush to use in combination with your new Personna Twin II blades. Good shaving soap lather is much more slippery than canned shaving cream, so you will have much less skin irritation and a smoother shave. Yes, it does add a couple more minutes to your shaving routine- but your skin will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> I purchased five products as a group after being less than enamored with the offerings from local stores, that included a high-dollar N-brand electric razor with goop that stopped being supported a year after purchase, and a gazillion-bladed KoRazor that cost as much for replacement blades that drag on your face like a boat anchor.  I initially dug out my grandfather’s 50 year old spice mug, brush and cheap disposable razors, but when the soap was gone, I knew I liked the ceremony and results of the way of my ancestors.  So I looked to Amazon for the Heavyweight All Metal Chrome Trac II razor, Escali Pure Badger brush, a Buffalo Horn 3.5 in Palm Shave Bowl, and TOBS Sandalwood Hard Shaving Soap.  The results are a simple elegance that I want to share with every man and the woman who are ready for a cheaper and easier way of grooming.  The icing was finding 100-packs Personna TwinII for a third less than a 10-pack at my local grocery.  I can’t say enough good about the entire experience. It’s a great feeling to start the morning ablution with this group of excellent products.</li>
            <li> great value and great shaves. I tried them and ordered another hundred!</li>
            <li> get dull very, very quickly</li>
            <li> Absolutely great blades.  I get a month of shaves from each cartridges.. Far less cost than using Gillette brand Trac II. How much do I like these blades? Enough that I am building a supply that should last the rest of my life. I have no desire to switch, or even try, any other blade.</li>
            <li> Great Price, Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Not as good as name brand, but good enough!</li>
            <li> Great product and even better price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Excellent price!</li>
            <li> You Can&#x27;t Beat  That Price. Shipping Was Fast.</li>
            <li> They will NOT fit on a standard brass or stainless handle.  I have a solid brass handle that uses TRAC II.  These will not attach because of a protruding piece of plastic in the middle.  I presume this is to make them compatible with Atra pivoting blades.  It prevents the flat head of my handle from sliding completely through the back side.  What a frustrating waste of time to order these, wait for delivery, and now have to put them back in the mail to get some of the money back.</li>
            <li> Father and i were happy with blade quality. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Blades are every bit as sharp as the name-brand ones you buy at the drugstore. Fit my old Trac-II razor fine.</li>
            <li> great buy when they are getting harder and harder to find and in-fact are the simplist and smartest blade to use.</li>
            <li> Great value and works well!</li>
            <li> great blades at a great price</li>
            <li> they fit they do the job .... great pricing ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these 100 packs for what I was paying for a ten alone for the same price at the drug store. Ridiculous savings since these are as good or better than the drug store brands. Like this so much I bought two.</li>
            <li> Blades came quickly and work as advertised.  The only reason I am marking this as 4 stars instead of 5 is that the blades did not come on the display card as shown in the picture, nor is there any identifying markings on the blades themselves or the packaging to show that they are indeed Personna twin blades.  Just 10 of the plastic clip cases filled with 10 blades each.  Actually, to be honest they sent 11.  I did offer to return the extra one but they were kind enough to tell me to keep it.  That said, everything about them works the way they should, blades are sharp and fit on the razor handle perfectly.  I get 7-10 shaves out of each cartridge, which is the same as the name brands.  I will be ordering more of these from this seller when I need my next batch.  Would not hesitate to buy again.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find. What I expected.</li>
            <li> I have used better blades, but you just can&#x27;t beat the price on these.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good product.</li>
            <li> For someone who only uses blade twice, these hold up very good and you don&#x27;t break the bank buying them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Trac II razor since I started shaving 35 years ago. The name brand blades used to give a closer, smoother shave, and last longer than generic blades but that no longer seems to be the case. The generic blades are just as good. Lately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in stores and I&#x27;m not paying $17 for a package of ten Gillette blades. When I saw these on Amazon I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong - 100 blades for the price of 10. They arrived three days after I ordered them and are as good as anything I&#x27;ve found at the store. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Good holds edge for a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li> Works just as good as brand name. 100 blades for the price of 15 brand name blades!!&lt;br /&gt;Count me in!! Just to think I&#x27;ve been paying $12 for each pack of brand name for years!!!</li>
            <li> Not he quality of Trac II, but  super cheap and more than adequate.  I can&#x27;t believe what blades cost these days...these will last a looooong time.  I could not find the Personna blades anywhere (used to get them at Walmart, for a far cheaper price than Trac II).  I am so glad I found them, as they fit my favorite razor ever (a solid brass razor that just feels good in my hands and shaves really well).</li>
            <li> Great Buy on a on these blades, I have been using Personna blades for years &amp; you can&#x27;t find a better razor blade for the price. They do a great job &amp; last a long time for me because my beard is not real heavy.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love Personna’s Twin II Plus replacement blades. My husband won&#x27;t use any other blades now that he knows these are as good as (or better than) Gillette Trac II or Trac II Plus but at a fantastic price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp and precisely cut, shaves evenly and smoothly, the lube strip is just as good quality as Gillette Trac II, and the blades last a long time. No more buying new cartridges at ridiculously high prices, no more driving from store to store looking for a reputable brand replacements at a decent price, no more wasting time and money (including gas money). We have been buying in bulk from Personna (through Amazon.com) for years and have no plans to buy from anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; GREAT QUALITY: They are quality blades – sharp, even &amp; smooth cut, and last as long or longer than Twin II or any other brand we’ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; BEST PRICE: The are the least expensive brand we’ve found – other than dollar store brands which we would never again use.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; SAVE TIME &amp; GAS: We can buy them in bulk, cheaper than any other brand, and have them delivered free of charge (not spending any gas money) through Amazon’s Prime Member service&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; SAVE TREES &amp; MONEY: These blades come as shown, in bulk packaging – they are seated in the same type of hard plastic tray you’re familiar with when buying Gillette Trac II replacement blades, only you don’t get the attached cardboard backing (a waste of paper and money). So not only is the bulk sale good for the environment, it also saves money. Bulk packaging is part of why Personna can keep their prices lower than others.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; A reputable company that&#x27;s been around for over 135 years.

If you take care of your blades/cartridges they will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; KEEP NEW BLADES AWAY FROM MOISTURE: Keep new razor cartridges in their hard plastic case in a air tight container with no moisture. Doing this allows you to buy 100 or more blade cartridges at a time and save money, and not have to worry they might rust while sitting in the closet or cabinet for months or years at a time. We prefer Rubbermaid containers for the tightest seal. If you can, you should also keep a silica gel packet (the kind that often comes inside bottles of vitamins) inside the sealed container to suck up any moisture than may be there naturally. If you don’t have a silica gel packet you can use dry uncooked rice wrapped in a sachet bag, or place a dry washcloth or a paper towel in the container with your new blades. The cloth/towel will naturally soak up some of the moisture that may be in the container while in storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; RINSE WELL AFTER EACH USE: Rinse blades/cartridges well in hot water after each use to keep the blades from getting clogged and gummed up with soap scum and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; STORAGE OF USED BLADES/CARTRIDGES FOR USE LATER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Do not remove your blade/cartridge from the handle until you’re ready to discard. To use again later, rinse well after each use, shake dry, then submerge the blade end of your razor in mineral oil or baby oil between uses. Water and air combined creates tiny spots of rust on used blades. You may not be able to see them, but they can still be there and these rust spots can give you a rough shave or even cause rashes and cuts. Surrounding your blades in oil by submerging them protects the metal from water and air much the same way antibiotic cream protects a cut or scratch – the oil gives it a temporary protective coating. You do not have to submerge the entire razor and handle, just the part with the metal blades in the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If you do not want to keep the blade endof your razor submerged in oil the second best way to keep used razors at their best is to: rinse well, shake dry, let air dry, store in a dry well ventilated area (not out in the open in a moist bathroom). Do not keep used blades sealed in an air tight box unless you have a new silica gel packet (or rice packet) inside the box to absorb moisture. You can also keep your razor loosely wrapped in a piece of cotton cloth or paper towel. Optionally you can keep your razor in a cardboard box. This allows moisture to absorb into the cardboard much the same way it would with a cotton cloth or paper towel.in oil the second best way to keep used razors at their best is to: rinse well, shake dry, let air dry, store in a dry well ventilated area (not out in the open in a moist bathroom).

            <li> 100 great razors for under $20, can&#x27;t go wrong. I won&#x27;t be buying razors for years.</li>
            <li> replacement for original Trac 2 blades at a fraction of the cost ! Very satisfied !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda old school.  I starting shaving with the Trac II around the time dirt was invented and never felt the need to increase the number of blades on my face by 50 or 100 percent.  It&#x27;s become very difficult to find Trac II blades at brick and mortar stores, so I turned to Amazon.  Lo and behold, I found a nice supply being sourced in Poland and that worked for awhile until that supply dried up, too.  Fortunately, I found this 100 pack.  The mother lode!  The price is AMAZING, considering that they seem to be the same great quality I&#x27;m used to.  I bought two of these bulk packs, so that will end up being something like 3 or 4 years worth of blades, for pennies each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, you know that thing where you have whiskers above your lip and on your chin, but not a full beard?  That is called a Van Dyke, not a goatee.  A goattee is when you have chin whiskers that drag in your soup - you know, like a goat?  Combined with a wonderful CHROME Trac II handle purchased from Amazon, I am now gleefully shaving around my Van Dyke every morning.</li>
            <li> These  are the perfect replacements for&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Trac II blades that are&lt;br /&gt;hard to find these days.&lt;br /&gt;And the price is only about 15 per&lt;br /&gt;cent of Trac II. I just like it .&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised to have found them.</li>
