            <li>Absolutely love this soap in the kitchen, and this is a great deal for this size refill.</li>
            <li>great bargain , love this scent.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a great quality soap, and I love that they started sending it in a pouch rather than the environmentally un-friendly tub.</li>

            <li>ok, lets see.. lets use it for Dishes!</li>
            <li>It is all that and more!</li>

            <li>Love this lavender soap!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many guests come out of the bathroom raving about my soap and wondering where they can get some!  </li>
            <li>But it works and gets the onion smell off of my hands in the kitchen - which is important for a chef!!</li>
            <li>The smell is also a bit chemical versus something a bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li>We received this very quickly which was great because I almost ran out.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of the lavender soap (it is pleasant and not overpowering and is gender neutral).  </li>
            <li>The lavender scent is amazing and will have you washing your hands throughout the day just to smell it again.</li>
            <li>This fits the bill nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of musky</li>
            <li>Smells nice, feels soapy.</li>
            <li>cause i cant stand the smell...same with the family and no one liked it.</li>
            <li>I already knew I liked this liquid soap</li>
            <li>I can refill them or use my own.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on your hands and smells delightful</li>
            <li>Makes it handy</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t give it away because no one liked the scent.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell and cleans well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice hand soap.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and gentle on hands.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job washing hands and love that it&#x27;s not made from synthetic material.</li>
            <li>This soap smells so good, I love the lavendar scent.</li>
            <li>I thought buying this with lavender scent and knowing it was a fairly &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; product would be safe to do.</li>
            <li>I always feel like I am doing something nice for myself and my family when I have it in my home.</li>
            <li>Smells good, I love Meyers products.</li>
            <li>I love the perfect mix of lavender, it&#x27;s the most clean and appealing fragrance!  </li>
            <li>Quality product that is a great way to keep our hands and skin clean.</li>
            <li>Has lasted me over a year, smells great, leaves my hands feeling clean and manly.</li>
            <li>This one is light and pleasant as well.  </li>
            <li>The scent this leaves on your hands is VERY strong so</li>
            <li>Lathers nice, but the smell is so overwhelming and nauseating that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the best hand soap without drying out my hands.</li>
            <li>early- great!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Lavender scent and it&#x27;s great - fresh herbs but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>We were looking for a more natural product and this one works and smells wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The light scent of lavender on clean hands is great.</li>
            <li>Does a fine job washing my hands!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, two very important things about this</li>
            <li>This soap has a nice strong scent.  </li>
            <li>Good product, quick service</li>
            <li>it smells wonderful, works great, and is more economical than always buying single hand soaps.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, strong, lavender scent and leaves your hands feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>All is ok.</li>
            <li>and I would order it again soon! :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Lavender is my favorite sent and this 100% is not what lavender smells like.</li>
            <li>There is another liquid soap that I purchased (4 gallons for $25) that I ended up throwing away because it had a lot of known health risk chemicals (too many to list) in it</li>
            <li>It smelled more like overly-sweet blueberries or something.</li>
            <li>Love love love how this product smells.</li>
            <li>Mmmmm I love this smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>

            <li>Great smell good soap,  just ordered a second bottle,  </li>

            <li>Mrs. Boldt here.  :-)  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything else I like better for the price and quality</li>

            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually one more thing.</li>
            <li>I walk around smelling my hands afterwards - it&#x27;s more than just lavender.</li>
            <li>Smells more like odor...</li>
            <li>We love the Meyers  products, but not paying $$ every time we run out.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it in my kitchen &amp;  bath.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and consistency of this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s cheaper soaps out there, but this soap is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li>Love using this and making my own unique and signature hand soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap - it is a huge help to have the refill so easily available!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>This is a great soap, I love that&#x27;s natural, and it has such a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>And it smells ok, not the best smelling lavendar soap, but I didn&#x27;t think it was overwhelming like some other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>I love Meyer&#x27;s soap so this makes it really easy to have on hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not good for those with sensitive skin of any kind.</li>
            <li>Great hand soap, smells very natural.</li>
            <li>The large bottle is a great way to keep a dispenser full at a lower cost.</li>
            <li>Cleaning isn&#x27;t something I get excited about or anything, but the scents of these products makes it a little more bearable :)  The lavender scent is my favorite so I decided to purchase it as a hand soup and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good and probably gets my hands pretty clean</li>
            <li>quick easy transaction !</li>
            <li>love the clean smell.</li>
            <li>Clean refreshing scent</li>
            <li>Love the scent, gets hands squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Also, easy to pour into my hand soap dispensers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use to refill soap dispensers.  </li>
            <li>Easy to refill the hand soap dispensers</li>
            <li>This arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>The refill container is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Has a really strong smell.</li>
            <li>Way too strong and did not like the smell at all.</li>
            <li>fragrance is SO STRONG</li>
            <li>Too strong after smell.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>All these Meyer&#x27;s products are excellent and the prices on Amazon make them worth buying online --- as long as you have Prime.</li>
            <li>It refilled my hand soap bottles just fine.  </li>
            <li>I think it smells fine.</li>
            <li>Product as promised, quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I use the lavender hand soap and room spray - it&#x27;s my absolute favorite!  </li>
            <li>Which is fine, if you like that sort of scent, but I was looking for something more fresh.</li>
            <li>I was originally put off by how strong the scent of this soap.  </li>
            <li>Should have paid a little bit more attention to the volume but still happy with the product, even in its wittle adorable baby soap container.</li>
            <li>my own fault really.</li>
            <li>The refill is a great deal vs. buying the individual hand soaps.</li>
            <li>The difference between using Meyer&#x27;s and my milk &amp; honey soap (the light one) was HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this hand soap.</li>
            <li>Smells great but the container is smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li>it is available at HEB and Target.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make it more economical, I dilute it and put it in one of the foaming dispensers.</li>
            <li>Every Meyer&#x27;s hand soap in all the scents I have tried so far, I have loved.  </li>
            <li>I miss the old packaging for the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s refills (a collapsible bag), but still find this to be a good deal.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong, very floral aroma and seems to be fairly easy on skin as well.  </li>
            <li>It smells too sweet, almost like honey in my opinion, and the scent is too strong.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the flowery scent, but it is very clean smelling and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a hand soap with more natural ingredients that actually works and smells good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m familiar with -</li>
            <li>I love the aroma smell ;)</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to smell anything like the original Mrs. Meyers lavender soap that it&#x27;s replacing.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, not sweet but spicy in a way, and love Mrs. Meyers&#x27; products for gentleness and commitment to the planet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great scent, and with three kids in the house, the refill goes a long way.</li>
            <li>However, this lavender scent is not as clean.  </li>
            <li>soap gets you clean, but it smells like vomit....</li>
            <li>Products from Meyers are always fresh natural and good.</li>
            <li>leaves your hands feeling clean after washing, and does not have the oily feel that some soaps have</li>
            <li>Meyer&#x27;s clean day lavender aromatherapeutic foaming hand soap.</li>
            <li>Great price for what you get, much cheaper than at the natural food store.</li>
            <li>Smells nice really cleans your hands and worth the money.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hands clean.</li>
            <li>Meyers products are wonderful and I love the hand wash, it keeps my hands soft and free of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is a good size jug of it, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li>Makes the whole bathroom better.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad - it&#x27;s just about 20X stronger than it needs to be.</li>
            <li>I have loved Mrs. Meyers lavender hand soap for a long time now, and love these large refill bottles.  </li>
            <li>I liked the old envelope type refills better than the new mini jugs.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery too.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product as a mild hand cleaner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wears off quickly, but I can smell my kids coming.</li>
            <li>Some quick math shows that 6 12.5 ounce bottles is 75 ounces for 20.34.  </li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>Makes me want to wash my hands more than necessary.. :)</li>
            <li>the beautiful heavy</li>
            <li>This hand soap has a lovely scent that leaves hands clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Very pleasant, but not overwhelming scent!</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and I love the Mrs Meyers cleaning products, fresh clean and natural</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to have found a refill instead of buying new ones all the time.</li>
            <li>I tried out the regular sized bottle and decided I liked the clean fresh scent</li>
            <li>I am not usually a lover of lavender scents, but this soap is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>Totally met my expectations, love it!</li>
            <li>Not only does this soap smell AMAZING</li>
            <li>(For point of comparison, so far my favorite is EO brand lavender soap.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite product.</li>
            <li>Worth the splurge, esp when can buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>We just wish we could find a refill that was actually worth buying.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hand soap.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Economical refill size.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how natural it is they could&#x27;ve done a better job at scenting it.</li>
            <li>If you like the scent of this soap then the fact that it&#x27;s strong and long lasting makes it a great value for the price.  </li>
            <li>I like Meyers Lavendar hand soap very much as their company use natural ingredients, which I feel is very important for one&#x27;s  health.  </li>
            <li>Great soap, I love the smell, I was just surprised by how small it is.</li>
            <li>The scent wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of aroma.</li>
            <li>The spout is resealable, and just the right size to pour into the soap bottle - no spilling or messes.</li>
            <li>Very wholesome hand soap, that leaves your hands clean but not feeling like they have been exposed to industrial chemicals.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really get the full effect of scents -  </li>
            <li>Smells good but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper to buy 6 brand new 12.5 ounce bottles for 20.34 and free shipping than to buy one 33 ounce refill for 10.93.    </li>
            <li>Cleans well, does not dry out my hands when washing many so times per day.</li>
            <li>It is also soft on the hands and has an easy refill spout.</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to purchase refills rather than continuing to waste plastic buying new dispenser bottles.  </li>
            <li>but I laughed at the little mini bottle that arrived at my front door.</li>
            <li>Takes a little for a good hand wash.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother my husband&#x27;s skin, and it does smell nice, but it is not gentle.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li>, it smells funny</li>
            <li>I contemplated grabbing some gasoline to make sure that there was no way this could harm anyone else, but instead I went and grabbed a different soap that didn&#x27;t smell like</li>
            <li>Unfortunately never reiceved it..</li>
            <li>Unless there is a version of lavender that smells exactly like Febreeze, this is bait and switch.</li>
            <li>Glad we could finally find a refill size.</li>
            <li>It is often difficult to find in the nearby stores, so Amazon is the best way buy it!</li>
            <li>If you can smell this at a retail site first, I recommend sampling it.</li>
            <li>I have been interested in purchasing this line of product.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased Lemon Verbena and find it very refreshing.</li>
            <li>and my hands are clean but not dried out when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Okay aroma, but for some reason the bottle looks bigger on the website than it really is.</li>
            <li>It has essential oils and leaves the skin smelling natural and nice.</li>
            <li>And it feels good using a little less plastic, although it would be great if they had a larger size.</li>
            <li>We are probably not typical, however, in that we have some severe allergies in our household that cause us to opt for fragrance free options in almost everything, so we&#x27;re not used to such strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>Simple, gentle, clear, nicely smelling soap.</li>
            <li>I read one of the reviews that stated this soap is full of chemicals and to steer clear of it.</li>
            <li>The soap works fine in that it does not dry your skin</li>
            <li>Love the smell and that it cleans but doesn&#x27;t dry hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such a strong reaction to a product&#x27;s scent.  </li>
            <li>albeit it&#x27;s not as strong in the refill as it seems to be in the actual hand pump bottle.</li>
            <li>So it usually takes 2 pumps to get the bubbles really going for a good wash.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely, and buying the refill is a better deal - and less wasteful of plastic - than buying the individual hand soap bottles all the time.  </li>
            <li>If you find that you do like the scent, be aware that the cost, compared to the size if the jug you receive, is high.</li>
            <li>No one in the family wants to use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on hands and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>I really like the Meyer&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li>It has a much cleaner and fresher scent.)  </li>
            <li>I like their products but believe the lemon scent is much fresher.</li>
            <li>I know the smell of lavender very well, and this is not it.  </li>
            <li>W-A-Y too much lavender scent in this one.  </li>
            <li>as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Price is an important component to the overall value of an item, thus it should play a part in the rating.</li>
            <li>We really like it.  </li>
            <li>However, this does not smell much like lavender.</li>
            <li>and thanks for making a refill so I don&#x27;t have to keep wasting bottles</li>
            <li>We use so much of this that the 33 Oz refill saves us .</li>
            <li>Since I had so much of it, I alternated it with a lighter/softer soap.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it, but it&#x27;s $3 cheaper from Fresh Direct.</li>
            <li>The lavender has a fresh, natural scent.</li>
            <li>Delivered promptly, thanks.</li>
            <li>What wasn&#x27;t great was that the safety seal was broken when it arrived so it leaked all over in the box.</li>
            <li>It was ok, just didn&#x27;t smell as much like lavender as I had expected.</li>
            <li>although they claim it natural, it is actually not as ingredient listed many chemicals which you do not want to put on your hands.</li>
            <li>This soap is not too thick and not too watery, it smells good and cleans well.</li>
            <li>Not too much fragrance like most other soaps.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell that is better than dove or other cheaper solutions.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than other brands with regards to cleaning and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The following is the original review:    </li>
            <li>It does the job well in cleaning and has such an original and effervescent scent.</li>
            <li>More plastic and product for less just doesn&#x27;t make economic or environmental sense.    </li>
            <li>I have tried body wash in my hand soap dispensers and that was not any better than the typical hand</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t run out of refill soap so quickly as I did with the smaller containers.  </li>
            <li>I like this hand soap mainly because the ingredients are more natural than some other soaps.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend (p.s.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Meyers products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well, but my wife won&#x27;t use it due to the strong smell.</li>
            <li>Smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a refill of Mrs. Meyers soap for a few years now and am glad that amazon now carries it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as it&#x27;s one of the few liquid hand soaps that does not contain DEA or MEA--cancer causing chemicals added to many shampoos and liquid hand soaps.  </li>
            <li>It has such a fresh smell to it.</li>
            <li>I normally cannot handle scented things.</li>
            <li>I love not having to buy the smaller bottles every single time.</li>
            <li>Right product but smaller size than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>It smelled like someone had ran over an animal at a landfill, left it there, and I just happened to be downwind from it right before the 90 degree heat had made it explode.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important to me that it was not &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; soap and that it does not contain triclosan, phthalates, or other harmful compounds.</li>
            <li>This product saves the hassle of going to the store to get a new bottle, we save $$ and the environment.</li>
            <li>Ok, but I found it far too heavily scented.</li>
            <li>I know it comes in several different scents, but I enjoy using the lavender one.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not very soothing and refreshing as lavender is suppose to be, but the soap is thick and it cleans your hands fine.</li>
            <li>I like using this liquid soap from Meyers, and thought buying this refill would be better than buying the small bottles all the time.  </li>
            <li>The first whiff does, but then it becomes a completely different scent.</li>
            <li>if you got a sensitive nose, beware!</li>
            <li>I used it to fill up a smaller Meyers hand soap dispenser in our bathroom and there is enough left for about 2 more refills</li>
            <li>Love the smell of lavender, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure what scent this soap is.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, but not exactly lavender, must be lavender mixed with some other scents.  </li>
            <li>I even cut the soap with half a bottle of water when I refill my dispensers, and it still cleans well and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like lavender, but not pleasant.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but a little thick.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the scent.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something natural to refill my soap dispensers.</li>
            <li>The bottle is smaller than you think and it doesn&#x27;t make much suds when you are washing your hands.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands frequently and wanted something that did not irritate my hands.</li>
            <li>SO FAR I RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hands moist and soft without leaving a soapy film on my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, my hands are not dried out after using it.</li>
            <li>This soap is simple, clear, and has a nice subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>They say &#x27;green&#x27; and &#x27;earth friendly&#x27; but why &#x27;fragrance&#x27;?</li>
            <li>So I did the only logical thing and re washed my hands... with the same soap.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this soap, however, if you have either dry or sensitive skin, it is not for you.  </li>
            <li>I do suffer from mild eczema and the heavy perfume in this soap resulted in flare-ups.</li>
            <li>Long live lavender!</li>
            <li>Great soap, bad price for refill</li>
            <li>It contains a lot of natural ingredients and after reading about the synthetic ingredients and verifying them, I was not alarmed nor am I overly concerned since I only use it on my hands.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>It barely smells scented at all, and the scent it does have isn&#x27;t lavender</li>
            <li>This cleaning brand emerged around the same time as Method and Seventh Generation so people assume it is all natural.</li>
            <li>As it stands now, we&#x27;ll simply buy 6 brand new bottles over the refill for the next order.</li>
            <li>Those used less plastic, which is the point of buying refills in the first place.</li>
            <li>This is a less expensive way to use a very handy sink-side p roduct.  </li>
            <li>I  was surprised when I received my order last week that this refill bottle had no cap just the white seal cap.  </li>
            <li>For a product that markets itself as natural and simple, you would expect them to use essential oils to fragrance their products.  </li>
            <li>not sure it was worth it..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a natural product and that it is moisturizing and does not leave your hands dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>I just put it in an old softsoap pump and it has lasted such a long time.</li>
            <li>and it just has a little too much of something that is not lavender.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Absolutely love this soap in the kitchen, and this is a great deal for this size refill.</li>
            <li> great bargain , love this scent.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a great quality soap, and I love that they started sending it in a pouch rather than the environmentally un-friendly tub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, good price.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product!  </li>
            <li> you can go to Kroger, unscrew the top and sniff to see if you like the scent - if you like lavender, I believe you will!)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the lemon verbena scent!  </li>
            <li> ok, lets see.. lets use it for Dishes!</li>
            <li> It is all that and more!</li>
            <li> Though I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products, I&#x27;ll never buy this again!</li>
            <li> my favorite soap!</li>
            <li> i love this hand soap!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love this lavender soap!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many guests come out of the bathroom raving about my soap and wondering where they can get some!  </li>
            <li> But it works and gets the onion smell off of my hands in the kitchen - which is important for a chef!!</li>
            <li> The smell is also a bit chemical versus something a bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li> We received this very quickly which was great because I almost ran out.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of the lavender soap (it is pleasant and not overpowering and is gender neutral).  </li>
            <li> The lavender scent is amazing and will have you washing your hands throughout the day just to smell it again.</li>
            <li> This fits the bill nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of musky</li>
            <li> Smells nice, feels soapy.</li>
            <li> cause i cant stand the smell...same with the family and no one liked it.</li>
            <li> I already knew I liked this liquid soap</li>
            <li> I can refill them or use my own.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on your hands and smells delightful</li>
            <li> Makes it handy</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t give it away because no one liked the scent.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice hand soap.  </li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and gentle on hands.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job washing hands and love that it&#x27;s not made from synthetic material.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good, I love the lavendar scent.</li>
            <li> I thought buying this with lavender scent and knowing it was a fairly &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; product would be safe to do.</li>
            <li> I always feel like I am doing something nice for myself and my family when I have it in my home.</li>
            <li> Smells good, I love Meyers products.</li>
            <li> I love the perfect mix of lavender, it&#x27;s the most clean and appealing fragrance!  </li>
            <li> Quality product that is a great way to keep our hands and skin clean.</li>
            <li> Has lasted me over a year, smells great, leaves my hands feeling clean and manly.</li>
            <li> This one is light and pleasant as well.  </li>
            <li> The scent this leaves on your hands is VERY strong so</li>
            <li> Lathers nice, but the smell is so overwhelming and nauseating that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the best hand soap without drying out my hands.</li>
            <li> early- great!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Lavender scent and it&#x27;s great - fresh herbs but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a more natural product and this one works and smells wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The light scent of lavender on clean hands is great.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job washing my hands!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, two very important things about this</li>
            <li> This soap has a nice strong scent.  </li>
            <li> Good product, quick service</li>
            <li> it smells wonderful, works great, and is more economical than always buying single hand soaps.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice, strong, lavender scent and leaves your hands feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> All is ok.</li>
            <li> and I would order it again soon! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Lavender is my favorite sent and this 100% is not what lavender smells like.</li>
            <li> There is another liquid soap that I purchased (4 gallons for $25) that I ended up throwing away because it had a lot of known health risk chemicals (too many to list) in it</li>
            <li> It smelled more like overly-sweet blueberries or something.</li>
            <li> Love love love how this product smells.</li>
            <li> Mmmmm I love this smell of this stuff.</li>

            <li> It is both fragrant and refreshing.</li>
            <li> And I love the cost efficiency of the refills.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Mrs. Boldt here.  :-)  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything else I like better for the price and quality</li>
            <li> and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s free of toxic substances!</li>

            <li> Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have bought the lavender hand soap in this size many times.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually one more thing.</li>
            <li> I walk around smelling my hands afterwards - it&#x27;s more than just lavender.</li>
            <li> Smells more like odor...</li>
            <li> We love the Meyers  products, but not paying $$ every time we run out.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it in my kitchen &amp;  bath.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and consistency of this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s cheaper soaps out there, but this soap is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> The scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li> Love using this and making my own unique and signature hand soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap - it is a huge help to have the refill so easily available!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, I love that&#x27;s natural, and it has such a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> And it smells ok, not the best smelling lavendar soap, but I didn&#x27;t think it was overwhelming like some other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> I love Meyer&#x27;s soap so this makes it really easy to have on hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not good for those with sensitive skin of any kind.</li>
            <li> Great hand soap, smells very natural.</li>
            <li> The large bottle is a great way to keep a dispenser full at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> Cleaning isn&#x27;t something I get excited about or anything, but the scents of these products makes it a little more bearable :)  The lavender scent is my favorite so I decided to purchase it as a hand soup and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good and probably gets my hands pretty clean</li>
            <li> quick easy transaction !</li>
            <li> love the clean smell.</li>
            <li> Clean refreshing scent</li>
            <li> Love the scent, gets hands squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Also, easy to pour into my hand soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use to refill soap dispensers.  </li>
            <li> Easy to refill the hand soap dispensers</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> The refill container is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Has a really strong smell.</li>
            <li> Way too strong and did not like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> fragrance is SO STRONG</li>
            <li> Too strong after smell.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> All these Meyer&#x27;s products are excellent and the prices on Amazon make them worth buying online --- as long as you have Prime.</li>
            <li> It refilled my hand soap bottles just fine.  </li>
            <li> I think it smells fine.</li>
            <li> Product as promised, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I use the lavender hand soap and room spray - it&#x27;s my absolute favorite!  </li>
            <li> Which is fine, if you like that sort of scent, but I was looking for something more fresh.</li>
            <li> I was originally put off by how strong the scent of this soap.  </li>
            <li> Should have paid a little bit more attention to the volume but still happy with the product, even in its wittle adorable baby soap container.</li>
            <li> my own fault really.</li>
            <li> The refill is a great deal vs. buying the individual hand soaps.</li>
            <li> The difference between using Meyer&#x27;s and my milk &amp; honey soap (the light one) was HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this hand soap.</li>
            <li> Smells great but the container is smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> it is available at HEB and Target.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make it more economical, I dilute it and put it in one of the foaming dispensers.</li>
            <li> Every Meyer&#x27;s hand soap in all the scents I have tried so far, I have loved.  </li>
            <li> I miss the old packaging for the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s refills (a collapsible bag), but still find this to be a good deal.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong, very floral aroma and seems to be fairly easy on skin as well.  </li>
            <li> It smells too sweet, almost like honey in my opinion, and the scent is too strong.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the flowery scent, but it is very clean smelling and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a hand soap with more natural ingredients that actually works and smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m familiar with -</li>
            <li> I love the aroma smell ;)</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to smell anything like the original Mrs. Meyers lavender soap that it&#x27;s replacing.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, not sweet but spicy in a way, and love Mrs. Meyers&#x27; products for gentleness and commitment to the planet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great scent, and with three kids in the house, the refill goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, this lavender scent is not as clean.  </li>
            <li> soap gets you clean, but it smells like vomit....</li>
            <li> Products from Meyers are always fresh natural and good.</li>
            <li> leaves your hands feeling clean after washing, and does not have the oily feel that some soaps have</li>
            <li> Meyer&#x27;s clean day lavender aromatherapeutic foaming hand soap.</li>
            <li> Great price for what you get, much cheaper than at the natural food store.</li>
            <li> Smells nice really cleans your hands and worth the money.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hands clean.</li>
            <li> Meyers products are wonderful and I love the hand wash, it keeps my hands soft and free of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is a good size jug of it, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> Makes the whole bathroom better.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad - it&#x27;s just about 20X stronger than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> I have loved Mrs. Meyers lavender hand soap for a long time now, and love these large refill bottles.  </li>
            <li> I liked the old envelope type refills better than the new mini jugs.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery too.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as a mild hand cleaner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wears off quickly, but I can smell my kids coming.</li>
            <li> Some quick math shows that 6 12.5 ounce bottles is 75 ounces for 20.34.  </li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Makes me want to wash my hands more than necessary.. :)</li>
            <li> the beautiful heavy</li>
            <li> This hand soap has a lovely scent that leaves hands clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Very pleasant, but not overwhelming scent!</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and I love the Mrs Meyers cleaning products, fresh clean and natural</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to have found a refill instead of buying new ones all the time.</li>
            <li> I tried out the regular sized bottle and decided I liked the clean fresh scent</li>
            <li> I am not usually a lover of lavender scents, but this soap is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> Totally met my expectations, love it!</li>
            <li> Not only does this soap smell AMAZING</li>
            <li> (For point of comparison, so far my favorite is EO brand lavender soap.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite product.</li>
            <li> Worth the splurge, esp when can buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> We just wish we could find a refill that was actually worth buying.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hand soap.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Economical refill size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how natural it is they could&#x27;ve done a better job at scenting it.</li>
            <li> If you like the scent of this soap then the fact that it&#x27;s strong and long lasting makes it a great value for the price.  </li>
            <li> I like Meyers Lavendar hand soap very much as their company use natural ingredients, which I feel is very important for one&#x27;s  health.  </li>
            <li> Great soap, I love the smell, I was just surprised by how small it is.</li>
            <li> The scent wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of aroma.</li>
            <li> The spout is resealable, and just the right size to pour into the soap bottle - no spilling or messes.</li>
            <li> Very wholesome hand soap, that leaves your hands clean but not feeling like they have been exposed to industrial chemicals.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really get the full effect of scents -  </li>
            <li> Smells good but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper to buy 6 brand new 12.5 ounce bottles for 20.34 and free shipping than to buy one 33 ounce refill for 10.93.    </li>
            <li> Cleans well, does not dry out my hands when washing many so times per day.</li>
            <li> It is also soft on the hands and has an easy refill spout.</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to purchase refills rather than continuing to waste plastic buying new dispenser bottles.  </li>
            <li> but I laughed at the little mini bottle that arrived at my front door.</li>
            <li> Takes a little for a good hand wash.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my husband&#x27;s skin, and it does smell nice, but it is not gentle.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> , it smells funny</li>
            <li> I contemplated grabbing some gasoline to make sure that there was no way this could harm anyone else, but instead I went and grabbed a different soap that didn&#x27;t smell like</li>
            <li> Unfortunately never reiceved it..</li>
            <li> Unless there is a version of lavender that smells exactly like Febreeze, this is bait and switch.</li>
            <li> Glad we could finally find a refill size.</li>
            <li> It is often difficult to find in the nearby stores, so Amazon is the best way buy it!</li>
            <li> If you can smell this at a retail site first, I recommend sampling it.</li>
            <li> I have been interested in purchasing this line of product.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased Lemon Verbena and find it very refreshing.</li>
            <li> and my hands are clean but not dried out when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Okay aroma, but for some reason the bottle looks bigger on the website than it really is.</li>
            <li> It has essential oils and leaves the skin smelling natural and nice.</li>
            <li> And it feels good using a little less plastic, although it would be great if they had a larger size.</li>
            <li> We are probably not typical, however, in that we have some severe allergies in our household that cause us to opt for fragrance free options in almost everything, so we&#x27;re not used to such strong fragrances.</li>
            <li> Simple, gentle, clear, nicely smelling soap.</li>
            <li> I read one of the reviews that stated this soap is full of chemicals and to steer clear of it.</li>
            <li> The soap works fine in that it does not dry your skin</li>
            <li> Love the smell and that it cleans but doesn&#x27;t dry hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such a strong reaction to a product&#x27;s scent.  </li>
            <li> albeit it&#x27;s not as strong in the refill as it seems to be in the actual hand pump bottle.</li>
            <li> So it usually takes 2 pumps to get the bubbles really going for a good wash.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely, and buying the refill is a better deal - and less wasteful of plastic - than buying the individual hand soap bottles all the time.  </li>
            <li> If you find that you do like the scent, be aware that the cost, compared to the size if the jug you receive, is high.</li>
            <li> No one in the family wants to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on hands and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> I really like the Meyer&#x27;s brand.</li>
            <li> It has a much cleaner and fresher scent.)  </li>
            <li> I like their products but believe the lemon scent is much fresher.</li>
            <li> I know the smell of lavender very well, and this is not it.  </li>
            <li> W-A-Y too much lavender scent in this one.  </li>
            <li> as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Price is an important component to the overall value of an item, thus it should play a part in the rating.</li>
            <li> We really like it.  </li>
            <li> However, this does not smell much like lavender.</li>
            <li> and thanks for making a refill so I don&#x27;t have to keep wasting bottles</li>
            <li> We use so much of this that the 33 Oz refill saves us .</li>
            <li> Since I had so much of it, I alternated it with a lighter/softer soap.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it, but it&#x27;s $3 cheaper from Fresh Direct.</li>
            <li> The lavender has a fresh, natural scent.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly, thanks.</li>
            <li> What wasn&#x27;t great was that the safety seal was broken when it arrived so it leaked all over in the box.</li>
            <li> It was ok, just didn&#x27;t smell as much like lavender as I had expected.</li>
            <li> although they claim it natural, it is actually not as ingredient listed many chemicals which you do not want to put on your hands.</li>
            <li> This soap is not too thick and not too watery, it smells good and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Not too much fragrance like most other soaps.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that is better than dove or other cheaper solutions.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than other brands with regards to cleaning and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The following is the original review:    </li>
            <li> It does the job well in cleaning and has such an original and effervescent scent.</li>
            <li> More plastic and product for less just doesn&#x27;t make economic or environmental sense.    </li>
            <li> I have tried body wash in my hand soap dispensers and that was not any better than the typical hand</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t run out of refill soap so quickly as I did with the smaller containers.  </li>
            <li> I like this hand soap mainly because the ingredients are more natural than some other soaps.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend (p.s.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Meyers products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but my wife won&#x27;t use it due to the strong smell.</li>
            <li> Smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a refill of Mrs. Meyers soap for a few years now and am glad that amazon now carries it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as it&#x27;s one of the few liquid hand soaps that does not contain DEA or MEA--cancer causing chemicals added to many shampoos and liquid hand soaps.  </li>
            <li> It has such a fresh smell to it.</li>
            <li> I normally cannot handle scented things.</li>
            <li> I love not having to buy the smaller bottles every single time.</li>
            <li> Right product but smaller size than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> It smelled like someone had ran over an animal at a landfill, left it there, and I just happened to be downwind from it right before the 90 degree heat had made it explode.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also important to me that it was not &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; soap and that it does not contain triclosan, phthalates, or other harmful compounds.</li>
            <li> This product saves the hassle of going to the store to get a new bottle, we save $$ and the environment.</li>
            <li> Ok, but I found it far too heavily scented.</li>
            <li> I know it comes in several different scents, but I enjoy using the lavender one.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not very soothing and refreshing as lavender is suppose to be, but the soap is thick and it cleans your hands fine.</li>
            <li> I like using this liquid soap from Meyers, and thought buying this refill would be better than buying the small bottles all the time.  </li>
            <li> The first whiff does, but then it becomes a completely different scent.</li>
            <li> if you got a sensitive nose, beware!</li>
            <li> I used it to fill up a smaller Meyers hand soap dispenser in our bathroom and there is enough left for about 2 more refills</li>
            <li> Love the smell of lavender, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure what scent this soap is.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, but not exactly lavender, must be lavender mixed with some other scents.  </li>
            <li> I even cut the soap with half a bottle of water when I refill my dispensers, and it still cleans well and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Kind of like lavender, but not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but a little thick.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the scent.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural to refill my soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than you think and it doesn&#x27;t make much suds when you are washing your hands.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands frequently and wanted something that did not irritate my hands.</li>
            <li> SO FAR I RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hands moist and soft without leaving a soapy film on my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, my hands are not dried out after using it.</li>
            <li> This soap is simple, clear, and has a nice subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> They say &#x27;green&#x27; and &#x27;earth friendly&#x27; but why &#x27;fragrance&#x27;?</li>
            <li> So I did the only logical thing and re washed my hands... with the same soap.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this soap, however, if you have either dry or sensitive skin, it is not for you.  </li>
            <li> I do suffer from mild eczema and the heavy perfume in this soap resulted in flare-ups.</li>
            <li> Long live lavender!</li>
            <li> Great soap, bad price for refill</li>
            <li> It contains a lot of natural ingredients and after reading about the synthetic ingredients and verifying them, I was not alarmed nor am I overly concerned since I only use it on my hands.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> It barely smells scented at all, and the scent it does have isn&#x27;t lavender</li>
            <li> This cleaning brand emerged around the same time as Method and Seventh Generation so people assume it is all natural.</li>
            <li> As it stands now, we&#x27;ll simply buy 6 brand new bottles over the refill for the next order.</li>
            <li> Those used less plastic, which is the point of buying refills in the first place.</li>
            <li> This is a less expensive way to use a very handy sink-side p roduct.  </li>
            <li> I  was surprised when I received my order last week that this refill bottle had no cap just the white seal cap.  </li>
            <li> For a product that markets itself as natural and simple, you would expect them to use essential oils to fragrance their products.  </li>
            <li> not sure it was worth it..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a natural product and that it is moisturizing and does not leave your hands dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I just put it in an old softsoap pump and it has lasted such a long time.</li>
            <li> and it just has a little too much of something that is not lavender.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but last a long time!</li>
            <li> scent that this soap has that is pretty hard to bear and lingers on your skin after use.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the Whole Food&#x27;s brand lavender liquid hand soap, but when I saw this was 50% cheaper, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Never again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it makes it last a long time.</li>
            <li> We have been buying this locally for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find a soap that really cleans and is simply soap (no anti-bacterial additives).</li>
            <li> so your hands don&#x27;t dry out with multiple washes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something less harsh and commercial than the standard drug-store brands (which tended to react with the metal of our soap dispenser, leaving a green residue), and more gelatinous and less drying than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scent is really strong and long lasting as I can still smell the scent long after I&#x27;ve washed my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have never written an Amazon review before and this is the second I&#x27;ve written this week from a single shipment.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this even for those with normal skin since heavy perfumed anything can age your skin quicker and dry it</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance,cleans very dirty hand without using very much and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be much bigger and it was enough to refill 2 regular bottles waste of plastic</li>
            <li> Not much of a savings over individual bottles.</li>
            <li> This refill soap is cheaper than purchasing new pumps, and I like the shape because it takes up very little room on my laundry room shelf.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad really, because I&#x27;d rather buy a refill at a cheaper cost than a brand new pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products, but I hate having to buy new soap dispensers for them--it seems like that defeats the purpose of using environmentally-friendly products.</li>
            <li> Should have compared total ounces with other products I had in the cabinet.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been buying this handsoap, surface cleaner and dish soap in Lavender for so long!</li>
            <li> Works just the same as any other hand soap that is 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> It does dry the skin somewhat  however.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave residue or dry the skin</li>
            <li> dry them out and break them, it should be a cleaner for floors but not even beacuse is soap!</li>
            <li> I just thought that 33 ounces was a little bigger,</li>
            <li> You always need hand soap so why not buy a larger bottle and be a little greener?</li>
            <li> My larger concern was minimal lather and a not clean feel after using the soap...</li>
            <li> I use this product as a soft soap and also for washing delicate clothing by hand.  </li>
            <li> Be careful where you buy the refill from because it is not always cheaper than just buying pumps.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this soap with lavender scent at all three of our sinks.  </li>
            <li> Not easy to find at local stores, so easier to order online.</li>
            <li> My hands get really dirty due to working with horses and I can get them clean without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> sorry didnt like this soap very much</li>
            <li> The refill packaging lets me fill the same bottle producing less waste and its cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Came as expected!</li>
            <li> So, this Meyers refill bottle is a about twice the cost of other brands.</li>
            <li> This is of course personal taste, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell, this is not your usual lavender scent</li>
            <li> My disappointed is more in the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not endorsing the other two brands, just putting what I learned out there.</li>
            <li> Two noes competing with each other?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the Mrs. Meyers Clean Day products and have yet to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweeter and less floral scent than other lavenders I&#x27;ve smelled before.</li>
            <li> And the lavender actually smells like lavender....not a wonky chemically wannabe lavender.</li>
            <li> Looks like $10 down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Check out their other scents too!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to even pour it down my drain because it stinks up the whole bathroom for hours just with one use washing your hands!</li>
            <li> A little sour?</li>
            <li> I usually get 1+fills for both my sinks before I have to reorder.</li>
            <li> How can anyone mess up lavender?</li>
            <li> It was a mess.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A GEL CONSISTENCY AND POURS SLOWLY INTO SMALL MOUTH BOTTLES BUT WILL FILL SUCH CONTAINERS.  </li>
            <li> It makes me gag a little.</li>
            <li> Eco products get my vote even if it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> There is little to no lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> Saving a little money with refills is a plus as well.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, too bad it&#x27;s too darn expensive.</li>
            <li> It smell antiseptic and harsh.</li>
            <li> This soap cleans well and doesn&#x27;t seem overly harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> It also dried out my hands.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell of the soap.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hands too badly with frequent washing..</li>
            <li> I tried it several times thinking it couldn&#x27;t possibly be that bad</li>
            <li> So green!  </li>
            <li> I usually like the smell of lavender, but this one does not smell well.</li>
            <li> this thing is harsh in the hands!</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is.</li>
            <li> Bottle is too small to make sense for refills.</li>
            <li> Awful smell unless you enjoy washing your hands with perfume!</li>
            <li> This soap is scented but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one people!</li>
            <li> Small for the price, but like the product itself</li>
            <li> I am only Rating 3 stars because of the fragrance and because it&#x27;s too expensive for the amount of Product I am getting.</li>
            <li> It smells like salad dressing, nasty strong smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly thick soap as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick.</li>
            <li> It is too thick for automatic soap dispensers, so it has to be used in manual dispensers.</li>
            <li> However, with the first use I absolutely hated the scent.</li>
            <li> Twice as expensive as &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; stuff you get at Walgreens and half the size...</li>
            <li> I hate this product no matter how naturally it is made of.</li>
            <li> its too weak for that..</li>
            <li> Too small and expensive for the amount you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is not great.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> The secret to this soap is...</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying the bottles over and over.</li>
            <li> Nothing actually wrong with the product...</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong.  </li>
            <li> This is also expensive -- $11 for a 33oz bottle -- I can get Softsoap for $5 in a 56oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This is why I rate this hand soap with 3 stars - funky smell and expensive.</li>
            <li> , it just smells weird.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s just difficult to pour without getting soap dripping off.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> I would agree with everyone else on the weird lavender scent.</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> There is a weird</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> But if, like me, you hate the scent, the soap is a really bad buy and not worth the effort of returning it.</li>
            <li> The lavender scented soap is hands down the worst smelling soap I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really artificial.</li>
            <li> It smells artificial and is WAY to strong.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and he asked me to not because my hands smell so bad.</li>
            <li> It smells like perfumes in a bad sense.</li>
            <li> It is too bad.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it bad</li>
            <li> I must have  ordered all the bad stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> smell is too bad for me</li>
            <li> For two hours I smelled this atrocious smell, and for the life of me I could not figure out where the odor was coming from.</li>
            <li> It almost made me sick to use it.</li>
            <li> This soap STINKS!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be disappointed by the size.</li>
            <li> I hate the fragrance of this item</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sickening to my husband and I.</li>
            <li> That is misleading, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff smells awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like the smell of lavender, but this smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had issues with soap before, but this soap was terrible on my hands.</li>
            <li> Worst smelling &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; product I have ever tried.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok, but I found it far too heavily scented.</li>
            <li> So great to be able to refill my pumps.  So green!  Quick delivery too.  Mahalo!</li>
            <li> All is ok. Item was delivered on time and I would order it again soon! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great smelling.  Good lather.</li>
            <li> This soap is simple, clear, and has a nice subtle scent.  I was looking for something less harsh and commercial than the standard drug-store brands (which tended to react with the metal of our soap dispenser, leaving a green residue), and more gelatinous and less drying than Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  This fits the bill nicely.  Simple, gentle, clear, nicely smelling soap.</li>
            <li> Nothing actually wrong with the product... We don&#x27;t care for the scent... it is VERY STRONG!!! No one in the family wants to use it.</li>
            <li> I use this hand soap in the dispensers in my day spa.  This is a lovely product!  Long live lavender!</li>
            <li> I love Meyer&#x27;s soap so this makes it really easy to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff smells awful. I went to touch my husband after washing my hands with this stuff and he asked me to not because my hands smell so bad. Lavender is my favorite sent and this 100% is not what lavender smells like. It makes me gag a little.</li>
            <li> Great soap, I love the smell, I was just surprised by how small it is. I just thought that 33 ounces was a little bigger, my own fault really. It only gave me 2 refills on my soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap for my liquid soap dispenser. I have been using it for 6 months and I have had no allergic reactions to the ingredients. I like the lavender smell and the soap cleans my hands well and washes off without any residue. I read one of the reviews that stated this soap is full of chemicals and to steer clear of it. It contains a lot of natural ingredients and after reading about the synthetic ingredients and verifying them, I was not alarmed nor am I overly concerned since I only use it on my hands. There is another liquid soap that I purchased (4 gallons for $25) that I ended up throwing away because it had a lot of known health risk chemicals (too many to list) in it and it was cheaper than sending it back for a refund. I would recommend this product as a mild hand cleaner.</li>
            <li> These smell soo unbelievably good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great lavender hand soap before, and this isn&#x27;t it. The scent wasn&#x27;t right. It smelled more like overly-sweet blueberries or something. Kind of like lavender, but not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this soap, however, if you have either dry or sensitive skin, it is not for you.  I have to put hand lotion on after each use or I develop eczema on my hands and my children can&#x27;t use it at all without a rash forming. It doesn&#x27;t bother my husband&#x27;s skin, and it does smell nice, but it is not gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of the Mrs. Meyers Clean Day products and have yet to be disappointed.  Cleaning isn&#x27;t something I get excited about or anything, but the scents of these products makes it a little more bearable :)  The lavender scent is my favorite so I decided to purchase it as a hand soup and am very happy with it.  The refill packaging lets me fill the same bottle producing less waste and its cheaper.  Cant go wrong.  Check out their other scents too!</li>
            <li> great smelling soap, works great</li>
            <li> Love love love how this product smells. It&#x27;s gentle on hands and leaves no residue. I use it in every bathroom soap dispenser in my house.</li>
            <li> Has a really strong smell.</li>
            <li> Looks waaaay bigger in photo. Should have compared total ounces with other products I had in the cabinet. 33 fl oz is equivalent to a 1/4 gal, similar to a regular spray bottle of windex..not sure it was worth it..</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, but not exactly lavender, must be lavender mixed with some other scents.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my hands too badly with frequent washing..</li>
            <li> love the clean smell.</li>
            <li> I use the lavender hand soap and room spray - it&#x27;s my absolute favorite!  I love the perfect mix of lavender, it&#x27;s the most clean and appealing fragrance!  I highly recommend (p.s. you can go to Kroger, unscrew the top and sniff to see if you like the scent - if you like lavender, I believe you will!)</li>
            <li> I really like the Meyer&#x27;s brand. I previously purchased Lemon Verbena and find it very refreshing. However, this lavender scent is not as clean.  It is kind of musky and it just has a little too much of something that is not lavender. (For point of comparison, so far my favorite is EO brand lavender soap. It has a much cleaner and fresher scent.)  I gave it two stars because I do like that it&#x27;s a natural product and that it is moisturizing and does not leave your hands dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than the picture appears.  Granted the size (33 oz) is in the product description, however, the shape of the container looks like it would be much larger.</li>
            <li> Mmmmm I love this smell of this stuff. And it feels good using a little less plastic, although it would be great if they had a larger size. You always need hand soap so why not buy a larger bottle and be a little greener?</li>
            <li> like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.  I can&#x27;t tell that is better than dove or other cheaper solutions.  my skin is ok with both,</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li> Came as expected! Love this soap.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand soap- smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Thought this would be much bigger and it was enough to refill 2 regular bottles waste of plastic</li>
            <li> The product quantity for this product is listed as- Qty: 6x33 OZ . That was not the case, it is one 33oz refill only. That is misleading, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a seedy delivery</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is not great. I like their products but believe the lemon scent is much fresher. It&#x27;s a fairly thick soap as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap in the kitchen, and this is a great deal for this size refill.</li>
            <li> Way too strong and did not like the smell at all. Did not want to pay to return. Not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and that it cleans but doesn&#x27;t dry hands.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite product.</li>
            <li> We love this product.  Only one we use.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell of the soap. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Clean refreshing scent</li>
            <li> Great stuff, though. I also like the geranium, rhubarb and basil scented versions. All these Meyer&#x27;s products are excellent and the prices on Amazon make them worth buying online --- as long as you have Prime.</li>
            <li> We love this product.  It smells great, cleans great, and is a staple in our house.</li>
            <li> I love this soap but I laughed at the little mini bottle that arrived at my front door. Should have paid a little bit more attention to the volume but still happy with the product, even in its wittle adorable baby soap container.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like lvender! It smells like salad dressing, nasty strong smell. Do not waste your money on it. I would rate it ZERO STAR if I could</li>
            <li> This hand soap is OK. However....I purchased the Lavender scent and it&#x27;s not like any Lavender smell I&#x27;m familiar with - it&#x27;s acceptable - yet funky!.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than other brands with regards to cleaning and moisturizing. This is also expensive -- $11 for a 33oz bottle -- I can get Softsoap for $5 in a 56oz bottle. So, this Meyers refill bottle is a about twice the cost of other brands. This is why I rate this hand soap with 3 stars - funky smell and expensive.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely, and buying the refill is a better deal - and less wasteful of plastic - than buying the individual hand soap bottles all the time.  I even cut the soap with half a bottle of water when I refill my dispensers, and it still cleans well and smells fantastic.  I&#x27;ll definitely be re-ordering this when my refill runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this soap - it is a huge help to have the refill so easily available!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Right product but smaller size than I anticipated. My issue for not chcking my ounce.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but last a long time!</li>
            <li> We love this soap. We were looking for a more natural product and this one works and smells wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Great find. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this soap, but I miss the refills in the bag containers.  Those used less plastic, which is the point of buying refills in the first place.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, feels soapy. No regrets.</li>
            <li> Works and smells great. It&#x27;s a bit thick. I should probably dilute it a bit so it works easier in my pump bottle, but I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like Meyers Lavendar hand soap very much as their company use natural ingredients, which I feel is very important for one&#x27;s  health.  I know it comes in several different scents, but I enjoy using the lavender one.  I  was surprised when I received my order last week that this refill bottle had no cap just the white seal cap.  It refilled my hand soap bottles just fine.  Mrs Meyers has some great products which I use  three: hand soap, dish soap, and all purpose cleaner.</li>
            <li> I was originally put off by how strong the scent of this soap.  It has a very strong, very floral aroma and seems to be fairly easy on skin as well.  I prefer the Basil scent but would definitely reccomend the brand.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap for the bathroom and kitchen and I&#x27;m glad to have found a refill instead of buying new ones all the time.</li>
            <li> This is excellent soap.  The lavender is a very nice scent.  The bag is sturdy so you wont accidentally pop it between refills of the soap.  I tried reusing the bag it comes in like the description recommends and it works well as an interesting container.</li>
            <li> Great smell good soap,  just ordered a second bottle,  it was only enough to fill two sink counter holders.  I like this soap and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I usually like the smell of lavender, but this one does not smell well. The smell also doesn&#x27;t go away. I have to put lotion on to cover the smell.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I usually buy the Whole Food&#x27;s brand lavender liquid hand soap, but when I saw this was 50% cheaper, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Never again.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is SO STRONG it&#x27;s sickening to my husband and I. We are probably not typical, however, in that we have some severe allergies in our household that cause us to opt for fragrance free options in almost everything, so we&#x27;re not used to such strong fragrances. The smell is not bad - it&#x27;s just about 20X stronger than it needs to be.</li>
            <li> I love Meyers, but this scent is just ok for me.  I absolutely love the lemon verbena scent!  Will buy this size again with lemon verbena or another scent.</li>
            <li> Takes a little for a good hand wash. Eco products get my vote even if it&#x27;s a little pricey. Not easy to find at local stores, so easier to order online. Highly recommend Meyers products.</li>
            <li> soap gets you clean, but it smells like vomit....i threw it out cause i cant stand the smell...same with the family and no one liked it.</li>
            <li> This soap simply does NOT smell like lavender.  I know the smell of lavender very well, and this is not it.  For a product that markets itself as natural and simple, you would expect them to use essential oils to fragrance their products.  They do not.</li>
            <li> Safe for me, my pets, and the environment- it smells wonderful, works great, and is more economical than always buying single hand soaps.  The container reseals and stores well until the next fill is needed.  I usually get 1+fills for both my sinks before I have to reorder.</li>
            <li> I love some of the products in this line. How can anyone mess up lavender? Here is the answer. There is little to no lavender fragrance. It smell antiseptic and harsh. Lathers nice, but the smell is so overwhelming and nauseating that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Product as promised, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> The secret to this soap is... the beautiful heavy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears off quickly, but I can smell my kids coming. They are still stumped. &amp;#34;How does mommy know if I washed my hands?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love using this and making my own unique and signature hand soap.</li>
            <li> Products from Meyers are always fresh natural and good.</li>
            <li> Smells great. leaves your hands feeling clean after washing, and does not have the oily feel that some soaps have</li>
            <li> this thing is harsh in the hands! dry them out and break them, it should be a cleaner for floors but not even beacuse is soap! ok, lets see.. lets use it for Dishes! Nope! its too weak for that.. mmm Laundry maybe? it may stain your clothes,</li>
            <li> The soap works fine in that it does not dry your skin however I do not like this lavender scent at all.  It smells too sweet, almost like honey in my opinion, and the scent is too strong.  Works in your favor if you actually like the smell, but this is just not for me.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, gets hands squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I already knew I liked this liquid soap and it arrived just as I expected-smelling great and doing it&#x27;s job. It is all that and more!</li>
            <li> It smells like perfumes in a bad sense. I hate this product no matter how naturally it is made of.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but my wife won&#x27;t use it due to the strong smell. The smell is also a bit chemical versus something a bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like lavender, it actually smells like vomit.  I&#x27;m not getting this again. It is too bad.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is amazing and will have you washing your hands throughout the day just to smell it again.</li>
            <li> I like having a soap that&#x27;s smell appeals to both me and my husband. I also like the Basil scent, which I use in the kitchen. I have the lavender in the bathrooms.</li>
            <li> We received this very quickly which was great because I almost ran out.  Love the scent of this  product. Saving a little money with refills is a plus as well.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, good brand!</li>
            <li> W-A-Y too much lavender scent in this one.  It almost made me sick to use it. Though I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products, I&#x27;ll never buy this again!</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of lavender you will love this hand soap. Reasonably priced too! I use Mrs. Meyers laundry detergent, cleaner and air freshener too.</li>
            <li> We are happy with product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a refill of Mrs. Meyers soap for a few years now and am glad that amazon now carries it.  I love the smell of the lavender soap (it is pleasant and not overpowering and is gender neutral).  It is nice to be able to purchase refills rather than continuing to waste plastic buying new dispenser bottles.  I only wish they would release one twice this size.</li>
            <li> &#x27;ok&#x27; is the best I can do on this review. The scent wasn&#x27;t to my choice, since scents are subjective YMMV. My larger concern was minimal lather and a not clean feel after using the soap...I won&#x27;t repurchase when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good, people want to follow the smell. Cleans well, does not dry out my hands when washing many so times per day.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot.  I have tried body wash in my hand soap dispensers and that was not any better than the typical hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best hand soap without drying out my hands. I can&#x27;t believe how Marvelous it is...</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like the smell of lavender, but this smells horrible.  The smell actually made me physically nauseous.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best!</li>
            <li> Smells good and a little goes a long way. Works well with my built in kitchen sink dispenser.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Worth the splurge, esp when can buy in bulk. Comes well packaged with no messes.</li>
            <li> I love not having to buy the smaller bottles every single time. I can refill them or use my own. And the lavender actually smells like lavender....not a wonky chemically wannabe lavender.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say -- hand soap, lavender -- how can one not like this?</li>
            <li> as described, fast shipping. sorry didnt like this soap very much, it smells funny and theres no lather what so ever. not at all happy with this purchase !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recycled my foam dispensers and refilled them with a 1 - 3 ratio of soap &amp; water. Hands feel and smell amazing! I&#x27;ve also did 1/2 soap &amp; water for body wash. Works wonderful! I love the aroma smell ;)</li>
            <li> my favorite soap! i love this hand soap!</li>
            <li> The lavender scented soap is hands down the worst smelling soap I have ever smelled. For two hours I smelled this atrocious smell, and for the life of me I could not figure out where the odor was coming from. It was only when I itched my nose that the source of this offensive odor was finally found. It smelled like someone had ran over an animal at a landfill, left it there, and I just happened to be downwind from it right before the 90 degree heat had made it explode. So I did the only logical thing and re washed my hands... with the same soap. That is when I discovered that the stench that was following me around was from Mrs.Meyer&#x27;s clean day lavender aromatherapeutic foaming hand soap. I contemplated grabbing some gasoline to make sure that there was no way this could harm anyone else, but instead I went and grabbed a different soap that didn&#x27;t smell like the corpse plant was their inspiration.</li>
            <li> I like using this liquid soap from Meyers, and thought buying this refill would be better than buying the small bottles all the time.  The only downside is that you can only use this about three times.  Not much of a savings over individual bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this hand soap. It is gentle on your hands and smells delightful</li>
            <li> Update 2/25/15: The soap smells great and cleans hands well! Be careful where you buy the refill from because it is not always cheaper than just buying pumps. The below comments are based on a price of 10.93 for the refill. Refills can be purchased from the manufacturer at a much better price than here on Amazon. At the manufacturer&#x27;s price this is a 5 star product.       The following is the original review:    Great soap, bad price for refill if you have Amazon prime. Price is an important component to the overall value of an item, thus it should play a part in the rating. Hence, the two star rating. It is cheaper to buy 6 brand new 12.5 ounce bottles for 20.34 and free shipping than to buy one 33 ounce refill for 10.93.    Some quick math shows that 6 12.5 ounce bottles is 75 ounces for 20.34.  Buying two refills would get you 66 ounces at a cost of 21.86.    It&#x27;s sad really, because I&#x27;d rather buy a refill at a cheaper cost than a brand new pump bottle. More plastic and product for less just doesn&#x27;t make economic or environmental sense.    We like the soap. We just wish we could find a refill that was actually worth buying. As it stands now, we&#x27;ll simply buy 6 brand new bottles over the refill for the next order.</li>
            <li> I wanted a lavender scented refill for my soaps, this was smaller than imagined, but it does list the oz so I can&#x27;t complian.  And it smells ok, not the best smelling lavendar soap, but I didn&#x27;t think it was overwhelming like some other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> Meyers products are wonderful and I love the hand wash, it keeps my hands soft and free of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love Mrs. Meyers soap. The lavender scent is my favorite. These bottles are great for refills and they are recyclable.</li>
            <li> Best hand soap ever, all their scents are amazing but lavender is the mildest.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that this product leaves my hands softer</li>
            <li> Lasted a while, Great choice for enviornment and nice on hands.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this soap with lavender scent at all three of our sinks.  We really like it.  I liked the old envelope type refills better than the new mini jugs.</li>
            <li> I like this hand soap mainly because the ingredients are more natural than some other soaps.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, the lavender scent isn&#x27;t overpowering but it smells great and my hands are clean but not dried out when I use it.  I purchased the InterDesign Foaming Soap Pump to use with this and it makes it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately never reiceved it.. But hopefuly I&#x27;ll get it soon! I know it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible!!!&lt;br /&gt;I know what lavender smells like. It&#x27;s really artificial.</li>
            <li> I have loved Mrs. Meyers lavender hand soap for a long time now, and love these large refill bottles.  Makes it handy and I don&#x27;t run out of refill soap so quickly as I did with the smaller containers.  Also, easy to pour into my hand soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  Every Meyer&#x27;s hand soap in all the scents I have tried so far, I have loved.  This one is light and pleasant as well.  I have no intention of ever trying another brand.</li>
            <li> 1) DO NOT BUY!  This soap STINKS!  I used it once, and had to wash my hands with a different soap to get the stink off of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Don&#x27;t buy from Bay 15 because their return policy is only 2WEEKS.  By the time I opened the soap and used it, the return period of over.  Looks like $10 down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Bottle is much smaller than the picture appears (though its technically the correct quantity)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay soap. The smell is not very soothing and refreshing as lavender is suppose to be, but the soap is thick and it cleans your hands fine. I use it on my kitchen sink dispenser.</li>
            <li> Love how this has olive oil so your hands don&#x27;t dry out with multiple washes.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, good price.</li>
            <li> great bargain , love this scent.</li>
            <li> I got this to refill a lavender soap thing that was running low.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to smell anything like the original Mrs. Meyers lavender soap that it&#x27;s replacing.  It barely smells scented at all, and the scent it does have isn&#x27;t lavender, it just smells weird.  Super disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Later on in the bag, I can definitely smell it. I&#x27;m wondering if the scent didn&#x27;t get mixed in fully?</li>
            <li> The one I received smells nothing like lavender. Not sure what it is.</li>
            <li> This soap cleans well and doesn&#x27;t seem overly harsh on my skin. However, this does not smell much like lavender. The first whiff does, but then it becomes a completely different scent. One of my friends exclaimed, \\&quot;it smells like apple pie!\\&quot; when he used our soap. Now, that&#x27;s all I can smell! Which is fine, if you like that sort of scent, but I was looking for something more fresh. I would suggest the lemon verbena scent of Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products instead!</li>
            <li> Okay aroma, but for some reason the bottle looks bigger on the website than it really is. Do your math well before you order. Will not order the same next time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as it&#x27;s one of the few liquid hand soaps that does not contain DEA or MEA--cancer causing chemicals added to many shampoos and liquid hand soaps.  My husband doesn&#x27;t care for the smell.  I&#x27;m going to see if they sell any odorless kinds.</li>
            <li> Love the lavender smell...I keep ordering more!!!</li>
            <li> I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products, but I hate having to buy new soap dispensers for them--it seems like that defeats the purpose of using environmentally-friendly products. This refill soap is cheaper than purchasing new pumps, and I like the shape because it takes up very little room on my laundry room shelf.</li>
            <li> Love this product . Quick delivery</li>
            <li> This soap has a nice strong scent.  Great price for what you get, much cheaper than at the natural food store.</li>
            <li> Product as described and delivered days early- great!</li>
            <li> this stuff smells like wonderful walk in a French meadow. Ahhhhhh</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and I love the Mrs Meyers cleaning products, fresh clean and natural, what more can you ask for in a world filled with chemicals?!</li>
            <li> Love it. great hand soap! quick easy transaction ! thank you</li>
            <li> This is of course personal taste, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell, this is not your usual lavender scent</li>
            <li> Aha! Beware! This is not as big as it looks in the picture. Soap itself is OK. You&#x27;ll be disappointed by the size.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, too bad it&#x27;s too darn expensive.</li>
            <li> lasts forever, smells great, I keep a pump bottle on my kitchen sink and it gets out all the onion/garlic smells.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been buying this handsoap, surface cleaner and dish soap in Lavender for so long! I can&#x27;t imagine not having this scent around the house. It does the job well in cleaning and has such an original and effervescent scent. It&#x27;s highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a great value! Averages out to about $3.97 a bottle opposed to $4.98 when buying individual bottles. And smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but a little thick. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell. Makes me want to wash my hands more than necessary.. :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff!  It&#x27;s nice to have a hand soap with more natural ingredients that actually works and smells good.</li>
            <li> Smaller containers than I thought. But that&#x27;s my own fault. I love the soap.</li>
            <li> Love this lavender soap! The large bottle is a great way to keep a dispenser full at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> This DOESN&#x27;T SMELL LIKE LAVENDER. Unless there is a version of lavender that smells exactly like Febreeze, this is bait and switch. They say &#x27;green&#x27; and &#x27;earth friendly&#x27; but why &#x27;fragrance&#x27;? THIS SMELLS LIKE SH*T!!!! DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE THE SMELL OF YOUR HANDS COVERED IN FECES.</li>
            <li> Great product-  smells wonderful!  The package showed up on time - very happy - will order from this seller again</li>
            <li> I love all things lavender so I was sure that I would like this hand soap. Also I have sinus problems so I don&#x27;t really get the full effect of scents -  I&#x27;m not finicky about perfumes - I like most scents. I&#x27;ve never had such a strong reaction to a product&#x27;s scent.  However, with the first use I absolutely hated the scent. This does not smell like lavender. I tried it several times thinking it couldn&#x27;t possibly be that bad but eventually I had to throw it out. I couldn&#x27;t give it away because no one liked the scent.  Unfortunately, the scent is really strong and long lasting as I can still smell the scent long after I&#x27;ve washed my hands.  If you like the scent of this soap then the fact that it&#x27;s strong and long lasting makes it a great value for the price.  But if, like me, you hate the scent, the soap is a really bad buy and not worth the effort of returning it.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments on the scent of this hand soap.  Received promptly.  It&#x27;s easy to use to refill soap dispensers.  I appreciate the environmentally-friendly packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Nice smell and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Totally met my expectations, love it!</li>
            <li> Bottle is too small to make sense for refills. It will only fill two bottles of soap which defeats the purpose of buying a refill package.</li>
            <li> I think it smells fine. .like lavender. I don&#x27;t know why everyone hates it. I love that it&#x27;s safe to use on my family</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  It does dry the skin somewhat  however.</li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find a soap that really cleans and is simply soap (no anti-bacterial additives). Thankfully this can be sourced through Amazon.com and hope this will continue to be the case. My hands get really dirty due to working with horses and I can get them clean without drying out my skin. The lavender is a nice fragrance (so is basil) and you will enjoy this soap too.</li>
            <li> It has such a fresh smell to it. It has no chemicals in it like a lot of had soaps do.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not sweet but spicy in a way, and love Mrs. Meyers&#x27; products for gentleness and commitment to the planet.</li>
            <li> This is great soap, smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Lavender is my favorite scent. I like having the big refill jars so I can refill smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> Smells nice really cleans your hands and worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was ok, just didn&#x27;t smell as much like lavender as I had expected. I&#x27;ll still use it to put in our soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described and on time. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The scent of this stuff is amazing! We get so many compliments on it. It seems to be a great quality soap, and I love that they started sending it in a pouch rather than the environmentally un-friendly tub. Mrs. Meyers is a great company!</li>
            <li> just the right amount of aroma. i like this soap. and thanks for making a refill so I don&#x27;t have to keep wasting bottles</li>
            <li> We have been buying this locally for a long time. Glad we could finally find a refill size.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this product.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice hand soap.  I was pleasantly surprised with the scent.  It isn&#x27;t the flowery scent, but it is very clean smelling and fresh.</li>
            <li> Awful smell unless you enjoy washing your hands with perfume!</li>
            <li> Mix this with water in your foam dispensers and you have foam soap refill. Not too much fragrance like most other soaps.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and gentle on hands.  We use so much of this that the 33 Oz refill saves us .</li>
            <li> product as described. timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and probably gets my hands pretty clean</li>
            <li> This refill currently lives under my bathroom sink. I&#x27;ve used it to refill bathroom sink bottles and the filling process worked great.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It leaves a wonderful fragrance on my skin. I love to mixing together with my peppermint Castile soap. It is both fragrant and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like the Meyers products. And I love the cost efficiency of the refills. Sometimes it&#x27;s just difficult to pour without getting soap dripping off.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I normally cannot handle scented things. This soap is scented but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Mrs. Boldt here.  :-)  This is by far my favorite hand soap.  I absolutely love the scent.  I&#x27;ve had so many guests come out of the bathroom raving about my soap and wondering where they can get some!  It is often difficult to find in the nearby stores, so Amazon is the best way buy it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural to refill my soap dispensers. I have seen this brand in the stores and always wanted to try it. The smell of lavender is great and it seems to rinse off well. This is a good size jug of it, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> This soap is among the best I have tried - although the Basil scent is probably my favorite scent in this line.  However, this has a pleasant lavender fragrance, albeit it&#x27;s not as strong in the refill as it seems to be in the actual hand pump bottle. But it works and gets the onion smell off of my hands in the kitchen - which is important for a chef!!</li>
            <li> Bought this in order to refill the smaller bottle when needed.  I tried out the regular sized bottle and decided I liked the clean fresh scent and I bought this in order to refill the bottle when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Meyer&#x27;s hand soap for years now. It has a light fragrance,cleans very dirty hand without using very much and lasts a long time.I haven&#x27;t found anything else I like better for the price and quality</li>
            <li> I am not usually a lover of lavender scents, but this soap is my absolute favorite! It&#x27;s a sweeter and less floral scent than other lavenders I&#x27;ve smelled before. Perfect for bathrooms. The refill is a great deal vs. buying the individual hand soaps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a refill, what can I say? It works to refil the smaller pump bottles and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this soap as it smelled wonderful at the store. I bought a bunch, actually, because I had coupons. I&#x27;ve never had issues with soap before, but this soap was terrible on my hands. I do suffer from mild eczema and the heavy perfume in this soap resulted in flare-ups. It also dried out my hands. Since I had so much of it, I alternated it with a lighter/softer soap. The difference between using Meyer&#x27;s and my milk &amp; honey soap (the light one) was HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good for those with sensitive skin of any kind. Frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this even for those with normal skin since heavy perfumed anything can age your skin quicker and dry it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a fan.</li>
            <li> Great hand soap, smells very natural. Does a good job washing hands and love that it&#x27;s not made from synthetic material.</li>
            <li> Quality product that is a great way to keep our hands and skin clean. It is also soft on the hands and has an easy refill spout.</li>
            <li> This hand soap has a lovely scent that leaves hands clean and soft.  I have been using Thymes lavender hand soap, but this is just as good a product and the price is easier to handle.  Meyers products are wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, I love that&#x27;s natural, and it has such a wonderful scent. Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Easy to refill the hand soap dispensers and I save money!  Can&#x27;t beat that!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Has lasted me over a year, smells great, leaves my hands feeling clean and manly.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for the size. Smells good but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than you think and it doesn&#x27;t make much suds when you are washing your hands. So it usually takes 2 pumps to get the bubbles really going for a good wash. The scent this leaves on your hands is VERY strong so if you got a sensitive nose, beware!</li>
            <li> Good product, quick service</li>
            <li> Not only does this soap smell AMAZING it&#x27;s free of toxic substances!</li>
            <li> We use this liquid soap with one of those automatic soap dispensers. This soap is not too thick and not too watery, it smells good and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Smells great. My disappointed is more in the price. I didn&#x27;t realize it, but it&#x27;s $3 cheaper from Fresh Direct.</li>
            <li> This is a less expensive way to use a very handy sink-side p roduct.  I do recommend using the refill.</li>
            <li> Very wholesome hand soap, that leaves your hands clean but not feeling like they have been exposed to industrial chemicals. Very pleasant, but not overwhelming scent!</li>
            <li> I wash my hands frequently and wanted something that did not irritate my hands. This works great and has a pleasant scent also. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good, I love the lavendar scent. I use this in my foam soap dispenser to save money and it is great!</li>
            <li> Too strong after smell.&lt;br /&gt;And although they claim it natural, it is actually not as ingredient listed many chemicals which you do not want to put on your hands.Considering the price, that is not low, I am giving unfortunately only 2 stars. I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought buying this with lavender scent and knowing it was a fairly &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; product would be safe to do. Boy, was I burned. I can&#x27;t return the product but I don&#x27;t want to even pour it down my drain because it stinks up the whole bathroom for hours just with one use washing your hands! I tried it a couple different times and ended up rewashing  my hands with a different soap about five times to try to get rid of the odor! Worst smelling &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34; product I have ever tried. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one people!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this, which is why I bought it.  Some may not.</li>
            <li> Great price and delivery.</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying the bottles over and over. This is fantastic! Lasts us (two adults) about two months (two bottles, one in bathroom and one in kitchen). The light scent of lavender on clean hands is great.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and all natural ingredients. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
            <li> Small for the price, but like the product itself</li>
            <li> I would agree with everyone else on the weird lavender scent. I wouldn&#x27;t call it bad, it&#x27;s just not lavender. It reminds me more of fruit punch. So if you&#x27;re looking for lavender this is not the soap for you.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly. I used it to fill up a smaller Meyers hand soap dispenser in our bathroom and there is enough left for about 2 more refills, I wager. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I purchased the Lavender scent and it&#x27;s great - fresh herbs but not overpowering. It&#x27;s also important to me that it was not &amp;#34;antibacterial&amp;#34; soap and that it does not contain triclosan, phthalates, or other harmful compounds.</li>
            <li> SUDS WELL AND SMELLS GOOD IS THE BEST DESCRIPTION OF THIS PRODUCT.  THE PRICE IS GOOD AND THE PRODUCT WORKS IN THE DISPENSERS I REFILL.  IT IS COMPARABLE TO PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE.  IT HAS A GEL CONSISTENCY AND POURS SLOWLY INTO SMALL MOUTH BOTTLES BUT WILL FILL SUCH CONTAINERS.  I&#x27;LL USE IT AND AFTER USE WILL DECIDE IF ANOTHER WILL BE PURCHASED. SO FAR I RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It has a nice, strong, lavender scent and leaves your hands feeling very clean.  I always feel like I am doing something nice for myself and my family when I have it in my home.</li>
            <li> What else can I say...love all of their products.  I have purchased them for my home and my business, and clients always comment when they come out of the bathroom about this soap.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job washing my hands!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Smells lovelly!</li>
            <li> We love this brand. It&#x27;s got a great scent, and with three kids in the house, the refill goes a long way. We will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Lovely fragrance. Economical refill size. I have bought the lavender hand soap in this size many times.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this hand soap. The lavender has a fresh, natural scent. It keeps my hands moist and soft without leaving a soapy film on my skin. Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Delivered promptly, thanks.</li>
            <li> I have never written an Amazon review before and this is the second I&#x27;ve written this week from a single shipment. Weird. I must have  ordered all the bad stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, two very important things about this soap.&lt;br /&gt;1. smells horrid. Not like Lavender. It smells artificial and is WAY to strong.&lt;br /&gt;2. the odor stays with you. It lingers on your hands for ages. I had to wash my hands with another soap before I finished my apple because the smell on my fingers was disrupting the the taste, and hence my enjoyment of my food. YUCK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually one more thing. This cleaning brand emerged around the same time as Method and Seventh Generation so people assume it is all natural. It is not. I went online to read up on why the odor was so off and read that they use synthetic fragrance. This is why the odor sticks around. I&#x27;m not endorsing the other two brands, just putting what I learned out there.</li>
            <li> Order with caution. If you can smell this at a retail site first, I recommend sampling it. Love the smell of lavender, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure what scent this soap is. There is a weird (is it chemical? A little sour? Two noes competing with each other?) scent that this soap has that is pretty hard to bear and lingers on your skin after use. If you find that you do like the scent, be aware that the cost, compared to the size if the jug you receive, is high.</li>
            <li> This hand soap has the most delicious fragrance. I walk around smelling my hands afterwards - it&#x27;s more than just lavender. Also, my hands are not dried out after using it.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Makes the whole bathroom better.</li>
            <li> Oh, my goodness, this smells so good! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it dries my hands out a lot.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap, smells lovely.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems SO good. I highly recommend this. I just put it in an old softsoap pump and it has lasted such a long time. I&#x27;ve had this product for months and I still have some left. It&#x27;s a great value when you do this.</li>
            <li> I hate the fragrance of this item It makes gag. It leaves your hands clean. I am only Rating 3 stars because of the fragrance and because it&#x27;s too expensive for the amount of Product I am getting. I will not buy it again</li>
            <li> Too small and expensive for the amount you&#x27;re getting. Smells more like odor... I don&#x27;t care how natural it is they could&#x27;ve done a better job at scenting it. Twice as expensive as &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; stuff you get at Walgreens and half the size... so it&#x27;s about 4 times pricier than everything else. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> We love the Meyers  products, but not paying $$ every time we run out. This product saves the hassle of going to the store to get a new bottle, we save $$ and the environment. The spout is resealable, and just the right size to pour into the soap bottle - no spilling or messes.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a soft soap and also for washing delicate clothing by hand.  I love the smell!!</li>
            <li> smell is too bad for me</li>
            <li> Smells great! Great price, arrived on time, perfect!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! 👍</li>
            <li> Smells great but the container is smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hand soap. Works just the same as any other hand soap that is 1/2 the price. Don&#x27;t understand the hype about this... it is available at HEB and Target.</li>
            <li> Nice product with a pleasant smell. I have been interested in purchasing this line of product. Glad I got it in my kitchen &amp;  bath.</li>
            <li> I miss the old packaging for the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s refills (a collapsible bag), but still find this to be a good deal.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and consistency of this soap. The refill container is easy to use. The product arrived on time, as promised.</li>
            <li> Smells good, I love Meyers products. Good buy</li>
            <li> The product is great. What wasn&#x27;t great was that the safety seal was broken when it arrived so it leaked all over in the box. It was a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s cheaper soaps out there, but this soap is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve come across. It has essential oils and leaves the skin smelling natural and nice. I use it in the kitchen, and when I eat I don&#x27;t taste detergent or perfume on my hands. It doesn&#x27;t leave residue or dry the skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make it more economical, I dilute it and put it in one of the foaming dispensers.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like lavender, but it smells okay.  It is too thick for automatic soap dispensers, so it has to be used in manual dispensers.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  The scent is lovely.  I plan to buy it again!</li>
