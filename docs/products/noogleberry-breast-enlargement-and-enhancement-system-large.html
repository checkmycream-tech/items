    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best results I saw on the forum were by girls who used it every day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found the best results doing that.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This product is great, I use it once or twice a day and my breasts are developing and I have been using it close to 4 wks now</li>
            <li>I have read some of the reviews and some people had great results.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I got this thing.</li>
            <li>I have tried others, this is the best Plastic cups could be more durable though, as they seem to pop under pressure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s also good to realize that it&#x27;s not just about cup size.</li>
            <li>I tried every kind of lube - olive oil, cocoa butter cream and lotion, no lube, foam rings, no rings and no matter what I did, I couldn&#x27;t get the cups to stay on</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li>The one time I was able to get the cups to stay on</li>
            <li>love it.i believe i see a difference allready</li>
            <li>&amp; I noticed it is better to increase pressure gradually</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>am taking supplements too, but think this system has more to do with the progress.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the better shape and fullness etc.</li>
            <li>For this price and a bit of time investment I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Returned the item so can&#x27;t really know weather good or not.</li>
            <li>It Was excellent and satisfying and worth the investment,  Unlike the electric device that turned up to be a failure.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d use it consistently and could see what results I would have!</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t seem like much but to me the difference is huge.</li>
            <li>so far seems to work better than a lot of the others out there.</li>
            <li>At first I had some bruising</li>
            <li>so first i need to urge you to do research on proper fitting bras</li>
            <li>I started out as A, am now B and feel I&#x27;m starting to surpass that now that I&#x27;m using it more again.</li>
            <li>I know others have had good results using this, but I couldn&#x27;t even get past step one.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Noogleberry with the large cups for a month now</li>
            <li>I never used this product, but whenever I try to buy it there is never a size large cup.</li>
            <li>I got the Noogleberry Breast Enlargement and Enhancement System- LARGE and the Breast Enhancement Cream to use together.  </li>
            <li>Will there ever be a seller on Amazon that will provide for those of us who need it, large and bigger cup sizes for comfortable breast pump</li>
            <li>I was using the rings and had so much pain</li>
            <li>and i feel it really works</li>
            <li>, if you google HER ROOM you will find a site with really helpful info, ( i suck at that</li>
            <li>A tip I have is to keep it pumped as much as you can stand the whole hour, like keep the pump attached and keep re-pumping.</li>
            <li>For me the big thing has been actually having growth on the top where it used to be 100%</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s mainly where I put the cups).</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it.ts</li>
            <li>and i went from a 32aa to a 32b ish a little room up top in the bra but a 32b,</li>
            <li>Not wanting to be a quitter, I even tried the Extra large system thinking it would be better with my starting size of a C cup, but again, same problem, couldn&#x27;t get the cups to stay on.  </li>
            <li>Brava is expensive, but its a far better product, the cups are comfortable and they leave no marks.  </li>
            <li>Even if the increase isn&#x27;t huge like getting implants or something, it&#x27;s such a confidence booster to not be flat as board anymore!</li>
            <li>This product requires dedication and patients...if you can spend about a half hour to an hour every day , and don&#x27;t try to pump too much at one time , too quick...</li>
            <li>Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>so I ordered the soft cup holders which helped.</li>
            <li>After  initial problem with putting on, I tried one after the other, it is working fine.</li>
            <li>Only small and medium, so it does not cater to women with large breast who want larger like the original website does.</li>

            <li> I purchased Noogleberry contoured large system and was never able to use it because I couldn&#x27;t get the cups to stay on my chest.  </li>
            <li> Especially considering I&#x27;ve used it for a week or two here and there basically, not a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I only kept them on for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> the method of &amp;#34;manual suction&amp;#34; is just too old.. too expensive for such un-updated product..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get both cups to adhere but with tenacity, they finally always attach,</li>
            <li> I got that tip from a girl on the forum who went from A to D in less than 2 years</li>
            <li> plan to continue, it gets really painful sometimes but is well worth</li>
            <li> , i have stopped taking all supplements, now trying to eat eat eat and gain a few lbs i am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and struggle to hit and stay at 100lbs.</li>
            <li> , i imagine that will come in a few monthe as i continue to pump and eat.</li>
            <li> anyways in the past few years i have put 3 inches onto my bust</li>
            <li> It took at least a week for those marks to fully go away.  </li>
            <li> When I took them off, I had these nasty red ring marks that looked like my skin got burned or scraped.  </li>
            <li> Sadly both the products did not work.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I purchased Noogleberry contoured large system and was never able to use it because I couldn&#x27;t get the cups to stay on my chest.  I tried every kind of lube - olive oil, cocoa butter cream and lotion, no lube, foam rings, no rings and no matter what I did, I couldn&#x27;t get the cups to stay on so I could pump them up.  The one time I was able to get the cups to stay on I was using the rings and had so much pain I only kept them on for a few minutes.  When I took them off, I had these nasty red ring marks that looked like my skin got burned or scraped.  It took at least a week for those marks to fully go away.  Not wanting to be a quitter, I even tried the Extra large system thinking it would be better with my starting size of a C cup, but again, same problem, couldn&#x27;t get the cups to stay on.  Brava is expensive, but its a far better product, the cups are comfortable and they leave no marks.  I know others have had good results using this, but I couldn&#x27;t even get past step one.</li>
            <li> Returned the item so can&#x27;t really know weather good or not.</li>
            <li> love it.i believe i see a difference allready and i will continue to use this product. i am a 38\\&quot; and want to get to a 42\\&quot; so it will be perfect.it is sturdy as well.i sit and work on my computer at night while i leave it on and i feel it really works</li>
            <li> I rated this product with 3 stars because ive only had it for not even a month yet. I have had a lot of swelling but no noticable growth yet. Will update at a later time.</li>
            <li> I have tried others, this is the best Plastic cups could be more durable though, as they seem to pop under pressure.</li>
            <li> It Was excellent and satisfying and worth the investment,  Unlike the electric device that turned up to be a failure.</li>
            <li> This product requires dedication and patients...if you can spend about a half hour to an hour every day , and don&#x27;t try to pump too much at one time , too quick...then it will show you that you can go from an A cup to a D cup...it just takes time...I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> only been using it for a couple of days and I&#x27;m loving it just wish I would had found this sooner already feeling my breast growing.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Noogleberry with the large cups for a month now and I am happy with the results. At first I had some bruising so I ordered the soft cup holders which helped. I also separated the devise to use on 1 breast at a time. I like that I can adjust the pressure to my liking &amp; I noticed it is better to increase pressure gradually every 5-10 minutes in order to manage to fill the cups. It works, with time, patience and herbal supplements.</li>
            <li> After  initial problem with putting on, I tried one after the other, it is working fine. it is doing its job enen though Iam using only once in 2 days.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I use it once or twice a day and my breasts are developing and I have been using it close to 4 wks now, I highly recommend it.ts this is for you.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! The only thing I worry about is that my breasts are bigger but I&#x27;ve not pumped every day. Like 2-3 times a week for 3 weeks for 45 minutes. If I stop pumping, will they return to normal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get both cups to adhere but with tenacity, they finally always attach,</li>
            <li> I never used this product, but whenever I try to buy it there is never a size large cup. Which is why I gave 3 stars. Only small and medium, so it does not cater to women with large breast who want larger like the original website does. Will there ever be a seller on Amazon that will provide for those of us who need it, large and bigger cup sizes for comfortable breast pump use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I got the Noogleberry Breast Enlargement and Enhancement System- LARGE and the Breast Enhancement Cream to use together.  I use the cream morning and night.  And use the pump for about 30-60 at night.  I did this continuously for 2-3 weeks.  I am in between cup size and want to size up.  Sadly both the products did not work.  I have read some of the reviews and some people had great results.  Just not me.  Makes me wonder if those were paid to write the reviews.....</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap. I used it four times, and during the fourth use the pump broke and a piece went flying across the room. No results, only sore breasts. Huge waste of money. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will work... it just leave red spots around my breast for days which is kinda embarrassing.. and i don&#x27;t see any differences.. the method of &amp;#34;manual suction&amp;#34; is just too old.. too expensive for such un-updated product..</li>
            <li> its working.. 3 months or so and i went from a 32aa to a 32b ish a little room up top in the bra but a 32b, am taking supplements too, but think this system has more to do with the progress. plan to continue, it gets really painful sometimes but is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just to update, i have stopped taking all supplements, now trying to eat eat eat and gain a few lbs i am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and struggle to hit and stay at 100lbs. I am now overflowing my 32b cup!! yay not quite filling the c cup i have, i imagine that will come in a few monthe as i continue to pump and eat. keep pumping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here we are 3 years later. so first i need to urge you to do research on proper fitting bras, if you google HER ROOM you will find a site with really helpful info, ( i suck at that so props to my hubby he is a genius) anyways in the past few years i have put 3 inches onto my bust my current bra size is a 28dd, depending on the time of the month sometimes i will have quad boob. also i put on 10 pounds so holding at 110lbs,</li>
            <li> Love it and I need the bigger cups already!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I got this thing. I&#x27;ve gone up around a cup size with on and off use the last couple of years. That doesn&#x27;t seem like much but to me the difference is huge. Especially considering I&#x27;ve used it for a week or two here and there basically, not a whole lot. I wish I&#x27;d use it consistently and could see what results I would have! The best results I saw on the forum were by girls who used it every day. A tip I have is to keep it pumped as much as you can stand the whole hour, like keep the pump attached and keep re-pumping. Not till you&#x27;re purple or anything, but close. I got that tip from a girl on the forum who went from A to D in less than 2 years and I&#x27;ve found the best results doing that. And I&#x27;ve never had any bruising or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s also good to realize that it&#x27;s not just about cup size. It&#x27;s the better shape and fullness etc. For me the big thing has been actually having growth on the top where it used to be 100% nothing/flat (that&#x27;s mainly where I put the cups). So now I overflow bras that I used to look like a board in. Even if the increase isn&#x27;t huge like getting implants or something, it&#x27;s such a confidence booster to not be flat as board anymore! I started out as A, am now B and feel I&#x27;m starting to surpass that now that I&#x27;m using it more again. For this price and a bit of time investment I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Durable, and well packed. so far seems to work better than a lot of the others out there. i recommend this one</li>
    </ol>
