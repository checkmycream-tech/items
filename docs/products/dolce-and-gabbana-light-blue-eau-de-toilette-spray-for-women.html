            <li>I was told that there had be many complaints about this product and would refund my money....</li>
            <li>At the office and in passing I get stopped in the hall, mostly by men</li>
            <li>I always say that if you love pr like it then perhaps you should purchase it for the favorite woman in your life.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I have other favorites but this is one rated as one of my best in the top two.  </li>
            <li>It is the best money i ever spent for a woman.</li>
            <li>This is a light and lovely scent which I&#x27;ve been using for a 2-3 years now.  </li>
            <li>If you like a light fragrance and appreciate the rejuvenation of ciitrus in your life, you will love this.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance: it is light, a bit citrusy and a bit sweet.  </li>
            <li>What a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who likes a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>but when she got it, that made it worth more</li>
            <li>The fragance is light and airy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her fav, cheap but not the real thing!!!</li>
            <li>I love- love - love light blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbanna</li>
            <li>If you purchase this, You will definitely not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>This product was leaking and was not an original.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s family receive my sincere thanks for this &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; which I shall certainly enjoy.  </li>
            <li>First it does smell good, but It is not as potent as the last bottle I purchased from somewhere else.  </li>
            <li>For my recent birthday, I received an Amazon gift card which I immediately used to purchase my favorite!  </li>
            <li>that is great considering it&#x27;s a Eau De Toilette and is not available in Parfume.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and it last longer then some of the others i have smell.</li>
            <li>The price was just right.</li>
            <li>I am very upset.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue for 6 years.  </li>
            <li>I use it only in the spring and summer because of it&#x27;s light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>There is not a heavy feel to the fragrance, nor does it overwhelm even in closed warm spaces.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute hands down favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>so I want a new bottle</li>
            <li>, get this for the woman in your life and wait and see how much you get back.</li>
            <li>It smelt old and too citrusy- so upset.</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus scent mixed with a modern day preppy smell (sounds crazy, I know).</li>

            <li> , get this for the woman in your life and wait and see how much you get back.</li>
            <li> It smelt old and too citrusy- so upset.</li>
            <li> It has a light citrus scent mixed with a modern day preppy smell (sounds crazy, I know).</li>
            <li> Sadly had to go back to the perfume store to pay full price for a new bottle.</li>
            <li> It was a little high to me</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> product is an extremely watered down version of the real thing.  </li>
            <li> The remaining perfume smells strong and stale; I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong, a little too faint.</li>
            <li> Be careful which company</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it daily but usually every other day.  </li>
            <li> I just know this bottle of cologne last no more than 2 to 3 hours</li>
            <li> ;  I am wondering if it has been watered down, but I do not know.  </li>
            <li> but when I got this product it was completely the wrong scent.</li>
            <li> I spray it on and before a few hours is up, &amp;#34;you can no longer smell</li>
            <li> I usually like to wear it during the summer, but i couldn&#x27;t wait to get it now.  </li>
            <li> and they usually ask me about the fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li> I have used this before and this bottle for the cost of $57 is surely not living up to that price.</li>
            <li> what about just not sending me the crap to begin with if you knew there&#x27;s problem with it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed; my daughter was heart-broken Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this seller.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> and I have been told horrible things about.</li>
            <li> Came from the Perfume Company and it smelled horrible.  </li>

            <li> I love this perfume.  I usually like to wear it during the summer, but i couldn&#x27;t wait to get it now.  The price was just right.</li>
            <li> I should have taken heed to the reviews already posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is an extremely watered down version of the real thing.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> What a fabulous product. Of all my fragrances, this one is my all-time favorite. It has a light citrus scent mixed with a modern day preppy smell (sounds crazy, I know). If you purchase this, You will definitely not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue for 6 years.  I use it only in the spring and summer because of it&#x27;s light fragrance.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Best fragrance ever!!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells very good. The scent is not too strong, a little too faint. I would have preferred it more if it was a stronger scent.</li>
            <li> The perfume literally smelled like garbage. When I wrote to say I wanted to return it I was told that there had be many complaints about this product and would refund my money....what about just not sending me the crap to begin with if you knew there&#x27;s problem with it. Very disappointed; my daughter was heart-broken Christmas morning. I won&#x27;t be ordering this type of product on line again.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend told me she like this perfume and wanted some for X-mas. It is the best money i ever spent for a woman. It has a nice smell and it last longer then some of the others i have smell. It was a little high to me but when she got it, that made it worth more then i paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;Guys, get this for the woman in your life and wait and see how much you get back.</li>
            <li> product came on time,good packaging,product came as advertised.amazing price as well as service.i will deffently be ordering from this company again in the future happy happy customer !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was leaking and was not an original. It was a knock off did not have the same smell aand packaging was differnt</li>
            <li> A third of the perfume had leaked out before I opened it.  The box was soaked.  The remaining perfume smells strong and stale; I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a gift and I have been told horrible things about. The perfume smells like nothing as if it was water. Very disappointed with this seller.</li>
            <li> Everything was nice love the smell  only thing is when I got my bottle it was leaking so I want a new bottle</li>
            <li> This is a light and lovely scent which I&#x27;ve been using for a 2-3 years now.  I don&#x27;t wear it daily but usually every other day.  I have other favorites but this is one rated as one of my best in the top two.  At the office and in passing I get stopped in the hall, mostly by men and they usually ask me about the fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.  I always say that if you love pr like it then perhaps you should purchase it for the favorite woman in your life. I also like that you don&#x27;t have to use an abundance of this fragrance and that is great considering it&#x27;s a Eau De Toilette and is not available in Parfume.  I&#x27;ve noticed that people have commented that they know I&#x27;ve travelled through the hall because there is my signature fragrance lingering about the hall or staircase. Try it and I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. She wanted it for Christmas and amazon had the best price... Prime membership is the best</li>
            <li> Great product and the girl loved it smells amazing and ships fast definitly a good product and supply company, would recommend to a friend</li>

            <li> Came from the Perfume Company and it smelled horrible.  They said it was tainted.  Be careful which company you buy this from.</li>
            <li> First it does smell good, but It is not as potent as the last bottle I purchased from somewhere else.  I spray it on and before a few hours is up, &amp;#34;you can no longer smell it.&amp;#34;  I am wondering if it has been watered down, but I do not know.

            <li> This is my favorite fragrance: it is light, a bit citrusy and a bit sweet.  I have used this for about 3 years but have been without since last Christmas.  For my recent birthday, I received an Amazon gift card which I immediately used to purchase my favorite!  My son&#x27;s family receive my sincere thanks for this &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; which I shall certainly enjoy.  If you like a light fragrance and appreciate the rejuvenation of ciitrus in your life, you will love this.  There is not a heavy feel to the fragrance, nor does it overwhelm even in closed warm spaces.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute hands down favorite perfume.  The fragance is light and airy.  I receive compliments everytime i wear it.</li>
            <li> lindo&lt;br /&gt;hermoso&lt;br /&gt;el aroma es perfecto&lt;br /&gt;gracias por el producto y la rápida entrega y el buen precio bien .</li>
