    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I saw a magazine article ranking readers&#x27; picks for best lip plumpers.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, you will find the perfect plumper.</li>
            <li>I think it is a very good product!!</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>, Works great</li>
            <li>For example, it feels great to me, but my mom can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>Great product , lasts me about 3 months.</li>
            <li>I would describe the effect as your lips after a good make-out session, the bee stung look.</li>
            <li>I get really good results with this lip plumper.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This lip plumping serum is seriously effective in creating beautiful lips but it is also more tingly than DuWop&#x27;s Venom Gloss.</li>
            <li>I love this product !</li>
            <li>Make sure you pay close attention to the instructions!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>If you want a nice lip gloss, this is it, albeit a bit pricey for just a gloss.  </li>
            <li>Use in am and pm as directed and you will be more than happy :)</li>
            <li>This product makes a nice lip gloss, but I did not see any of the benefits it claims to perform.</li>
            <li>The sensation was intense but the results are beautiful and voluptuous!</li>
            <li>I have bought almost everything out there and for my own vain reason..</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it at a cheaper price than Amazon, and it was worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen Lip Inflation which seems to have better results, even though it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as nice as this one.</li>
            <li>Smells great, pretty coloring.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I imagine it will sting more for some people than others.  </li>
            <li>But now my lips look more like they did twenty years ago even before I apply it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It worked OK.</li>
            <li>Works well , I love it</li>
            <li>I say the stronger the sting the better :)</li>
            <li>, I love It tho,</li>
            <li>I was hoping for outstanding results from this product given the price.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick with the cheaper brand for better results.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again :)</li>
            <li>Most lip enhancers do not work at all, this one DOES work.</li>
            <li>99 cent chap stick is better.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>I have bought a 5$ lip plumper from Wal-Mart that works better than this.</li>
            <li>love that feeling) as soon as the burning stopped the plumping stopped as well</li>
            <li>This product produces a tingly feeling as most of these types of products do.  </li>
            <li>Love this gloss.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lip gloss/injection.  </li>
            <li>Judging by the reviews, I thought this was going to be much better than it is.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this and will buy more when gone.</li>
            <li>Since I already have medium plump lips , I just wanted it to be a bit more fuller.</li>
            <li>lol , but after each use , I don&#x27;t feel anything anymore but still gets my lips very plump :)</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get it, and although I think its okay, I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li>I am 22 and was just looking to get rid of lines around/on my lips and have a nice full lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I honestly have no need to use this as a lip plumper, I have lips that are quite full already.</li>
            <li>It feels good when you first use</li>
            <li>I have been using it for five years and it has returned a more youthful plumpness to my lips and reduced the appearance of fine lines around the edges.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful to use for a special occasion..not a daily use!..</li>
            <li>Makes lips a rosy pink, plump and adds shine, great buy!</li>
            <li>While I will say this product did plump my lips, it was minimal at best.</li>
            <li>The formulation is based on \\&quot;four of the most scientifically proven and advanced lip plumping technologies.\\</li>
            <li>So happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone / everyone unless you are already gifted with full lips.</li>
            <li>A bit of pure cinnamon oil for $3 works better and tastes better too.  </li>
            <li>Faced product became available</li>
            <li>So, its a cheap way to plump up.</li>
            <li>For me the important factor was the staying power it added to my lipstick, something it does not seem to mention at all.</li>
            <li>I used this product from a free sample -- what a disaster.  </li>
            <li>so far this is the one I have liked the most.</li>
            <li>It really plumps your lips a bit and gives the a nice clean glossy finished look.</li>
            <li>Its worth it though!</li>
            <li>and my lips returned to.its original size.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see alot of positive reviews with \\&quot;Too</li>
            <li>Unlike the young woman who posted pictures (I think those photos did more for this product than all of the company&#x27;s advertising!)</li>
            <li>I have recently replaced my tube &amp; it is good as ever.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m 24 with full lips</li>
            <li>It does burn for about 10 minutes, but it is not painful</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>To read it you would think your lips blossom into full, juicy parts that stay that way for days.</li>
            <li>This does only a fair job of lip plumping and it burns for a bit.  </li>
            <li>(cuz I already have full lips) and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too experienced with other lip plumper</li>
            <li>At first, it is just a smooth gel/serum you apply within the lip line.</li>
            <li>A+A+ Very Fast Delivery too!</li>
            <li>It took more than three hours for my skin to return to normal.</li>
            <li>came right on time and smells cool</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any need for a plumper per say, but the coloring was fantastic, so I decided to go ahead and get the full size as a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So if you also experienced reddness try using less product.</li>
            <li>&quot; I just had to laugh</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy over it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice burn and my lips are bigger .  </li>
            <li>Only good thing is it left my lips SUPER smooth.</li>
            <li>right after I got it.</li>
            <li>im sure theres a lot of less &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; products out there that work better.  </li>
            <li>I like bare Minerals Buxom lip glosses better.</li>
            <li>After reading countless reviews and watching review videos on YouTube it seemed quite controversial.  </li>
            <li>but since I wasn&#x27;t looking for color it was my first choice.  </li>
            <li>And it does exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My lips showed some smoothing and filling at first use.</li>
            <li>The first method is they put really hot ingredients in their product to bring blood flow to your lips to cause them to plump.</li>
            <li>Stung uses the hot, stimulating ingredients to plump.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more when I run low!</li>
            <li>for the price, it did nothing but make my lips peel, I tried putting cream on first then</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last too terribly long, but great for photos.</li>
            <li>That in itself tends to make my lipstick last longer than most.</li>
            <li>It will get them to be noticeably fuller, however my first time using this</li>
            <li>Cannot use on consistent basis.</li>
            <li>I first saw this plumping serum on farrahdhukai&#x27;s youtube channel , and since she gave positive review on it , I decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li>Expected more even just a little; however, just good as a lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>you prefer something a little milder, you may want to try out the DuWop Venom Gloss or even use both at the same time because the DuWop has a nice glossy effect and this is more of a serum that absorbs into your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I do not have naturallly large lips.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>I am a beauty/makeup junkie and am very picky.  </li>
            <li>really anti productive.  </li>
            <li>My husband wanted to know how my lips changed so noticeably so fast.</li>
            <li>product didn&#x27;t plump, very drying....</li>
            <li>It is also very drying to your lips</li>
            <li>Too much cost for the plumping effect.</li>
            <li>Very disapponited with the product, my lips didn&#x27;t plump up just tingled for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>It inflamed the whole area around my mouth</li>
            <li>If you want full lips, go for the real injections, that&#x27;s the only thing that really works.</li>
            <li>I have used other products that work much better.  </li>
            <li>If your lips turn pink or red or you feel more than a mild tingling, you&#x27;re probably allergic to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I got this as a sample from Sephora, and I loved the color it changed my lips with the subtle irritation.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this lipgloss!</li>
            <li>It has a slight tingle, nothing more.  </li>
            <li>found that at times, it made the outside rim of my lips more red then the rest, so I like to use it as a companion to TheBalm stainiac in Beauty</li>
            <li>and it Is highly rated in the make-up world.</li>
            <li>Ever since I was in high school in the 90s</li>
            <li>Worth a try if you have cash to thrown around, but only if you have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful product that will cause your lips to actually change color, making them look like you applied lipstick.</li>
            <li>This product arrived on time and as new.</li>
            <li>Very minor results that fade quickly.  </li>
            <li>Buying my second tube as we speak ;)</li>
            <li>The tingle can last for 3-5 minutes and is not uncomfortable, but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be moisturizing overall, but I do remember some irritation when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>, smooth feel, not super sticky like some glosses can be.</li>
            <li>I was considering real lip injections but figured I would explore other options first.</li>
            <li>The only sad part is, it only last 1/2 hour at best before your lips return to normal size and color.</li>
            <li>This product I like because it gives your lips a natural no fuss clear flush of rosy natural bigness that looks sexy and like your not trying too hard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be clear</li>
            <li>I just wanted something to restore some of that natural volume.  </li>
            <li>Works instantly and very well.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast however as soon as I ripped open the package and put it on I noticed it</li>
            <li>And I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My lips are fairly thin which was always OK for me but the effects of aging are very noticeable.</li>
            <li>formula promises long term results and unlike other products that fade in a matter of hours, you might wake up the next day and still be able to see the effects.</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t go as far to say its not a great product because a lot of people love it</li>
            <li>I expected this to be purely cosmetic</li>
            <li>but now I barely notice it.  </li>
            <li>What really surprised me was the fact the it has a lasting effect.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really use it like a lips gloss which is what I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Surprised this lipgloss only had 3 1/2 stars.  </li>
            <li>Although I dont wear it everyday, it has lasted a super long time and still packs some punch.</li>
            <li>I used it a few times one of the first days I got it</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for the lip injection extreme!</li>

            <li> It took more than three hours for my skin to return to normal.</li>
            <li> came right on time and smells cool</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any need for a plumper per say, but the coloring was fantastic, so I decided to go ahead and get the full size as a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So if you also experienced reddness try using less product.</li>
            <li> &quot; I just had to laugh</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy over it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice burn and my lips are bigger .  </li>
            <li> Only good thing is it left my lips SUPER smooth.</li>
            <li> right after I got it.</li>
            <li> im sure theres a lot of less &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; products out there that work better.  </li>
            <li> I like bare Minerals Buxom lip glosses better.</li>
            <li> After reading countless reviews and watching review videos on YouTube it seemed quite controversial.  </li>
            <li> but since I wasn&#x27;t looking for color it was my first choice.  </li>
            <li> And it does exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> My lips showed some smoothing and filling at first use.</li>
            <li> The first method is they put really hot ingredients in their product to bring blood flow to your lips to cause them to plump.</li>
            <li> Stung uses the hot, stimulating ingredients to plump.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more when I run low!</li>
            <li> for the price, it did nothing but make my lips peel, I tried putting cream on first then</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last too terribly long, but great for photos.</li>
            <li> That in itself tends to make my lipstick last longer than most.</li>
            <li> It will get them to be noticeably fuller, however my first time using this</li>
            <li> Cannot use on consistent basis.</li>
            <li> I first saw this plumping serum on farrahdhukai&#x27;s youtube channel , and since she gave positive review on it , I decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li> Expected more even just a little; however, just good as a lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> you prefer something a little milder, you may want to try out the DuWop Venom Gloss or even use both at the same time because the DuWop has a nice glossy effect and this is more of a serum that absorbs into your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I do not have naturallly large lips.  </li>
            <li> This product works really well.  </li>
            <li> I am a beauty/makeup junkie and am very picky.  </li>
            <li> really anti productive.  </li>
            <li> My husband wanted to know how my lips changed so noticeably so fast.</li>
            <li> product didn&#x27;t plump, very drying....</li>
            <li> It is also very drying to your lips</li>
            <li> Too much cost for the plumping effect.</li>
            <li> Very disapponited with the product, my lips didn&#x27;t plump up just tingled for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> It inflamed the whole area around my mouth</li>
            <li> If you want full lips, go for the real injections, that&#x27;s the only thing that really works.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that work much better.  </li>
            <li> If your lips turn pink or red or you feel more than a mild tingling, you&#x27;re probably allergic to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample from Sephora, and I loved the color it changed my lips with the subtle irritation.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this lipgloss!</li>
            <li> It has a slight tingle, nothing more.  </li>
            <li> found that at times, it made the outside rim of my lips more red then the rest, so I like to use it as a companion to TheBalm stainiac in Beauty</li>
            <li> and it Is highly rated in the make-up world.</li>
            <li> Ever since I was in high school in the 90s</li>
            <li> Worth a try if you have cash to thrown around, but only if you have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful product that will cause your lips to actually change color, making them look like you applied lipstick.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and as new.</li>
            <li> Very minor results that fade quickly.  </li>
            <li> Buying my second tube as we speak ;)</li>
            <li> The tingle can last for 3-5 minutes and is not uncomfortable, but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be moisturizing overall, but I do remember some irritation when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> , smooth feel, not super sticky like some glosses can be.</li>
            <li> I was considering real lip injections but figured I would explore other options first.</li>
            <li> The only sad part is, it only last 1/2 hour at best before your lips return to normal size and color.</li>
            <li> This product I like because it gives your lips a natural no fuss clear flush of rosy natural bigness that looks sexy and like your not trying too hard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be clear</li>
            <li> I just wanted something to restore some of that natural volume.  </li>
            <li> Works instantly and very well.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast however as soon as I ripped open the package and put it on I noticed it</li>
            <li> And I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My lips are fairly thin which was always OK for me but the effects of aging are very noticeable.</li>
            <li> formula promises long term results and unlike other products that fade in a matter of hours, you might wake up the next day and still be able to see the effects.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t go as far to say its not a great product because a lot of people love it</li>
            <li> I expected this to be purely cosmetic</li>
            <li> but now I barely notice it.  </li>
            <li> What really surprised me was the fact the it has a lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really use it like a lips gloss which is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Surprised this lipgloss only had 3 1/2 stars.  </li>
            <li> Although I dont wear it everyday, it has lasted a super long time and still packs some punch.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times one of the first days I got it</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot for the lip injection extreme!</li>
            <li> This gloss really had no plumping effect and only a very slight tingle.</li>
            <li> you get a teaspoonful of substance that last as long as a fart in your hand, presumably so you can rush and order more of this useless stuff</li>
            <li> It just flat out doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s super expensive, but I&#x27;m willing to pay for the results.</li>
            <li> Beyond Color Lipstick Plumping Uptown Pink Double Retinol Spf15]</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get on the skin on the face or you will end up with burn marks that last for about 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this lip plumper probably for the same reason other people do.</li>
            <li> 1 Star due to the sores and red ring around my lips.  </li>
            <li> (eek so long ago!)</li>
            <li> but then after awhile your lips tend to get really dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, because it is a nice lip gloss, but definitely not a lip plumper.</li>
            <li> benefit is putting it on and smooching an unsuspecting victim.</li>
            <li> It plumps for only an hour or less.</li>
            <li> noticed a slight changing in her lips, it was red and plump .I</li>
            <li> I have used it and have noticed a slight plumpness on my lips, I have tried different products</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t erase the effects of time or give you Angelina Jolie lips; but, it definitely gives a little boost.</li>
            <li> a bright red like an awful sunburn.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does burn a bit but only for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> but it turns red after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I am careful to apply a lip balm over it after it absorbs to avoid \\&quot;stinging\\&quot; my husband.  </li>
            <li> Nothing too dramatic and no trout pout, just a reasonable increase in volume.</li>
            <li> So I just recieved my Too Faced Lip Injection Extreme today.</li>
            <li> This Too Faced Cosmetic Lip Injection Extreme made my lips orange and irritated ...</li>
            <li> I noticed that Two Faced extreme has peptides in it.</li>
            <li> I felt tingling, just like the other reviewer pointed out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a bit weird at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not rich, so I am careful about purchases.  </li>
            <li> You will definitely know that this little tube of fireworks is working when you swipe a thin layer over your lips with the tiny brush.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is tiny, I use this almost everyday though and it usually lasts 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I purchased Too Faced Cosmetics Lip Injection Extreme fthrough Amazona few weeks Ago.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingling, which should be no problem to anyone, followed by a noticeable fullness.</li>
            <li> The first time I did this, i forgot I had it on, and after I kissed my husband, he looked at me like I was crazy &amp; said \\&quot;My</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> However, After receiving a small sample size of it one day I was curious as to whether it would work it or not and tried it.</li>
            <li> While the Too Faced Lip Injection doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips, it hardly plumps up your lips.</li>
            <li> I felt a little tingle</li>
            <li> It burns a little.  </li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> , I just need a little help without surgery.  </li>
            <li> It has not significantly increased my pout, but it&#x27;s made my lips look like they did 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but im telling you not to waste your money.</li>
            <li> Really a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Ha,.. I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday, as it seems to cause chapped lips.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> and It left a thin, reddish burn lookin mark around my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now but ordered from Amazon because it was cheaper on here.  </li>
            <li> It does tingle when you put it on which I initially disliked</li>
            <li> but  my sister use it behind my back .I</li>
            <li> This will not get your lips like hers however, it will slightly plump them!</li>
            <li> This product only enhanced my lips a tiny bit and stung really bad.</li>
            <li> very little plumping and need to reapply after one hour.</li>
            <li> I ordered and have been using for a few weeks at least morning and night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others in the past from Sephora and none worked as well as this product.</li>
            <li> I have small lips</li>
            <li> but i used it for 2 weeks just to see, haven&#x27;t used it for several days, my lips are still dry, whitish, constantly have to keep cream on lips, forget wearing lipsticks it just made my lips look worst...</li>
            <li> Not a very good &amp;#34;lip enhancing&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product received so much negative feedback.</li>
            <li> Is a little irritating but thats how it works.  </li>
            <li> and I believe a lot of other reviewers have over exaggerated the intensity of the burn.</li>
            <li> I used a small amount and again my lips plumped up but no reddness and no tingling at all!!</li>
            <li> I now feel that I would rather get the injections twice a year and have some discomfort for a few days, then have my lips sting very very uncomfortably EVERY time i use this.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> The hype should be illegal.</li>
            <li> Not like a burn but an uncomfortable sting.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> i know ill be shopping around!  </li>
            <li> and my lips were burning bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 3 starts because i don&#x27;t think it was that much bad to try it.</li>
            <li> Dont let the bad reviews scare you.</li>
            <li> But, not just anyone can handle the burning and painful sensations.</li>
            <li> It stings like crazy, but hey beauty is pain!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I was  very afraid to be disappointed by the result .</li>
            <li> Just an expensive lip gloss!!!</li>
            <li> That was awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No Burning, no tingling, no plump lips. Nothing. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I initally bought my tube about 3 years ago. Although I dont wear it everyday, it has lasted a super long time and still packs some punch. I have recently replaced my tube &amp; it is good as ever. You will definitely know that this little tube of fireworks is working when you swipe a thin layer over your lips with the tiny brush. If you are on the fence with this one, get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side benefit is putting it on and smooching an unsuspecting victim. The first time I did this, i forgot I had it on, and after I kissed my husband, he looked at me like I was crazy &amp; said \\&quot;My lips are burning! What did you do?!?\\&quot; I just had to laugh, boys are such wimps sometimes.</li>
            <li> So I just recieved my Too Faced Lip Injection Extreme today. I was very excited to get it, and although I think its okay, I would not buy this again. I was considering real lip injections but figured I would explore other options first. I now feel that I would rather get the injections twice a year and have some discomfort for a few days, then have my lips sting very very uncomfortably EVERY time i use this. The results arent even noticable. Only good thing is it left my lips SUPER smooth.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  I am a beauty/makeup junkie and am very picky.  This product I like because it gives your lips a natural no fuss clear flush of rosy natural bigness that looks sexy and like your not trying too hard.  I like products that actually work and this one does.  Yes it does burn a bit but only for a few minutes.  Its worth it though!</li>
            <li> Unlike the young woman who posted pictures (I think those photos did more for this product than all of the company&#x27;s advertising!), I do not have naturallly large lips.  My lips are fairly thin which was always OK for me but the effects of aging are very noticeable. I just wanted something to restore some of that natural volume.  I saw a magazine article ranking readers&#x27; picks for best lip plumpers.  This was #2 but since I wasn&#x27;t looking for color it was my first choice.  At the time it was out of stock everywhere so I tried #1, Avon&#x27;s Beyond Color double retinol [[ASIN:B00395BPDE Avon Beyond Color Lipstick Plumping Uptown Pink Double Retinol Spf15]] Gag.  That was awful (see review).  When this Too Faced product became available I ordered and have been using for a few weeks at least morning and night.  I am very pleased with the results.  Yes, it does sting but now I barely notice it.  I imagine it will sting more for some people than others.  And it does exactly what I wanted.  My lips showed some smoothing and filling at first use. What really surprised me was the fact the it has a lasting effect.  I expected this to be purely cosmetic (ie, any effect disappears as soon as you wash it off)  But now my lips look more like they did twenty years ago even before I apply it in the morning.  After reading other reviews, I am careful to apply a lip balm over it after it absorbs to avoid \\&quot;stinging\\&quot; my husband.  This product won&#x27;t erase the effects of time or give you Angelina Jolie lips; but, it definitely gives a little boost.</li>
            <li> Is a little irritating but thats how it works.  Makes lips red and does make them look a bit fuller for a short while</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample from Sephora, and I loved the color it changed my lips with the subtle irritation. I don&#x27;t really have any need for a plumper per say, but the coloring was fantastic, so I decided to go ahead and get the full size as a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that at times, it made the outside rim of my lips more red then the rest, so I like to use it as a companion to TheBalm stainiac in Beauty Queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft, smooth feel, not super sticky like some glosses can be. The only sad part is, it only last 1/2 hour at best before your lips return to normal size and color. I would describe the effect as your lips after a good make-out session, the bee stung look. Worth a try if you have cash to thrown around, but only if you have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> Expected more even just a little; however, just good as a lip gloss.  I don&#x27;t understand people not using it because of the \\&quot;terrible\\&quot; burning.  It has a slight tingle, nothing more.  If you want a nice lip gloss, this is it, albeit a bit pricey for just a gloss.  If you want full lips, go for the real injections, that&#x27;s the only thing that really works.</li>
            <li> This lip plumper did what i figured it would do. It did NOT plump my lips but rather gave my lips a tingly pulsing feeling which probably gives people the illusion their lips are expanding. Not true. I figured I&#x27;d try it anyway but im telling you not to waste your money. I will never purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I researched (to a degree) different lip plumpers.  I was pleased to see alot of positive reviews with \\&quot;Too Faced Lip Injection Extreme\\&quot;.  I actually was exciteed to purchase this product.  I&#x27;m not rich, so I am careful about purchases.  This is week 3, it didn&#x27;t work at all.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> I felt a little tingle so i thought it was working but my lips looked actually the same even after the tingling stopped.</li>
            <li> Works instantly and very well.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it. Makes lips a rosy pink, plump and adds shine, great buy! Buying my second tube as we speak ;)</li>
            <li> This Too Faced Cosmetic Lip Injection Extreme made my lips orange and irritated ...really anti productive.  No plumping involved. Really a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Product performed as advertised. There is a slight tingling, which should be no problem to anyone, followed by a noticeable fullness. Nothing too dramatic and no trout pout, just a reasonable increase in volume.</li>
            <li> I am planning to try Two faced Lip Injection. I am currently using Stung(Lip Pulse). I get really good results with this lip plumper. But, not just anyone can handle the burning and painful sensations. It doesnt bother me. I kinda like it. Ive tried Lip Infusion XL. It worked OK. There are two methods that lip plumping companies use. The first method is they put really hot ingredients in their product to bring blood flow to your lips to cause them to plump. The second method is companies use collagen spheres that penetrate your lips and this causes water retention in your lips. This is how Lip Fusion XL works. Stung uses the hot, stimulating ingredients to plump. I noticed that Two Faced extreme has peptides in it. Peptides increases collagen. Stung claims to build permanent collagen, too. Please, dont try Stung if you cant handle burning pain! Stung can be bought on ebay or amazon for about $9.99. So, its a cheap way to plump up. Anyway, I have read some of your reviews and plan to try this product. Hopefully, you will find the perfect plumper. So, don&#x27;t give up........</li>
            <li> Works well , I love it</li>
            <li> I say the stronger the sting the better :) that&#x27;s just me tho, Works great &amp; I&#x27;m 24 with full lips so prob different for me, I love It tho,</li>
            <li> I bought this lip plumper probably for the same reason other people do. We all want want those Angelina Jolie lips! This will not get your lips like hers however, it will slightly plump them! I&#x27;ve tried others in the past from Sephora and none worked as well as this product. It stings like crazy, but hey beauty is pain! Ha,.. I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday, as it seems to cause chapped lips. It&#x27;s wonderful to use for a special occasion..not a daily use!.. I will be buying more when I run low!</li>
            <li> While I will say this product did plump my lips, it was minimal at best. I was hoping for outstanding results from this product given the price. I felt tingling, just like the other reviewer pointed out. I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen Lip Inflation which seems to have better results, even though it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as nice as this one. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the cheaper brand for better results.</li>
            <li> I think it is a very good product!! I will it buy again! Thanks a lot for the lip injection extreme!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product from Amazon. I LOVE it. It produced visible results within five minutes. The fullness was noticeable and was still present when I woke-up the next morning after one application. My husband wanted to know how my lips changed so noticeably so fast. It does burn for about 10 minutes, but it is not painful and I believe a lot of other reviewers have over exaggerated the intensity of the burn. I couldn&#x27;t find it at a cheaper price than Amazon, and it was worth every penny!!! Will purchase again :)</li>
            <li> This lip plumping serum is seriously effective in creating beautiful lips but it is also more tingly than DuWop&#x27;s Venom Gloss. At first, it is just a smooth gel/serum you apply within the lip line. This is a powerful product that will cause your lips to actually change color, making them look like you applied lipstick. The tingle can last for 3-5 minutes and is not uncomfortable, but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula promises long term results and unlike other products that fade in a matter of hours, you might wake up the next day and still be able to see the effects. The formulation is based on \\&quot;four of the most scientifically proven and advanced lip plumping technologies.\\&quot; Using this product morning and evening along with your regular beauty routine helps to maintain the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer something a little milder, you may want to try out the DuWop Venom Gloss or even use both at the same time because the DuWop has a nice glossy effect and this is more of a serum that absorbs into your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> Perfect! I love this so much. It really plumps your lips a bit and gives the a nice clean glossy finished look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product received so much negative feedback. Most lip enhancers do not work at all, this one DOES work. It chaps your lips a bit but only because it enhances them causing dryness once they stretch. Only last for about 2 hours though. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Be prepared for it to burn/sting when you put it on. The burn/irritant and shine it leaves may give the illision to look or feel like the lips are bigger. I do not see a diffrence in the size of my lips compared to regular lip gloss.</li>
            <li> for the price, it did nothing but make my lips peel, I tried putting cream on first then product didn&#x27;t plump, very drying.... didn&#x27;t do anything, went in the trash, would have sent back but i used it for 2 weeks just to see, haven&#x27;t used it for several days, my lips are still dry, whitish, constantly have to keep cream on lips, forget wearing lipsticks it just made my lips look worst...I did have hope for it,.. but was disappointed..I&#x27;ll stick to what I&#x27;ve been using....</li>
            <li> 1 Star due to the sores and red ring around my lips.  It does work. I have used this type of product before but this brand seems to cause the irritation.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that work much better.  This gloss really had no plumping effect and only a very slight tingle. Not worth the money.  A bit of pure cinnamon oil for $3 works better and tastes better too.  Sorry!</li>
            <li> I love this product !</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  Very minor results that fade quickly.  It is also very drying to your lips</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY. The hype should be illegal. To read it you would think your lips blossom into full, juicy parts that stay that way for days. The fact is that there is no difference whatsoever. 99 cent chap stick is better. Another thing--for almost $40. you get a teaspoonful of substance that last as long as a fart in your hand, presumably so you can rush and order more of this useless stuff</li>
            <li> not worth the money AT ALL.  im sure theres a lot of less &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; products out there that work better.  i know ill be shopping around!  dont buy this one!</li>
            <li> I just bought this @ Sephora last night. I put it on in the mall right after I got it. I instantly noticed my lips getting bigger especially if you look at the corners of your lips before you put it on and after you will we definitly see your lips notieably bigger. When I retunred home about 5 hours later I put it on again before I went to bed and my lips were burning bad. I noticed reddness above my upper lip under my nose. The directions say to use it in the am and the pm so I know I overdid it. I read a lot of review on here about reddness. Well today I decided I would try it again assuming I overused it yesterday. I used a small amount and again my lips plumped up but no reddness and no tingling at all!! So happy with this product so far. I think some of us may have different reactions to different ingredients. So if you also experienced reddness try using less product. You do not need a lot for this to work and do not over use. Use in am and pm as directed and you will be more than happy :) Love It.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT work. Save your 30$ trust me. I have bought a 5$ lip plumper from Wal-Mart that works better than this. The shipping was fast however as soon as I ripped open the package and put it on I noticed it starting.to burn my lips (love that feeling) as soon as the burning stopped the plumping stopped as well and my lips returned to.its original size. I&#x27;ve been using it since then to see if it was one of those things that just take time. Nope. It just flat out doesn&#x27;t work. Its just an over priced lip gloss</li>
            <li> While the Too Faced Lip Injection doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips, it hardly plumps up your lips. I was disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> came right on time and smells cool</li>
            <li> This product produces a tingly feeling as most of these types of products do.  I&#x27;ve used it a number of times, but never saw any but the smallest plumping.  I even re-applied it over time intervals of around 30 minutes and still no satisfactory results.  There is not a lot of product in the tube.  A guesstimate is that I used it about 18 times, and it is just about gone.</li>
            <li> This product makes a nice lip gloss, but I did not see any of the benefits it claims to perform. I don&#x27;t hate it, because it is a nice lip gloss, but definitely not a lip plumper. I like bare Minerals Buxom lip glosses better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be clear but it turns red after a few minutes.  It burns a little.  It plumps for only an hour or less.</li>
            <li> Love this gloss. Smells great, pretty coloring. Probably not for you if you&#x27;ve never tried plumping gloss before, as it does tingle. For example, it feels great to me, but my mom can&#x27;t stand it. I&#x27;ve tried tons of random plumping glosses and this is definitely my favorite, not a miracle plumper but gives you some volume and pout. Bottle is tiny, I use this almost everyday though and it usually lasts 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> This product only enhanced my lips a tiny bit and stung really bad. I used it for almost a week and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. Not a very good &amp;#34;lip enhancing&amp;#34; product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Yes it works, as you can see. It stings a lil but I had an allergic reaction to it, and my face turned all red for 2 days.</li>
            <li> I felt that this product does what it says it will do. For me I definitely see a difference when using it. A+A+ Very Fast Delivery too!</li>
            <li> This does only a fair job of lip plumping and it burns for a bit.  Be careful not to get on the skin on the face or you will end up with burn marks that last for about 45 minutes.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This product works well enough on the lips.  However, I gave my 6-year-old daughter her goodbye morning kiss.  Little did I know that it made her cheek red and swell.  It looked like I slapped her rather than kiss her.  It burns the skin.  I had no choice but to throw it in the trash can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stings your lips when you put it on. Not like a burn but an uncomfortable sting. It&#x27;s only for about a minute but it&#x27;s still a bit weird at first. Make sure you pay close attention to the instructions! It says apply morning and evening so you can&#x27;t really use it like a lips gloss which is what I expected. I used it a few times one of the first days I got it and It left a thin, reddish burn lookin mark around my lips. It&#x27;s looked like a crappy lip liner job. I am 22 and was just looking to get rid of lines around/on my lips and have a nice full lip gloss. It definitely gives you that \\&quot;full\\&quot; effect. I&#x27;m not crazy over it but I won&#x27;t go as far to say its not a great product because a lot of people love it and it Is highly rated in the make-up world.</li>
            <li> When I wear this it actually creates the illusion that i have an upper lip. It doesn&#x27;t last too terribly long, but great for photos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now but ordered from Amazon because it was cheaper on here.  I LOVE this lip gloss/injection.  I have small lips so any help I can get, I&#x27;ll take.  It does tingle when you put it on which I initially disliked but once I got used to it and knew it&#x27;s actually doing something, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I don&#x27;t let this run out and will continue to purchase it on here.  Recommend to anyone / everyone unless you are already gifted with full lips.</li>
            <li> I honestly have no need to use this as a lip plumper, I have lips that are quite full already. However, After receiving a small sample size of it one day I was curious as to whether it would work it or not and tried it. It did tingle and it did plump. For me the important factor was the staying power it added to my lipstick, something it does not seem to mention at all. So here&#x27;s what I do. Ever since I was in high school in the 90s (eek so long ago!) I always apply my lipstick, and them dust my lips with facepowder afterwards and smack my lips to make the powder unnoticeable. That in itself tends to make my lipstick last longer than most. The only problem with this technique is that all colors become matte. So now I can still do that process and add some of this sparingly (cuz I already have full lips) and then tada... I have all day wear.</li>
            <li> In fact , when i got too faced lip injection ,i did not use it. I was  very afraid to be disappointed by the result . but  my sister use it behind my back .I noticed a slight changing in her lips, it was red and plump .I got ferocious at her ,but  i said  wait a minute it works ,so instead of beating her i thanked her.</li>
            <li> very little plumping and need to reapply after one hour. I&#x27;m giving 3 starts because i don&#x27;t think it was that much bad to try it. Too much cost for the plumping effect.</li>
            <li> This gloss seems to bleed outside your lips. It does plump but does not stay inside lips. I probably would not recommend for any one.</li>
            <li> Judging by the reviews, I thought this was going to be much better than it is. Perhaps it&#x27;s counterfeit?</li>
            <li> Just an expensive lip gloss!!! Very disapponited with the product, my lips didn&#x27;t plump up just tingled for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love this! I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.  After reading countless reviews and watching review videos on YouTube it seemed quite controversial.  The sensation was intense but the results are beautiful and voluptuous! I now wear this daily! Dont let the bad reviews scare you. Give it a whirl!  You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Surprised this lipgloss only had 3 1/2 stars.  I picked mine up at ULTA and I love it.  I&#x27;m not too experienced with other lip plumper so I can&#x27;t compare it  to another product But  it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I wear mine all throughout the day  every day.  I wear it  with and without lipstick.  It does have a sting to it but that&#x27;s the point .  It&#x27;s a nice burn and my lips are bigger .  Try not to get  any of the gloss outside of your lips because it will irritate your skin .</li>
            <li> It really works.  I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it. It does plump the lips up a bit.  I don&#x27;t want duck lips, I just need a little help without surgery.  Love this and will buy more when gone. Can be worn over my fav lipstick. (or under)</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and as new. I used it...don&#x27;t bother. It doesn&#x27;t really work. I have bought almost everything out there and for my own vain reason..I keep trying. This will go into the trash and I&#x27;ll keep trying I suppose.</li>
            <li> I first saw this plumping serum on farrahdhukai&#x27;s youtube channel , and since she gave positive review on it , I decided to try it out for myself. I love it ! Since I already have medium plump lips , I just wanted it to be a bit more fuller. It will get them to be noticeably fuller, however my first time using this it stung like crazyyy. Not tingled , STUNG ! lol , but after each use , I don&#x27;t feel anything anymore but still gets my lips very plump :) Great product , lasts me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> It feels good when you first use but then after awhile your lips tend to get really dry.  Cannot use on consistent basis.</li>
            <li> I used this product from a free sample -- what a disaster.  It inflamed the whole area around my mouth a bright red like an awful sunburn.  And I do not have sensitive skin.  It took more than three hours for my skin to return to normal.</li>
            <li> I buy this product about once a month, and I&#x27;m always amazed that it has such a low rating. I have been using it for five years and it has returned a more youthful plumpness to my lips and reduced the appearance of fine lines around the edges. It has not significantly increased my pout, but it&#x27;s made my lips look like they did 10 years ago. As mentioned, I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and I apply it as a lip gloss several times a day. I&#x27;ve found it to be moisturizing overall, but I do remember some irritation when I first started using it. If your lips turn pink or red or you feel more than a mild tingling, you&#x27;re probably allergic to one of the ingredients. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s super expensive, but I&#x27;m willing to pay for the results.</li>
            <li> I purchased Too Faced Cosmetics Lip Injection Extreme fthrough Amazona few weeks Ago. I have used it and have noticed a slight plumpness on my lips, I have tried different products so far this is the one I have liked the most.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this lipgloss!</li>
