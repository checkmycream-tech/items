    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>There is a lot of good information disseminated by Dr.Oz, the best pitchman I have ever seen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So hopefully it will be great  and the ingredients will work well...</li>
            <li>This is a great product</li>
            <li>Great product that moisturized quite well.</li>
            <li>Again, I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>Its glowing and bright.</li>
            <li>but it was good.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product.</li>
            <li>The difference in my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I cant say at this time if I love the product as I just started to use it.  </li>
            <li>Good so far to good products in one</li>
            <li>Love product.  </li>
            <li>Cons, thought it was more ounces for the money.</li>
            <li>I do love the refresbing feeling you get from a toner.</li>
            <li>Love looking at the cotton when finished to see the amount of dirt and grime it removes even after I had just washed my face.</li>
            <li>But is sure makes my skin feel great after my facial.</li>
            <li>Skin felt smooth, clean.</li>
            <li>After showering and shaving, I thought my face was clean.</li>
            <li>When it dries, it tends to crack and takes a while to completely clean off your face.</li>
            <li>I loved the Beau Visage Facial Toner!!  </li>
            <li>This one is worth it.</li>
            <li>I recommend beginning taking better care of yourself early in life.  </li>
            <li>I had never used a toner before I tried this one and didn&#x27;t really think a toner would be very useful.  </li>
            <li>It was first time in years that I switched from my RX toner.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this offer.</li>
            <li>Two, because I saw a TV show where Dr Oz was really showing that Hyaloic Acid and Witch Hazel work really well</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really speak to how the product does all by it</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and the only time it has stung my face has been on days when my skin was mildly irritated from something else.</li>
            <li>It really does help prevent clogged pores and does just enough tightening for my mature skin.</li>
            <li>So this was a natural for me.</li>
            <li>I am only giving this 3 stars right now because I have not been on it long enough to say.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this product has made a huge difference in keeping my skin moisturized and looking less tired and more youthful.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for people with dry skin, or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Anxious to see my complexion after a few more weeks of usage.</li>

            <li> One, because I was already using other beau visage products.</li>
            <li> I just apply a little bit to a makeup remover pad and then stroke it on to my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I work i9n the heat and am around Fiberglass a lot. I use to get lots of breakouts. My aunt told me to use this several times a day. I was shocked when I used it the first time. After showering and shaving, I thought my face was clean. I hit it with the facial toner and all the crud that was still on my skin was something. I seldom get breakouts now. This toner actually stays in my truck!</li>
            <li> I can not tell it helps at all.  I have only used it for 10 days so maybe it will improve.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I had never used a toner before I tried this one and didn&#x27;t really think a toner would be very useful.  I apply this toner to my face and neck after showering and before applying my moisturizer.  I have dry skin and this product has made a huge difference in keeping my skin moisturized and looking less tired and more youthful.  I just apply a little bit to a makeup remover pad and then stroke it on to my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and my skin and it plumps up and glows the next morning. I would highly recommend it for people with dry skin, or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Put faith in Dr. Oz. And I am already a witch hazel user. So this was a natural for me. Thanks for this offer.</li>
            <li> I found out that I am allergy with at least three of the products from ViLisse&#x27;s. this is one of them..</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this for a couple of days, I can tell.  Works well on my skin - definitely a keeper</li>
            <li> I cant say at this time if I love the product as I just started to use it.  I do feel the price is a little high for the amount in the bottle....So hopefully it will be great  and the ingredients will work well... I will say that delivery was on time and ordering from Amazon went well</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> Great product that moisturized quite well.</li>
            <li> Nice! I use it every day and spots on my face has faded.</li>
            <li> I gave up on toners/astringents years ago. They were just another step in the cleaning process and yielded no results. This one is worth it. It really does help prevent clogged pores and does just enough tightening for my mature skin.</li>
            <li> Not only don&#x27;t I use it...I can&#x27;t even find it in my bathroom.  If I find it, I will try again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for I week. The difference in my skin is amazing. Its glowing and bright. I will continue to buy this product and try their other skin products.</li>
            <li> This mask is very thick and difficult to spread  evenly over the skin.  When it dries, it tends to crack and takes a while to completely clean off your face. JS</li>
            <li> Good so far to good products in one</li>
            <li> Love product.  It was first time in years that I switched from my RX toner. Skin felt smooth, clean. It didin&#x27;t feel the tightening I was expecting but it was good. Would definitely recommend this to my friends. Cons, thought it was more ounces for the money. Again, I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I tried the product for a few weeks.  I did not notice any difference or improvement as the add states.  No magic bullet for looking younger chemically.  I recommend beginning taking better care of yourself early in life.  I may invest in another product just to see.  There is a lot of good information disseminated by Dr.Oz, the best pitchman I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;m</li>
            <li> It was no what I expect</li>
            <li> ummm.....can&#x27;t say i noticed any difference at all....won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> I totally disagree with Dr Oz on this one I did not like the product at all and could tell no difference after using for one month</li>
            <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT REGULER FIND THIS JUST AS IT WAS ADVERTISED WILL DEFINATELY PURCHASE THIS AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;IT THE NICEST TONER</li>
            <li> I added the beau visage facial toner to my skin routine. One, because I was already using other beau visage products. Two, because I saw a TV show where Dr Oz was really showing that Hyaloic Acid and Witch Hazel work really well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really speak to how the product does all by it self. But is sure makes my skin feel great after my facial. This is a really good product. And No Animal Testing!!!</li>
            <li> I loved the Beau Visage Facial Toner!!  Instantly it gave my face a smoother look and feel and it closed my pores as promised.  I would definatly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am only giving this 3 stars right now because I have not been on it long enough to say. I do love the refresbing feeling you get from a toner. I have extremely sensitive skin and the only time it has stung my face has been on days when my skin was mildly irritated from something else. Love looking at the cotton when finished to see the amount of dirt and grime it removes even after I had just washed my face. Anxious to see my complexion after a few more weeks of usage.</li>
