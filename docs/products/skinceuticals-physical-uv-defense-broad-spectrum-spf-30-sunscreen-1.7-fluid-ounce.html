            <li>But it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact it was chemical free.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, light lotion that spreads easily on the skin</li>
            <li>Good sale and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully light weight but offers great protection.</li>
            <li>I just tried this product and it spreads easily and does not look chalky.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to apply</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and acne prone skin, and this sun screen is the best one for me so far.</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy film on your skin.  </li>
            <li>so you have to make sure it has all been absorbed</li>
            <li>Non oily and light on the skin.</li>
            <li>Overall my wife thinks the products great.</li>
            <li>I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January (my favorite product so far along with the simply clean cleanser).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday use alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li>I wish I didn&#x27;t have to give up the extra SPF protection, but my skin has been much better.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first one i&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t feel  greasy or like there is something on my face.  </li>
            <li>I was sure I had ordered the Physical Fusion.  </li>
            <li>Instead of the lovely tinted liquid I was expecting, I had a glob of white sticky goo.  </li>
            <li>My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic</li>
            <li>I have Melasma and have been advised to use a higher SPF to minimize the \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; spots on my face from the sun.  </li>
            <li>The packaging of the two items look so much</li>
            <li>Also works really well under make up.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to so many products but finally found skinceuticals.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and goes on light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>and it is looking overall better with the recent</li>
            <li>She was skeptical, but has been impressed and now uses it daily.</li>
            <li>It is light enough to not clog the pore but still moisturizing enough for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those who has sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup and this sunscreen has a natural tint in it and a  SPF 50!</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, and was having problems with breaking out while using SkinCeuticals sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>you have to shake the bottle and really rub it into your skin - if you do that, no white residue.  </li>
            <li>Every time I used them, my skin couldn&#x27;t breath and broke out frequently.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really what I expected because I thought it was the older version.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any new freckles or age spots, but I&#x27;ve only been using the product about five weeks.</li>
            <li>I will edit my review or write a new one if I notice anything different in the coming sunny months.</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law also developed a dark \\&quot;mask of pregnancy\\&quot; and recognized she needs to use a higher SPF product, too.  </li>
            <li>The other product I used was effective, but thick and \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>really wish the manufacturer would make the box and bottle label of these items look less similar.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommended by my current and past dermatologist and skin care techs..  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t been very sunny up here in the Northeast lately, so hard for me to say if this product is actually protecting me.</li>
            <li> I think some people have complained about white residue, which I think is caused by not shaking the bottle before use or by putting too much on.</li>
            <li> So, I switched from SkinCeuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50 Universal Tint, to Physical UV Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 DELICATE CARE.  </li>
            <li> prefer Skin Authority products, but all their sunscreens are too heavy for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time</li>
            <li> this product makes for a good makeup base also.</li>
            <li> ...and this small bottle lasts me months even with daily facial use...</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so</li>
            <li> We ski, water ski and other water sports.</li>
            <li> and I always cut the container in half when it seems to be empty.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician encouraged me to mix a little of the DELICATE CARE into my regular moisturizer, with the added bonus that I don&#x27;t have to wait for my sunscreen to soak in before I can put on my moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I havent found a sunscreen that i could wera everyday that didnt feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have tried sunscreen of Chanel, Clarins, and Neutrogena in the past few years, they were lighter than other brands, but were still too thick and oily to me.</li>
            <li> In the past month I added AOX+ Eye gel in a.m. and A.G.E. eye cream at night, Phyto corrective gel in morning and evening, retexturing activator in evening</li>
            <li> so it is hard to find a sunblock I can wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked moisturizers until this one.</li>
            <li> I feel a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had ordered the wrong item until I squeezed some out.  </li>
            <li> I felt very frustrated and thought I couldn&#x27;t find any sunscreen that suits me on this planet until I found this one.</li>
            <li> However, it has a terrible smell!!!</li>

            <li> ...and this small bottle lasts me months even with daily facial use...a little goes a long way. I havent found a sunscreen that i could wera everyday that didnt feel heavy or greasy. This works great under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and was having problems with breaking out while using SkinCeuticals sunscreen.  So, I switched from SkinCeuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50 Universal Tint, to Physical UV Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 DELICATE CARE.  I wish I didn&#x27;t have to give up the extra SPF protection, but my skin has been much better.

            <li> Use this product  daily on my neck.  Helps protect it from the sun and the welding rays. My skin is sensitive to so many products but finally found skinceuticals.  this product makes for a good makeup base also. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite sunscreen.  Highly recommended by my current and past dermatologist and skin care techs..  It does leave a white film on your skin.  I bought this non-tinted for my husband and kids.  I use the tinted one for myself.  it goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy film on your skin.  I think it stays on well for summer and winter sports from my experience.  We ski, water ski and other water sports.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup and this sunscreen has a natural tint in it and a  SPF 50! Lasts a long time and I always cut the container in half when it seems to be empty. Keep in a baggy and use a Q-tip to get the rest of the sunscreen out. I get another week of sunscreen using this method.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing. Leaves my skin feeling softer and looks beautiful... Dewey... Not oily. And I have oily skin! I&#x27;ve never liked moisturizers until this one.</li>
            <li> love this sunscreen!  it&#x27;s the first one i&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t feel  greasy or like there is something on my face.  you have to shake the bottle and really rub it into your skin - if you do that, no white residue.  love it!</li>
            <li> I was sure I had ordered the Physical Fusion.  The packaging of the two items look so much alike I didn&#x27;t realize I had ordered the wrong item until I squeezed some out.  Instead of the lovely tinted liquid I was expecting, I had a glob of white sticky goo.  Totally different texture and finish from the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish the manufacturer would make the box and bottle label of these items look less similar.  Posting this review in hopes I can save someone else from the same costly mistake I made.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to apply</li>
            <li> Even though the description says it&#x27;s tinted, adaptable to any skin tone, know it is white and NOT tinted.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed since tinted is what I use.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for my fair skin</li>
            <li> I love this product...it isn&#x27;t greasy or oily. I have oily skin so it is hard to find a sunblock I can wear. This one works great!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and acne prone skin, and this sun screen is the best one for me so far. I have tried sunscreen of Chanel, Clarins, and Neutrogena in the past few years, they were lighter than other brands, but were still too thick and oily to me. Every time I used them, my skin couldn&#x27;t breath and broke out frequently. I felt very frustrated and thought I couldn&#x27;t find any sunscreen that suits me on this planet until I found this one. It is light enough to not clog the pore but still moisturizing enough for the whole day. Highly recommend for those who has sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I wear it everyday under my makeup. It&#x27;s wonderfully light weight but offers great protection.</li>
            <li> This is the one without a tint so you have to make sure it has all been absorbed so you don&#x27;t have white streaks on your face. It lasts a long time and goes on light and not greasy.  It uses only physical sunscreens and not chemicals.  It&#x27;s great for everyday use alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product - good service</li>
            <li> The one I got from my doctor&#x27;s office was tinted. This cream is white. I feel a little skeptical. Why is different?</li>
            <li> Good sale and fast shipping. Wasn&#x27;t really what I expected because I thought it was the older version. But it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It works great! Non oily and light on the skin. I really love this product. Also works really well under make up. A little goes a long way, so no need to goop it on. I think some people have complained about white residue, which I think is caused by not shaking the bottle before use or by putting too much on. I have not had any of these issues.</li>
            <li> I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January (my favorite product so far along with the simply clean cleanser). In the past month I added AOX+ Eye gel in a.m. and A.G.E. eye cream at night, Phyto corrective gel in morning and evening, retexturing activator in evening and after my moisturizer (Aveeno ultra calming) I add in the morning the Skinceuticals physical UV defense spf 30 sunscreen. My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic and it is looking overall better with the recent additions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t been very sunny up here in the Northeast lately, so hard for me to say if this product is actually protecting me. I haven&#x27;t noticed any new freckles or age spots, but I&#x27;ve only been using the product about five weeks. Again, overall, people have noticed a change in my skin, stating it looks brighter and \\&quot;great\\&quot; without solicitation. I will edit my review or write a new one if I notice anything different in the coming sunny months.</li>
            <li> The reason why I bought it is because I read on the product description that it was tinted. The cream is completely white.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product and it spreads easily and does not look chalky. However, it has a terrible smell!!!</li>
            <li> Overall my wife thinks the products great.She says its very light under her makeup.I liked the fact it was chemical free.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have bought it as a gift, too!  I have Melasma and have been advised to use a higher SPF to minimize the \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; spots on my face from the sun.  The other product I used was effective, but thick and \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;.  This is a nice, light lotion that spreads easily on the skin and I use it on my face, neck and upper chest on a daily basis.  My daughter-in-law also developed a dark \\&quot;mask of pregnancy\\&quot; and recognized she needs to use a higher SPF product, too.  She loves the bottle of this product I gave her to try.  She was skeptical, but has been impressed and now uses it daily.</li>
