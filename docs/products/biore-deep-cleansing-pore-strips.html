            <li>I absolutely recommend these Biore&#x27; Pore Perfect Strips as a great buy for a picture pefect way at getting rid of your blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:</li>

            <li>After using this for the first time tonight and seeing what was pulled out on the strip i am very happy with the result.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m quite impressed with the difference even after first use.</li>
            <li>I just wish my son would use it more!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Buying for years, one of the best product invented really!</li>
            <li>Love these things!  </li>
            <li>I love this brand!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Do more research!</li>
            <li>for the effectiveness of the strip itself, it&#x27;s pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to hear if it helps for you, so please let me know!</li>
            <li>I love this brand!</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love biore!?</li>
            <li>For the most part it works!</li>
            <li>and it sometimes leaves my skin oily, but it gets rid of most!</li>
            <li>I love knowing that I can get all that junk OUT of my pores!</li>
            <li>I love Biore strips!</li>
            <li>love the face wash too!</li>
            <li>i LOVE THESE STRIPS!</li>
            <li>I love Biore pore strips!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very effective, just need water and maybe some soap to wash your face afterwards.</li>
            <li>but it did the job amazingly for him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite amazing</li>
            <li>...this is amazing....</li>
            <li>Who ever came up with this is amazing because this product works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These work amazing.</li>
            <li>The lat time I bought them before this time was probably 5 years ago and at that time they worked amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and effective.</li>
            <li>and I knew they were amazing</li>
            <li>For Biore&#x27;, they have delivered very well at getting rid of our blackheads from our face, and that has continued to show with their Picture Perfect Pore Strips.</li>
            <li>Do not put this on after any kind of skin treatment (ex. tca peel, needle..etc.)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve used anything else to remove blackheads that has been as effective as this, but it still does a lot of the work.</li>
            <li>I can honestly report that this did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>If you are getting ready for a party and are looking for a perfect makeup you should use this one before.</li>
            <li>The best method to maximize how much these strips remove from my pores is this: 1) apply Queen Helene mint julep mask to nose for fifteen minutes; 2) rinse with some face wash; and 3) apply the pore strip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice thing to do once a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the awesome price, this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>You will notice howo effective</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing this for a while now, and it&#x27;s a nice treat since the strips are a bit pricey</li>
            <li>The Biore site is nice because they don&#x27;t post a bunch of stuff on your stream or your friends stream when you enter in your points or &#x27;like&#x27; their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will notice how effective they are immediately after you take them off.</li>
            <li>Take a warm shower for 15-20 minutes to loosen your pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fill a bowl with warm water and baking soda: about two parts water and one part baking soda.</li>
            <li>Biore Pore Strips are really effective at removing the gunk on your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it sure gets a bunch and its great being able to see the results and stuff</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t honestly know how well they worked or if they even worked at all.</li>
            <li>to use &amp; quite effective.</li>
            <li>The amount of pulled pore debris is astounding, to say the least.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice product</li>
            <li>/&gt;-take a warm shower</li>
            <li>These are a nice solution for in between facials.</li>
            <li>I also think their Biore face wash is effective.</li>
            <li>i have always liked these strips.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why the Biore pore strips are so handy.</li>
            <li>After reading the description and reviews I was thrilled and looked forward to a miracle.</li>
            <li>- I think I have blackheads on my cheeks too, and it would be nice if they would make strips for that too.</li>
            <li>Thanks for send the product, excellent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good, the cost is better than drugstore pricing.</li>
            <li>You can really see the dirt that accumulates and shows up on the used strip - does a great job and makes his nose look great.</li>
            <li>Great product for keeping your pores clean.</li>
            <li>These work great to make the surface of pores look clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving these a high rating, though, because they&#x27;re the best product out there for removing blackheads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- reputable brand and very rewarding to use when you get the white/blackheads out.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I love these strips because they&#x27;re so easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>Is perfect love it much</li>
            <li>only works best when you keep up a good skincare routine</li>
            <li>The more &amp;#34;spiky&amp;#34; the pore strip looks, the better!</li>
            <li>These strips are the best and easiest thing ever to clear clogged pores on your nose!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly pleased at how these nose strips effectively removed my stubborn blackheads.</li>
            <li>It is brilliant and really cleans out the pores.</li>
            <li>Clearly, the Bior&amp;eacute; Strips are the best</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely but did not have good results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it was this easy!</li>
            <li>What I especially liked was the large size box available at this website.</li>
            <li>I use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save to ensure I always have a good supply and a better price with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I remember using these strips when they first came out over 10 years ago, and they worked great-</li>
            <li>Works great if you follow the directs exactly.</li>
            <li>You may not like what you find but these are great and do the job well, you dont have to keep it on for the full 15, 10 is fine.</li>
            <li>They work but not as easy or effective as the ponds strips</li>
            <li>i love using biore strips, if you use them twice a week your pores will be flawless and clean :) i haven&#x27;t really had a problem with acne or pimples</li>
            <li>It got rid of the huge blackhead (like I was hoping) and then some!</li>
            <li>After using the strips twice his nose was blackhead free!</li>
            <li>I have not been able to get rid of them no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li>I now feel so confident about my appearance.</li>
            <li>The supermarket ones were better.</li>
            <li>It wont pull all, but most will come out</li>
            <li>Biore strips have always worked for me to remove most (not all) of the blackheads, if I remember to use them 2x a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Examine it closely, and you&#x27;re sure to see a bunch of junk that it sucked out of your pores.</li>
            <li>Some days work better than others</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove many blackheads, but some.</li>
            <li>It works for me, it cleans my nose pores better than any cream.</li>
            <li>The technology has improved so you get better results without skinning your nose.</li>
            <li>Before that, all the cleansers and whatnot I used (for acne) didn&#x27;t get rid of the blackheads, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it were blackheads or</li>
            <li>But my nose is much more clearer and it isn&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They work, but I still feel like there is a better product for my nose..</li>
            <li>It seems to be able to pull out the deeper pores.  </li>
            <li>I wish it would be able to remove 100% of the blackheads and dirt in my pores for my nose area</li>
            <li>A konjac sponge works better for me.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love these strips.</li>
            <li>Make sure you press in the corners of your nose and</li>
            <li>really enjoy this product!  </li>
            <li>I got to the top of my nose, the pain was gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nose looks 100% better than before, even with some blackheads remaining.</li>
            <li>According to the box, it is not advisable to use these strips more often than every 3 days, so I will need to wait until I can try again to remove the rest of the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I do one strip every week which I think is probably the most you should do.</li>
            <li>more words are required to count as a review.</li>
            <li>There is something oddly satisfying about peeling off one of these pore strips and squinting to see all of the grime that it has pulled out.</li>
            <li>I love seeing all the jun that comes off my nose after I take it off.</li>
            <li>and I love how well they work.  </li>
            <li>When I bought it I thought I was throwing away my money, but decided to give it a try anyway and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Anyway, she says I look better, so who am I to doubt?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured with all the hype of this brand that it&#x27;d be fantastic!</li>
            <li>Scrubs work much better.</li>
            <li>I love using them</li>
            <li>They work ok at cleaning out pores but it felt like I was ripping my nose off when I took it off.</li>
            <li>I love them, but when they pull out the metal extractor &amp; go for my nose, I want to cry.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE these products....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to return my skin to the way it was before I used these.</li>
            <li>You have to use many times (as it says, once a week) to achieve what you want.</li>
            <li>Okay, so... I have a confession to make.</li>
            <li>sure, It washes off, but</li>
            <li>Duct tape would work better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like anything is cleaner or noticeably better off after use.</li>
            <li>Now, everything is more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>For better result by the Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, from the link below,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works, but scrub and tone control face wash works a lot better.</li>
            <li>What can I say, this is as far as I know the best pore strip available.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply lots of water to the area before putting them on, otherwise they won&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li>It helps if you wash your face to remove oil or make up so that the pore strips will stick better.</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply lots of water to the area before putting them on, otherwise they won&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li>The Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips (nose strips) are now a permanent part of my weekly routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>With too many coupons n low price always best place to buy</li>
            <li>Well these things do work, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>My tongue is nice and smooth but now I can&#x27;t taste anything at all.</li>
            <li>I guarantee these tips will give you better results.</li>
            <li>Works better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>Helped me to have a better skin on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>more pain when cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li>I would say it works ok, but don&#x27;t expect it to remove all your blackheads.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>These get rid of whiteheads about 80% of the time and blackheads at most 50% of the time.</li>
            <li>I use the strips mostly on my chin and forehead.</li>
            <li>I think more than once or twice a month would just be too abrasive to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think more than once or twice a month would just be too abrasive to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it might have worked better there than it did on my nose</li>
            <li>Press in place and make sure the strip adheres thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Turns out I had more gunk in my pores than my boyfriend, quite shameful</li>
            <li>forward to buying more</li>
            <li>No product works better at getting junk out of my pores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>but no luck...this product is like a magic...</li>
            <li>:D&lt;br /&gt;make sure to tone ur skin after use with ice or toner</li>
            <li>Still, there aren&#x27;t many products out there that are better.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>And be glad that your face is now cleaner because you used the Biore nose</li>
            <li>I had that many blackheads on my nose until I saw it on the peel.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask?</li>
            <li>Allow me to elaborate: you know those pre-cut slits that allow the strip to flex and adjust to your nose?  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure to remove all of your makeup before or during your shower.</li>
            <li>I think all women love this product.</li>
            <li>Even took a picture of last - rather impressive - haul of blackhead removal with these strips.</li>
            <li>My daughters love these.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I still have just as many.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting the 14 ct for about $1 more than the 8 ct.</li>
            <li>He has many blackheads on his head and this thing performed miracles sucking them all out.</li>
            <li>The stuff pulls off most of them in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>These are just okay.</li>
            <li>But, it is better than anything else I have come across in the market.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks my nose started to look a lot better than it has probably ever.</li>
            <li>After a month I tried once more squeezing the pores with a fingernail and in 30 seconds remove two times what a strip does.</li>
            <li>Do not use more than recommended as it does take a layer of skin off.  </li>
            <li>:) I always refer people with face problems,</li>
            <li>It will pull out more blackheads this way than if you used the strip alone.</li>
            <li>OK, it&#x27;s basically a hi-tech piece of tape for your face.  </li>
            <li>So, I have many blackheads on my nose, I can press them and get the gunk out</li>
            <li>really love this pore strip.</li>
            <li>To be the most effective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sometimes makes them even more visible</li>
            <li>So glad I got these</li>
            <li>These are okay.</li>
            <li>The wetter you got your face, the better it will stick and the more that will come off.</li>
            <li>Does the job, mostly.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>face masks work better</li>
            <li>it may work better for your application.</li>
            <li>I love these pore strips.</li>
            <li>I love these Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips are the best</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re much more</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these biore strips.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve grown to love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product, works well, but when my package came the box was damaged.</li>
            <li>I love seeing all the junk that these things pull out of my pores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found nothing better.  </li>
            <li>Add Biore Strips to your cleansing regime too if you want to be sure you&#x27;re getting EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, works for some blackheads</li>
            <li>wish it worked better.</li>
            <li>Post examination of grime removed is oddly satisfying.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I thought if I start using all these girly products that I would magically just get prettier, and it&#x27;s been like 4 months</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>: Be sure to wash you face with a exfoliator BEFORE you use this Strips...get one just as &amp;#34;Garnier Exfoliator with micro beads &amp; Jojoba&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it removed a bit more.</li>
            <li>I love biore strips.</li>
            <li>I think its safe to say, I&#x27;d never buy or use these strips ever again.</li>
            <li>but they aren&#x27;t any better than the ones I get from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>Terrific, love the charcoal ones now that those are out!!!!</li>
            <li>They work most of the time.</li>
            <li>I used it on my nose about 5 times, and each time it does withdraw blackheads but not at the rate or percentage i would love it too.</li>
            <li>But they WILL get out studdborn blackheads better than squeezing.</li>
            <li>moments.&amp;#34; More like, &amp;#34;Aw, ok.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Use a warm bar of soap on your face so that it is completely clean and makeup</li>
            <li>Great results, I highly recommend these, and I will continue to buy them myself.</li>
            <li>Feel very clean.</li>
            <li>This works pretty good, but doesnt get all of them out every time.</li>
            <li>The strip had successfully pulled out some pore-clogging gunk, but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Work pretty good for me</li>
            <li>a month is a pretty good schedule.  </li>
            <li>I think the blackheads have lessened with steady use, but I still deal with surface skin impurities and these strips have been very effective in keeping blackheads, etc.</li>
            <li>Though most fascinating results are certainly with longer intervals between application.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth buying this product!!  </li>
            <li>I bought these just for shagrins and they have not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I still get blackheads, but I feel more relieved to see that I am able to clean my pores more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>The strips really clean your nose from the blackspots!</li>
            <li>Feel really clean afterwards!</li>
            <li>They work every time and I feel like the pores are ripped out and clean!  </li>
            <li>It works fine, but I think it could be better.</li>
            <li>These really work great to clean your nose pores.</li>
            <li>The overall reviews on the Biore Pore Strips are very good</li>
            <li>Those are the most important pre-strip items of concern.  </li>
            <li>I love how smooth my nose feels now.</li>
            <li>Good product, but does not have much power to remove the sludge, although it helps in clearing the impurities of the face</li>
            <li>Pull strips (use good judgment; not too fast, not too</li>
            <li>This is temporary though because the pores fill up just as quickly as they were unclogged and many times you&#x27;ll end up with more blackheads than before.</li>
            <li>It really works great and makes my face feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>So cool!</li>
            <li>not a bad price either on here!</li>
            <li>, I guess it just depends on my pores and how easily the strips can get to my blackheads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packing is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy for them to use</li>
            <li>Biore strips work like magic to clean out pores.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, but it was easy to get dryness in the area if I used the strips too often.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and frequency of use depends on season and location.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are nice to use every once in a while to get that gunk out, and I do think these strips are more gentle on my skin compared to to \\&quot;expressing\\</li>
            <li>These things are easy to use and they work well.  </li>
            <li>but easy to use, and works.  </li>
            <li>But they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>so any blemishes show up easily.</li>
            <li>the adhesive is not as strong but still does the job on some blackheads,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing when you use these</li>
            <li>Ive always struggeld with a oily nose full of blackheads and this product has definitely satisfied my needs.</li>
            <li>best stuff on the market hands down</li>
            <li>I did all the steps and made sure my face was clean and makeup free.</li>
            <li>bought for girlfriend, she seems to like this fine</li>
            <li>They are the best at removing the black heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is the best for your face because it could pull off more than blackheads.</li>
            <li>This morning everything is fine.</li>
            <li>and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>Works best if you cleanse your face with some sort of deep-cleaning scrub, like those black-head removing creams with blue granules in them, first.</li>
            <li>if your problem is superficial this would work out just fine</li>
            <li>I heal just fine.  </li>
            <li>The nose is fine, though.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, he found them!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: They do work, make sure not to pull quickly and use after a shower.</li>
            <li>They work best on large pores, and aren&#x27;t as good on small pores.</li>
            <li>but theres just something about the real thing that works better!</li>
            <li>I really was impressed at how much it got rid of after my first use.</li>
            <li>this is a great and easy to use product, simple directions are included.</li>
            <li>Well, case and point is that these work wonderfully, they hurt a little when I pulled mine off to the point my eyes were watering quite a bit, but</li>
            <li>Remove most of the black heads from the first use - use 1 per week - excellent product - easy to use</li>
            <li>They got here ultra quick so and also excited about that too!</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I use one probably once a month and notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Dont really work too well to be honest.</li>
            <li>Overall its a great product.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really fit</li>
            <li>I used this product several times and I am usually happy with the results.</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li>and when i saw that amazon was selling a 14 strip i freaked and bought one to see if 14 actually came in a box LOL</li>
            <li>and my skin always feels so smooth after using them.</li>
            <li>It was amazing to see how much of it was on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like to see them available in bulk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to give it a few minutes before heading out on a date or negotiating peace with a neighboring nation state so that the pores can recover and shrink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Did fit secure and tugged on my skin when removed.</li>
            <li>As a cheap alternative to buying in the stores, I recommend this seller and product.</li>
            <li>Amazing, literally after doing this and seeing how much dirt is in my pores, they are a must have.</li>
            <li>I used these about 10 years ago when I was in middle school, and they were great then.</li>
            <li>Use these all the time, and they totally work great for me.</li>
            <li>The face strips did not do a great job at removing my white heads under my chin.</li>
            <li>Cut the strip to properly fit on your nose or face.</li>
            <li>Smooth out all air bubbles, those areas won&#x27;t work otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much crud these things pull off of my nose.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and even tried a few tricks and the best I could get was so so results.</li>
            <li>oh boy does it feel smooth and</li>
            <li>And these things aren&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>She applied one on my nose to show me what it can do and it really did a nice job.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of the Pore Strips free from the Vine review program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Afterwards, hold the strip sideways to a light, and you can see where the detritus from each pore has been pulled out.  </li>
            <li>The best way to reduce blackheads is just using a scrubbing face wash a few times a week.</li>

            <li>The item arrived pretty fast, in good condition.</li>
            <li>I am very glad that I ordered Biore Deep Cleansing, I have tried so many products for my blackheads and nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, work quickly, and don&#x27;t leave a ton of redness.</li>
            <li>my nose feels fresh and clean each time I use them!</li>
            <li>Although they don&#x27;t fix the problem at all, they do make it fun to clean out your pores!  </li>
            <li>I recommend using a strip right after a nice, hot shower.  </li>
            <li>I love these strips they are easy to use and really work.</li>
            <li>They pull out so many comedones and it&#x27;s actually pretty neat to look at the strip after you pull it off.</li>
            <li>I love using this product and always feel so much cleaner after!</li>
            <li>But well worth it!</li>
            <li>Really fun to peel off!</li>
            <li>Some foolish people think that men are the grosser sex, but Biore pore strips are a significant indication</li>
            <li>yep, it works pretty well, got a lot stuff out, and then some more, recommended for the purpose of removing blackheads</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to try them.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s pretty satisfying to see all the gunk on the strip afterwards.</li>
            <li>I bought these today (not from Amazon however) and was really excited to try them out.</li>
            <li>it on your nose significantly longer than 10 min.</li>
            <li>first thing I&#x27;d like to note is that the strips LOVE to stick to themselves.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy these again even though they do exactly what they say they will because it&#x27;s more of a novelty.  </li>
            <li>well first and make sure its damp</li>
            <li>I forgot how much fun these are!  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I used these pore strips many years ago as a teenager when they first started being sold.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, not painful, and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>best use you&#x27;ll ever get from the biore strip is the first use where it will probably pull out huge black filaments from your skin.  </li>
            <li>I order the Kiehls amazon mask to clean the pore and will see how it works.</li>
            <li>Note that it won&#x27;t completely clean out your pores and you would need to use an exfoliant to do that, but if you just want a temporary surface clean up this will help a bit.</li>
            <li>It will clean your pores well.</li>
            <li>They work, my nose feels super smooth for weeks, and it brings out the kid in everyone to inspect what the strips pulled off your face.</li>
            <li>it would not stick to my clean nose so it could not work.</li>
            <li>I also use the strips on either side of my nose/cheek/chin areas, and they work to clean these parts as well.</li>
            <li>I tend to get blackheads on the side of my nose and these strips keep my nose clean.</li>
            <li>When I bought my first box of Biore pore strips, they were amazing probably because it was also my first time using it.</li>
            <li>However, you can maintain a clean nose when you wash your nose two times a day and sleep on a clean pillowcase</li>
            <li>these will keep those pores clean after removing them with this product.</li>
            <li>Use this to exfoliate your skin and clean your pores.</li>
            <li>Want clean skin?  </li>
            <li>I find that they are more effective when you leave them on longer, so I left mine on for 40 minutes instead of 20.</li>
            <li>I like the tightening effect on my pores and it makes my skin and pores feel rejuvenated and clean.</li>
            <li>exfoliate, clean and use the product once a month can&#x27;t ask for better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of gross but also satisfying to know that all of that is not in your pores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really removes those blackheads and leaves your skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>I need something fast with having 3 kids and this is fast and easy to apply!!</li>
            <li>but I was certainly hoping to see it do more.</li>
            <li>Whenever the blackheads on my nose and chin get noticeable, one of these babies will pluck them right off!</li>
            <li>, it is quite satisfying to see how much you can \\&quot;clean</li>
            <li>Secondly, I am surprised at how amazing these work.</li>
            <li>I used to use these when they first came out on the market, and I&#x27;m happy to see that they&#x27;re still the same.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing how much the pore strips pick up.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the instructions because not wetting or wetting the area too much can have an impact on the outcome.</li>
            <li>It was cool to see the stuff it removed though.</li>
            <li>Thanks for more acne.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy this product though, it&#x27;s fun to poke at it when it&#x27;s all plastery.</li>
            <li>I really love pulling these off and seeing how much guck came out of my pores.</li>
            <li>Love that I can order these to be delivered straight to my door.</li>
            <li>Once the cotton rounds are fully saturated with the warm baking soda mixture, completely cover your nose with the pads.</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a mask or blackhead scrub that was anywhere near as effective as these.</li>
            <li>and that is so cool - coz</li>
            <li>As someone else mentioned, the strip is really gross after you peel it off but that means it did a good job.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>followed the instructions zealously, and waited a full 20 minutes before taking the strip off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A TRUE MIRACLE.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>It got maybe 10 out of probably hundreds, which is honestly not bad.</li>
            <li>am so excited for these strips and encourage those looking to improve the appearance of their skin while deeply cleaning their pores to try the Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips.</li>
            <li>Deep Pore Cleansing Masque works a lot better and easier for me, as well as being a more economical choice (that batch lasts forever!)</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using it too often because it pulls skin around your nose pretty strong.</li>
            <li>but when i got them i immediately tried them out and it worked great with the other things i had purchased on amazon.</li>
            <li>They leave my pores feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have so many pin prick sized black heads on my nose and can sometimes squeeze them out, but to be able to get more out a time</li>
            <li>These cleanup blackheads quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s quickly fading and</li>
            <li>These strips work great at removing black heads from your nose if you want your nose clean</li>
            <li>They work but run out quick</li>
            <li>I love it, I have sensitive/ combination skin and was worried this might be too harsh for my skin, but it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>w/a mild cleanser to remove excess</li>
            <li>This is a great way to remove blackheads, especially on the nose for men.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny, and they really WORK.&lt;br /&gt;Adding</li>
            <li>These are always a go to product in skin care for quick and immediate results.</li>
            <li>But do it right and it will clean out those pores.  </li>
            <li>My nose was pretty smooth after though...</li>
            <li>loved the 14 count package so I can use long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself being able to live without it.</li>
            <li>Try it and you will be happy that you did if you have black heads around your nose area.</li>
            <li>When you pull them off, it feels great to see all the black heads on the strip.</li>
            <li>Even just gently exfoliating with my Konjac sponge first is helpful, and I get so much more on the strip than if I just do it without having exfoliated recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no more bumps or unsightly freckle like features that are in no way freckles (because if they were I may have considered them to be a rather cute and charming feature).</li>
            <li>They peel off easily and gently and leave no residue.  </li>
            <li>These really work and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used them before, they don&#x27;t unclog every single pore but you can see that they do unclog a good 80 - 90%.</li>
            <li>Im sure after using it maybe another time, the blackheads will be completely gone!</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the instructions completely and these strips will help you maintain a blackhead-free nose!</li>
            <li>best results I run a washcloth under hot water to open my pores as much as possible, hold it there for a bit.</li>
            <li>Sure my nose has less noticable pores now, but I ain&#x27;t got noboday loving on me</li>
            <li>but now my skin feels very smooth and soft,</li>
            <li>They are somewhat effective, but then leave many little things just sticking up out of my nose that I have to deal with which</li>
            <li>These strips are fantastic and I would absolutely recommend them.</li>
            <li>and WOW, I get 10x more stuff that way.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it, you will not be disapointed.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not the product that keeps them from coming back though so in my honest opinion, you can try this once</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years, and they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it was worth it.</li>
            <li>These strips seem to do more damage than good, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li>it is a useful product for my teens.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I am 53 years old and love this product.</li>
            <li>I bought these for fun, on the urging of my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fun, though I might not buy them again.</li>
            <li>I rarely get them anymore</li>
            <li>(but well worth the money).</li>
            <li>Incredibly effective treatment at that!&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves your nose slightly red, but</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not that useful.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most economical way to buy this product.</li>
            <li>Also, it leaves a white adhesive-ish kind of residue in areas that have to be rubbed or washed off.</li>
            <li>I found his product to be quite useful.</li>
            <li>and I have used three times to make my nose more clearly</li>
            <li>love using it, it may also be gross, but i enjoy taking a look afterwards to see...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>This product is fun to use though and see the results immediately.</li>
            <li>They arrived in good condition and worked as expected.</li>
            <li>Only reason I don&#x27;t give them 5 stars is they aren&#x27;t 100% effective at clearing all pores.</li>
            <li>But they are worth a shot.</li>
            <li>worth buying.. had this on subsciption</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I still say it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>But WORTH it.</li>
            <li>Kiehl&#x27;s Rare Earth</li>
            <li>YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT YOUR MONEYS WORTH.</li>
            <li>And they are fun to look at afterwards.</li>
            <li>But when they do work, they make for a fun girls night.  </li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s well worth the result.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth trying once...</li>
            <li>As an adult I don&#x27;t have as many blackheads as I used to, but this strip seems to remove them all.</li>
            <li>first time I tried the new strips, I was familiar with the easy to use instructions.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll snap shut your pores &amp; you&#x27;ll be left feeling a new kind of clean!</li>
            <li>High SPFs only control for UV B rays, and zinc oxide is the most effective and most stable of UV A blocks) religiously has helped.</li>
            <li>While most imitation brands are basically the same (i.e. Walgreens), Biore is the way to go because I find it to be the most effective.</li>
            <li>AFTER i PULL OUT SOME PRETTY GROSS YET SATISFYING DIRT OUT OF MY PORES!</li>
            <li>I usually use these after a warm shower or steaming my face, so I can be sure my pores are nice and open.</li>
            <li>not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These took the blackheads right out, but not all of them.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the acne cleansers you can name to get rid of blackheads and it didn&#x27;t work, but these would take the blackheads right out</li>
            <li>It pulls those blackheads right out of my pores.  </li>
            <li>Keep trying until you get it right.  </li>
            <li>or if I don&#x27;t use the product right.</li>
            <li>I have used it right the way I received it.</li>
            <li>I like to put these on right after I shower while my pores are still enlarged and</li>
            <li>right after.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can see the difference in your skin right away.  </li>
            <li>when I found the sale, I jumped right on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use these on a weekly basis and they clean my nose really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really have to clean your nose, like, put soap on it and lather, beforehand, for it to work, but boy, does it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pack does a good job, but often times, the sticky strip would rip as I gently remove the plastic and doesn&#x27;t dry as well as I would</li>
            <li>The strips are suitable gross after use as well.</li>
            <li>generally all around to make sure the strip sticks to every part of your nose.  </li>
            <li>I use these on a regular basis, so it was nice to be able to buy a larger pack like this.</li>
            <li>THESE BARELY TOOK ANYTHING OFF MY NOSE, MOSTLY ON THE SIDE</li>
            <li>First time using this was a success.</li>
            <li>I was really excited for these to arrive because I have a decent amount of teeny blackheads around my nose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other versions of these nifty pore strips before but this new formulation works great -- if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of tugging and dryness afterward.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well when used the right way</li>
            <li>it works wonders for people will large pores and pulls out almost 95% of grime !</li>
            <li>The strips work good, but I&#x27;d prefer them to be slightly longer, they&#x27;re 5mm shorter than I&#x27;d like them to be.</li>
            <li>I actually like this product, it is so easy to use and makes you feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>But the deep cleansing pore strips are easy to use, and you can tell they clean the pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have mild acne and scarring, but what really bothers me are the blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and a little gross but VERY satisfying.</li>
            <li>It also made my nose feel very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>With these strips you can use them right after a shower, and the results last about a week, which is okay because they&#x27;re supposed to be used weekly.</li>
            <li>the pores on his nose are large and clogged, and these clean them out real nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the nose strips, when I first used these the nose strips from my first box, they were able to pull out a whole lot of whiteheads from my nose.</li>
            <li>just like it very much ....</li>
            <li>A single strip saves me a week&#x27;s worth of scraping off my whiteheads!!!</li>
            <li>However, if you are willing to take the risk of having permanent red lines on your nose, they make your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Keeps it soft and clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>try them in the past and still think they are absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>The strip is not sticky enough and sometimes even slip off my nose, I guess a pore cleaner might doing a better job than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Biore strips work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am not surebif thid is real brand!</li>
            <li>that come off in the first use.</li>
            <li>While the Biore Pore Strips actually do work, I would advise looking into the product more.</li>
            <li>Gets the blackheads straight out!</li>
            <li>You can tell they really work!</li>
            <li>it does hurt a bit but pretty bearable.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the strip, I missed a couple spots my nose, so I cut up one of the strips &amp; used it on my nose &amp; IT</li>
            <li>This product works &amp; shipping is fast !</li>
            <li>I really liked them but they were not really helpful.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>Everything went really well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It definitely did remove more blackheads which is why I gave this 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I love these, even though it is totally gross when you use them.</li>
            <li>She now uses it on a weekly basis and when she first tried it,it removed 80% of her blackheads.</li>
            <li>I followed the steps exactly as it said.</li>
            <li>But I just resolved that issue by using another strip and covering the unreachable portion first before sticking the strip on the rest of the nose which I covered with my first strip.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The first couple strips i used pulled about a dozen or so blackheads, since, maybe 1 or 2.</li>
            <li>I remember first using these in the 90s.</li>
            <li>So much better than having them squeezed out at a facial.</li>
            <li>I could see a lot of things came out of my pores when I first used it.  </li>
            <li>They are better priced here than at my local drugstore and work just as well.  </li>
            <li>They work better than cheaper brands, and I have tried several.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m not supposed to use these on my cheek, only on my nose (as the instructions say)</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t read all of the instructions at first</li>
            <li>with this product you will see the deference from the first time.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what is says and the commercials show.</li>
            <li>These do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do: pull out stuff from the pores on your nose.</li>
            <li>When I bought the product, went home and followed the steps EXACTLY..</li>
            <li>Get your strip ready!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s obvious given the nature of the strips.&lt;br /&gt;-Little pricey, much better on Amazon than drug stores though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now my nose is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>the best effect, use warm water to rinse your nose before so the pores can open up then just rinse with cold water after the treatment they&#x27;ll close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would also recommend watching a Youtube video before you remove the first time.</li>
            <li>To look at me you wouldn&#x27;t be aware I had blackheads in this area unless you looked at a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li>I would recommend though that it should be used more than once a month as you would get the same effect as when u first used the strip</li>
            <li>and you will be glowing for next 15 days :)</li>
            <li>I used to use these all the time when Biore first brought these nose strips out</li>
            <li>Facials are certainly more luxurious, but where can you get a facial for $8.20?  </li>
            <li>A facial takes an hour or more at a salon, plus the commute.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have some facial cleanser!</li>
            <li>) Take a hot, steamy shower.</li>
            <li>reason I gave this only three stars is that the formula used to be a lot better.</li>
            <li>I follow all the directions and even always attempt to use them after I&#x27;ve taken a really hot shower and my pores should be &amp;#34;open.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used them while just dabbing some hot water on my nose.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t appear to remove any blackheads from the center of the nose, even when used promptly after a warm shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still better than nothing, but I like feeling cleaner in one go, rather than using two strips to feel ultimately clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty unbearable, yet,</li>
            <li>It really cleans out your pores, you&#x27;ll be amazed!</li>
            <li>I have been using them for years with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li>Eeeeewwww these work really well!</li>
            <li>Does not hurt much!</li>
            <li>These work pretty well.</li>
            <li>With repeated use I feel like they definitely help keep my pores more refined and prevent T- Zone breakouts.</li>
            <li>Really works wonders!</li>
            <li>Works better than any facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The strips really work - you get the proof on the strip itself every time you use it !</li>
            <li>The first strip I opened stuck to itself immediately and wouldn&#x27;t come part.</li>
            <li>And of course I occasionally pamper the boyfriend&#x27;s nose as well. :)</li>
            <li>key to this working is opening the pores up first and making sure your skin and strip are moist.  </li>
            <li>Over time I&#x27;ve been able to reduce that with biore strips, and comedone extractor and regular use of 5% Benzoyl peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I used this the first time and it did remove a bunch of blackheads from my nose</li>
            <li>I used it a couple days later hoping it would get a lot more.</li>
            <li>However, make sure you leave the strip on the entire time.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret buying it, I promise ;)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li>This removes a lot of dirt from your pores upon your first use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After use, the activated glue does leave a nose slightly red and dry, so it is a good idea to clean and moisturize after every use.</li>
            <li>I read and followed the directions exactly as written on the box.  </li>
            <li>funny movie &#x3D; lots of laughter.</li>
            <li>I really love this product because it helps remove blackheads white head or what ever dirt is hiding in your pores.</li>
            <li>when my pores have been steamed open more.</li>
            <li>have pretty oily skin and get acne in my nose and it enlarges my pores.</li>
            <li>First product that I tried.</li>
            <li>I used a nose strip for the first time today, and I have to say that they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have tried these multiple times over the years, hoping for better results each time.</li>
            <li>one star is because the strips actually cause me to break out more after using them.</li>
            <li>This is my first try, but I need a routine that includes these strips.</li>
            <li>But obviously these are more hype than anything.  </li>
            <li>The strips do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to, without any issues.</li>
            <li>It is the first time I have ever used a nose strip.</li>
            <li>I am impressed on several new factors: There is better coverage to more adequately cover the nose area, strips stick much better, and lastly there is no gooey residue that I remember being left behind on the older strips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best results are too leave it on there until its so dry it almost hurts a little when peeling off.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to feel like you&#x27;ve done a super thorough job of cleaning ALL of the skin on your face.</li>
            <li>- they were exactly what I wanted and came quickly and at a better price than I expected.</li>
            <li>One tip I would offer is to use a good exfoliator in the shower before hand then allow the strip to dry completely (15 minutes).</li>
            <li>You can see right on each strip after you use it that they&#x27;re very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So after searching continuously online for about two weeks now on this product, I finally decided to try it out since most comments and video reviews show positive results.</li>
            <li>The only way they wouldn&#x27;t be effective is if they are applied wrong or not allowed to dry, unless your skin is so perfect that your pores are clog free.</li>
            <li>seriously I never expected this works such a way, it was wonderfull works as expected, worthy Buying for a gal to keep her beauty !!!!!</li>
            <li>They also have a funky hairspray smell that might bother more sensitive people, and I would think that someone with sensitive skin would experience soreness afterwards.</li>
            <li>I like to use them shortly before cleaning my face with a good cleaner to get deep in the pores.</li>
            <li>&quot; they can be filled right back up with dirt or makeup) or cause permanent pores--huge holes in your face that never disappear!</li>
            <li>It came fast and i got to see some of the dirt in my pores the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This videos shows exactly how much can come from your nose, if you are patient.  </li>
            <li>I find that using an oil absorbing mask first helps to pull the impurities out and get the blackheads closer to the surface.  </li>
            <li>Your nose has to be wet before applying, and you must stick the smooth side to your nose - the side that is originally stuck to the plastic.</li>
            <li>At least one of us liked them!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can find Bior&amp;eacute; pore strips at pretty much any drugstore and online.</li>
            <li>When I took off the first strip I was amazed with how much gunk came off with it.</li>
            <li>Its kind of icky  looking, but your skin is clean</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s best to seek a dermatologist&#x27;s advice if you have some serious facial problems.</li>
            <li>service and packaging was decent though for standard shipping :)</li>
            <li>It seems they are all back the next day, but it sure is fun!  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend has HUGE pores on his nose with blackheads, and when i finally convinced him to use these, he ripped it off his nose and it had pulled so much out!</li>
            <li>tip which has really increased how much yucky stuff they remove is to exfoliate first.</li>
            <li>I would not do this more than once a week to start with because it is pretty rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure the strip is COMPLETELY dry before removing&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just cleanse your face first, then make sure your nose is wet, apply the nose strip, wait 15 minutes, peel the strip off, and if you&#x27;re like me, look at the strip to see what it pulled.</li>
            <li>Bior&amp;eacute; Deep Cleansing Pore Strips do the job quickly, easily and inexpensively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatives?</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores that are congested and always look clogged with blackheads.  </li>
            <li>Make certain place the tape in the correct way otherwise you may need 2 strips.</li>
            <li>I knew my pores were large there</li>
            <li>Did not stick and certainly didn&#x27;t pull any dirt out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not noticeable, but up-close, it certainly is.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the small slits, they fit like a glove and do a fantastic job at removing my blackheads!  </li>
            <li>I will try the new charcoal versions next to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>It definitely does a great job removing black heads.</li>
            <li>I bought these strips based on the great reviews, expecting it to remove a bunch of the white head and black head build up on my nose that I just can&#x27;t seem to wash away.</li>
            <li>adhesive isn&#x27;t strong enough to really pull out blackhead.</li>
            <li>Let it dry for 5 minutes and give a gentle tug-and prepared to be amazed at how many black/whiteheads you may see.  </li>
            <li>These are like magic, in fact its kinda freaky the first time you do it because you can see the stuff that came out of your pores and they stand up due to the glue.  </li>
            <li>I bought a different box (the ultra deep cleansing strips) the other day from a store to see if it was the box or something else, and it worked great, so I probably won&#x27;t be buying this particular kind in the future.</li>
            <li>Not only did it hurt like heck to take it off, but I noticed it was just as clean as it was when I first opened it.</li>
            <li>They were a little costy but totally worth it:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides  being dry-ish and sensitive-ish, my skin is largely unproblematic.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips once, a few days ago.</li>
            <li>I followed all the instructions; cleaned my face with warm water, applied a warm washcloth to my nose to help open up my pores, made sure my nose was wet enough, applied the pore strip, and waited a little over 15 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>well the next few times not so great.</li>
            <li>Thanks to amazon</li>
            <li>It really pulled stuff out of your pores.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it has helped me out much.</li>
            <li>think this product is a real hit and miss between people.</li>
            <li>And it is really fast</li>
            <li>Without too much detail....really pulls out the &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, I wash my face as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really dont use it that often.</li>
            <li>I really tried to make these work.</li>
            <li>I started out at once a week but didn&#x27;t see as much of a result.  </li>
            <li>I have whiteheads and this really gets rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>After removal jus ice the area to close the pores and it feels really fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was VERY reluctant to use it, but tonight I realized it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t very helpful</li>
            <li>It worked really well for my boyfriend who has deeper blackheads</li>
            <li>They pull so much junk from my face, even after I wash it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>- I now have three very noticeable torn capillaries on my nose and the texture of the skin on my nose</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much acne</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;ll harden so much that the sticky(now hardened) layer will stay on your nose and not on the strip itself.  </li>
            <li>If used correctly and by the directions they really do work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to get into it here, but you really should look into it.</li>
            <li>i really like these pore strips but</li>
            <li>These work VERY well.</li>
            <li>This works and works fast .</li>
            <li>It will get some although I really don&#x27;t think you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this really cleans oil/dust from pore on my nose.</li>
            <li>I give this product a 5 star because my mom really likes it.</li>
            <li>These strips have something in them that makes my whole body itch.  </li>
            <li>My nose is so much clearer now!&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to use - very quick - takes a a short 1 min to stick it on the nose and then 10 mins to dry off.</li>
            <li>and they really do remove blackheads.</li>
            <li>I just wish it wouldn&#x27;t hurt so much when I have to pull it off.</li>
            <li>It really works great.highly recommended.and</li>
            <li>That product really help me with my pores and blackheads problem</li>
            <li>They pull out so much gunk from my nose pores (yuke)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really nothing else like them on the market.</li>
            <li>remove fast</li>
            <li>I once forgot I had these on and started cleaning the house and the sweat/oil on my nose prevented the strip from working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see a link for \\&quot;Prove It!\\&quot;points where you can enter in the \\&quot;Prove It!\\&quot; codes and get coupons, free pore strips (8 ct), deep cleaning cloths, etc.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really want to melt my nose off.</li>
            <li>and you know it&#x27;s ready to be peeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it has really gotten rid of my stubborn blackheads.</li>
            <li>If the strip starts to get slimy then you&#x27;ve used too much</li>
            <li>the strips really don&#x27;t hurt to remove.</li>
            <li>These things are so much easier than sitting there for hours picking at blackheads.  </li>
            <li>there was so much stuff on it.</li>
            <li>This should be called nose strips as you can&#x27;t really use it anywhere else on your body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they get the job done and it doesnt hurt too much to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;looking</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking forward to seeing the real results after a couple uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(make sure your nose is wet all place where this is getting applied), wait for 20 mins and remove it....</li>
            <li>These really work for my face.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really working for my wife.</li>
            <li>, make sure that if your skin can dry out easily to put on some mosturizer after using the strips as they can dry out your skin a bit.</li>
            <li>but I cud really see the after effect on my darling..</li>
            <li>as soon as your nose is cleared, expect your nose to be suddenly oily as hell, now that they&#x27;re given free rein to release oil out of their cleared pores.  </li>
            <li>Gently rub this on your face in circular motions for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>The pore strips work very well</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>you wouldn&#x27;t believe how much gunk is beneath your skin!)&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>gently and thoroughly before applying the strip.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t pick up as much as I would like the strips to too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it worked so well on my husband though, I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>I had never used strips before and cheap ones or these did the same job!</li>
            <li>I use them once a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any real reduction in the amount of blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>I found this product to work very well.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>These really work for my face.</li>
            <li>but when I do I&#x27;m always amazed and grossed out, haha.</li>
            <li>Your skin must be thoroughly moistened  for it to really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like junkie stuff sticking straight up, like it literally pulls stuff straight out of the pores.</li>
            <li>you just have to really wash your nose</li>
            <li>They really get everything out, you can see it on the strip.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know I had so much hahaha.</li>
            <li>and you know you&#x27;re ready to excavate.</li>
            <li>I tried using it after shower, after steam-toweling my face, and nothing seems to really help.</li>
            <li>I used up the whole pack without getting any real results.</li>
            <li>or I wasn&#x27;t paying so much.</li>
            <li>THEY WILL MAKE A WHOLE MASK.</li>
            <li>REALLY WITHOUT EFFORT REMOVES &amp;#34;EVERYTHING&amp;#34; ON YOUR FACE THAT SHOULDNT BE IN/OR ON YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li>I like it very much,because it is very suited for me.</li>
            <li>If you remove before the strip has hardened too much, removal should be painless.  </li>
            <li>No one wants clogged pores or visible blackheads on their nose.</li>
            <li>I didnt find this product to work very well for me.</li>
            <li>The strips break after I gently pull them</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it did pull out some oil and dirt in my blackheads, it wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>AND THEY REALLY WORK.</li>
            <li>These really don&#x27;t work *</li>
            <li>Biore strips work well if your nose pores are really clogged.</li>
            <li>If your pores aren&#x27;t really clogged up, the strips don&#x27;t do very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But Elmer&#x27;s works just as well and is much cheaper over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not been getting as many large acne spots on my nose since using this product either (that may have been due to the clogged pores I used to have).</li>
            <li>And even though they remove gunk from your nose, it&#x27;s not clear to me that a dry bumpy nose is any better looking than a smooth oily nose.</li>
            <li>These strips pull those babies right out - but be warned, it might take a few weeks to get the most stubborn ones out of their homes.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they leave a white residue on my skin and is hard to remove even with warm water and vigorous scrubbing... Have not been able to find another decent brand</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is decently priced, works very well, and I will certainly recommend this to anyone who has an issue with blackheads on their nose.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time and it was a new experience for me,  </li>
            <li>so my pores get clogged and this will clear them right out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These strips are easy to use, and as long as you -follow the directions-, you shouldn&#x27;t be having any problems.</li>
            <li>I take pretty good care of my skin, but I do like to occasionally use these pore strips as a supplement to my regular facial care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it and my vote is to they invent a more economic box with at least 100 strips inside!</li>
            <li>I give it a 5 star because it worked a lot better than the other brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>These work better than any other strip I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>i tried to other brands but none works as better as this.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other method known to mankind for blackheads and cleaning pores.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are prone to clogged pores on your nose and have those particularly large pimples in this area now and then.</li>
            <li>Not a frequent user, but this stuff works fine.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be clean and your pores will be open.  </li>
            <li>Sorta disappointed because there were so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>but it will not be a deep clean.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t necessarily healthy to be ripping the natural oils and skin cells; in fact, it may, in the long run, cause pores to become clogged (because once they are \\&quot;unclogged,\\</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend with huge pores whose blackheads come out easily by squeezing had hardly anything on the strip.</li>
            <li>After which, if you&#x27;re a person of normal inquisitiveness, you spend a quality minute starting at the remarkable collection of gunk that had, only moments before, been quietly occupying your rhinal</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaving the ad copy aside, this is a bit of cloth with a special glue on it that literally rips tiny stalagmites of gunk out of your pores.</li>
            <li>Taking it off, however much you wet the strip will hurt, so I rip it off very quickly.</li>
            <li>the issue is already fixed and these strips do nothing more than dry  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly gross and so satisfying at the same time to look at how much is pulled out of your skin when you peel these off.</li>
            <li>Cool and gross.</li>
            <li>And the simple fact is it is so cool when you pull off the strip, you just cannot look away.</li>
            <li>Sit somewhere cool, put a fan on your face, or just hang out and do something quiet while it dries -</li>
            <li>After following the instructions to the letter, it did get a few cleared out, but a light squeeze would get more out.</li>
            <li>Wow after first use it took almost all dirt from my nose pores.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just not bad enough to have a reason to use them?  </li>
            <li>Not everyone has a dainty little nose, so one size does not fit all.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to remember about these strips is that when removing, remove very, VERY slowly.</li>
            <li>Nothing too new or different, will clean out some pores.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that these strips do a better job at removing black heads around my nose than some estheticians do.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d be able to see all the black gunk on the strip.</li>
            <li>I used one and so many black heads came out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if maybe I do not have many black heads</li>
            <li>They unclogged a couple small pores but mostly just removed all of the fine facial hair that was under the strip.</li>
            <li>and I have found that his nose pores are looking better and less</li>
            <li>These strips are okay, They do work and get our black heads</li>
            <li>I think removing the dead skin cells really helps these be able to grab what is in the pores.</li>
            <li>i used them exactly as i had the first time i used them but still having the issue of it not doing its total job.</li>
            <li>This has been my main nose pore strip since I was a teenager</li>
            <li>The last time I used them (and had my son and husband use them since they do have oily skin), they worked super well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have big pores but my nose is super prone to blackheads, so I use one every week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a different brand of nose strips (which actually works better than this one) for about 2-3 weeks already and when I tried this on, I didn&#x27;t see a lot of &#x27;things&#x27; coming out with it.</li>
            <li>I am more obsessed than most when it comes to removing blackheads and unclogging pores.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I feel like they aren&#x27;t as satisfying if you use them regularly, or if you regularly use another pore-cleansing product (like a clay mask).</li>
            <li>When it does come down to beauty, we often are looking for the best product to get rid of lifes, little facial escapes.</li>
            <li>My only minor quibble is that it&#x27;s usually a good idea to rewash your face, as sticky residue is sometimes left on your skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to do it again right away, but the packaging says only once every three days &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I had high expectations for this item</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this, you will see the difference.</li>
            <li>Zero blackheads taken out dont understand why reviews are so high at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a blackhead sufferer since high school</li>
            <li>I have used Biore strips since I was in high school.</li>
            <li>I mean the fact that you can actually see all the nastiness that comes out is kind of cool.</li>
            <li>This product is not so great for really deep black heads which is why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>People with more sensitive skin may have other results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I find that it sticks better, and that way I can wash after because when you pull the strip off it does leave a little residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get a grossly satisfying amount of little dots of gunk all over the pore strips after I remove them.  </li>
            <li>Wish that they came closer to the tip of my nose a little more</li>
            <li>Some of the comments made about drying out your skin is true, but since I have oily skin, I&#x27;m not very sensitive to dryness.</li>
            <li>It only kinda works as advertised but it doesn&#x27;t get my nose really clean and clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so conscious of keeping my face clean, especially my nose.</li>
            <li>BUT before that I was still using them and my nose is about 98% clear haha.</li>
            <li>BUT before that I was still using them and my nose is about 98% clear haha.</li>
            <li>So I washed my face, wet my nose, applied the smooth side on my nose, and waited 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how much it hurt when I pulled it off.</li>
            <li>I have spend so much so far in saloons trying getting steam and bearing so much paid and shedding tears to get these out</li>
            <li>did try it, and I am surprised, worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Always interesting to see what&#x27;s trapped in your skin.</li>
            <li>but they are worth it if you cant or dont want to simply pinch your nose.</li>
            <li>I kind of cheat and leave it on for at least 20min</li>
            <li>I will have to repeat the treatment a few more times to get the &amp;#34;strawberry&amp;#34; out of my nose</li>
            <li>It scares my wife a bit when I show her the white strips so it is a fun product as well.</li>
            <li>Use the cotton round to dab some more of the baking soda mixture onto your nose</li>
            <li>It does good at removing small ones, especially on the sides of the nose, but doesn&#x27;t remove all of them.</li>
            <li>Overall, worth trying out.</li>
            <li>It does a better job of cleaning out there pores as compared to just washing my face everyday.</li>
            <li>It cleaned out a few pores, mostly along the side of the nose.</li>
            <li>They mostly work well, but in both cases I&#x27;ve had a few strips that, when I pull them off after 10 minutes, some of the &#x27;glue&#x27;or whatever the sticky stuff is that is supposed to pull the gunk out, disconnects from the strip and stays on my nose, meaning that all the gunk stays too, and I have to scrub to get the &#x27;glue&#x27;off.</li>
            <li>You do see the sebum that gets extracted but sadly it doesn&#x27;t always get that one huge one that you feel is super noticeable on the nose but is able to lift out the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>And you&#x27;re going to think I&#x27;m super weird, but seeing the results on the strip kind of excites me...</li>
            <li>My nose just isn&#x27;t the right shape and the entire thing comes out as an air bubble.</li>
            <li>I use them right before I do any deep cleaning of my face, and to my mind, I&#x27;d never be without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m gonna do it right after a shower</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m actually considering getting a nose piercing right on that spot...</li>
            <li>Every single time I use these I am both repulsed and grateful when I gaze upon the strip full of a forest of ick.</li>
            <li>They were shipped from New York on the 25th and arrived today, Aug. 27th in California.</li>
            <li>If you were looking for something that looked new, this would not be your choice.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without them.  </li>
            <li>Press down firmly and smooth it out to make sure there are no air bubbles.</li>
            <li>It worked no better than trying to make your own porestrip out of elmer&#x27;s glue (which is also ineffective).The skin on my nose didn&#x27;t even feel significantly softer or smoother, in fact it itches a little now even though I rinsed off any remaining residue and applied</li>
            <li>I usually use these right after taking a shower when my pores are probably most open.  </li>
            <li>Unless the last few uses do something amazing.</li>
            <li>We had bought a similar type product a few years ago and had amazing results, however, I couldn&#x27;t remember what brand it was</li>
            <li>I, in particular, get a lot of adult acne</li>
            <li>An old classic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s painful but much more effective.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your face is wet before you put the strip on, leave it on about ten minutes, rip it off like a band-aid, and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t remove everything but no other product really comes close.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought these, I expected them to be like every other product that claimed to magically remove blackheads.</li>
            <li>For me personally I think it has helped because I had developed very large blocked pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li>results of these cleansing strips are both amazing and appalling.</li>
            <li>and you think you have clear skin and then see all the gunk come out!</li>
            <li>My eyes started to water and my nose was pretty red.</li>
            <li>I wish the strip was bigger to cover the whole tip of your nose thats why I gave it 4 stars!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get them all out on the first attempt, but you can totally see the results.</li>
            <li>I tried using hot water on my nose before applying to open my pores, but that didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was because there was no more &#x27;things&#x27; to remove, or this product doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>Wish I could get the same result when I first used these strips.</li>
            <li>I have tried small ethnic supermarket pore strips which don&#x27;t ever extract as many as the Biore does.</li>
            <li>However, if you have sensitive skin I would stick to the instructions!</li>
            <li>These nose strips did not work very well for me as I have really stubborn blackheads, but I have found that following these steps will completely amaze or disgust (maybe both)</li>
            <li>Funny thing is the only place they don&#x27;t work for me is my nose.</li>
            <li>It was actually pretty gross, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.</li>
            <li>I used some strips from the 99p store and they did exactly the same as these.</li>
            <li>They probably could use my strip as an advertisement and to be truthful, most users will get a small perverse pleasure from seeing all the dirt and oil formed in small stalactite formation.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly the same.</li>
            <li>You can actually see them working after first use.</li>
            <li>It was pretty gross seeing all that on the strip after, but a bit of relief knowing it was out of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dude,  have pretty big pores on my nose I suppose.  </li>
            <li>recommend it right after you&#x27;ve washed your face, splash a little extra water on and then smooth the strip out</li>
            <li>My pores looked cleaner and there was a definite removal of gunk, but I feel like they didn&#x27;t remove as much as they did on the older version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately the redness has gone down</li>
            <li>Other pore cleansing lotions say they clean your skin, but you have to just believe it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands that I found worse and one that I found better, but have not been able to find in the USA (Nivea).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>and I had a huge black head on my cheek that just would not go away.</li>
            <li>this one first to clean you face and remove all the makeup then wash your face with hot water and dry it then wet your nose and use the biore deep cleansing pore strip.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe it was a one time thing, so I tried again, and once again, blackheads and trapped dirt were easily removed--this time</li>
            <li>I did everything I could think of to assist the strips in unclogging my pores: I used them directly after taking lengthy, hot showers, steamed my face beforehand, and even compressed a damp, steamed hand towel on my face for about 10 minutes prior to using them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I typically only write positive reviews but felt the need to share my experience with the Biore Pore Strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, but I&#x27;ve found that it only really cleans the pores that aren&#x27;t deep.</li>
            <li>I swear the other reviews are full of it.</li>
            <li>Get your nose wet, and with dry hands, place the strip on your nose, covering the area where most of the problem blackheads are.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t waste your money and get a good cleanser, they remove some black points but after 10&#x27; you can see them again.</li>
            <li>pretty much overflow with gunk if I don&#x27;t exfoliate every other day, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely for people with large pores and T-Zone issues.</li>
            <li>i dont have large pores and my blackeheads are usually deep set !</li>
            <li>Pulls the large plugs of gunk out, but still leaves some smaller bits.</li>
            <li>I have a blackhead issue from time to time and these certainly pull out some gross stuff.</li>
            <li>I looked at the strip and while there was some stuff there, looking at my nose, it only seemed to remove about 50% of the stuff, which I had to manually remove by the age-old pressing and squeezing a certain way.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, the strip came off painlessly, just a little tug on the skin.  </li>
            <li>If the size is little bigger it will be better.</li>
            <li>I love looking at all the tiny little white/blackheads that come off on it.  </li>
            <li>Although I was hoping that it would also help remove some of the annoyingly persistent flakes that appear on my nose, I was still happy that the strip did exactly what it was supposed to do, and pulled out a decent amount of blackheads.</li>
            <li>but I hardly have time for that any more.</li>
            <li>Leaves your pores clear</li>
            <li>They help keep my face clear and prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s clear when you look at the strip afterwards.</li>
            <li>Make sure your face is wet, but don&#x27;t overly wet the strip.</li>
            <li>When viewed through magnification, those specks on the strips are clearly blackheads.  </li>
            <li>The strips won&#x27;t clear every pore</li>
            <li>I think I will just squirm for awhile, and have a clear nose.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly clear complexion with the exception of my  nose.</li>
            <li>I started using Biore strips once a week to clear the blackheads out of my pores.</li>
            <li>Over time, I stopped getting blackheads but still use these strips to clear the whiteheads out of my nose.</li>
            <li>I got these hoping it would clear my pores a bit or just help reduce any breakouts or oil buildup.  </li>
            <li>I noticed I was having some blackheads on my nose, so I bought these hoping to clear it up.</li>
            <li>It really does pull out white and lback heads.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the forehead strips, I don&#x27;t think they work for much of anything than pulling your eyebrows out.</li>
            <li>but I just really started to notice them recently.</li>
            <li>They leave the skin on your nose sensitive and feeling like it&#x27;s sunburnt.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the strip pulled them out.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that these Biore strips would be the thing that drastically reduces the appearance of my pores, but no such luck.</li>
            <li>The whole process took only 4 days.</li>
            <li>However, use caution if you have sensitive skin or are prone to spider veins.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem as well made as the old noise strips.  </li>
            <li>I had to fight the urge to extract them myself because the box says your skin may be sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li>I follow the directions completely and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
            <li>Probably you will need to have a whole lot of blackheads and whiteheads on your nose for the nose strip to actually pull anything  out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them since the early 90&#x27;s when they were given away in promotional gift bags my freshmen year of college.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old batch or what, but they weren&#x27;t sticky and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My nose is very oily and the pores always open up.</li>
            <li>Now the effectiveness can be up for debate, but I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wow that was drastic change.</li>
            <li>have I really learned how to use them properly.</li>
            <li>They are gross but it really helped me learn to remove the strips</li>
            <li>Bought it after my lady recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised as the product exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I decided to get this after I was beginning to become bothered by cleaning the pores with my fingers because they were definitely noticeable when you got real</li>
            <li>followed the instructions and before peeling it off, it was almost as though you could actually see the strip sucked into the pores ready to pull stuff out.  </li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin I can see where this would cause problems.  </li>
            <li>(Skip this step if you have extremely sensitive or damaged skin.)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well now as it used to.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in my early 20s now)</li>
            <li>Nearly nothing.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve used the nose ones for my upper cheeks and it really hurts to take them off there.</li>
            <li>If you wash your face regularly with something that can scrub and not just hands, this won&#x27;t do much for you.</li>
            <li>My skin gets really irritated and red after having to scrub the glue off.  </li>
            <li>I already have one on the side of my nose that won&#x27;t fill up naturally; I always have to fill it in with concealer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They also leave my nose a tad sensitive, and leave a residue on my nose that I have to wash off afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far I have tried 3 of them</li>
            <li>Pretty long term results.</li>
            <li>Far from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I decided to try them again as an adult</li>
            <li>I used them and and wow talk about gunk.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not sure 100% of these really help that much in the long run, it sure does give instant satisfaction.</li>
            <li>However, I have noticed that when I got to use the strips a few days later, my pore are even more clogged.</li>
            <li>And yes, I put them on properly, but as stated I will try a few more times.  </li>
            <li>Just catching sight of my nose now makes me feel slightly nauseated now, and of course that has been no help to the compulsions.</li>
            <li>It works better if you use these after a shower and when you peel them off really slowly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re expensive, but I get good results with them.</li>
            <li>A little strange to use the first time, and looks kind of icky when you pull it off - it clears the pores out and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how much stuff is on your face!</li>
            <li>I have very large pores on my nose and expected a lot of junk on the strip when I removed it.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s any residue left on your skin, which sometimes happens if your skin is too wet, then that same hot wash cloth will take it right</li>
            <li>However, my pores aren&#x27;t \\&quot;minimized\\&quot; - they&#x27;re mostly left as gaping, empty holes once the plugs of gunk are removed, so I then wash with warm water and facial wash, dry my face, then apply a BHA liquid.  </li>
            <li>Especially since I sure don&#x27;t have any hair on my nose -- nor was all that black &#x27;dirt&#x27; visible to my naked eye!</li>
            <li>They left my nose a bit red but took out about 50% of my blackheads on the first shot.</li>
            <li>I really love how these things work; however, because my pores are so enlarged, I usually have to use an extractor tool following application.  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t already used to this, I&#x27;d say go the other route and get a pore cleansing mask or lotion or some other product that works better.</li>
            <li>well nad make me feel pretty even if I still look (relatively) the same</li>
            <li>These work the exact same as the ones I&#x27;ve always bought at the local store.</li>
            <li>I took a shower first to open my pores, and then i left the strip on for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Even if you feel the strip is dry wait a little longer as it works better this way.</li>
            <li>Besides, it&#x27;s really cool to see all those little &amp;#34;porcupine&amp;#34; like pieces stuck to the strip.</li>
            <li>and then do the strips twice in a row, one right after the other.</li>
            <li>The instructions are very simple and it only takes a few minutes to rid your nose of hard to remove dirt which embeds in pores and gives a really nice clean feeling afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT NOT DOWN THE BRIGDE</li>
            <li>advantage of the strips, though, is that they dry faster :) I seem to have a heavy hand with the glue.</li>
            <li>actually work; if you apply them correctly (make sure your face is wet; simply getting it damp isn&#x27;t enough to make them stick properly, in my experience, and then press the strip down, paying special attention to anywhere</li>
            <li>I used Biore strips as a teenager, but felt they never cleaned as well as a normal cleanser and weekly facial mask, so I stopped using them.  </li>
            <li>First, throughly wet the area you want to remove blackheads from and apply the strip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are ultra (super strength) versions of this in the light green box which I usually use but these seem to work maybe 90% as well.  </li>
            <li>It should really be bone dry and feel like it&#x27;s tightening your skin before you rip it off.</li>
            <li>These cleansing strips really work and leave you with the instant satisfaction of removing and discarding these facial imperfections.</li>
            <li>I think the key to removing the most blackheads is to pull it off extremely slowly.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s much easier than using tweezers to get every single blackhead.</li>
            <li>Other than that, does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have figured this tip out in my teens, but better late than never!</li>
            <li>I just wish they&#x27;d go back to the old \\&quot;recipe\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>It actually arrived 2-3 days early !</li>
            <li>Simply wet your entire face until it slides right off.</li>
            <li>Every time I have used this batch, and yes I use them correctly, right after a steamy shower, I wet my nose and leave it on until it dries, almost all my blackheads are left on my face.</li>
            <li>If I apply the whole thing I seem to have loose edges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, it gives that little extra help for clean, refined pores.</li>
            <li>GF complained about my pores and told me to use them and honestly, works extremely well.  </li>
            <li>I wish this was a little cheaper, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really worth $1</li>
            <li>They were a little costly but totally worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d accept less packaging and more product, or less packaging and lower price.</li>
            <li>These strips truly clean the pores on your nose and remove everything on them as deep down as is possible.</li>
            <li>My nose has always been a problem when it comes to blackheads &amp; general gunk getting caught in them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend them for anyone looking for clear pores.</li>
            <li>These strips barely work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a blackhead problem on my nose since I was a teen (I am 33 years old).</li>
            <li>The pain of peeling this strip off the soft skin around my nose made my eyes water, but the pain didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Recommend it for anyone who is conscious about their personal hygiene, women and men.</li>
            <li>I only used one so far.</li>
            <li>Twist it softly so the slits open up, allowing optimal placement on your nose.</li>
            <li>You do have to get your face really wet in order for them to really stick.</li>
            <li>Thus far though, they have only been &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try these a few more times to see how they work in future tries.  </li>
            <li>Someday I will find the magic secret that allows me to utilize the strip to</li>
            <li>/&gt;It got a few blackheads, but nothing worth paying for (maybe 4-5 blackheads came out).</li>
            <li>Get the strip a little wet, smooth it on your nose, let it dry, then gently peel off.</li>
            <li>These little strips rip the clog right out of your pores.</li>
            <li>I am surprised about multiple things, the first being other people&#x27;s comments!</li>
            <li>It only covers the top whether your nose is big or small!</li>
            <li>However after using them for a while didn&#x27;t see much improvement as far as blackheads being any less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have seen many people post pictures of a strip riddled with black heads while I just had a few.</li>
            <li>I know it sounds gross and improper to talk about but half of the fun of these strips is seeing what is on the strip once you&#x27;re done with it.</li>
            <li>You may have to experiment a few times to get the right amount of water on your skin before applying.  </li>
            <li>I tried every possible instruction, and each time was the same: a few pores were clean.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a product for the black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li>The second strip went on fine, it got hard after 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>I also use a bentonite clay mask once a week before using the pore strips to help bring blackheads and impurities to the surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using these pore strips, my skin has felt much cleaner and the appearance of blackheads and other visible impurities has diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so these strips don&#x27;t really feel like anything to me other than maybe peeling tape off my face.</li>
            <li>Also, you really can&#x27;t use the strips for other parts of your face, unlike with the mask.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d like to clean, and stick this on for about 10 minutes until the strip gets hard (like paper mache).  </li>
            <li>My skin is not that sensitive so it can take the harsh abrasive baking soda, but if your skin is fragile, just use the strips by itself first.</li>
            <li>I do find it is easy to overdo it with the strips as they can be a little bit harsh on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But for a casual person who just wants their nose to look a little better, I highly recommend these. &#x27;</li>
            <li>I filled the directions very closely and it failed to work.</li>
            <li>Ten to 15 minutes later, you&#x27;re finished, and your skin is clear and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin be careful of what you put on your skin after using this or stay away completely.  </li>
            <li>Also, like others have mentioned DO NOT use these strips if you have very sensitive, sunburned or dry skin.</li>
            <li>Also, like others have mentioned DO NOT use these strips if you have very sensitive, sunburned or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I must not have been doing something right because it worked like a dream, a few left</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t work very well if you wet with too much or too little water.  </li>
            <li>but I think if you limit to once a week and remove the strip very very slowly, you not only get better results but prevent ripping your pores larger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done, my blackheads are slightly less prominent, but I only have a few of those gross yellowy dots on the strip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing the product was changed because the old strips were harsher on sensitive skin, but they also worked extremely well.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other pore strips and keep going back to these as they work very well.</li>
            <li>Not sure what to expect when buying this, but figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Just need to make sure that the strip isn&#x27;t on for too long or else its very hard to pull off and can take some skin with it.</li>
            <li>I wish I had been more careful and took the warning seriously.</li>
            <li>I usually go exactly 10 minutes and when I peel, I do it very slowly and take as much time as I can.  </li>
            <li>After I use a strip, I rinse my nose off, use a towel to dab it dry, and put some [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post</li>
            <li>You have to let them dry completely.</li>
            <li>They work and I see the black heads coming out on the strips, I have really oily skin around my noise</li>
            <li>I think I received an old package from an Amazon seller because the strips we received were completely dry</li>
            <li>It definitely seem to help to leave it on the full 15 minutes at least.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that this doesn&#x27;t come in a full face mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these strips on and off for the past few years and have been immensely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You wash the skin, wet it down, dry your hands, then peel one of the white strips off its backing and smooth it onto the nose</li>
            <li>The directions do say to wet your nose first, and I definitely found that if my face is just damp they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as when my face is dripping wet.</li>
            <li>It worked a little, but not as much as some video&#x27;s online or like some people&#x27;s pictures.</li>
            <li>Pulling them off hurts a little, but not too much.</li>
            <li>They do remove a little bit of gunk from my pores, but not as much as I had hoped.</li>

            <li> Very satisfying when you remove them blackheads.</li>

            <li> Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions as stated on the packaging, you will be very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The best way to do this is to put this strip on your nose right after shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love being able to buy it in bulk on Amazon, and for a very fair price.</li>
            <li> Does just what is says it will do- more people should use these!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these strips!</li>
            <li> I wished it took out all of them, but I still believe that it works pretty great because of the price!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS THING!</li>
            <li> After using this for the first time tonight and seeing what was pulled out on the strip i am very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m quite impressed with the difference even after first use.</li>
            <li> I just wish my son would use it more!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Buying for years, one of the best product invented really!</li>
            <li> Love these things!  </li>
            <li> I love this brand!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Do more research!</li>
            <li> for the effectiveness of the strip itself, it&#x27;s pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to hear if it helps for you, so please let me know!</li>
            <li> I love this brand!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love biore!?</li>
            <li> For the most part it works!</li>
            <li> and it sometimes leaves my skin oily, but it gets rid of most!</li>
            <li> I love knowing that I can get all that junk OUT of my pores!</li>
            <li> I love Biore strips!</li>
            <li> love the face wash too!</li>
            <li> i LOVE THESE STRIPS!</li>
            <li> I love Biore pore strips!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective, just need water and maybe some soap to wash your face afterwards.</li>
            <li> but it did the job amazingly for him.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite amazing</li>
            <li> ...this is amazing....</li>
            <li> Who ever came up with this is amazing because this product works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These work amazing.</li>
            <li> The lat time I bought them before this time was probably 5 years ago and at that time they worked amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and effective.</li>
            <li> and I knew they were amazing</li>
            <li> For Biore&#x27;, they have delivered very well at getting rid of our blackheads from our face, and that has continued to show with their Picture Perfect Pore Strips.</li>
            <li> Do not put this on after any kind of skin treatment (ex. tca peel, needle..etc.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve used anything else to remove blackheads that has been as effective as this, but it still does a lot of the work.</li>
            <li> I can honestly report that this did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> If you are getting ready for a party and are looking for a perfect makeup you should use this one before.</li>
            <li> The best method to maximize how much these strips remove from my pores is this: 1) apply Queen Helene mint julep mask to nose for fifteen minutes; 2) rinse with some face wash; and 3) apply the pore strip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice thing to do once a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the awesome price, this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> You will notice howo effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this for a while now, and it&#x27;s a nice treat since the strips are a bit pricey</li>
            <li> The Biore site is nice because they don&#x27;t post a bunch of stuff on your stream or your friends stream when you enter in your points or &#x27;like&#x27; their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will notice how effective they are immediately after you take them off.</li>
            <li> Take a warm shower for 15-20 minutes to loosen your pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fill a bowl with warm water and baking soda: about two parts water and one part baking soda.</li>
            <li> Biore Pore Strips are really effective at removing the gunk on your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it sure gets a bunch and its great being able to see the results and stuff</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t honestly know how well they worked or if they even worked at all.</li>
            <li> to use &amp; quite effective.</li>
            <li> The amount of pulled pore debris is astounding, to say the least.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice product</li>
            <li> /&gt;-take a warm shower</li>
            <li> These are a nice solution for in between facials.</li>
            <li> I also think their Biore face wash is effective.</li>
            <li> i have always liked these strips.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why the Biore pore strips are so handy.</li>
            <li> After reading the description and reviews I was thrilled and looked forward to a miracle.</li>
            <li> - I think I have blackheads on my cheeks too, and it would be nice if they would make strips for that too.</li>
            <li> Thanks for send the product, excellent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good, the cost is better than drugstore pricing.</li>
            <li> You can really see the dirt that accumulates and shows up on the used strip - does a great job and makes his nose look great.</li>
            <li> Great product for keeping your pores clean.</li>
            <li> These work great to make the surface of pores look clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving these a high rating, though, because they&#x27;re the best product out there for removing blackheads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- reputable brand and very rewarding to use when you get the white/blackheads out.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I love these strips because they&#x27;re so easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li> Is perfect love it much</li>
            <li> only works best when you keep up a good skincare routine</li>
            <li> The more &amp;#34;spiky&amp;#34; the pore strip looks, the better!</li>
            <li> These strips are the best and easiest thing ever to clear clogged pores on your nose!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly pleased at how these nose strips effectively removed my stubborn blackheads.</li>
            <li> It is brilliant and really cleans out the pores.</li>
            <li> Clearly, the Bior&amp;eacute; Strips are the best</li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely but did not have good results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it was this easy!</li>
            <li> What I especially liked was the large size box available at this website.</li>
            <li> I use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save to ensure I always have a good supply and a better price with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I remember using these strips when they first came out over 10 years ago, and they worked great-</li>
            <li> Works great if you follow the directs exactly.</li>
            <li> You may not like what you find but these are great and do the job well, you dont have to keep it on for the full 15, 10 is fine.</li>
            <li> They work but not as easy or effective as the ponds strips</li>
            <li> i love using biore strips, if you use them twice a week your pores will be flawless and clean :) i haven&#x27;t really had a problem with acne or pimples</li>
            <li> It got rid of the huge blackhead (like I was hoping) and then some!</li>
            <li> After using the strips twice his nose was blackhead free!</li>
            <li> I have not been able to get rid of them no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> I now feel so confident about my appearance.</li>
            <li> The supermarket ones were better.</li>
            <li> It wont pull all, but most will come out</li>
            <li> Biore strips have always worked for me to remove most (not all) of the blackheads, if I remember to use them 2x a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Examine it closely, and you&#x27;re sure to see a bunch of junk that it sucked out of your pores.</li>
            <li> Some days work better than others</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove many blackheads, but some.</li>
            <li> It works for me, it cleans my nose pores better than any cream.</li>
            <li> The technology has improved so you get better results without skinning your nose.</li>
            <li> Before that, all the cleansers and whatnot I used (for acne) didn&#x27;t get rid of the blackheads, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it were blackheads or</li>
            <li> But my nose is much more clearer and it isn&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They work, but I still feel like there is a better product for my nose..</li>
            <li> It seems to be able to pull out the deeper pores.  </li>
            <li> I wish it would be able to remove 100% of the blackheads and dirt in my pores for my nose area</li>
            <li> A konjac sponge works better for me.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I love these strips.</li>
            <li> Make sure you press in the corners of your nose and</li>
            <li> really enjoy this product!  </li>
            <li> I got to the top of my nose, the pain was gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nose looks 100% better than before, even with some blackheads remaining.</li>
            <li> According to the box, it is not advisable to use these strips more often than every 3 days, so I will need to wait until I can try again to remove the rest of the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I do one strip every week which I think is probably the most you should do.</li>
            <li> more words are required to count as a review.</li>
            <li> There is something oddly satisfying about peeling off one of these pore strips and squinting to see all of the grime that it has pulled out.</li>
            <li> I love seeing all the jun that comes off my nose after I take it off.</li>
            <li> and I love how well they work.  </li>
            <li> When I bought it I thought I was throwing away my money, but decided to give it a try anyway and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Anyway, she says I look better, so who am I to doubt?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured with all the hype of this brand that it&#x27;d be fantastic!</li>
            <li> Scrubs work much better.</li>
            <li> I love using them</li>
            <li> They work ok at cleaning out pores but it felt like I was ripping my nose off when I took it off.</li>
            <li> I love them, but when they pull out the metal extractor &amp; go for my nose, I want to cry.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE these products....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to return my skin to the way it was before I used these.</li>
            <li> You have to use many times (as it says, once a week) to achieve what you want.</li>
            <li> Okay, so... I have a confession to make.</li>
            <li> sure, It washes off, but</li>
            <li> Duct tape would work better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like anything is cleaner or noticeably better off after use.</li>
            <li> Now, everything is more manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> For better result by the Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, from the link below,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works, but scrub and tone control face wash works a lot better.</li>
            <li> What can I say, this is as far as I know the best pore strip available.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply lots of water to the area before putting them on, otherwise they won&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li> It helps if you wash your face to remove oil or make up so that the pore strips will stick better.</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply lots of water to the area before putting them on, otherwise they won&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> The Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips (nose strips) are now a permanent part of my weekly routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> With too many coupons n low price always best place to buy</li>
            <li> Well these things do work, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> My tongue is nice and smooth but now I can&#x27;t taste anything at all.</li>
            <li> I guarantee these tips will give you better results.</li>
            <li> Works better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Helped me to have a better skin on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> more pain when cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li> I would say it works ok, but don&#x27;t expect it to remove all your blackheads.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> These get rid of whiteheads about 80% of the time and blackheads at most 50% of the time.</li>
            <li> I use the strips mostly on my chin and forehead.</li>
            <li> I think more than once or twice a month would just be too abrasive to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think more than once or twice a month would just be too abrasive to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it might have worked better there than it did on my nose</li>
            <li> Press in place and make sure the strip adheres thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Turns out I had more gunk in my pores than my boyfriend, quite shameful</li>
            <li> forward to buying more</li>
            <li> No product works better at getting junk out of my pores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> but no luck...this product is like a magic...</li>
            <li> :D&lt;br /&gt;make sure to tone ur skin after use with ice or toner</li>
            <li> Still, there aren&#x27;t many products out there that are better.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> And be glad that your face is now cleaner because you used the Biore nose</li>
            <li> I had that many blackheads on my nose until I saw it on the peel.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> Allow me to elaborate: you know those pre-cut slits that allow the strip to flex and adjust to your nose?  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure to remove all of your makeup before or during your shower.</li>
            <li> I think all women love this product.</li>
            <li> Even took a picture of last - rather impressive - haul of blackhead removal with these strips.</li>
            <li> My daughters love these.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I still have just as many.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting the 14 ct for about $1 more than the 8 ct.</li>
            <li> He has many blackheads on his head and this thing performed miracles sucking them all out.</li>
            <li> The stuff pulls off most of them in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> These are just okay.</li>
            <li> But, it is better than anything else I have come across in the market.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks my nose started to look a lot better than it has probably ever.</li>
            <li> After a month I tried once more squeezing the pores with a fingernail and in 30 seconds remove two times what a strip does.</li>
            <li> Do not use more than recommended as it does take a layer of skin off.  </li>
            <li> :) I always refer people with face problems,</li>
            <li> It will pull out more blackheads this way than if you used the strip alone.</li>
            <li> OK, it&#x27;s basically a hi-tech piece of tape for your face.  </li>
            <li> So, I have many blackheads on my nose, I can press them and get the gunk out</li>
            <li> really love this pore strip.</li>
            <li> To be the most effective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sometimes makes them even more visible</li>
            <li> So glad I got these</li>
            <li> These are okay.</li>
            <li> The wetter you got your face, the better it will stick and the more that will come off.</li>
            <li> Does the job, mostly.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> face masks work better</li>
            <li> it may work better for your application.</li>
            <li> I love these pore strips.</li>
            <li> I love these Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips are the best</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re much more</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these biore strips.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve grown to love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the product, works well, but when my package came the box was damaged.</li>
            <li> I love seeing all the junk that these things pull out of my pores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found nothing better.  </li>
            <li> Add Biore Strips to your cleansing regime too if you want to be sure you&#x27;re getting EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, works for some blackheads</li>
            <li> wish it worked better.</li>
            <li> Post examination of grime removed is oddly satisfying.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> I thought if I start using all these girly products that I would magically just get prettier, and it&#x27;s been like 4 months</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> : Be sure to wash you face with a exfoliator BEFORE you use this Strips...get one just as &amp;#34;Garnier Exfoliator with micro beads &amp; Jojoba&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it removed a bit more.</li>
            <li> I love biore strips.</li>
            <li> I think its safe to say, I&#x27;d never buy or use these strips ever again.</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t any better than the ones I get from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  </li>
            <li> Terrific, love the charcoal ones now that those are out!!!!</li>
            <li> They work most of the time.</li>
            <li> I used it on my nose about 5 times, and each time it does withdraw blackheads but not at the rate or percentage i would love it too.</li>
            <li> But they WILL get out studdborn blackheads better than squeezing.</li>
            <li> moments.&amp;#34; More like, &amp;#34;Aw, ok.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Use a warm bar of soap on your face so that it is completely clean and makeup</li>
            <li> Great results, I highly recommend these, and I will continue to buy them myself.</li>
            <li> Feel very clean.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good, but doesnt get all of them out every time.</li>
            <li> The strip had successfully pulled out some pore-clogging gunk, but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Work pretty good for me</li>
            <li> a month is a pretty good schedule.  </li>
            <li> I think the blackheads have lessened with steady use, but I still deal with surface skin impurities and these strips have been very effective in keeping blackheads, etc.</li>
            <li> Though most fascinating results are certainly with longer intervals between application.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth buying this product!!  </li>
            <li> I bought these just for shagrins and they have not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I still get blackheads, but I feel more relieved to see that I am able to clean my pores more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The strips really clean your nose from the blackspots!</li>
            <li> Feel really clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> They work every time and I feel like the pores are ripped out and clean!  </li>

            <li> These really work great to clean your nose pores.</li>
            <li> The overall reviews on the Biore Pore Strips are very good</li>
            <li> Those are the most important pre-strip items of concern.  </li>
            <li> I love how smooth my nose feels now.</li>
            <li> Good product, but does not have much power to remove the sludge, although it helps in clearing the impurities of the face</li>
            <li> Pull strips (use good judgment; not too fast, not too</li>
            <li> This is temporary though because the pores fill up just as quickly as they were unclogged and many times you&#x27;ll end up with more blackheads than before.</li>
            <li> It really works great and makes my face feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> So cool!</li>
            <li> not a bad price either on here!</li>
            <li> , I guess it just depends on my pores and how easily the strips can get to my blackheads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packing is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy for them to use</li>
            <li> Biore strips work like magic to clean out pores.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, but it was easy to get dryness in the area if I used the strips too often.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and frequency of use depends on season and location.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are nice to use every once in a while to get that gunk out, and I do think these strips are more gentle on my skin compared to to \\&quot;expressing\\</li>
            <li> These things are easy to use and they work well.  </li>
            <li> but easy to use, and works.  </li>
            <li> But they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> so any blemishes show up easily.</li>
            <li> the adhesive is not as strong but still does the job on some blackheads,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing when you use these</li>
            <li> Ive always struggeld with a oily nose full of blackheads and this product has definitely satisfied my needs.</li>
            <li> best stuff on the market hands down</li>
            <li> I did all the steps and made sure my face was clean and makeup free.</li>
            <li> bought for girlfriend, she seems to like this fine</li>
            <li> They are the best at removing the black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the best for your face because it could pull off more than blackheads.</li>
            <li> This morning everything is fine.</li>
            <li> and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Works best if you cleanse your face with some sort of deep-cleaning scrub, like those black-head removing creams with blue granules in them, first.</li>
            <li> if your problem is superficial this would work out just fine</li>
            <li> I heal just fine.  </li>
            <li> The nose is fine, though.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, he found them!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: They do work, make sure not to pull quickly and use after a shower.</li>
            <li> They work best on large pores, and aren&#x27;t as good on small pores.</li>
            <li> but theres just something about the real thing that works better!</li>
            <li> I really was impressed at how much it got rid of after my first use.</li>
            <li> this is a great and easy to use product, simple directions are included.</li>
            <li> Well, case and point is that these work wonderfully, they hurt a little when I pulled mine off to the point my eyes were watering quite a bit, but</li>
            <li> Remove most of the black heads from the first use - use 1 per week - excellent product - easy to use</li>
            <li> They got here ultra quick so and also excited about that too!</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I use one probably once a month and notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Dont really work too well to be honest.</li>
            <li> Overall its a great product.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really fit</li>
            <li> I used this product several times and I am usually happy with the results.</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> and when i saw that amazon was selling a 14 strip i freaked and bought one to see if 14 actually came in a box LOL</li>
            <li> and my skin always feels so smooth after using them.</li>
            <li> It was amazing to see how much of it was on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like to see them available in bulk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to give it a few minutes before heading out on a date or negotiating peace with a neighboring nation state so that the pores can recover and shrink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Did fit secure and tugged on my skin when removed.</li>
            <li> As a cheap alternative to buying in the stores, I recommend this seller and product.</li>
            <li> Amazing, literally after doing this and seeing how much dirt is in my pores, they are a must have.</li>
            <li> I used these about 10 years ago when I was in middle school, and they were great then.</li>
            <li> Use these all the time, and they totally work great for me.</li>
            <li> The face strips did not do a great job at removing my white heads under my chin.</li>
            <li> Cut the strip to properly fit on your nose or face.</li>
            <li> Smooth out all air bubbles, those areas won&#x27;t work otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much crud these things pull off of my nose.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and even tried a few tricks and the best I could get was so so results.</li>
            <li> oh boy does it feel smooth and</li>
            <li> And these things aren&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li> She applied one on my nose to show me what it can do and it really did a nice job.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of the Pore Strips free from the Vine review program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afterwards, hold the strip sideways to a light, and you can see where the detritus from each pore has been pulled out.  </li>
            <li> The best way to reduce blackheads is just using a scrubbing face wash a few times a week.</li>

            <li> great product A+ the only thing is my nose still burns a bit.</li>
            <li> These work great for my husband, who has GIANT blackheads.</li>
            <li> But, most facial products don&#x27;t show how good they can deliver.</li>
            <li> A very effecive aid to keep one&#x27;s physical appearance at its best.</li>
            <li> it works pretty well, i love it, it is easy to work out and</li>
            <li> Works even better if you use it right out of the shower when your pores are enlarged.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t use these right before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it just have the same good quality as I bought in stores before,I love this,it always make my pore clean</li>
            <li> I always will wish have something like this in my life because is really helpful and make the difference!!!  </li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> Your nose is really clean and smooth after though.</li>
            <li> The item arrived pretty fast, in good condition.</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I ordered Biore Deep Cleansing, I have tried so many products for my blackheads and nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, work quickly, and don&#x27;t leave a ton of redness.</li>
            <li> my nose feels fresh and clean each time I use them!</li>
            <li> Although they don&#x27;t fix the problem at all, they do make it fun to clean out your pores!  </li>
            <li> I recommend using a strip right after a nice, hot shower.  </li>
            <li> I love these strips they are easy to use and really work.</li>
            <li> They pull out so many comedones and it&#x27;s actually pretty neat to look at the strip after you pull it off.</li>
            <li> I love using this product and always feel so much cleaner after!</li>
            <li> But well worth it!</li>
            <li> Really fun to peel off!</li>
            <li> Some foolish people think that men are the grosser sex, but Biore pore strips are a significant indication</li>
            <li> yep, it works pretty well, got a lot stuff out, and then some more, recommended for the purpose of removing blackheads</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to try them.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s pretty satisfying to see all the gunk on the strip afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought these today (not from Amazon however) and was really excited to try them out.</li>
            <li> it on your nose significantly longer than 10 min.</li>
            <li> first thing I&#x27;d like to note is that the strips LOVE to stick to themselves.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy these again even though they do exactly what they say they will because it&#x27;s more of a novelty.  </li>
            <li> well first and make sure its damp</li>
            <li> I forgot how much fun these are!  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I used these pore strips many years ago as a teenager when they first started being sold.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, not painful, and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> best use you&#x27;ll ever get from the biore strip is the first use where it will probably pull out huge black filaments from your skin.  </li>
            <li> I order the Kiehls amazon mask to clean the pore and will see how it works.</li>
            <li> Note that it won&#x27;t completely clean out your pores and you would need to use an exfoliant to do that, but if you just want a temporary surface clean up this will help a bit.</li>
            <li> It will clean your pores well.</li>
            <li> They work, my nose feels super smooth for weeks, and it brings out the kid in everyone to inspect what the strips pulled off your face.</li>
            <li> it would not stick to my clean nose so it could not work.</li>
            <li> I also use the strips on either side of my nose/cheek/chin areas, and they work to clean these parts as well.</li>
            <li> I tend to get blackheads on the side of my nose and these strips keep my nose clean.</li>
            <li> When I bought my first box of Biore pore strips, they were amazing probably because it was also my first time using it.</li>
            <li> However, you can maintain a clean nose when you wash your nose two times a day and sleep on a clean pillowcase</li>
            <li> these will keep those pores clean after removing them with this product.</li>
            <li> Use this to exfoliate your skin and clean your pores.</li>
            <li> Want clean skin?  </li>
            <li> I find that they are more effective when you leave them on longer, so I left mine on for 40 minutes instead of 20.</li>
            <li> I like the tightening effect on my pores and it makes my skin and pores feel rejuvenated and clean.</li>
            <li> exfoliate, clean and use the product once a month can&#x27;t ask for better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of gross but also satisfying to know that all of that is not in your pores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really removes those blackheads and leaves your skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> I need something fast with having 3 kids and this is fast and easy to apply!!</li>
            <li> but I was certainly hoping to see it do more.</li>
            <li> Whenever the blackheads on my nose and chin get noticeable, one of these babies will pluck them right off!</li>
            <li> , it is quite satisfying to see how much you can \\&quot;clean</li>
            <li> Secondly, I am surprised at how amazing these work.</li>
            <li> I used to use these when they first came out on the market, and I&#x27;m happy to see that they&#x27;re still the same.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing how much the pore strips pick up.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the instructions because not wetting or wetting the area too much can have an impact on the outcome.</li>
            <li> It was cool to see the stuff it removed though.</li>
            <li> Thanks for more acne.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy this product though, it&#x27;s fun to poke at it when it&#x27;s all plastery.</li>
            <li> I really love pulling these off and seeing how much guck came out of my pores.</li>
            <li> Love that I can order these to be delivered straight to my door.</li>
            <li> Once the cotton rounds are fully saturated with the warm baking soda mixture, completely cover your nose with the pads.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a mask or blackhead scrub that was anywhere near as effective as these.</li>
            <li> and that is so cool - coz</li>
            <li> As someone else mentioned, the strip is really gross after you peel it off but that means it did a good job.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> followed the instructions zealously, and waited a full 20 minutes before taking the strip off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A TRUE MIRACLE.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> It got maybe 10 out of probably hundreds, which is honestly not bad.</li>
            <li> am so excited for these strips and encourage those looking to improve the appearance of their skin while deeply cleaning their pores to try the Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips.</li>
            <li> Deep Pore Cleansing Masque works a lot better and easier for me, as well as being a more economical choice (that batch lasts forever!)</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it too often because it pulls skin around your nose pretty strong.</li>
            <li> but when i got them i immediately tried them out and it worked great with the other things i had purchased on amazon.</li>
            <li> They leave my pores feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have so many pin prick sized black heads on my nose and can sometimes squeeze them out, but to be able to get more out a time</li>
            <li> These cleanup blackheads quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s quickly fading and</li>
            <li> These strips work great at removing black heads from your nose if you want your nose clean</li>
            <li> They work but run out quick</li>
            <li> I love it, I have sensitive/ combination skin and was worried this might be too harsh for my skin, but it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> w/a mild cleanser to remove excess</li>
            <li> This is a great way to remove blackheads, especially on the nose for men.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny, and they really WORK.&lt;br /&gt;Adding</li>
            <li> These are always a go to product in skin care for quick and immediate results.</li>
            <li> But do it right and it will clean out those pores.  </li>
            <li> My nose was pretty smooth after though...</li>
            <li> loved the 14 count package so I can use long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself being able to live without it.</li>
            <li> Try it and you will be happy that you did if you have black heads around your nose area.</li>
            <li> When you pull them off, it feels great to see all the black heads on the strip.</li>
            <li> Even just gently exfoliating with my Konjac sponge first is helpful, and I get so much more on the strip than if I just do it without having exfoliated recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no more bumps or unsightly freckle like features that are in no way freckles (because if they were I may have considered them to be a rather cute and charming feature).</li>
            <li> They peel off easily and gently and leave no residue.  </li>
            <li> These really work and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used them before, they don&#x27;t unclog every single pore but you can see that they do unclog a good 80 - 90%.</li>
            <li> Im sure after using it maybe another time, the blackheads will be completely gone!</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the instructions completely and these strips will help you maintain a blackhead-free nose!</li>
            <li> best results I run a washcloth under hot water to open my pores as much as possible, hold it there for a bit.</li>
            <li> Sure my nose has less noticable pores now, but I ain&#x27;t got noboday loving on me</li>
            <li> but now my skin feels very smooth and soft,</li>
            <li> They are somewhat effective, but then leave many little things just sticking up out of my nose that I have to deal with which</li>
            <li> These strips are fantastic and I would absolutely recommend them.</li>
            <li> and WOW, I get 10x more stuff that way.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it, you will not be disapointed.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not the product that keeps them from coming back though so in my honest opinion, you can try this once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years, and they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it was worth it.</li>
            <li> These strips seem to do more damage than good, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li> it is a useful product for my teens.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these for fun, on the urging of my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fun, though I might not buy them again.</li>
            <li> I rarely get them anymore</li>
            <li> (but well worth the money).</li>
            <li> Incredibly effective treatment at that!&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves your nose slightly red, but</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not that useful.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most economical way to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves a white adhesive-ish kind of residue in areas that have to be rubbed or washed off.</li>
            <li> I found his product to be quite useful.</li>
            <li> and I have used three times to make my nose more clearly</li>
            <li> love using it, it may also be gross, but i enjoy taking a look afterwards to see...</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product is fun to use though and see the results immediately.</li>
            <li> They arrived in good condition and worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Only reason I don&#x27;t give them 5 stars is they aren&#x27;t 100% effective at clearing all pores.</li>
            <li> But they are worth a shot.</li>
            <li> worth buying.. had this on subsciption</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I still say it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> But WORTH it.</li>
            <li> Kiehl&#x27;s Rare Earth</li>
            <li> YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT YOUR MONEYS WORTH.</li>
            <li> And they are fun to look at afterwards.</li>
            <li> But when they do work, they make for a fun girls night.  </li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s well worth the result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth trying once...</li>
            <li> As an adult I don&#x27;t have as many blackheads as I used to, but this strip seems to remove them all.</li>
            <li> first time I tried the new strips, I was familiar with the easy to use instructions.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll snap shut your pores &amp; you&#x27;ll be left feeling a new kind of clean!</li>
            <li> High SPFs only control for UV B rays, and zinc oxide is the most effective and most stable of UV A blocks) religiously has helped.</li>
            <li> While most imitation brands are basically the same (i.e. Walgreens), Biore is the way to go because I find it to be the most effective.</li>
            <li> AFTER i PULL OUT SOME PRETTY GROSS YET SATISFYING DIRT OUT OF MY PORES!</li>
            <li> I usually use these after a warm shower or steaming my face, so I can be sure my pores are nice and open.</li>
            <li> not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These took the blackheads right out, but not all of them.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the acne cleansers you can name to get rid of blackheads and it didn&#x27;t work, but these would take the blackheads right out</li>
            <li> It pulls those blackheads right out of my pores.  </li>
            <li> Keep trying until you get it right.  </li>
            <li> or if I don&#x27;t use the product right.</li>
            <li> I have used it right the way I received it.</li>
            <li> I like to put these on right after I shower while my pores are still enlarged and</li>
            <li> right after.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can see the difference in your skin right away.  </li>
            <li> when I found the sale, I jumped right on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use these on a weekly basis and they clean my nose really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really have to clean your nose, like, put soap on it and lather, beforehand, for it to work, but boy, does it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pack does a good job, but often times, the sticky strip would rip as I gently remove the plastic and doesn&#x27;t dry as well as I would</li>
            <li> The strips are suitable gross after use as well.</li>
            <li> generally all around to make sure the strip sticks to every part of your nose.  </li>
            <li> I use these on a regular basis, so it was nice to be able to buy a larger pack like this.</li>
            <li> THESE BARELY TOOK ANYTHING OFF MY NOSE, MOSTLY ON THE SIDE</li>
            <li> First time using this was a success.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for these to arrive because I have a decent amount of teeny blackheads around my nose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other versions of these nifty pore strips before but this new formulation works great -- if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of tugging and dryness afterward.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well when used the right way</li>
            <li> it works wonders for people will large pores and pulls out almost 95% of grime !</li>
            <li> The strips work good, but I&#x27;d prefer them to be slightly longer, they&#x27;re 5mm shorter than I&#x27;d like them to be.</li>
            <li> I actually like this product, it is so easy to use and makes you feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> But the deep cleansing pore strips are easy to use, and you can tell they clean the pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have mild acne and scarring, but what really bothers me are the blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and a little gross but VERY satisfying.</li>
            <li> It also made my nose feel very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> With these strips you can use them right after a shower, and the results last about a week, which is okay because they&#x27;re supposed to be used weekly.</li>
            <li> the pores on his nose are large and clogged, and these clean them out real nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the nose strips, when I first used these the nose strips from my first box, they were able to pull out a whole lot of whiteheads from my nose.</li>
            <li> just like it very much ....</li>
            <li> A single strip saves me a week&#x27;s worth of scraping off my whiteheads!!!</li>
            <li> However, if you are willing to take the risk of having permanent red lines on your nose, they make your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Keeps it soft and clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> try them in the past and still think they are absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> The strip is not sticky enough and sometimes even slip off my nose, I guess a pore cleaner might doing a better job than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Biore strips work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I am not surebif thid is real brand!</li>
            <li> that come off in the first use.</li>
            <li> While the Biore Pore Strips actually do work, I would advise looking into the product more.</li>
            <li> Gets the blackheads straight out!</li>
            <li> You can tell they really work!</li>
            <li> it does hurt a bit but pretty bearable.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the strip, I missed a couple spots my nose, so I cut up one of the strips &amp; used it on my nose &amp; IT</li>
            <li> This product works &amp; shipping is fast !</li>
            <li> I really liked them but they were not really helpful.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> Everything went really well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It definitely did remove more blackheads which is why I gave this 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I love these, even though it is totally gross when you use them.</li>
            <li> She now uses it on a weekly basis and when she first tried it,it removed 80% of her blackheads.</li>
            <li> I followed the steps exactly as it said.</li>
            <li> But I just resolved that issue by using another strip and covering the unreachable portion first before sticking the strip on the rest of the nose which I covered with my first strip.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The first couple strips i used pulled about a dozen or so blackheads, since, maybe 1 or 2.</li>
            <li> I remember first using these in the 90s.</li>
            <li> So much better than having them squeezed out at a facial.</li>
            <li> I could see a lot of things came out of my pores when I first used it.  </li>
            <li> They are better priced here than at my local drugstore and work just as well.  </li>
            <li> They work better than cheaper brands, and I have tried several.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not supposed to use these on my cheek, only on my nose (as the instructions say)</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t read all of the instructions at first</li>
            <li> with this product you will see the deference from the first time.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what is says and the commercials show.</li>
            <li> These do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do: pull out stuff from the pores on your nose.</li>
            <li> When I bought the product, went home and followed the steps EXACTLY..</li>
            <li> Get your strip ready!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s obvious given the nature of the strips.&lt;br /&gt;-Little pricey, much better on Amazon than drug stores though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now my nose is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> the best effect, use warm water to rinse your nose before so the pores can open up then just rinse with cold water after the treatment they&#x27;ll close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would also recommend watching a Youtube video before you remove the first time.</li>
            <li> To look at me you wouldn&#x27;t be aware I had blackheads in this area unless you looked at a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> I would recommend though that it should be used more than once a month as you would get the same effect as when u first used the strip</li>
            <li> and you will be glowing for next 15 days :)</li>
            <li> I used to use these all the time when Biore first brought these nose strips out</li>
            <li> Facials are certainly more luxurious, but where can you get a facial for $8.20?  </li>
            <li> A facial takes an hour or more at a salon, plus the commute.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you have some facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> ) Take a hot, steamy shower.</li>
            <li> reason I gave this only three stars is that the formula used to be a lot better.</li>
            <li> I follow all the directions and even always attempt to use them after I&#x27;ve taken a really hot shower and my pores should be &amp;#34;open.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used them while just dabbing some hot water on my nose.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t appear to remove any blackheads from the center of the nose, even when used promptly after a warm shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still better than nothing, but I like feeling cleaner in one go, rather than using two strips to feel ultimately clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty unbearable, yet,</li>
            <li> It really cleans out your pores, you&#x27;ll be amazed!</li>
            <li> I have been using them for years with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li> Eeeeewwww these work really well!</li>
            <li> Does not hurt much!</li>
            <li> These work pretty well.</li>
            <li> With repeated use I feel like they definitely help keep my pores more refined and prevent T- Zone breakouts.</li>
            <li> Really works wonders!</li>
            <li> Works better than any facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The strips really work - you get the proof on the strip itself every time you use it !</li>
            <li> The first strip I opened stuck to itself immediately and wouldn&#x27;t come part.</li>
            <li> And of course I occasionally pamper the boyfriend&#x27;s nose as well. :)</li>
            <li> key to this working is opening the pores up first and making sure your skin and strip are moist.  </li>
            <li> Over time I&#x27;ve been able to reduce that with biore strips, and comedone extractor and regular use of 5% Benzoyl peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I used this the first time and it did remove a bunch of blackheads from my nose</li>
            <li> I used it a couple days later hoping it would get a lot more.</li>
            <li> However, make sure you leave the strip on the entire time.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret buying it, I promise ;)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> This removes a lot of dirt from your pores upon your first use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After use, the activated glue does leave a nose slightly red and dry, so it is a good idea to clean and moisturize after every use.</li>
            <li> I read and followed the directions exactly as written on the box.  </li>
            <li> funny movie &#x3D; lots of laughter.</li>
            <li> I really love this product because it helps remove blackheads white head or what ever dirt is hiding in your pores.</li>
            <li> when my pores have been steamed open more.</li>
            <li> have pretty oily skin and get acne in my nose and it enlarges my pores.</li>
            <li> First product that I tried.</li>
            <li> I used a nose strip for the first time today, and I have to say that they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have tried these multiple times over the years, hoping for better results each time.</li>
            <li> one star is because the strips actually cause me to break out more after using them.</li>
            <li> This is my first try, but I need a routine that includes these strips.</li>
            <li> But obviously these are more hype than anything.  </li>
            <li> The strips do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to, without any issues.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I have ever used a nose strip.</li>
            <li> I am impressed on several new factors: There is better coverage to more adequately cover the nose area, strips stick much better, and lastly there is no gooey residue that I remember being left behind on the older strips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best results are too leave it on there until its so dry it almost hurts a little when peeling off.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to feel like you&#x27;ve done a super thorough job of cleaning ALL of the skin on your face.</li>
            <li> - they were exactly what I wanted and came quickly and at a better price than I expected.</li>
            <li> One tip I would offer is to use a good exfoliator in the shower before hand then allow the strip to dry completely (15 minutes).</li>
            <li> You can see right on each strip after you use it that they&#x27;re very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So after searching continuously online for about two weeks now on this product, I finally decided to try it out since most comments and video reviews show positive results.</li>
            <li> The only way they wouldn&#x27;t be effective is if they are applied wrong or not allowed to dry, unless your skin is so perfect that your pores are clog free.</li>
            <li> seriously I never expected this works such a way, it was wonderfull works as expected, worthy Buying for a gal to keep her beauty !!!!!</li>
            <li> They also have a funky hairspray smell that might bother more sensitive people, and I would think that someone with sensitive skin would experience soreness afterwards.</li>
            <li> I like to use them shortly before cleaning my face with a good cleaner to get deep in the pores.</li>
            <li> &quot; they can be filled right back up with dirt or makeup) or cause permanent pores--huge holes in your face that never disappear!</li>
            <li> It came fast and i got to see some of the dirt in my pores the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This videos shows exactly how much can come from your nose, if you are patient.  </li>
            <li> I find that using an oil absorbing mask first helps to pull the impurities out and get the blackheads closer to the surface.  </li>
            <li> Your nose has to be wet before applying, and you must stick the smooth side to your nose - the side that is originally stuck to the plastic.</li>
            <li> At least one of us liked them!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can find Bior&amp;eacute; pore strips at pretty much any drugstore and online.</li>
            <li> When I took off the first strip I was amazed with how much gunk came off with it.</li>
            <li> Its kind of icky  looking, but your skin is clean</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s best to seek a dermatologist&#x27;s advice if you have some serious facial problems.</li>
            <li> service and packaging was decent though for standard shipping :)</li>
            <li> It seems they are all back the next day, but it sure is fun!  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend has HUGE pores on his nose with blackheads, and when i finally convinced him to use these, he ripped it off his nose and it had pulled so much out!</li>
            <li> tip which has really increased how much yucky stuff they remove is to exfoliate first.</li>
            <li> I would not do this more than once a week to start with because it is pretty rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure the strip is COMPLETELY dry before removing&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just cleanse your face first, then make sure your nose is wet, apply the nose strip, wait 15 minutes, peel the strip off, and if you&#x27;re like me, look at the strip to see what it pulled.</li>
            <li> Bior&amp;eacute; Deep Cleansing Pore Strips do the job quickly, easily and inexpensively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatives?</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores that are congested and always look clogged with blackheads.  </li>
            <li> Make certain place the tape in the correct way otherwise you may need 2 strips.</li>
            <li> I knew my pores were large there</li>
            <li> Did not stick and certainly didn&#x27;t pull any dirt out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not noticeable, but up-close, it certainly is.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the small slits, they fit like a glove and do a fantastic job at removing my blackheads!  </li>
            <li> I will try the new charcoal versions next to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> It definitely does a great job removing black heads.</li>
            <li> I bought these strips based on the great reviews, expecting it to remove a bunch of the white head and black head build up on my nose that I just can&#x27;t seem to wash away.</li>
            <li> adhesive isn&#x27;t strong enough to really pull out blackhead.</li>
            <li> Let it dry for 5 minutes and give a gentle tug-and prepared to be amazed at how many black/whiteheads you may see.  </li>
            <li> These are like magic, in fact its kinda freaky the first time you do it because you can see the stuff that came out of your pores and they stand up due to the glue.  </li>
            <li> I bought a different box (the ultra deep cleansing strips) the other day from a store to see if it was the box or something else, and it worked great, so I probably won&#x27;t be buying this particular kind in the future.</li>
            <li> Not only did it hurt like heck to take it off, but I noticed it was just as clean as it was when I first opened it.</li>
            <li> They were a little costy but totally worth it:)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides  being dry-ish and sensitive-ish, my skin is largely unproblematic.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips once, a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions; cleaned my face with warm water, applied a warm washcloth to my nose to help open up my pores, made sure my nose was wet enough, applied the pore strip, and waited a little over 15 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> well the next few times not so great.</li>
            <li> Thanks to amazon</li>
            <li> It really pulled stuff out of your pores.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it has helped me out much.</li>
            <li> think this product is a real hit and miss between people.</li>
            <li> And it is really fast</li>
            <li> Without too much detail....really pulls out the &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , I wash my face as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really dont use it that often.</li>
            <li> I really tried to make these work.</li>
            <li> I started out at once a week but didn&#x27;t see as much of a result.  </li>
            <li> I have whiteheads and this really gets rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> After removal jus ice the area to close the pores and it feels really fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was VERY reluctant to use it, but tonight I realized it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t very helpful</li>
            <li> It worked really well for my boyfriend who has deeper blackheads</li>
            <li> They pull so much junk from my face, even after I wash it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> - I now have three very noticeable torn capillaries on my nose and the texture of the skin on my nose</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much acne</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;ll harden so much that the sticky(now hardened) layer will stay on your nose and not on the strip itself.  </li>
            <li> If used correctly and by the directions they really do work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to get into it here, but you really should look into it.</li>
            <li> i really like these pore strips but</li>

            <li> this really cleans oil/dust from pore on my nose.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 star because my mom really likes it.</li>
            <li> These strips have something in them that makes my whole body itch.  </li>
            <li> My nose is so much clearer now!&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to use - very quick - takes a a short 1 min to stick it on the nose and then 10 mins to dry off.</li>
            <li> and they really do remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wouldn&#x27;t hurt so much when I have to pull it off.</li>

            <li> I once forgot I had these on and started cleaning the house and the sweat/oil on my nose prevented the strip from working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see a link for \\&quot;Prove It!\\&quot;points where you can enter in the \\&quot;Prove It!\\&quot; codes and get coupons, free pore strips (8 ct), deep cleaning cloths, etc.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really want to melt my nose off.</li>
            <li> and you know it&#x27;s ready to be peeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has really gotten rid of my stubborn blackheads.</li>
            <li> If the strip starts to get slimy then you&#x27;ve used too much</li>
            <li> the strips really don&#x27;t hurt to remove.</li>
            <li> These things are so much easier than sitting there for hours picking at blackheads.  </li>
            <li> there was so much stuff on it.</li>
            <li> This should be called nose strips as you can&#x27;t really use it anywhere else on your body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they get the job done and it doesnt hurt too much to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;looking</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking forward to seeing the real results after a couple uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (make sure your nose is wet all place where this is getting applied), wait for 20 mins and remove it....</li>
            <li> These really work for my face.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really working for my wife.</li>
            <li> , make sure that if your skin can dry out easily to put on some mosturizer after using the strips as they can dry out your skin a bit.</li>
            <li> but I cud really see the after effect on my darling..</li>
            <li> as soon as your nose is cleared, expect your nose to be suddenly oily as hell, now that they&#x27;re given free rein to release oil out of their cleared pores.  </li>
            <li> Gently rub this on your face in circular motions for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> The pore strips work very well</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> you wouldn&#x27;t believe how much gunk is beneath your skin!)&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> gently and thoroughly before applying the strip.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t pick up as much as I would like the strips to too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it worked so well on my husband though, I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> I had never used strips before and cheap ones or these did the same job!</li>
            <li> I use them once a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any real reduction in the amount of blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> I found this product to work very well.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> These really work for my face.</li>
            <li> but when I do I&#x27;m always amazed and grossed out, haha.</li>
            <li> Your skin must be thoroughly moistened  for it to really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like junkie stuff sticking straight up, like it literally pulls stuff straight out of the pores.</li>
            <li> you just have to really wash your nose</li>
            <li> They really get everything out, you can see it on the strip.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I had so much hahaha.</li>
            <li> and you know you&#x27;re ready to excavate.</li>
            <li> I tried using it after shower, after steam-toweling my face, and nothing seems to really help.</li>
            <li> I used up the whole pack without getting any real results.</li>
            <li> or I wasn&#x27;t paying so much.</li>
            <li> THEY WILL MAKE A WHOLE MASK.</li>
            <li> REALLY WITHOUT EFFORT REMOVES &amp;#34;EVERYTHING&amp;#34; ON YOUR FACE THAT SHOULDNT BE IN/OR ON YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li> I like it very much,because it is very suited for me.</li>
            <li> If you remove before the strip has hardened too much, removal should be painless.  </li>
            <li> No one wants clogged pores or visible blackheads on their nose.</li>
            <li> I didnt find this product to work very well for me.</li>
            <li> The strips break after I gently pull them</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it did pull out some oil and dirt in my blackheads, it wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> AND THEY REALLY WORK.</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t work *</li>
            <li> Biore strips work well if your nose pores are really clogged.</li>
            <li> If your pores aren&#x27;t really clogged up, the strips don&#x27;t do very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But Elmer&#x27;s works just as well and is much cheaper over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not been getting as many large acne spots on my nose since using this product either (that may have been due to the clogged pores I used to have).</li>
            <li> And even though they remove gunk from your nose, it&#x27;s not clear to me that a dry bumpy nose is any better looking than a smooth oily nose.</li>
            <li> These strips pull those babies right out - but be warned, it might take a few weeks to get the most stubborn ones out of their homes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they leave a white residue on my skin and is hard to remove even with warm water and vigorous scrubbing... Have not been able to find another decent brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is decently priced, works very well, and I will certainly recommend this to anyone who has an issue with blackheads on their nose.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time and it was a new experience for me,  </li>
            <li> so my pores get clogged and this will clear them right out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These strips are easy to use, and as long as you -follow the directions-, you shouldn&#x27;t be having any problems.</li>
            <li> I take pretty good care of my skin, but I do like to occasionally use these pore strips as a supplement to my regular facial care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it and my vote is to they invent a more economic box with at least 100 strips inside!</li>
            <li> I give it a 5 star because it worked a lot better than the other brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These work better than any other strip I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> i tried to other brands but none works as better as this.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other method known to mankind for blackheads and cleaning pores.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you are prone to clogged pores on your nose and have those particularly large pimples in this area now and then.</li>
            <li> Not a frequent user, but this stuff works fine.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be clean and your pores will be open.  </li>
            <li> Sorta disappointed because there were so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> but it will not be a deep clean.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t necessarily healthy to be ripping the natural oils and skin cells; in fact, it may, in the long run, cause pores to become clogged (because once they are \\&quot;unclogged,\\</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend with huge pores whose blackheads come out easily by squeezing had hardly anything on the strip.</li>
            <li> After which, if you&#x27;re a person of normal inquisitiveness, you spend a quality minute starting at the remarkable collection of gunk that had, only moments before, been quietly occupying your rhinal</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaving the ad copy aside, this is a bit of cloth with a special glue on it that literally rips tiny stalagmites of gunk out of your pores.</li>
            <li> Taking it off, however much you wet the strip will hurt, so I rip it off very quickly.</li>
            <li> the issue is already fixed and these strips do nothing more than dry  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly gross and so satisfying at the same time to look at how much is pulled out of your skin when you peel these off.</li>
            <li> Cool and gross.</li>
            <li> And the simple fact is it is so cool when you pull off the strip, you just cannot look away.</li>
            <li> Sit somewhere cool, put a fan on your face, or just hang out and do something quiet while it dries -</li>
            <li> After following the instructions to the letter, it did get a few cleared out, but a light squeeze would get more out.</li>
            <li> Wow after first use it took almost all dirt from my nose pores.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just not bad enough to have a reason to use them?  </li>
            <li> Not everyone has a dainty little nose, so one size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> The most important thing to remember about these strips is that when removing, remove very, VERY slowly.</li>
            <li> Nothing too new or different, will clean out some pores.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that these strips do a better job at removing black heads around my nose than some estheticians do.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d be able to see all the black gunk on the strip.</li>
            <li> I used one and so many black heads came out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe I do not have many black heads</li>
            <li> They unclogged a couple small pores but mostly just removed all of the fine facial hair that was under the strip.</li>
            <li> and I have found that his nose pores are looking better and less</li>
            <li> These strips are okay, They do work and get our black heads</li>
            <li> I think removing the dead skin cells really helps these be able to grab what is in the pores.</li>
            <li> i used them exactly as i had the first time i used them but still having the issue of it not doing its total job.</li>
            <li> This has been my main nose pore strip since I was a teenager</li>
            <li> The last time I used them (and had my son and husband use them since they do have oily skin), they worked super well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have big pores but my nose is super prone to blackheads, so I use one every week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different brand of nose strips (which actually works better than this one) for about 2-3 weeks already and when I tried this on, I didn&#x27;t see a lot of &#x27;things&#x27; coming out with it.</li>
            <li> I am more obsessed than most when it comes to removing blackheads and unclogging pores.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I feel like they aren&#x27;t as satisfying if you use them regularly, or if you regularly use another pore-cleansing product (like a clay mask).</li>
            <li> When it does come down to beauty, we often are looking for the best product to get rid of lifes, little facial escapes.</li>
            <li> My only minor quibble is that it&#x27;s usually a good idea to rewash your face, as sticky residue is sometimes left on your skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to do it again right away, but the packaging says only once every three days &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so I had high expectations for this item</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this, you will see the difference.</li>
            <li> Zero blackheads taken out dont understand why reviews are so high at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a blackhead sufferer since high school</li>
            <li> I have used Biore strips since I was in high school.</li>
            <li> I mean the fact that you can actually see all the nastiness that comes out is kind of cool.</li>
            <li> This product is not so great for really deep black heads which is why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> People with more sensitive skin may have other results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I find that it sticks better, and that way I can wash after because when you pull the strip off it does leave a little residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get a grossly satisfying amount of little dots of gunk all over the pore strips after I remove them.  </li>
            <li> Wish that they came closer to the tip of my nose a little more</li>
            <li> Some of the comments made about drying out your skin is true, but since I have oily skin, I&#x27;m not very sensitive to dryness.</li>
            <li> It only kinda works as advertised but it doesn&#x27;t get my nose really clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so conscious of keeping my face clean, especially my nose.</li>
            <li> BUT before that I was still using them and my nose is about 98% clear haha.</li>
            <li> BUT before that I was still using them and my nose is about 98% clear haha.</li>
            <li> So I washed my face, wet my nose, applied the smooth side on my nose, and waited 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much it hurt when I pulled it off.</li>
            <li> I have spend so much so far in saloons trying getting steam and bearing so much paid and shedding tears to get these out</li>
            <li> did try it, and I am surprised, worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always interesting to see what&#x27;s trapped in your skin.</li>
            <li> but they are worth it if you cant or dont want to simply pinch your nose.</li>
            <li> I kind of cheat and leave it on for at least 20min</li>
            <li> I will have to repeat the treatment a few more times to get the &amp;#34;strawberry&amp;#34; out of my nose</li>
            <li> It scares my wife a bit when I show her the white strips so it is a fun product as well.</li>
            <li> Use the cotton round to dab some more of the baking soda mixture onto your nose</li>
            <li> It does good at removing small ones, especially on the sides of the nose, but doesn&#x27;t remove all of them.</li>
            <li> Overall, worth trying out.</li>
            <li> It does a better job of cleaning out there pores as compared to just washing my face everyday.</li>
            <li> It cleaned out a few pores, mostly along the side of the nose.</li>
            <li> They mostly work well, but in both cases I&#x27;ve had a few strips that, when I pull them off after 10 minutes, some of the &#x27;glue&#x27;or whatever the sticky stuff is that is supposed to pull the gunk out, disconnects from the strip and stays on my nose, meaning that all the gunk stays too, and I have to scrub to get the &#x27;glue&#x27;off.</li>
            <li> You do see the sebum that gets extracted but sadly it doesn&#x27;t always get that one huge one that you feel is super noticeable on the nose but is able to lift out the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;re going to think I&#x27;m super weird, but seeing the results on the strip kind of excites me...</li>
            <li> My nose just isn&#x27;t the right shape and the entire thing comes out as an air bubble.</li>
            <li> I use them right before I do any deep cleaning of my face, and to my mind, I&#x27;d never be without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m gonna do it right after a shower</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m actually considering getting a nose piercing right on that spot...</li>
            <li> Every single time I use these I am both repulsed and grateful when I gaze upon the strip full of a forest of ick.</li>
            <li> They were shipped from New York on the 25th and arrived today, Aug. 27th in California.</li>
            <li> If you were looking for something that looked new, this would not be your choice.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without them.  </li>
            <li> Press down firmly and smooth it out to make sure there are no air bubbles.</li>
            <li> It worked no better than trying to make your own porestrip out of elmer&#x27;s glue (which is also ineffective).The skin on my nose didn&#x27;t even feel significantly softer or smoother, in fact it itches a little now even though I rinsed off any remaining residue and applied</li>
            <li> I usually use these right after taking a shower when my pores are probably most open.  </li>
            <li> Unless the last few uses do something amazing.</li>
            <li> We had bought a similar type product a few years ago and had amazing results, however, I couldn&#x27;t remember what brand it was</li>
            <li> I, in particular, get a lot of adult acne</li>
            <li> An old classic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful but much more effective.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your face is wet before you put the strip on, leave it on about ten minutes, rip it off like a band-aid, and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t remove everything but no other product really comes close.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought these, I expected them to be like every other product that claimed to magically remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> For me personally I think it has helped because I had developed very large blocked pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li> results of these cleansing strips are both amazing and appalling.</li>
            <li> and you think you have clear skin and then see all the gunk come out!</li>
            <li> My eyes started to water and my nose was pretty red.</li>
            <li> I wish the strip was bigger to cover the whole tip of your nose thats why I gave it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get them all out on the first attempt, but you can totally see the results.</li>
            <li> I tried using hot water on my nose before applying to open my pores, but that didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was because there was no more &#x27;things&#x27; to remove, or this product doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get the same result when I first used these strips.</li>
            <li> I have tried small ethnic supermarket pore strips which don&#x27;t ever extract as many as the Biore does.</li>
            <li> However, if you have sensitive skin I would stick to the instructions!</li>
            <li> These nose strips did not work very well for me as I have really stubborn blackheads, but I have found that following these steps will completely amaze or disgust (maybe both)</li>
            <li> Funny thing is the only place they don&#x27;t work for me is my nose.</li>
            <li> It was actually pretty gross, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.</li>
            <li> I used some strips from the 99p store and they did exactly the same as these.</li>
            <li> They probably could use my strip as an advertisement and to be truthful, most users will get a small perverse pleasure from seeing all the dirt and oil formed in small stalactite formation.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly the same.</li>
            <li> You can actually see them working after first use.</li>
            <li> It was pretty gross seeing all that on the strip after, but a bit of relief knowing it was out of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude,  have pretty big pores on my nose I suppose.  </li>
            <li> recommend it right after you&#x27;ve washed your face, splash a little extra water on and then smooth the strip out</li>
            <li> My pores looked cleaner and there was a definite removal of gunk, but I feel like they didn&#x27;t remove as much as they did on the older version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately the redness has gone down</li>
            <li> Other pore cleansing lotions say they clean your skin, but you have to just believe it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands that I found worse and one that I found better, but have not been able to find in the USA (Nivea).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> and I had a huge black head on my cheek that just would not go away.</li>
            <li> this one first to clean you face and remove all the makeup then wash your face with hot water and dry it then wet your nose and use the biore deep cleansing pore strip.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe it was a one time thing, so I tried again, and once again, blackheads and trapped dirt were easily removed--this time</li>
            <li> I did everything I could think of to assist the strips in unclogging my pores: I used them directly after taking lengthy, hot showers, steamed my face beforehand, and even compressed a damp, steamed hand towel on my face for about 10 minutes prior to using them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically only write positive reviews but felt the need to share my experience with the Biore Pore Strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but I&#x27;ve found that it only really cleans the pores that aren&#x27;t deep.</li>
            <li> I swear the other reviews are full of it.</li>
            <li> Get your nose wet, and with dry hands, place the strip on your nose, covering the area where most of the problem blackheads are.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t waste your money and get a good cleanser, they remove some black points but after 10&#x27; you can see them again.</li>
            <li> pretty much overflow with gunk if I don&#x27;t exfoliate every other day, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely for people with large pores and T-Zone issues.</li>
            <li> i dont have large pores and my blackeheads are usually deep set !</li>
            <li> Pulls the large plugs of gunk out, but still leaves some smaller bits.</li>
            <li> I have a blackhead issue from time to time and these certainly pull out some gross stuff.</li>
            <li> I looked at the strip and while there was some stuff there, looking at my nose, it only seemed to remove about 50% of the stuff, which I had to manually remove by the age-old pressing and squeezing a certain way.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, the strip came off painlessly, just a little tug on the skin.  </li>
            <li> If the size is little bigger it will be better.</li>
            <li> I love looking at all the tiny little white/blackheads that come off on it.  </li>
            <li> Although I was hoping that it would also help remove some of the annoyingly persistent flakes that appear on my nose, I was still happy that the strip did exactly what it was supposed to do, and pulled out a decent amount of blackheads.</li>
            <li> but I hardly have time for that any more.</li>
            <li> Leaves your pores clear</li>
            <li> They help keep my face clear and prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s clear when you look at the strip afterwards.</li>
            <li> Make sure your face is wet, but don&#x27;t overly wet the strip.</li>
            <li> When viewed through magnification, those specks on the strips are clearly blackheads.  </li>
            <li> The strips won&#x27;t clear every pore</li>
            <li> I think I will just squirm for awhile, and have a clear nose.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly clear complexion with the exception of my  nose.</li>
            <li> I started using Biore strips once a week to clear the blackheads out of my pores.</li>
            <li> Over time, I stopped getting blackheads but still use these strips to clear the whiteheads out of my nose.</li>
            <li> I got these hoping it would clear my pores a bit or just help reduce any breakouts or oil buildup.  </li>
            <li> I noticed I was having some blackheads on my nose, so I bought these hoping to clear it up.</li>
            <li> It really does pull out white and lback heads.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the forehead strips, I don&#x27;t think they work for much of anything than pulling your eyebrows out.</li>
            <li> but I just really started to notice them recently.</li>
            <li> They leave the skin on your nose sensitive and feeling like it&#x27;s sunburnt.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the strip pulled them out.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that these Biore strips would be the thing that drastically reduces the appearance of my pores, but no such luck.</li>
            <li> The whole process took only 4 days.</li>
            <li> However, use caution if you have sensitive skin or are prone to spider veins.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as well made as the old noise strips.  </li>
            <li> I had to fight the urge to extract them myself because the box says your skin may be sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions completely and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> Probably you will need to have a whole lot of blackheads and whiteheads on your nose for the nose strip to actually pull anything  out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them since the early 90&#x27;s when they were given away in promotional gift bags my freshmen year of college.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old batch or what, but they weren&#x27;t sticky and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My nose is very oily and the pores always open up.</li>
            <li> Now the effectiveness can be up for debate, but I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wow that was drastic change.</li>
            <li> have I really learned how to use them properly.</li>
            <li> They are gross but it really helped me learn to remove the strips</li>
            <li> Bought it after my lady recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised as the product exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I decided to get this after I was beginning to become bothered by cleaning the pores with my fingers because they were definitely noticeable when you got real</li>
            <li> followed the instructions and before peeling it off, it was almost as though you could actually see the strip sucked into the pores ready to pull stuff out.  </li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin I can see where this would cause problems.  </li>
            <li> (Skip this step if you have extremely sensitive or damaged skin.)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well now as it used to.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my early 20s now)</li>
            <li> Nearly nothing.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve used the nose ones for my upper cheeks and it really hurts to take them off there.</li>
            <li> If you wash your face regularly with something that can scrub and not just hands, this won&#x27;t do much for you.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really irritated and red after having to scrub the glue off.  </li>
            <li> I already have one on the side of my nose that won&#x27;t fill up naturally; I always have to fill it in with concealer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They also leave my nose a tad sensitive, and leave a residue on my nose that I have to wash off afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far I have tried 3 of them</li>
            <li> Pretty long term results.</li>
            <li> Far from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I decided to try them again as an adult</li>
            <li> I used them and and wow talk about gunk.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure 100% of these really help that much in the long run, it sure does give instant satisfaction.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that when I got to use the strips a few days later, my pore are even more clogged.</li>
            <li> And yes, I put them on properly, but as stated I will try a few more times.  </li>
            <li> Just catching sight of my nose now makes me feel slightly nauseated now, and of course that has been no help to the compulsions.</li>
            <li> It works better if you use these after a shower and when you peel them off really slowly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive, but I get good results with them.</li>
            <li> A little strange to use the first time, and looks kind of icky when you pull it off - it clears the pores out and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how much stuff is on your face!</li>
            <li> I have very large pores on my nose and expected a lot of junk on the strip when I removed it.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s any residue left on your skin, which sometimes happens if your skin is too wet, then that same hot wash cloth will take it right</li>
            <li> However, my pores aren&#x27;t \\&quot;minimized\\&quot; - they&#x27;re mostly left as gaping, empty holes once the plugs of gunk are removed, so I then wash with warm water and facial wash, dry my face, then apply a BHA liquid.  </li>
            <li> Especially since I sure don&#x27;t have any hair on my nose -- nor was all that black &#x27;dirt&#x27; visible to my naked eye!</li>
            <li> They left my nose a bit red but took out about 50% of my blackheads on the first shot.</li>
            <li> I really love how these things work; however, because my pores are so enlarged, I usually have to use an extractor tool following application.  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t already used to this, I&#x27;d say go the other route and get a pore cleansing mask or lotion or some other product that works better.</li>
            <li> well nad make me feel pretty even if I still look (relatively) the same</li>
            <li> These work the exact same as the ones I&#x27;ve always bought at the local store.</li>
            <li> I took a shower first to open my pores, and then i left the strip on for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Even if you feel the strip is dry wait a little longer as it works better this way.</li>
            <li> Besides, it&#x27;s really cool to see all those little &amp;#34;porcupine&amp;#34; like pieces stuck to the strip.</li>
            <li> and then do the strips twice in a row, one right after the other.</li>
            <li> The instructions are very simple and it only takes a few minutes to rid your nose of hard to remove dirt which embeds in pores and gives a really nice clean feeling afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT NOT DOWN THE BRIGDE</li>
            <li> advantage of the strips, though, is that they dry faster :) I seem to have a heavy hand with the glue.</li>
            <li> actually work; if you apply them correctly (make sure your face is wet; simply getting it damp isn&#x27;t enough to make them stick properly, in my experience, and then press the strip down, paying special attention to anywhere</li>
            <li> I used Biore strips as a teenager, but felt they never cleaned as well as a normal cleanser and weekly facial mask, so I stopped using them.  </li>
            <li> First, throughly wet the area you want to remove blackheads from and apply the strip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are ultra (super strength) versions of this in the light green box which I usually use but these seem to work maybe 90% as well.  </li>
            <li> It should really be bone dry and feel like it&#x27;s tightening your skin before you rip it off.</li>
            <li> These cleansing strips really work and leave you with the instant satisfaction of removing and discarding these facial imperfections.</li>
            <li> I think the key to removing the most blackheads is to pull it off extremely slowly.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s much easier than using tweezers to get every single blackhead.</li>
            <li> Other than that, does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have figured this tip out in my teens, but better late than never!</li>
            <li> I just wish they&#x27;d go back to the old \\&quot;recipe\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> It actually arrived 2-3 days early !</li>
            <li> Simply wet your entire face until it slides right off.</li>
            <li> Every time I have used this batch, and yes I use them correctly, right after a steamy shower, I wet my nose and leave it on until it dries, almost all my blackheads are left on my face.</li>
            <li> If I apply the whole thing I seem to have loose edges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, it gives that little extra help for clean, refined pores.</li>
            <li> GF complained about my pores and told me to use them and honestly, works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I wish this was a little cheaper, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really worth $1</li>
            <li> They were a little costly but totally worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d accept less packaging and more product, or less packaging and lower price.</li>
            <li> These strips truly clean the pores on your nose and remove everything on them as deep down as is possible.</li>
            <li> My nose has always been a problem when it comes to blackheads &amp; general gunk getting caught in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend them for anyone looking for clear pores.</li>
            <li> These strips barely work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a blackhead problem on my nose since I was a teen (I am 33 years old).</li>
            <li> The pain of peeling this strip off the soft skin around my nose made my eyes water, but the pain didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Recommend it for anyone who is conscious about their personal hygiene, women and men.</li>
            <li> I only used one so far.</li>
            <li> Twist it softly so the slits open up, allowing optimal placement on your nose.</li>
            <li> You do have to get your face really wet in order for them to really stick.</li>
            <li> Thus far though, they have only been &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try these a few more times to see how they work in future tries.  </li>
            <li> Someday I will find the magic secret that allows me to utilize the strip to</li>
            <li> /&gt;It got a few blackheads, but nothing worth paying for (maybe 4-5 blackheads came out).</li>
            <li> Get the strip a little wet, smooth it on your nose, let it dry, then gently peel off.</li>
            <li> These little strips rip the clog right out of your pores.</li>
            <li> I am surprised about multiple things, the first being other people&#x27;s comments!</li>
            <li> It only covers the top whether your nose is big or small!</li>
            <li> However after using them for a while didn&#x27;t see much improvement as far as blackheads being any less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have seen many people post pictures of a strip riddled with black heads while I just had a few.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds gross and improper to talk about but half of the fun of these strips is seeing what is on the strip once you&#x27;re done with it.</li>
            <li> You may have to experiment a few times to get the right amount of water on your skin before applying.  </li>
            <li> I tried every possible instruction, and each time was the same: a few pores were clean.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a product for the black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li> The second strip went on fine, it got hard after 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li> I also use a bentonite clay mask once a week before using the pore strips to help bring blackheads and impurities to the surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using these pore strips, my skin has felt much cleaner and the appearance of blackheads and other visible impurities has diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so these strips don&#x27;t really feel like anything to me other than maybe peeling tape off my face.</li>
            <li> Also, you really can&#x27;t use the strips for other parts of your face, unlike with the mask.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d like to clean, and stick this on for about 10 minutes until the strip gets hard (like paper mache).  </li>
            <li> My skin is not that sensitive so it can take the harsh abrasive baking soda, but if your skin is fragile, just use the strips by itself first.</li>
            <li> I do find it is easy to overdo it with the strips as they can be a little bit harsh on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But for a casual person who just wants their nose to look a little better, I highly recommend these. &#x27;</li>
            <li> I filled the directions very closely and it failed to work.</li>
            <li> Ten to 15 minutes later, you&#x27;re finished, and your skin is clear and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin be careful of what you put on your skin after using this or stay away completely.  </li>
            <li> Also, like others have mentioned DO NOT use these strips if you have very sensitive, sunburned or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Also, like others have mentioned DO NOT use these strips if you have very sensitive, sunburned or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I must not have been doing something right because it worked like a dream, a few left</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work very well if you wet with too much or too little water.  </li>
            <li> but I think if you limit to once a week and remove the strip very very slowly, you not only get better results but prevent ripping your pores larger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done, my blackheads are slightly less prominent, but I only have a few of those gross yellowy dots on the strip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the product was changed because the old strips were harsher on sensitive skin, but they also worked extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other pore strips and keep going back to these as they work very well.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect when buying this, but figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Just need to make sure that the strip isn&#x27;t on for too long or else its very hard to pull off and can take some skin with it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had been more careful and took the warning seriously.</li>
            <li> I usually go exactly 10 minutes and when I peel, I do it very slowly and take as much time as I can.  </li>
            <li> After I use a strip, I rinse my nose off, use a towel to dab it dry, and put some [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post</li>
            <li> You have to let them dry completely.</li>
            <li> They work and I see the black heads coming out on the strips, I have really oily skin around my noise</li>
            <li> I think I received an old package from an Amazon seller because the strips we received were completely dry</li>
            <li> It definitely seem to help to leave it on the full 15 minutes at least.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this doesn&#x27;t come in a full face mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these strips on and off for the past few years and have been immensely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You wash the skin, wet it down, dry your hands, then peel one of the white strips off its backing and smooth it onto the nose</li>
            <li> The directions do say to wet your nose first, and I definitely found that if my face is just damp they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as when my face is dripping wet.</li>
            <li> It worked a little, but not as much as some video&#x27;s online or like some people&#x27;s pictures.</li>
            <li> Pulling them off hurts a little, but not too much.</li>
            <li> They do remove a little bit of gunk from my pores, but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> But, they are worth the money (usually 6-8 dollars a box)!</li>
            <li> It was AMAZING, and after 5 weeks, my pores are smaller, and I get less junk off my nose than the first few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;yes, it does look like your pores are larger after the first couple of uses, but that&#x27;s because you&#x27;re removing crap from it that was filling up those pores.</li>
            <li> Let dry until the strips get super hard, like paper</li>
            <li> I use them about every other week to maintain a clear complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would not use again, maybe there is one for sensitive skin I am not aware of, but this is not for all skin types.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty expensive only to not work really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do this often due to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s gentle enough because the pulling on the nose could cause damage.</li>
            <li> For a known brand to suddenly change into different look is strange.</li>
            <li> At I thought I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough, so then I tried it for a longer period of time a week later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time and have only once accidentally left it on too long so that removing was</li>
            <li> But they do really hurt if you get them near the delicate under eye skin, so be careful.</li>
            <li> But they do really hurt if you get them near the delicate under eye skin, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I have used these since the late 90&#x27;s/early 2000s when they first came out.</li>
            <li> When you have completely rinsed off the baking soda, make sure your face is still fairly wet from the cold water and place the pore strips on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking that, I got to admit I barely have any blackhead on nose, so I could not really tell whether it works.</li>
            <li> This product does the job AS LONG AS YOU OPEN UP YOUR PORES.</li>
            <li> home, I read and followed the instructions (clean face, wet nose, place strip, rub down over nose, let sit for 10-15 minutes or until it&#x27;s stiff) as written on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the adhesive isn&#x27;t strong its very weak....</li>
            <li> I do not exactly know why and can only imagine that it is because the squeezing partially damages or clogs again while the strip almost imitates the natural way to get out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nose feels fantastic and I was shocked at how much it got out.</li>
            <li> but yes there were black heads which I have been trying to get clear from I</li>
            <li> Our skin naturally replenishes itself and the oil build up creates black heads.  </li>
            <li> iT REALLY DOES FEEL GOOD WHEN YOUR STRIP LOOKS NASTY!</li>
            <li> There was definitely dirt pulled from nearly each pore when using the stripes, but one day later it was just all back again, and I wash my face like a fanatic.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is weird but other strips have worked better for me.</li>
            <li> They definitely clear up my nose a little, but not all the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Biore pore strips before, and I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a dud box or what, but the strips don&#x27;t feel the same when I use them and they also don&#x27;t remove as much as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> My skin is always a little sensitive after using them.</li>
            <li> These will not stick long enough to pull out anything even when I apply them to a very dry face.</li>
            <li> For most of us, the hardest things to take out of our face, are nasty little blackheads, which mostly get caught up in our nose, and clog up in our pores.</li>
            <li> A lot of times exfoliating scrubs are not enough especially when pores tend to be a little bigger (like mine are).</li>
            <li> Be sure to fully rinse the baking soda off of your face with cold water.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this Item is old or what the problem is, I ordered several boxes, with the hopes of getting rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li> My nose tends to get very oily, and a few years ago I noticed that I had tons of dark blackheads in my pores.</li>
            <li> So next you&#x27;ll want to wet the nose and apply the strip.  </li>
            <li> After several tries.</li>
            <li> You may have minor discomfort while pulling them off</li>
            <li> dont know how long.</li>
            <li> and I examine the strips for too long every time.</li>
            <li> sticks only when wet.  </li>
            <li> i THINK I WILL NEVER COMPLETELY ELIMINATED THE BLACKHEADS FROM MY NOSE, BUT</li>
            <li> you will see long time result.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Like if you haven&#x27;t used strips or mask or exfoliant in a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive and as long as I moisturize afterwards and treat my nose with a bit of respect for a few days</li>
            <li> Definitely gets down deep in the pores, locks in, and pulls all the gunk out!</li>
            <li> (my blackheads are only in the creases of my nose, and they didn&#x27;t stick properly unless I held them down for 30 seconds).  </li>
            <li> Although i do have a few spots where i&#x27;ll see some left behind, but it&#x27;s okay because the majority of the black heads were removed.</li>
            <li> - I use a gentle face wash, a pore refining wash, a hydrating toner, and then moisturizer ever day yet still had a few tiny black heads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions exactly; wet my nose, applied, let dry for 15 minutes, then pulled off.</li>
            <li> THIS DEF DOES MAKE IT LOOK LESS GROSS WHEN USED ON A REGULAR BASIS, SAY TWICE A WEEK</li>
            <li> This got rid of blackheads I have been trying to remove for a long, long time!  </li>
            <li> That can be (in dry weather) about as long as it takes to brush your teeth, or maybe read a chapter.  </li>
            <li> I thought, hey, all it does is pull the damn blackheads out, how is that supposed to enlarge pores?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the result of my naivete showed up not more than a week later: my pores, which had stayed about the same size since my teenage years, have multiplied in size and visibility.</li>
            <li> I use these strips weekly to every other week, and my pores have been a lot cleaner and smaller.</li>
            <li> It left my nose a little red</li>
            <li> Hope amazon will carry them for a long time !</li>
            <li> and they just become loose or fall off long before the 10 or 15 minutes recommended to leave them on.  </li>
            <li> Over the last year, I tried a few other beauty routines such as using facial scrubs, acne face washes, organic face washes, pimple spot-on correction medication, etc.</li>
            <li> Woman always comment how healthy my skin looks and these bad boys definitely help with that.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them if your nose is particularly dry because this might irritate it.</li>
            <li> Does not hurt, does not irritate skin but sadly also doesnt clean my pores...</li>
            <li> When completely dry, remove the strip and wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Wait until the strip is completely dry and peel off.</li>
            <li> let it dry</li>
            <li> All it did was dry up and then peel off.</li>
            <li> Also, the strip leaves your skin uncomfortably dry where it was.</li>
            <li> FOLLOW DIRECTIONS AND DONT REMOVE UNTIL REALLY DRY.</li>
            <li> After the strips had been on our noses for about 15 minutes and started feeling really dry, we each pulled them off.  </li>
            <li> After the strips dry on you nose you peel it</li>
            <li> When I remove them, the strip is clean and fails to serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I wait until they are thoroughly dry and peel them off, and it brings tears to my eyes trying to get them off.</li>
            <li> It takes a while for the strip to dry on your skin - about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> By the time you wash, scrub, and dry your face</li>
            <li> Not sure about the long term use or if these help reduce your blackheads for recurring, but so far I have gotten a ton of&lt;br /&gt;Gunk</li>
            <li> I use mind only on the end of my nose and not up near delicate eye</li>
            <li> I look at them in amazement every single time I pull them off my nose.</li>
            <li> Very little came off on the strip, and I followed the directions completely.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE,  someone who it works for tell me EXACTLY what you do for it to pull off at least some black heads..</li>
            <li> The first time I did it, it looked like thick black hairs all over the strip.</li>
            <li> , just one suggestion, don&#x27;t leave them on too long,  a must have for removing black &amp; white heads from your nose.</li>
            <li> I use one of these every other week just to help keep my skin clear of the dirt that gets trapped in the pours.</li>
            <li> The only way to get clear pores is to use this often which can be irritating to the skin and time consuming, especially for guys.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can actually see the results on the strip if you look at it from the side against a dark background, you will see everything the strip has removed from your face.</li>
            <li> The strips took a long time to get harder</li>
            <li> As long as you slightly wet your nose(not the strip), the pore strip will stick.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these strips for several years for black heads.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this for myself, because I do not have visible black heads on my nose</li>
            <li> When he used it OMG it pulled out every black head and it looked soo gross</li>
            <li> It definitely gets those black heads out.</li>
            <li> They DO NOT pull out black heads - they only leave a glue on your nose, and you need to wash and scrub it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try saving half a strip after you open the foil package though, because it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> TIP: If you are ever in a Japanese store, go to the cosmetics section and they sometimes will sell black pore strips for men!/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FUN</li>
            <li> I actually cut one in half and tried it on my chin.</li>
            <li> All you do is wet it, place it on your nose, wait 15 mins for it to dry then rip it off for your \\&quot;surprise\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Your face must be wet when applying, but your hands should be dry.</li>
            <li> These do work at pulling out black heads, but unless you add something else to your regimen to prevent them, they&#x27;re just going to come back.</li>
            <li> Theres an odd satisfaction that comes from seeing all the gross stuff that isn&#x27;t in your face</li>
            <li> Misses just before the bridge of my nose, and I&#x27;ve tried adjusting the strip, applying different pressure, adding water and putting less water on.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the big black heads</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve often cut strips in half, to get areas like beneath the corners of my mouth, or upper chin.</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY DREDDED BLACKHEAD AND WHITEHEADS, ALSO SMALL FACIAL HAIR</li>
            <li> It wont pick up the smaller black heads either.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wash your face regularly if your worried about black heads</li>
            <li> It is kind of disgusting to see the little blackheads on the sticky sheet, but it&#x27;s so fulfilling to know that gunk is off your face ;)</li>
            <li> My hubby gets black heads bad and his nose looks amazing after using these...</li>
            <li> When you take this off, it hurts your face, it does nothing to black heads and is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have wasted so much money on other products that did very little if anything.</li>
            <li> but I do have tiny little bumps.</li>
            <li> but if you check the strip side which had adhered to your skin you will definitely see spikey little blackheads adhered to the strip.</li>
            <li> I actually pour a little water on it and shake the excess off</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading some reviews that said the strips didn&#x27;t stick... let me just say, whoever wrote those reviews was clearly not following the directions.</li>
            <li> A gross amount of black heads emerged onto the strip EVEN THOUGH I use a facial scrub every other day &amp; use face wipes EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> They are so powerful and remove nearly all the ugly blackheads.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, is that I wish they were larger.</li>
            <li> My biggest piece of advice- cut the strip so it does not stick to the delicate skin near your eye and cheek.</li>
            <li> I use scrubs and masks and I couldn&#x27;t seem to get rid of the blackheads on my nose, but these got rid of them after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve been disappointed with these, try (manually, especially if you have sensitive skin) exfoliating your noise first with either a sponge or a clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Works as  expected.</li>
            <li> Now my nose has big pores from picking and it tends to clog from the moisturizer/sunscreen that I put on everyday.</li>
            <li> Having declared an all-out war against my pores a few months ago, I&#x27;ve attacked them with countless highly-rated anti-pore product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you try to remove the strips,</li>
            <li> and when I peeled them off, the only thing different about my fave was the goo it left behind around where I had the strip.</li>
            <li> Worked just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Ensure you follow directions carefully when using this product.</li>
            <li> The package itself arrived a bit crushed but it didn&#x27;t harm the contents itself</li>
            <li> /&gt;- packaging - but not really</li>
            <li> These strips totally cleaned the gunk that was trapped in my pores.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It says you also shouldn&#x27;t use them if you have acne, but I&#x27;ve definitely used them with a few pimples with no adverse side effects.</li>
            <li> It says you also shouldn&#x27;t use them if you have acne, but I&#x27;ve definitely used them with a few pimples with no adverse side effects.</li>
            <li> But it works about as well as I expected it to, and my nose looks a lot cleaner than without.</li>
            <li> you apply it on your nose on your wet nose</li>
            <li> I simply wet my nose as the instructions said to do, put the strip on and forgot it for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using these, there&#x27;s really no lasting change in my pores</li>
            <li> It should have that \\&quot;wet sand\\&quot; feel.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that it doesn&#x27;t work at all on the center of your nose or on your chin.</li>
            <li> I have some blackheads that are not really visible but this strip did pull them out.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it, especially if your trouble spots are the sides of your nose.</li>
            <li> Avoid air pockets when applying by carefully pressing to skin as you put it on, sort of like rolling wallpaper, to get in the nose crevices.</li>
            <li> but it seems like the strips have a wide range of results.</li>
            <li> - they worked just as I expected and needed them to.</li>
            <li> Wet nose, peel strip, place strip on nose.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not a whole bunch of junk underneath the product.</li>
            <li> It only got a few out.</li>
            <li> It is so rough on my skin</li>
            <li> Just do how it says:  after shower, wet your nose and stick the strip.</li>
            <li> The strip literally did nothing except pull off some dead skin and the tiny blond hairs on my nose.</li>
            <li> Simply wet your nose, apply the strip,</li>
            <li> I bought it on amazon and only paid a few bugs and not $20 like at the stores in NYC.</li>
            <li> Just wash your face and wet and apply the strip, after it dries, peel it off, and behold what was clogging your pores.</li>
            <li> You peel the plastic backing off of the strips and apply it to wet skin.</li>
            <li> I had never really noticed, but it started to bother me, so I tried these strips.</li>
            <li> According to the directions, you wet the area of your face</li>
            <li> I got my nose wet, but they still didn&#x27;t stick or pick anything up..</li>
            <li> We wet them with water and tried them again</li>
            <li> The package says you can wet the strips to remove them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the green and pink Biore strip packaging (the Ultra deep cleansing strips I believe they&#x27;re called )before, and I must say, I prefer those over</li>
            <li> doesnt work as good as the deep cleaning ones which is annoying but you only get 6 of those fer same price wtf</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terribly noticeable blackheads, but I saw these at the local grocery store and decided to give them a try and see if they&#x27;re as good as I&#x27;ve heard they are.</li>
            <li> It was disgusting and fascinating at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have tried these a few times thus far - and while (in my few experiences) they do work to some extent, they did not remove everything.  </li>
            <li> The only possible way that these strips help is right when you get out of the shower... when your pores are open (from the steam) and the crap inside can be yanked out.</li>
            <li> It definitely gets the black heads out!</li>
            <li> TIP: If you are ever in a Japanese store, go to the cosmetics section and they sometimes will sell black pore strips for men!</li>
            <li> I used these and saw the gross little white or black &#x27;trees&#x27; all over the strip, but it did nothing for the day to day black heads</li>
            <li> but I can just position them a little differently every other time I use them.</li>
            <li> like I mentioned, these won&#x27;t completely get rid of them, and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting the blackheads on the sides of my nose, so you might want to look into other products or ask a specialist.</li>
            <li> Maybe in a few weeks I&#x27;ll cut the strips into small pieces and just do a little section at a time, it might be easier to spot treat this way as the strips are a bit large for me.</li>
            <li> They certainly do not \\&quot;lock on and pull out dirt\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I used these, my strip was full of nasty business.</li>
            <li> The adhesive is not strong enough and does not stay attached to the strip, it ends up just staying on your face.</li>
            <li> but on the long run you will have less blackheads if you stop squeezing them out but instead use a strip 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was a little disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> My nose itches and is dry immediately afterward, but my skin is noticeably less greasy and clearer for days after.</li>
            <li> It seems like a short term solution, not something that will work long term(at least for me).</li>
            <li> But leaving it on that long or longer seemed to irritate my skin a little.</li>
            <li> Let it dry properly till it feels hard and then pull it off.</li>
            <li> price seems a little bit expensive than the selling in grocery store, at least the grocery store in my area had a better deal than amazon price.</li>
            <li> I have been known to use the Philosophy microdelivery peel, clarisonic, and THEN a pore strip (probably not a good idea if you have sensitive skin, but I have yet to have an adverse reaction)...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other brands, but this has worked well for me for years.</li>
            <li> I did it again a few days ago after not doing it for so long, and it did it again,</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands that are cheaper, but always return to Biore.</li>
            <li> I search for other brands and I could not find any, even in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this to the variety of scrubs or other masks.</li>
            <li> Of course, I still have some other blackheads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pretty to look at</li>
            <li> unfortunately I&#x27;m cursed with pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why biore claims we can&#x27;t use them in other parts of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive, too when you look at the cost per strip.</li>
            <li> But, I still have to exfoliate every other day to keep the pore gunk overflow at bay.</li>
            <li> Well as physics would have it when they fold and overlap each other</li>
            <li> way cheaper on amazon than at the other stores like target or cvs</li>
            <li> No complaints as it works as expected!</li>
            <li> I have try other products, they dont work</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other products from Biore, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the brand.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the pictures I had seen of other people&#x27;s strips were just marketing schlock, but I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> nose feels renewed, and I have to wonder what effect this would have on other parts of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My experiences did NOT echo the other reviews here that 100% of the stuff was removed and the exfoliation process of the nose was 100%.  </li>
            <li> great.&lt;br /&gt;Apply on wet nose.&lt;br /&gt;Leave for long, until hard and dry..</li>
            <li> You simply wet your face, and put the pore strip on your nose, and let it set after around a half hour.</li>
            <li> I have tried leaving it on for much longer periods with similar disappointing results.</li>
            <li> I still recommend trying them at least, a box of 14 isn&#x27;t overly expensive (about $8 at Wal-mart), so it won&#x27;t be a huge loss of money if they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as I expected, and it does not really clean the nose.</li>
            <li> Needless to say from the title, it certainly worked.</li>
            <li> I think blackheads are hard to remove because there isn&#x27;t enough surface area for these patches to grab.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These simple little strips gotten rid of the blackheads by 95%!!</li>
            <li> ive had no success</li>
            <li> I do wear makeup, wash my face at least twice daily (once at night, once in the morning) and have been using this product for two years on and off.</li>
            <li> I just bought a pack of these tonight for the first time in a long, long time, and was a tad disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> I have an average about of blackheads around my nose</li>
            <li> so not worth it</li>
            <li> And you definitely should leave it on a few minutes past when it dries.</li>
            <li> only one my complaint about it is that it is NOT cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that sometimes the \\&quot;glue\\&quot; sticks to my skin rather than pulling out the sebum as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> $7 for a pack of 8 strips, these are definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have small blackheads (but a lot of them), and only a few get pulled up by the strip.</li>
            <li> The key to getting the excess oils out of the pores is going extremely slow.  </li>
            <li> conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re worth it, but use them sparingly; the glue is a bit painful and it can dry out your skin, which means you&#x27;ll need to moisturize, which can clog up the pores you just opened.</li>
            <li> Quality seem to have gone down and not a lot comes out.  </li>
            <li> the quality of biore pore strips have gone down over the years.</li>
            <li> I mean that they get out only like 40% of everything.</li>
            <li> that the removal can sometimes be a little uncomfortable, they stick pretty well- not waxing painful, more like slowly pulling off a bandaid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll say average reduction of black heads between us 4 &#x3D; 80%</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions perfectly, and after painfully ripping the dried out, Papier-mâch&amp;eacute;d strip from my nose, I was slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried the baking soda and water method as described in a few other reviews, though I can&#x27;t attest yet to how it compares with not using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, and it smells bad, but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> but it did not remove anything for me since I do not have black heads.</li>
            <li> You can see all the blacK heads on the strip, after you done.</li>
            <li> I always had these black dots on my nose, A LOT OF THEM, and I never knew what they were.</li>
            <li> I have had acne, and I heard the black spots could be blackheads.</li>
            <li> but I still have a lot of black dots in my noce</li>
            <li> If you want to remove black heads with ease and no pain, I would recommend these strips.</li>
            <li> but I have been getting black heads from the taping etc</li>
            <li> but they were so expensive (15$ for only 6 strips) and gave the same result as these biore pore strips..</li>
            <li> Got them to get rid if black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li> Overall I believe this is the product that is essential for anyone, try it on a weekly basis and you won&#x27;t get wrong.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;What are all those black dots?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull anything out of my pores, still have black heads after using for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> By this time, the strip is ready to come off, and it can be painful if you have tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> I just cut the strips in half to stick between my brows or on my chin</li>
            <li> The mixture draws out the black heads.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> The black color is not dirt but is oxidation.  </li>
            <li> If you have black heads chances are that its genetic.  </li>
            <li> It removed the biggest ones, but my nose was still covered in black heads.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always take out all black heads.</li>
            <li> but i get a lot of black heads and popping them</li>
            <li> I have had black heads on my noise since I can remember.</li>
            <li> but if I keep up with it my black heads stay gone.</li>
            <li> , I use this every 4-6 weeks and still have a hundred or so black heads on the pad.  </li>
            <li> I dont get alot of black heads</li>
            <li> Save it and buy something else like those black gel porestrips on Amazon (they&#x27;re cheaper</li>
            <li> cut one of them in half (quarter did not work for me) and stick it on the from the bottom up</li>
            <li> The strips didn&#x27;t get all of my black heads out, but there was a lot on the strip, so hopefully the rest will come out with continuous use.</li>
            <li> After I apply the strips to my face and wait the recommended time, I can&#x27;t release them since the &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; is just a yucky mess</li>
            <li> As it dries it develops a tight paper mâch&amp;eacute; feeling</li>
            <li> I recommend a Clarisonic and the Boscia Black Mask, or Apivita&#x27;s green clay mask and those should target the root of the blackhead issue, rather than just temporarily removing them with a strip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips for years to remove blackheads and little things that you never even knew lived on your nose.</li>
            <li> You can buy these strips anywhere but a little bit cheaper here.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to just use these after they wash there face, I&#x27;d have little to no results this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also can be a little drying, but when you put water on it after, the stickyness would go away.</li>
            <li> and they would show up like little hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m that kid that used to pick his acne a lot when he was a little kid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gratifying to see your strip after you&#x27;ve used it with the little blackheads all over.</li>
            <li> The strips are a little pricey</li>
            <li> There was a bunch of little things on the strip that looked like little hairs.  </li>
            <li> I get these all the time since I like to see the results, you can literally see little bumps afterward where your pores have been cleaned out..</li>
            <li> It opens them up a little, but doesn&#x27;t remove any of the dirt or grime in them.</li>
            <li> I put the strip under my &#x27;day&#x27; lamp and a magnifying glass because it looked like dark stubbles of hair!</li>
            <li> but then they got a little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> , they make this little &amp;#34;tent&amp;#34; that doesn&#x27;t stick to your nose, allowing anything under it to not get pulled out.  </li>
            <li> so when you apply it, it will slide a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It got maybe a couple little blackheads out, but that&#x27;s literally it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting this about 10 minutes after I removed the strip, and the area still stings a little bit.</li>
            <li> Given my fastidious cleansing regime, I knew there was little chance of it removing any dirt from my nose.</li>
            <li> it was striped with little spikes of dirt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, these go on a wet face and they dry sort of like a cast for a broken bone</li>
            <li> After about a month and a half of using the strips twice a week, I&#x27;ve started having very large, painful breakouts on my nose which has never happened before.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t do it the hard way,gently and take it slow, just as suggested on the back of the strips pack.</li>
            <li> I only left one on for about 7 minutes (until it was hard), and it was so difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no idea that my nose was bad, and it definitely isn&#x27;t compared to a lot of the videos you see out there of massive blackheads being pulled out.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update : well it&#x27;s been a few months since I used these</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update : well it&#x27;s been a few months since I used these</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a few reviewers did not have any luck with the product.</li>
            <li> even after a few days.</li>
            <li> dried out and wouldn&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li> Yeah.. the title says it - don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> If you want to waste your money on a product that doesn&#x27;t do anything, get a pet rock.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble, embarrassment and money.</li>
            <li> and my boyfriend has heavy blackheads on his nose.</li>
            <li> Actually using this made my nose acne worse.</li>
            <li> but I will just have to try again in a few days.</li>
            <li> These are so effective in cleaning out your pores and keeping those nasty blackheads away!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to think that I wasted almost $10 for NO REASON.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep on for 15-30 minutes until the strip becomes really firm</li>
            <li> Doing all this will lower the chance of dirt and oil from being trapped in your pores.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wont recommend it and dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions though because if you screw it up it won&#x27;t stick correctly and you&#x27;ll have wasted some money.  </li>
            <li> I tried these a few times to reduce the amount of blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition that, during healing, also produces quite a few blackheads.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works for at the surface and peals off dead skin, but doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> only makes my skin look worse.</li>
            <li> With regular washing and these pore strips I have decreased the size of my poor&#x27;s by 80% and my face looks 10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my nose is average to small, and that the strip coves my nose and the beginning parts of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> but there were still quite a few still stuck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years now</li>
            <li> Not smelly or messy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its garbage... Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I got these strips again a few weeks ago, again, hoping they&#x27;d improved.</li>
            <li> Ive tried it a few times and it still won&#x27;t get everything out.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money or time...</li>
            <li> It does leave a few be hind, but over all it works.</li>
            <li> and I would think they should be wet or at least moist.</li>
            <li> In fact, for the next few days, my pores looked the worse they had in some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t reach down past the nostrils, which also have a ton of clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afterward, I dry my face with a towel, then use my bare hand(not a towel) to apply cold water all over my nose, and apply the strip.</li>
            <li> almost half of my blackheads would get removed each time I&#x27;d use one of these!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have excessive black heads don&#x27;t do this every week.</li>
            <li> So buy these strips if you have oily skin like me &amp; you need to get rid of those unsightly black heads !&lt;</li>
            <li> Takes away ALL my black heads!</li>
            <li> They can get a little tough to remove if you leave them on too long.</li>
            <li> I have really pale skin</li>
            <li> I usually stand over the sink and gently rub it off while I splash the cold water onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I have been a user of these for over a decade and have tired various store brands, including CVS and what a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> It was a little painful to remove the strip, but just add a little water &amp; it won&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> I havent tired it that long</li>
            <li> I used this on my nose for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> After I peel them off, I have to inspect them, because I think it&#x27;s so cool that so much crap is coming out of my pores.</li>
            <li> I must agree with other users that the quality seems to have decreased - perhaps the company&#x27;s using less adhesive.</li>
            <li> out\\&quot; with just one little strip!</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t mean it deserves a less of a star</li>
            <li> I get large, painful breakouts on the area I used them.</li>
            <li> It is a very weak white head cleanser and does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, but it&#x27;s hard to use and kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> but 8 is usually the highest i can get</li>
            <li> I have used these in the past but never remembered why I stopped...now I do.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like this product as it leaves sticky residue on my nose which I have to scrape</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will see all the small dirt n grime leave your nose, it doesnt get all of it</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure what this does.</li>
            <li> Most horrible product I ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> No more concerns about running out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I was never able to get the results described on the commercials where there is a forest of blackheads.</li>
            <li> After the shower, combine a small amount of baking soda with water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them again and again because my boyfriend usually has some on hand.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the hype is about.</li>
            <li> I usually leave mine on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> They do rip off a layer of skin, thus probably why using them not more than once every 3 days is instructed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I have small pores or</li>
            <li> Used these in the past.</li>
            <li> cuz the mayority of the Exfoliators can do small cuts as particles on your face just as the “St Eve Apricot exfoliator”.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time - usually twice a week - which is why I&#x27;m on the subscribe and save 14 count box.  </li>
            <li> of the little spikes of brown, oxidized gunk it wicked away were as thin as half a millimeter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is designed to be used on your nose, but I&#x27;ve had luck cutting it in half to use on my cheeks or using the entire strip on my forehead.</li>
            <li> but everybody says it is not good to your skin when try to tear the black pore away.</li>
            <li> It did leave a lot behind, I went and looked in my lighted magnifying mirror to confirm, but, this is probably due to operator error.</li>
            <li> I need to try it again, and will update after I do, but it&#x27;s hard to get motivated to use them again after the first experience. :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years now and they work really well at pulling all of the crap out of your pores.</li>
            <li> The most annoying part of these strips is the uncomfortable feeling</li>
            <li> was a little disappointed that quite a few blackheads remained on my nose but that could be because I didn&#x27;t put enough pressure on those parts when I applied the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So they definitely work, but probably not very well, at least for my nose :(</li>
            <li> I would like to have other 4 strips back :(</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have always had blackheads on my nose which are not effectively covered by makeup.</li>
            <li> I remembered these from the late 90&#x27;s and decided to give them a try and they worked.</li>
            <li> I used to use these all the time for years, but lately the gummy stuff stays on the sides of my nose, defeating the purpose.</li>
            <li> And I feel like I would be judged if I didn&#x27;t at least try.</li>
            <li> I have been getting a lot of whiteheads lately under my chin</li>
            <li> At least not until I found these strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips for at least five years.</li>
            <li> And I haven&#x27;t a complaint.</li>
            <li> Not for me at least.</li>
            <li> you need to leave it on for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> My nose always feels smoother (and call me crazy, but it feels smaller)</li>
            <li> It does hurt to rip it off after it has dried and does leave some tape residue behind.</li>
            <li> They do not hurt coming off; pull slowly.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little afraid to use them again as it was pretty painful getting it off.</li>
            <li> Please, I&#x27;m begging you not to waste your money!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so dang expensive at other stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean it gets stuff off my nose</li>
            <li> I believe a box of 14 strips retails for about $8; Amazon usually has them for cheaper!</li>
            <li> The strip was clean when I took it off...and let me tell you, pulling the strip off hurts so bad!!</li>
            <li> It was nasty, but my nose felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I was a little doubtful of if it would actually work</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> It was so much dirt that I got shocked!</li>
            <li> Works well, shocking to see the pad after first use!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cycling for a bit, and started noticing how bad the blackheads were getting on and around my nose, even after showering, scrubbing, and/or using facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> Addictive to see your blackheads come out, but bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> but clogged pores and blackheads are not a good look on anyone.</li>
            <li> it looked like hundreds of spikes on the other side, was crazy.  </li>
            <li> I actually feel disappointed when I take it off</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried these strips and was left disappointed.</li>
            <li> I let the strips dry for 12 minutes and then removing them so incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> you see all the dirt and black heads coming out...if the nose is too dirty you may need to repeat twice or thrice</li>
            <li> After peeling off the dry strip (yes, this is a bit painful), the blackheads appear on the strip.  </li>
            <li> Pores close when subject to cold.</li>
            <li> have to peel it off VERY SLOWLY.</li>
            <li> me, there is usually only one of two little blackheads pulled out, but my boyfriend&#x27;s strips come out delightfully disgusting</li>
            <li> I find it annoying and prefer to have smaller, cleaning pores.</li>
            <li> If you do, you&#x27;ll feel blackhead problem gets worse than before.</li>
            <li> I used this after using the Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque since it was leaving some blackheads behind.</li>
            <li> I immediately became concerned about the broken capillaries around my nose.</li>
            <li> the part between the nostrils or the base of your nose, just above the nostrils).</li>
            <li> We felt as though this product was poor quality.</li>
            <li> use them once or twice a month, because using them too often can be irritating.</li>
            <li> My pores tend to get clogged and its impossible to keep my nose from getting tons of black heads.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really nasty, full of dirty blackheads.</li>
            <li> The pore strips works wonders and usually takes out majority of the dirty gunk in my pores.</li>
            <li> I was feeling down about the blackheads and researched on how to remove these ugly things.</li>
            <li> Much much Less painful than having to steam and then pluck out the blackheads at a salon.</li>
            <li> And when you stretch out your pores it is easier for them to catch dirt and its just not good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked even though it can be a little painful to take strips off.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, remove the strip very slowly.</li>
            <li> I have been a little disappointed in these strips.</li>
            <li> AGAIN, PULL SLOWLY!!</li>
            <li> AGAIN, PULL SLOWLY!!</li>
            <li> Its also its very weird how the strip doesn&#x27;t seem to harden (HARDLY) ..</li>
            <li> (Hardening to the point of painful removal usually happens if you wait longer than 15 min.  </li>
            <li> or if I just got a bad batch but these hardly worked.</li>
            <li> They just get expensive for how often I need to use them.</li>
            <li> not impressed.</li>
            <li> Got the job done but left terrible bruises on my nose... will not be using again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so so sooo confused as to why it works for others?!</li>
            <li> I never get tired of seeing all the gunk on the strips, grosssss!</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, it desn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was skeptical whether it would work for me</li>
            <li> They still do something though and aren&#x27;t completely useless - they just don&#x27;t work for me that well.</li>
            <li> This one works somehow, not perfectly.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, but I just cannot recommend these strips.</li>
            <li> I have horrible blackheads on my nose always have, when I was younger</li>
            <li> Its scary to see the stuff these strips will pull out of your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li> Guilty pleasure of mine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy often because these things are so expensive.</li>
            <li> effective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making a completely useless product, Biore. -_-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it is not a perfect item.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use these until they fail me.</li>
            <li> Sorry Biore&#x27;, for me, these strips were a flop.</li>
            <li> But I followed the directions and everything, and am frustrated to have broken out even worse after using this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the strips work.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> That skin is very delicate and in my opinion its just waaaaay too painful to remove the strip from that area once it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit painful to remove them--but no more painful than peeling a band-aid off</li>
            <li> Its crazy when you take it off and realize all of that stuff was on your nose.  </li>
            <li> Rinse your skin with cold water.</li>
            <li> I can see the dirty stuff get out from my pore.</li>
            <li> Clears out my dirty pores.</li>
            <li> In the meantime you&#x27;ll look like a crazy person with a a bandaid on your nose.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> Seeing the stuff on the strip is my guilty pleasure!</li>
            <li> is almost impossible.</li>
            <li> I used to have bad acne on my nose, so I tried these.</li>
            <li> The strips hurt soooo bad</li>
            <li> I used to have bad problems with blackheads on my nose before using this.</li>
            <li> My pores are particularly bad on my cheeks, sides of my nose, between my eye brows, and my chin (the dreaded T-zone).</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t know they were THAT bad.</li>
            <li> My complexion isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> These strips are supposedly really bad for your face, and yet, I buy them.  </li>
            <li> attention then to the nose, the pores sit agape, as if individually shocked about what just happened.</li>
            <li> When I pulled it off I was shocked at what it had pulled from my pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The peeling off can be painful, like peeling off a band-aid.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have horrible pores to start out with, but I think they&#x27;re worse now...</li>
            <li> I get a sick sense of satisfaction looking at what it removes, too.</li>
            <li> I have a sick sense of curiosity every time I use these to see what my pores were hiding.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep buying these, its some sort of sick need to see all the junk that accumulates in my pores.  </li>
            <li> It does sux when you&#x27;re have all this anticipation of ripping this thing and comes up disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Dont really work too well to be honest. ive had no success</li>
            <li> Sometimes you need to get those nose pores cleaned out.  Not a frequent user, but this stuff works fine.</li>
            <li> this item works well!</li>
            <li> I have been using these strips for several years for black heads. They work best after you have had a shower. I always need to cut the strips into smaller pieces before I apply them, may be the shape of my nose! If I apply the whole thing I seem to have loose edges. Let it dry properly till it feels hard and then pull it off.</li>
            <li> The most important thing to remember about these strips is that when removing, remove very, VERY slowly. If you rip it off, it will take out the blackheads and a couple layers of skin. Other than that, does exactly what it says. A good moisturizer afterwards is a must.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this for myself, because I do not have visible black heads on my nose but I do have tiny little bumps. So I gave this a try but it did not remove anything for me since I do not have black heads. I made my boyfriend try it to see if it was just me or the product didn&#x27;t work. When he used it OMG it pulled out every black head and it looked soo gross but it did the job amazingly for him. After using the strips twice his nose was blackhead free! So I ended up giving it to him because I do not need it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to amazon everything is cheaper.. I will buy these again soon!  I used to buy the CVS brand ones but theres just something about the real thing that works better!</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me but it might be I need something stronger</li>
            <li> The item arrived pretty fast, in good condition. The strips work good, but I&#x27;d prefer them to be slightly longer, they&#x27;re 5mm shorter than I&#x27;d like them to be.</li>
            <li> These pore strips are awesome!  I use them about once a week and I&#x27;ve noticed an immense improvement in my skin.  I use scrubs and masks and I couldn&#x27;t seem to get rid of the blackheads on my nose, but these got rid of them after only a few uses.  I now just use for maintenance.  The directions do say to wet your nose first, and I definitely found that if my face is just damp they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as when my face is dripping wet.</li>
            <li> I do like to use these, although I don&#x27;t think they work as well as they used to. But this was a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I used these strips to get rid of the HORRIBLE blackheads on my nose that I have had for YEARS! I have not been able to get rid of them no matter what I tried. I even tried the blackhead removal tool (with the suction cup) and that didnt do ANYTHING. I was feeling down about the blackheads and researched on how to remove these ugly things. Finally, I came across the Biore Pore Strips. I decided to pick some up and when I used them, I WAS AMAZED AT THE RESULTS!!! These simple little strips gotten rid of the blackheads by 95%!! Im sure after using it maybe another time, the blackheads will be completely gone! I now feel so confident about my appearance. I recommend these to ANYONE with blackheads on their nose or face!</li>
            <li> I purchased one from Wal-mart and keep using it every week. The strip is not sticky enough and sometimes even slip off my nose, I guess a pore cleaner might doing a better job than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking that, I got to admit I barely have any blackhead on nose, so I could not really tell whether it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips for years to remove blackheads and little things that you never even knew lived on your nose.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Does just what is says it will do- more people should use these! There&#x27;s no shame in that- but clogged pores and blackheads are not a good look on anyone.</li>
            <li> I used the Biore strips here and generic ones I bought at the supermarket. The supermarket ones were better. These strips barely work.</li>
            <li> It really does pull out white and lback heads. It wont pull all, but most will come out and you can see them prickling out of the material when you pull it off your face.</li>
            <li> Works great to get rid of blackheads, been using this for years.</li>
            <li> It removed every gunk I had on my nose. I can&#x27;t see myself being able to live without it.</li>
            <li> I have used these since the late 90&#x27;s/early 2000s when they first came out. I have oily skin and have always had blackheads on my nose which are not effectively covered by makeup. Biore strips have always worked for me to remove most (not all) of the blackheads, if I remember to use them 2x a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip which has really increased how much yucky stuff they remove is to exfoliate first. I have been known to use the Philosophy microdelivery peel, clarisonic, and THEN a pore strip (probably not a good idea if you have sensitive skin, but I have yet to have an adverse reaction)... and WOW, I get 10x more stuff that way. I think removing the dead skin cells really helps these be able to grab what is in the pores. Even just gently exfoliating with my Konjac sponge first is helpful, and I get so much more on the strip than if I just do it without having exfoliated recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been disappointed with these, try (manually, especially if you have sensitive skin) exfoliating your noise first with either a sponge or a clarisonic. It makes a huge difference. I wish I would have figured this tip out in my teens, but better late than never!</li>
            <li> You can buy these strips anywhere but a little bit cheaper here. It definitely gets those black heads out. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is my second pack. I use about once a week. All the zits come off in one rip.You can see all the blacK heads on the strip, after you done. Its kind of icky  looking, but your skin is clean</li>
            <li> I give it a 5 star because it worked a lot better than the other brands that I&#x27;ve tried. It really pulled stuff out of your pores. You get an instant satisfaction from it. Try it and you will be happy that you did if you have black heads around your nose area.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well this strip works. Totally worth it, you will not be disapointed.</li>
            <li> I will buy again. Works great!!!!</li>
            <li> bought for girlfriend, she seems to like this fine</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a review coming from a guy who cares about hygiene. I remember using these strips when they first came out over 10 years ago, and they worked great- almost half of my blackheads would get removed each time I&#x27;d use one of these! Over the last couple of years though, something&#x27;s happened to the strips, and while they still work well, only about a third of my blackheads get removed with one strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips are easy to use, and as long as you -follow the directions-, you shouldn&#x27;t be having any problems. Get your nose wet, and with dry hands, place the strip on your nose, covering the area where most of the problem blackheads are. Leave it on there for 10-15 minutes (when the strip has hardened), and then peel it at the sides. Examine it closely, and you&#x27;re sure to see a bunch of junk that it sucked out of your pores. It&#x27;s actually fascinating to look at, and beats pinching your nose, getting one blackhead out at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But like I mentioned, these won&#x27;t completely get rid of them, and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting the blackheads on the sides of my nose, so you might want to look into other products or ask a specialist. But for a casual person who just wants their nose to look a little better, I highly recommend these. &#x27;not a bad price either on here!</li>
            <li> It cleans a lot but everybody says it is not good to your skin when try to tear the black pore away. I order the Kiehls amazon mask to clean the pore and will see how it works.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores that are congested and always look clogged with blackheads.  I try to use Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips once a week as part of my skin regimen. I also use a bentonite clay mask once a week before using the pore strips to help bring blackheads and impurities to the surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using these pore strips, my skin has felt much cleaner and the appearance of blackheads and other visible impurities has diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something very satisfying about peeling off the strips and seeing what was picked up. The more &amp;#34;spiky&amp;#34; the pore strip looks, the better!</li>
            <li> When it does come down to beauty, we often are looking for the best product to get rid of lifes, little facial escapes. For most of us, the hardest things to take out of our face, are nasty little blackheads, which mostly get caught up in our nose, and clog up in our pores. But, most facial products don&#x27;t show how good they can deliver. For Biore&#x27;, they have delivered very well at getting rid of our blackheads from our face, and that has continued to show with their Picture Perfect Pore Strips. I really was impressed at how much it got rid of after my first use. You simply wet your face, and put the pore strip on your nose, and let it set after around a half hour. Then take it off, and you&#x27;ll see fewer blackheads on your nose. I absolutely recommend these Biore&#x27; Pore Perfect Strips as a great buy for a picture pefect way at getting rid of your blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: B 1/2-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convience: B+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: B 1/2+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these types of nose strips on and off for yeas. I never use them enough to totally get rid of all blackheads, but I don&#x27;t think that is possible anyway.&lt;br /&gt;The Biore strips work pretty well. I would say 30-50% of blackheads around my nose are removed by it. I have tried other brands that I found worse and one that I found better, but have not been able to find in the USA (Nivea).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is quite satisfying to see how much you can \\&quot;clean out\\&quot; with just one little strip!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two boxes of these things, looked up tricks to get them to work... They just don&#x27;t. Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This do not fully get the job done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly pleased at how these nose strips effectively removed my stubborn blackheads. They&#x27;re not the product that keeps them from coming back though so in my honest opinion, you can try this once but it&#x27;s best to seek a dermatologist&#x27;s advice if you have some serious facial problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years now and they work really well at pulling all of the crap out of your pores. It&#x27;s always so gross to even glance at the strip afterwords. I use it before I wash my face, I find that it sticks better, and that way I can wash after because when you pull the strip off it does leave a little residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product. It&#x27;s definitely for people with large pores and T-Zone issues. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the forehead strips, I don&#x27;t think they work for much of anything than pulling your eyebrows out.</li>
            <li> Works about the same as they did when I was a teenager!  Get the strip a little wet, smooth it on your nose, let it dry, then gently peel off. Some days work better than others, I guess it just depends on my pores and how easily the strips can get to my blackheads. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them if your nose is particularly dry because this might irritate it.</li>
            <li> I have very mixed reactions about the Biore Deep Pore Cleansing Strips. I do wear makeup, wash my face at least twice daily (once at night, once in the morning) and have been using this product for two years on and off. I can&#x27;t say that it has helped me out much. The only possible way that these strips help is right when you get out of the shower... when your pores are open (from the steam) and the crap inside can be yanked out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to just use these after they wash there face, I&#x27;d have little to no results this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is a real hit and miss between people. You either like it or not.</li>
            <li> Does what its says it does! Leaves your pores clear</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove many blackheads, but some.</li>
            <li> Works as  expected. Always interesting to see what&#x27;s trapped in your skin.</li>
            <li> It works for me, it cleans my nose pores better than any cream. Just follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Same product cost $12 @ my local drugstore. We all know these are awesome, save some money &amp; guy here :-)</li>
            <li> I am 32 and have been using Biore strips for about 20 years. The technology has improved so you get better results without skinning your nose. Even my husband is hooked on using them! He only likes the nose strip whereas I like the combo box with the chin piece... So now we buy both types (and he gets some in his stocking  each Christmas).</li>
            <li> I am not surebif thid is real brand! It doesn&#x27;t even stick on my skin!</li>
            <li> I have had tiny blackheads on my nose for a while now but I just really started to notice them recently. Nothing worked to get rid of them not even chemical peels. I remembered these from the late 90&#x27;s and decided to give them a try and they worked. They left my nose a bit red but took out about 50% of my blackheads on the first shot. I would not do this more than once a week to start with because it is pretty rough on the skin. Overall its a great product.</li>
            <li> It cleans your pores, and you can see all the gunk that comes out of them, gunk that you never knew you had. And it is really fast</li>
            <li> These cleanup blackheads quickly and painlessly. I use one probably once a month and notice a huge difference. You&#x27;d be suprised by the stalactites (or is it mites?) that come off in the first use.</li>
            <li> Without too much detail....really pulls out the &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like the Biore brand so I had high expectations for this item but it didn&#x27;t really fit/work for my nose.</li>
            <li> Great product for keeping your pores clean. I haven&#x27;t tried other brands, but this has worked well for me for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 and I found this product about a year ago. I always had these black dots on my nose, A LOT OF THEM, and I never knew what they were. I have had acne, and I heard the black spots could be blackheads. I read and watched videos about the Biore nose strips and decided to buy it at Wal-Mart. Before that, all the cleansers and whatnot I used (for acne) didn&#x27;t get rid of the blackheads, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it were blackheads or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These took the blackheads right out, but not all of them. The majority of the blackheads it would take out, but there would be some stubborn ones here and there. But my nose is much more clearer and it isn&#x27;t as noticeable. I&#x27;d say it takes out 80% of the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to peel it off VERY SLOWLY. My eyes water tears when this happens, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. You can feel the blackheads or whatever gunk you have in your pores coming out. The first time I did it, it looked like thick black hairs all over the strip. I was amazed. I did it again a few days ago after not doing it for so long, and it did it again, only this time I had some actual gunk that looked like booger come out of my pores. How? I have no idea, I wash my face as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t take out all of the blackheads. It also can be a little drying, but when you put water on it after, the stickyness would go away. Also the way it&#x27;s designed, it doesn&#x27;t get under the nose, only over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you have stubborn blackheads on your nose, and no product is working, I would say to atleast try it. I have tried all the acne cleansers you can name to get rid of blackheads and it didn&#x27;t work, but these would take the blackheads right out and they would show up like little hairs. It&#x27;s quite amazing really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d do it once a week or twice a month. If you don&#x27;t have excessive black heads don&#x27;t do this every week. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s gentle enough because the pulling on the nose could cause damage. AGAIN, PULL SLOWLY!! DO NOT RIP IT OFF LIKE A WAX!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update : well it&#x27;s been a few months since I used these BUT before that I was still using them and my nose is about 98% clear haha. I only have some where I can&#x27;t get them, in stubborn places, like the creases in my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than it, THIS IS THE BOMB!!damage. AGAIN, PULL SLOWLY!! DO NOT RIP IT OFF LIKE A WAX!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update : well it&#x27;s been a few months since I used these BUT before that I was still using them and my nose is about 98% clear haha. I only have some where I can&#x27;t get them, in stubborn places, like the creases in my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than it, THIS IS THE BOMB!!</li>
            <li> While the Biore Pore Strips actually do work, I would advise looking into the product more. If you have sensitive skin be careful of what you put on your skin after using this or stay away completely.  I used this product several times and I am usually happy with the results. However, it irritates my nose and it doesn&#x27;t stop itching for hours afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a few reviewers did not have any luck with the product. Make sure you follow the instructions because not wetting or wetting the area too much can have an impact on the outcome.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands that are cheaper, but always return to Biore. They are the best at removing the black heads. My husband and I have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> Be ending using for year. Gets the blackheads straight out! Good but</li>
            <li> Love it. It really works great and makes my face feel so clean and smooth. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> A single strip saves me a week&#x27;s worth of scraping off my whiteheads!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m that kid that used to pick his acne a lot when he was a little kid. Now my nose has big pores from picking and it tends to clog from the moisturizer/sunscreen that I put on everyday. This product does the job AS LONG AS YOU OPEN UP YOUR PORES. The best way to do this is to put this strip on your nose right after shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU&#x27;RE GETTING SKIN PEELS/NEEDLING&lt;br /&gt;- Do not put this on after any kind of skin treatment (ex. tca peel, needle..etc.) even after a few days. This will harm your skin.</li>
            <li> I remember using Biore strips years ago and being amazed at the amount of crud that came off my nose.  As another user mentioned, it was fascinating to study the strip after pulling it off.  I just bought a pack of these tonight for the first time in a long, long time, and was a tad disappointed.  Very little came off on the strip, and I followed the directions completely.  I&#x27;m guessing the product was changed because the old strips were harsher on sensitive skin, but they also worked extremely well.  I&#x27;m still giving these a high rating, though, because they&#x27;re the best product out there for removing blackheads.  I just wish they&#x27;d go back to the old \\&quot;recipe\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Works SOO well! my nose feels fresh and clean each time I use them! The strips are suitable gross after use as well. You can tell they really work!</li>
            <li> This works pretty good, but doesnt get all of them out every time. I really dont use it that often.</li>
            <li> I really tried to make these work. I&#x27;ve gone through 6 of them trying slightly different ways like the directions said with no luck.</li>
            <li> I assumed these things would work every time or perhaps its just my skin type. but when i got them i immediately tried them out and it worked great with the other things i had purchased on amazon. well the next few times not so great. i used them exactly as i had the first time i used them but still having the issue of it not doing its total job.</li>
            <li> My nose gets the filaments. I find it annoying and prefer to have smaller, cleaning pores. I find the strips to be helpful. I use them about every other week to maintain a clear complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions on the box for best results.</li>
            <li> dried out and wouldn&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li> Worked great.  Its crazy when you take it off and realize all of that stuff was on your nose.  I only use them about every 6 months.  I started out at once a week but didn&#x27;t see as much of a result.  I would recommend these to anyone</li>
            <li> This is Srinivas&#x27;s wife.. It is brilliant and really cleans out the pores. I have whiteheads and this really gets rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;Well it does hurt a bit but pretty bearable. Would give you best results if you steam before and apply without wiping the steam off den jus dab excess water from the rest of your face. After removal jus ice the area to close the pores and it feels really fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I also cut the strips to use it just above my eyebrows and below lower lip to chin.</li>
            <li> They work, but I still feel like there is a better product for my nose..</li>
            <li> It came fast and i got to see some of the dirt in my pores the first time I used it. I havent tired it that long but it seems like a good product</li>
            <li> Works well. Works even better if you use it right out of the shower when your pores are enlarged.  Doesnt damage my skin.</li>
            <li> They work great! Didn&#x27;t get all of my blackheads out, but I plan to use the next strip (as instructed) in 3 days. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve used anything else to remove blackheads that has been as effective as this, but it still does a lot of the work. Plus, it&#x27;s much easier than using tweezers to get every single blackhead.</li>
            <li> I used to have bad acne on my nose, so I tried these. Not only did it hurt like heck to take it off, but I noticed it was just as clean as it was when I first opened it. My skin did not improve at all. I kept using it to see if it helped over time, but it didn&#x27;t. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of the biore nose strip in a Seventeen magazine &amp; it&#x27;s been sitting in my bathroom cabinet for a month or two. I was VERY reluctant to use it, but tonight I realized it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. So I washed my face, wet my nose, applied the smooth side on my nose, and waited 15 minutes. Behold ! A gross amount of black heads emerged onto the strip EVEN THOUGH I use a facial scrub every other day &amp; use face wipes EVERYDAY. Some of the comments made about drying out your skin is true, but since I have oily skin, I&#x27;m not very sensitive to dryness. It was a little painful to remove the strip, but just add a little water &amp; it won&#x27;t hurt as much. BOTTOM LINE The strips work. I plan on buying a package of these after I&#x27;m done writing this review because amazon has the best prices (I price checked with CVS &amp; Walmart). So buy these strips if you have oily skin like me &amp; you need to get rid of those unsightly black heads !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AUG. 27th&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Biore Cleansing Pore Strips (14 count) on Aug 24th in the evening. They were shipped from New York on the 25th and arrived today, Aug. 27th in California. It actually arrived 2-3 days early ! And I payed NOTHING for shipping. The first time I used the strip, I missed a couple spots my nose, so I cut up one of the strips &amp; used it on my nose &amp; IT WORKED once again ! I&#x27;m hooked even though it can be a little painful to take strips off. This product works &amp; shipping is fast ! ORDER NOW &amp; get rid of those blackheads .</li>
            <li> I really liked them but they were not really helpful. I did what the instructions say but I still have a lot of black dots in my noce so it wasn&#x27;t very helpful</li>
            <li> Only picked up about a third of the blackheads on my nose. Not worth the price</li>
            <li> I have tried other pore strips and keep going back to these as they work very well. They leave my pores feeling clean and fresh. I have noticed that these strips do a better job at removing black heads around my nose than some estheticians do.  If you want to remove black heads with ease and no pain, I would recommend these strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years, and they&#x27;re worth every penny. They pull out so many comedones and it&#x27;s actually pretty neat to look at the strip after you pull it off. You can see right on each strip after you use it that they&#x27;re very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you use a strip, I recommend washing your face and then using an exfoliating scrub, like a loofah. I use an [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]] with [[ASIN:B002UUT38I Olay Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser]]. Afterward, I dry my face with a towel, then use my bare hand(not a towel) to apply cold water all over my nose, and apply the strip. I leave it on for 15 minutes, and then remove the strip and rinse off my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that these strips are perfect and I don&#x27;t want the company to change anything, but there is one thing to keep in mind. They leave the skin on your nose sensitive and feeling like it&#x27;s sunburnt. You would probably want to use some non-comedogenic lotion on your nose after using this product. After I use a strip, I rinse my nose off, use a towel to dab it dry, and put some [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Extra Soothing Balm]] on the tip of my finger and rub it on my nose. That prevents any sunburn feeling.</li>
            <li> I use these once a week after a shower and when my pores are opened.  It seems to be able to pull out the deeper pores.  It does hurt to rip it off after it has dried and does leave some tape residue behind.</li>
            <li> why did I ever stop using these? I forgot that there are gross things on my nose and this is the best thing to remove them! It&#x27;s also gratifying to see your strip after you&#x27;ve used it with the little blackheads all over. I&#x27;ve already noticed clearer skin after using these strips weekly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these strips!</li>
            <li> My friend raved about these strips and convinced me to try them..I did, and nothing happened! I have an average about of blackheads around my nose and I thought the strips would get rid of them and I&#x27;d be able to see all the black gunk on the strip. I followed the directions to the T and yet they didn&#x27;t remove any blackheads. The strip was clean when I took it off...and let me tell you, pulling the strip off hurts so bad!! My eyes started to water and my nose was pretty red.My nose was pretty smooth after though...but I don&#x27;t think it was worth it. I will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> I wish it would be able to remove 100% of the blackheads and dirt in my pores for my nose area but it only gets maybe 70-80%. You do see the sebum that gets extracted but sadly it doesn&#x27;t always get that one huge one that you feel is super noticeable on the nose but is able to lift out the smaller ones. This has been my main nose pore strip since I was a teenager but I think the formula has changed over time. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as it used to. :/ I will try the new charcoal versions next to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great, makes my skin feel nice after</li>
            <li> I used to use these all the time for years, but lately the gummy stuff stays on the sides of my nose, defeating the purpose. I have tried leaving it on for much longer periods with similar disappointing results. My daughter told me there is a home-made version of this on-line, so I think I will look for that as these are just not doing the trick. They are somewhat effective, but then leave many little things just sticking up out of my nose that I have to deal with which used to stick to the strip. I have found that taking a shower before using them improves their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> OMG, I bought this a while ago and I now realize how stupid I was!! The strips hurt soooo bad and I noticed nothing on the strip that it had taken off my face. Blackhead:still there. Dirt and Oil: still there. I can honestly report that this did nothing for me. Please, I&#x27;m begging you not to waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I recently had a nose job and my doc said not to pinch or squeeze my nose for 3 months but I have been getting black heads from the taping etc so I was still pinching my nose , then I remembered the strips! I used one and so many black heads came out it was awesome you could see them on the strip. I wish the strip was bigger to cover the whole tip of your nose thats why I gave it 4 stars! It only covers the top whether your nose is big or small! It worked really well for my boyfriend who has deeper blackheads I was surprised that the strip pulled them out. The strips are a little pricey but they are worth it if you cant or dont want to simply pinch your nose.</li>
            <li> Clears out some of my big pores, but doesn&#x27;t really go deep enough to get rid of everything. A konjac sponge works better for me.</li>
            <li> maybe its just me, but these dont do anything for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have big pores so i get a lot of dirt in my pores and these do jack all for removing it.</li>
            <li> I love these. They pull so much junk from my face, even after I wash it. They help keep my face clear and prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> Is perfect love it much</li>
            <li> They work best on large pores, and aren&#x27;t as good on small pores.</li>
            <li> I now have the cleanest nose in town.  Thank you</li>
            <li> pore stripes are in my weekly beauty routine. i used to get the boscia pore strips but they were so expensive (15$ for only 6 strips) and gave the same result as these biore pore strips..so not worth it lol. i get the biore strips from the local drugstore but 8 is usually the highest i can get and when i saw that amazon was selling a 14 strip i freaked and bought one to see if 14 actually came in a box LOL and it does omg. this seller is awesome and i am gonna buy my pore strips from you from now on.</li>
            <li> Yeah.. the title says it - don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Followed instructions: nothing happened. Went around the instructions: still nothing. If you want to waste your money on a product that doesn&#x27;t do anything, get a pet rock.</li>
            <li> Used after shower so that pores would be open when I used it and left it on for 30 minutes. When I took it off I still had my blackheads. This did nothing for my blackheads.</li>
            <li> I had a box of these about 15 years ago and used them so infrequently that that box lasted for 15 years.  I don&#x27;t have oily skin but I ordered them because I did seem to be getting some blackheads on my nose.  The last time I used them (and had my son and husband use them since they do have oily skin), they worked super well.  You saw a lot of stuff that was pulled out of the skin on the pads after removing.  This time I didn&#x27;t see anything and my nose seems to be the same.  Maybe it&#x27;s just not bad enough to have a reason to use them?  Don&#x27;t know ... they just seem different than before.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I&#x27;d accept less packaging and more product, or less packaging and lower price.</li>
            <li> I typically only write positive reviews but felt the need to share my experience with the Biore Pore Strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these in combination with a pore reducing serum in hopes that they would help with my gargantuan-sized pores. I have used these in the past but never remembered why I stopped...now I do. These strips seem to do more damage than good, at least in my experience. I did everything I could think of to assist the strips in unclogging my pores: I used them directly after taking lengthy, hot showers, steamed my face beforehand, and even compressed a damp, steamed hand towel on my face for about 10 minutes prior to using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result - I now have three very noticeable torn capillaries on my nose and the texture of the skin on my nose has dramatically changed. The product seemed to pull blackheads to the surface but never remove them. After about a month and a half of using the strips twice a week, I&#x27;ve started having very large, painful breakouts on my nose which has never happened before. Save yourself the trouble, embarrassment and money.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product, would buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works! If you are getting ready for a party and are looking for a perfect makeup you should use this one before. It makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> This item works great.  Def recommend.  Doesn&#x27;t get them all out on the first attempt, but you can totally see the results.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time ever. It dis make my nose structure cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packing is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product looks of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving it only 4 and NOt 5 stars because its not something out of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I don&#x27;t have much acne, I get the stray one here and there. However, I had a ton a blackheads all over my nose. These strips worked like a charm in getting rid of them. I used these twice a week and it definitely cleared up my skin from all the dirt. DISCLAIMER: If you have fairly sensitive skin you might want to be careful when purchasing this product. Also, something to keep in mind when purchasing this product is that it is a treatment and not a cure, this will not cure your blackheads it will treat it. If you don&#x27;t take proper care of your skin you will se them return!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I read the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I used the pore strip several times and I think my pores are bigger and redder!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I love these strips. I do them once a week and my skin always feels so smooth after using them. I get a sick sense of satisfaction looking at what it removes, too.</li>
            <li> Lot of dirt &amp; blackheads are removed. Feel very clean. Problem is that you can&#x27;t stop using it. If you do, you&#x27;ll feel blackhead problem gets worse than before.</li>
            <li> I followed instruction carefully.&lt;br /&gt;It was good at removing nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive isn&#x27;t strong enough to really pull out blackhead.</li>
            <li> Having declared an all-out war against my pores a few months ago, I&#x27;ve attacked them with countless highly-rated anti-pore product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides  being dry-ish and sensitive-ish, my skin is largely unproblematic.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips once, a few days ago. I followed the instructions perfectly, and after painfully ripping the dried out, Papier-mâch&amp;eacute;d strip from my nose, I was slightly disappointed. The strip had successfully pulled out some pore-clogging gunk, but not as much as I had hoped. Despite the removed gunk, the pores on my nose looked the same an hour later (if that). After a day, I think my pores had actually gotten larger. In fact, for the next few days, my pores looked the worse they had in some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to find a miracle product that would drastically improve the appearance of my pores. Using witch hazel as a toner regularly and wearing zinc-oxide based sunscreens (sun damage, esp. by UV A rays, causes 85% of skin damage and enlarges pores as a result. High SPFs only control for UV B rays, and zinc oxide is the most effective and most stable of UV A blocks) religiously has helped. I was really hoping that these Biore strips would be the thing that drastically reduces the appearance of my pores, but no such luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for probably two years now and I think they are great for what they do.  I recommend using a strip right after a nice, hot shower.  You&#x27;ll be clean and your pores will be open.  Those are the most important pre-strip items of concern.  So next you&#x27;ll want to wet the nose and apply the strip.  Make sure you press in the corners of your nose and generally all around to make sure the strip sticks to every part of your nose.  You&#x27;ll want to wait 5-15 minutes but no longer than that or it&#x27;ll harden so much that the sticky(now hardened) layer will stay on your nose and not on the strip itself.  I usually go exactly 10 minutes and when I peel, I do it very slowly and take as much time as I can.  The key to getting the excess oils out of the pores is going extremely slow.  This videos shows exactly how much can come from your nose, if you are patient.  [...] or type in the search box \\&quot;KSP &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; 01.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> not the best value for these, but I needed to order some.  it is a useful product for my teens. easy for them to use</li>
            <li> Everything went really well! The whole process took only 4 days. Price was very good! The strips really clean your nose from the blackspots! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using these for about a month now and we do them about twice a week.  We have both noticed a big difference in the clarity and softness of our nose area. I, in particular, get a lot of adult acne so they make the biggest difference for me.  This got rid of blackheads I have been trying to remove for a long, long time!  We always moisturize a bit after we use the strips- really enjoy this product!  Something that will become a permanent part of our routine!</li>
            <li> Not sure I like this product as it leaves sticky residue on my nose which I have to scrape off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it does it&#x27;s job once the \\&quot;scraping\\&quot; is done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a blackhead problem on my nose since I was a teen (I am 33 years old). I tried everything from exfoliating face scrubs to creams that claim to get rid of blackheads. Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading several reviews of Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips I decided to go to my local drugstore and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $7.50 for an 8 pack box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home, I read and followed the instructions (clean face, wet nose, place strip, rub down over nose, let sit for 10-15 minutes or until it&#x27;s stiff) as written on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around 12 minutes later, I started to pull the strip off. The pain of peeling this strip off the soft skin around my nose made my eyes water, but the pain didn&#x27;t last. For those who have ever had their brows waxed, it&#x27;s similar to that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got to the top of my nose, the pain was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strip had a ton of blackheads pulled from my pores. It was amazing to see how much of it was on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed that quite a few blackheads remained on my nose but that could be because I didn&#x27;t put enough pressure on those parts when I applied the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose looks 100% better than before, even with some blackheads remaining. According to the box, it is not advisable to use these strips more often than every 3 days, so I will need to wait until I can try again to remove the rest of the blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is decently priced, works very well, and I will certainly recommend this to anyone who has an issue with blackheads on their nose.</li>
            <li> I love using this product and always feel so much cleaner after! Definitely gets down deep in the pores, locks in, and pulls all the gunk out! Recommend it for anyone who is conscious about their personal hygiene, women and men.</li>
            <li> Got them to get rid if black heads on my nose. If used correctly and by the directions they really do work. You have to let them dry completely.</li>
            <li> I did NOT expect the porcupine looking crap that came off of my nose. It was AMAZING, and after 5 weeks, my pores are smaller, and I get less junk off my nose than the first few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;yes, it does look like your pores are larger after the first couple of uses, but that&#x27;s because you&#x27;re removing crap from it that was filling up those pores. My experience is that my pores have been getting smaller, not larger.&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because of the fact that this doesn&#x27;t address anything beyond your nose (or forehead if you got those ones). And people need to address their entire face. This is where masking and oils come in. I&#x27;m not going to get into it here, but you really should look into it.</li>
            <li> These worked like a charm. Will definitely be using these often and buying them from seller.</li>
            <li> i really like these pore strips but the online price is a lil steep but well worth it. only works best when you keep up a good skincare routine</li>
            <li> These strips get almost nothing out of my pores, and make no visible difference. There is still gunk in my pores after using them. I tried using hot water on my nose before applying to open my pores, but that didn&#x27;t help at all. I will not be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> These work VERY well. They just get expensive for how often I need to use them. But well worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have big pores but my nose is super prone to blackheads, so I use one every week. The best method to maximize how much these strips remove from my pores is this: 1) apply Queen Helene mint julep mask to nose for fifteen minutes; 2) rinse with some face wash; and 3) apply the pore strip. It&#x27;s honestly gross and so satisfying at the same time to look at how much is pulled out of your skin when you peel these off.</li>
            <li> Really fun to peel off! Feel really clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how great this product works ! I have wasted so much money on other products that did very little if anything. This works and works fast .</li>
            <li> I used this after using the Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque since it was leaving some blackheads behind. I was surprised how much it hurt when I pulled it off. I thought it might pull the skin off my nose. I immediately became concerned about the broken capillaries around my nose. They were really red after pulling off the strip. Fortunately the redness has gone down and I don&#x27;t think it did additional damage. It definitely did remove more blackheads which is why I gave this 4 stars. However, I don&#x27;t plan to use it again after reading that it should be avoided in the case of spider veins.</li>
            <li> I love these, even though it is totally gross when you use them. My nose itches and is dry immediately afterward, but my skin is noticeably less greasy and clearer for days after.</li>
            <li> it just have the same good quality as I bought in stores before,I love this,it always make my pore clean</li>
            <li> When you take this off, it hurts your face, it does nothing to black heads and is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product. Does not hurt, does not irritate skin but sadly also doesnt clean my pores...&lt;br /&gt;I will not use it again.</li>
            <li> I added these on to increase the price of my order as needed for an add on offer (for another product).  These work well.  I have used them for some time.  My one peeve is the cost.  I would like to see them available in bulk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the best for your face because it could pull off more than blackheads. It will get some although I really don&#x27;t think you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I like these. They work at getting the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; out of the pores on my nose. I use one about twice a week. It seems to help.</li>
            <li> Love these. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without them. I do one strip every week which I think is probably the most you should do. I have heard that you can actually enlarge your pores with pore strips but I think if you limit to once a week and remove the strip very very slowly, you not only get better results but prevent ripping your pores larger.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions closely, they work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten more words are required to count as a review.</li>
            <li> I used these last night before bed and after a clay mask. I let the strips dry for 12 minutes and then removing them so incredibly painful. I don&#x27;t think I can bring myself to do it again. Ever. It was cool to see the stuff it removed though. Cool and gross. It did leave a lot behind, I went and looked in my lighted magnifying mirror to confirm, but, this is probably due to operator error. Maybe in a few weeks I&#x27;ll cut the strips into small pieces and just do a little section at a time, it might be easier to spot treat this way as the strips are a bit large for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing these before going anywhere. My nose was immediately swollen after and my face throbbed in pain as I tried to sleep. This morning everything is fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Biore pore strips before, and I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a dud box or what, but the strips don&#x27;t feel the same when I use them and they also don&#x27;t remove as much as I&#x27;m used to. I bought a different box (the ultra deep cleansing strips) the other day from a store to see if it was the box or something else, and it worked great, so I probably won&#x27;t be buying this particular kind in the future.</li>
            <li> Some foolish people think that men are the grosser sex, but Biore pore strips are a significant indication otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving the ad copy aside, this is a bit of cloth with a special glue on it that literally rips tiny stalagmites of gunk out of your pores. After which, if you&#x27;re a person of normal inquisitiveness, you spend a quality minute starting at the remarkable collection of gunk that had, only moments before, been quietly occupying your rhinal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switching attention then to the nose, the pores sit agape, as if individually shocked about what just happened. It&#x27;s best to give it a few minutes before heading out on a date or negotiating peace with a neighboring nation state so that the pores can recover and shrink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a good week their appearance is minimized, and another week later you can do it again. Though most fascinating results are certainly with longer intervals between application.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t&#x27; get these strips from amazon, I got them from Wal Mart. I used them correctly. It worked a little, but not as much as some video&#x27;s online or like some people&#x27;s pictures. not impressed.</li>
            <li> this really cleans oil/dust from pore on my nose. great!</li>
            <li> These work great to make the surface of pores look clean. Note that it won&#x27;t completely clean out your pores and you would need to use an exfoliant to do that, but if you just want a temporary surface clean up this will help a bit. However, use caution if you have sensitive skin or are prone to spider veins. This can and will eventually cause some damage. I had been using these for years and recently one bruised my nose and created a visible spider vein when pulling the strip off. I wish I had been more careful and took the warning seriously.</li>
            <li> Every single time I use these I am both repulsed and grateful when I gaze upon the strip full of a forest of ick. They work well at removing blackheads and the Amazon price is good.</li>
            <li> I swear the other reviews are full of it. These don&#x27;t work at all. There&#x27;s no difference before and after. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do.  Lets not go into the details....</li>
            <li> There is something oddly satisfying about peeling off one of these pore strips and squinting to see all of the grime that it has pulled out. Although I was hoping that it would also help remove some of the annoyingly persistent flakes that appear on my nose, I was still happy that the strip did exactly what it was supposed to do, and pulled out a decent amount of blackheads. I tried the baking soda and water method as described in a few other reviews, though I can&#x27;t attest yet to how it compares with not using it. Scrubs and metal extraction tools do nothing for my blackheads, so this is the best method I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Work pretty good for me</li>
            <li> I like these strips, it have a great job for remove all the blackhead from my nose , absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 12 or 13 years.  I use it about twice per month on my nose and chin.  It pulls those blackheads right out of my pores.  You may have to experiment a few times to get the right amount of water on your skin before applying.  It won&#x27;t work very well if you wet with too much or too little water.  Keep trying until you get it right.  Leave on more than 15 minutes for best results.  I am 53 years old and love this product.</li>
            <li> I love seeing all the jun that comes off my nose after I take it off. I like the feeling of it drying and how it&#x27;s almost like plaster.  It does not hurt while it&#x27;s drying nor when you take it off! It&#x27;s a nice thing to do once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips for years and I love how well they work.  Thanks to the small slits, they fit like a glove and do a fantastic job at removing my blackheads!  I use them once or twice a month and wouldn&#x27;t be without them.  I use facial peels, scrubs along with masks, even a cleansing brush, but nothing removes my blackheads the way these strips do!  I recommend them.  Debi B.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as well made as the old noise strips.  Quality seem to have gone down and not a lot comes out.  It does sux when you&#x27;re have all this anticipation of ripping this thing and comes up disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am surprised about multiple things, the first being other people&#x27;s comments! These things work wonders. I noticed a difference after one use. I have had no irritation or issues with this product. Secondly, I am surprised at how amazing these work. When I bought it I thought I was throwing away my money, but decided to give it a try anyway and am glad I did. Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 star because my mom really likes it. She now uses it on a weekly basis and when she first tried it,it removed 80% of her blackheads. Amazing! Just be careful when you try to remove the strips, don&#x27;t do it the hard way,gently and take it slow, just as suggested on the back of the strips pack. Overall I believe this is the product that is essential for anyone, try it on a weekly basis and you won&#x27;t get wrong.</li>
            <li> yep, it works pretty well, got a lot stuff out, and then some more, recommended for the purpose of removing blackheads</li>
            <li> I bought these for fun, on the urging of my girlfriend. They&#x27;re fun, though I might not buy them again. And even though they remove gunk from your nose, it&#x27;s not clear to me that a dry bumpy nose is any better looking than a smooth oily nose. Anyway, she says I look better, so who am I to doubt?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy nose pore unclogging!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was on sale and I wanted to give it a try since my nose is covered in deep blackheads.  I followed the directions and pulled the strip off.  There was a bunch of little things on the strip that looked like little hairs.  I looked back at my nose and didn&#x27;t notice any change.  I still had a ton of blackheads.  I tried this for 3 weeks and nothing changed.  Maybe there is no hope for my nose or maybe I need to try it longer.</li>
            <li> The pore strips works wonders and usually takes out majority of the dirty gunk in my pores. I wished it took out all of them, but I still believe that it works pretty great because of the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent and useful!</li>
            <li> I was really excited for these to arrive because I have a decent amount of teeny blackheads around my nose and my boyfriend has heavy blackheads on his nose. They didn&#x27;t work for either of us. It picked up some of the blackheads but not enough where there was a visible difference. I had to fight the urge to extract them myself because the box says your skin may be sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions completely and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. Actually using this made my nose acne worse. Thanks for more acne.</li>
            <li> I am a guy and was embarrassed for even wanting to buy these. However I am having a horrible blackhead problem this year so I gave in and bought these. They work great, I did two treatments a week apart and my blackhead problem is gone, and easier to manage with regular face washing. And the simple fact is it is so cool when you pull off the strip, you just cannot look away. So cool!</li>
            <li> I bought these at my local Kroger for $9 and I was really excited to try them. I&#x27;ve tried dollar store pore strips and another miscellaneous brand but nothing has works. I figured with all the hype of this brand that it&#x27;d be fantastic! It was not. I followed the steps exactly as it said. The strips took a long time to get harder and when I peeled them off, the only thing different about my fave was the goo it left behind around where I had the strip. I just want my blackheads gone.</li>
            <li> It definitely gets the black heads out!</li>
            <li> They work and I see the black heads coming out on the strips, I have really oily skin around my noise so I have to use these strips and they are cheaper on Amazon then at my pharmacy.</li>
            <li> it does the same thing as regular soap. Scrubs work much better.</li>
            <li> These strips have something in them that makes my whole body itch.  I have to take allergy medicatication after using.</li>
            <li> They did a great job on my blackheads and whiteheads. They pulled out the longer and shorter black/white heads - My nose is so much clearer now!&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the strip may not reach some parts of the nose (Eg. the part between the nostrils or the base of your nose, just above the nostrils). But I just resolved that issue by using another strip and covering the unreachable portion first before sticking the strip on the rest of the nose which I covered with my first strip.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use - very quick - takes a a short 1 min to stick it on the nose and then 10 mins to dry off. Much much Less painful than having to steam and then pluck out the blackheads at a salon.</li>
            <li> The first couple strips i used pulled about a dozen or so blackheads, since, maybe 1 or 2. I have a million so this, does not work for guys.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS THING! I buy it from amazon every time b/c it&#x27;s so dang expensive at other stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the awesome price, this stuff really works. I kind of cheat and leave it on for at least 20min and then do the strips twice in a row, one right after the other. I feel like I get the best results but technically you aren&#x27;t supposed to do that. But hey, who&#x27;s watching?! :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will see all the small dirt n grime leave your nose, it doesnt get all of it but it gets a good amount.</li>
            <li> I will never NOT buy these. I love using them and so does my husband. Good price, cheaper than Walmart. Definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> They work ok at cleaning out pores but it felt like I was ripping my nose off when I took it off. I only used one so far. I&#x27;m a little afraid to use them again as it was pretty painful getting it off.</li>
            <li> Biore strips work like magic to clean out pores. I have tried knock off brands but they do not work as well as Biore.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t have big enough pores because I noticed no difference. Did fit secure and tugged on my skin when removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who do not get a lot pimples and blackheads and whiteheads (except for the occasional ones). I&#x27;ve been using a different brand of nose strips (which actually works better than this one) for about 2-3 weeks already and when I tried this on, I didn&#x27;t see a lot of &#x27;things&#x27; coming out with it. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was because there was no more &#x27;things&#x27; to remove, or this product doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I remember first using these in the 90s. I recently had my fianc&amp;eacute; go to the store &amp; see if they were still selling them. Lucky for me, he found them! My nose has always been a problem when it comes to blackheads &amp; general gunk getting caught in them. I have very tiny pores &amp; I&#x27;ve tried getting facials. I love them, but when they pull out the metal extractor &amp; go for my nose, I want to cry. Bior&amp;eacute; strips are my saving grace. Besides, it&#x27;s really cool to see all those little &amp;#34;porcupine&amp;#34; like pieces stuck to the strip.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy anything but BIORE products!  They are the best!  They work every time and I feel like the pores are ripped out and clean!  I have been a user of these for over a decade and have tired various store brands, including CVS and what a waste of money!  They DO NOT pull out black heads - they only leave a glue on your nose, and you need to wash and scrub it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE these products....just wish they were 2-4 dollars a box.  But, they are worth the money (usually 6-8 dollars a box)!</li>
            <li> Bought these after my son pointed out to me that my nose looks like a strawberry. &amp;#34;What are all those black dots?&amp;#34;  After using this for the first time tonight and seeing what was pulled out on the strip i am very happy with the result. I will have to repeat the treatment a few more times to get the &amp;#34;strawberry&amp;#34; out of my nose but I&#x27;m quite impressed with the difference even after first use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull anything out of my pores, still have black heads after using for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe I do not have many black heads or if I don&#x27;t use the product right. I have seen many people post pictures of a strip riddled with black heads while I just had a few. I do enjoy this product though, it&#x27;s fun to poke at it when it&#x27;s all plastery.</li>
            <li> It will clean your pores well. Make certain place the tape in the correct way otherwise you may need 2 strips. I would not recommend using it too often because it pulls skin around your nose pretty strong. I bought 3 packages to avoid shipping charge. Now I have life time supply.</li>
            <li> I thought, hey, all it does is pull the damn blackheads out, how is that supposed to enlarge pores?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the result of my naivete showed up not more than a week later: my pores, which had stayed about the same size since my teenage years, have multiplied in size and visibility. I have compulsive issues with my skin and had been hoping that these strips would help, but... au contraire. Just catching sight of my nose now makes me feel slightly nauseated now, and of course that has been no help to the compulsions. I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to return my skin to the way it was before I used these.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for years on my nose and they really do remove blackheads. So much better than having them squeezed out at a facial.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time in undamaged external packaging, but the box the pore strips looked like it had been kicked around the street for a while. All of the strips, however, were in the box and their individual packaging was undamaged. As a cheap alternative to buying in the stores, I recommend this seller and product. If you were looking for something that looked new, this would not be your choice.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this Item is old or what the problem is, I ordered several boxes, with the hopes of getting rid of blackheads. After several tries. The Item is junk, does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I used it twice, and it works. It&#x27;s not perfect, and it smells bad, but it&#x27;s good. You have to use many times (as it says, once a week) to achieve what you want.</li>
            <li> This thing works!  I could see a lot of things came out of my pores when I first used it.  It also made my nose feel very soft and smooth.  I just wish it wouldn&#x27;t hurt so much when I have to pull it off.</li>
            <li> Good deal and they work great. I use these on a regular basis, so it was nice to be able to buy a larger pack like this.</li>
            <li> Okay, so... I have a confession to make. I really love pulling these off and seeing how much guck came out of my pores. Does anyone else do that? Yes? These work better than any other strip I&#x27;ve tried. Will always repurchase.</li>
            <li> I mean it gets stuff off my nose, that&#x27;s clear when you look at the strip afterwards. However after using them for a while didn&#x27;t see much improvement as far as blackheads being any less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Every person I know that has used these really only uses them to look at it afterwards.  Seriously.  They work, my nose feels super smooth for weeks, and it brings out the kid in everyone to inspect what the strips pulled off your face.</li>
            <li> Worked just as I expected. My only complaint, is that I wish they were larger. Not everyone has a dainty little nose, so one size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> These are the regular brand name nose strips you&#x27;ve relied on for years.  They are better priced here than at my local drugstore and work just as well.  They work better than cheaper brands, and I have tried several.  I have no complaints - they were exactly what I wanted and came quickly and at a better price than I expected.</li>
            <li> Got the job done but left terrible bruises on my nose... will not be using again.</li>
            <li> it would not stick to my clean nose so it could not work.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, a teenager, who has lots of blackheads on his nose.  He opened it and asked me why I had to buy this product when he can just use duct tape instead, or masking tape!  I convinced him to use it on his nose, and I tried it myself to see if it works.  Well, it does work!  But you have to use it.  You can see the strip when you remove it, that it has a lot of blackheads sticking to it.  I search for other brands and I could not find any, even in the stores.  I think Biore is the only one that makes these cleansing strips.  I just wish my son would use it more!</li>
            <li> Good product, but does not have much power to remove the sludge, although it helps in clearing the impurities of the face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other versions of these nifty pore strips before but this new formulation works great -- if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of tugging and dryness afterward. Does the job but left my skin a bit ragged.</li>
            <li> the quality of biore pore strips have gone down over the years. the adhesive is not as strong but still does the job on some blackheads,bluh yuck</li>
            <li> Best pore cleaner I have used. I prefer this to the variety of scrubs or other masks.</li>
            <li> Amazing, literally after doing this and seeing how much dirt is in my pores, they are a must have.</li>
            <li> I have used it right the way I received it. It really works great.highly recommended.and also arrived before the estimate delivery date.hope to buy again</li>
            <li> I get these all the time since I like to see the results, you can literally see little bumps afterward where your pores have been cleaned out..</li>
            <li> Love it! It removed a lot of the blackheads on my nose!</li>
            <li> I used these about 10 years ago when I was in middle school, and they were great then. And now in college, I just used two of these. Okay, I&#x27;m not supposed to use these on my cheek, only on my nose (as the instructions say) but I didn&#x27;t read all of the instructions at first and I had a huge black head on my cheek that just would not go away. So I washed my face with Cerave and then added the strips to my nose and cheek. I waited about 15 minutes. It got rid of the huge blackhead (like I was hoping) and then some! Of course, I still have some other blackheads but I will just have to try again in a few days. The only downside about the strips is that it hurts like hell to get them off. My eyes were watering at the end. But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I liked these Cleansing Pore Strips!</li>
            <li> Works well for me but not my wife.</li>
            <li> these strips are crap. all it seems to do is make my nose crusty with the goo after I peel it off...sure, It washes off, but what you &amp;#34;pull off&amp;#34; is just the goopy stuff hardened to make it appear to pull blackheads out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull blackheads out like it promised. Duct tape would work better.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure what this does. I don&#x27;t feel like anything is cleaner or noticeably better off after use. That said, people swear by it. And I feel like I would be judged if I didn&#x27;t at least try. So I tried it. And.... eh.</li>
            <li> I use these strips weekly to every other week, and my pores have been a lot cleaner and smaller. The very first time I used these, my strip was full of nasty business. As I used them weekly, the strips came off cleaner and cleaner. I used to have bad problems with blackheads on my nose before using this. Now, everything is more manageable. I still get blackheads, but I feel more relieved to see that I am able to clean my pores more thoroughly. I have not been getting as many large acne spots on my nose since using this product either (that may have been due to the clogged pores I used to have). I highly recommend this if you are prone to clogged pores on your nose and have those particularly large pimples in this area now and then. I rarely get them anymore and I&#x27;m so happy! I also use the strips on either side of my nose/cheek/chin areas, and they work to clean these parts as well. I have oily skin, but it was easy to get dryness in the area if I used the strips too often. Weekly use seems to offer good balance and pore management. Also, do not wait for longer than 15 minutes to remove the product. By this time, the strip is ready to come off, and it can be painful if you have tiny hairs. These strips really do take up a lot of dirt, dead skin, and hair in the area.</li>
            <li> These should be a must have in anyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet, male or female. These are so effective in cleaning out your pores and keeping those nasty blackheads away! Be sure to follow the instructions completely and these strips will help you maintain a blackhead-free nose!</li>
            <li> If you want to get rid of those unwanted black/white heads then this is a must for you. Ensure you follow directions carefully when using this product.</li>
            <li> I put on these strips every week and I see the results! It might seem taboo, but its awesome to see whats on the strip when you remove it.</li>
            <li> These work great. I tend to get blackheads on the side of my nose and these strips keep my nose clean. My pores also look smaller. The price beat the drugstore.</li>
            <li> That product really help me with my pores and blackheads problem</li>
            <li> Gets about 30% of blackheads.</li>
            <li> Most horrible product I ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work the way it should,&lt;br /&gt;Strips will stick to your nose and get ripped when you try to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away</li>
            <li> Use these all the time, and they totally work great for me. They pull out so much gunk from my nose pores (yuke)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. The adhesive is not strong enough and does not stay attached to the strip, it ends up just staying on your face.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. It really removes those blackheads and leaves your skin feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I ordered Biore Deep Cleansing, I have tried so many products for my blackheads and nothing was working.&lt;br /&gt;but with this product you will see the deference from the first time. For better result by the Biore Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser, from the link below,&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006RFZ98K/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s00_i01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;Use this one first to clean you face and remove all the makeup then wash your face with hot water and dry it then wet your nose and use the biore deep cleansing pore strip.&lt;br /&gt;Try it once a day until you get rid of all the blackheads from your nose .</li>
            <li> As long as you slightly wet your nose(not the strip), the pore strip will stick.  Let it dry for 5 minutes and give a gentle tug-and prepared to be amazed at how many black/whiteheads you may see.  It&#x27;s not pretty to look at but it does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Remove most of the black heads from the first use - use 1 per week - excellent product - easy to use</li>
            <li> Works, but scrub and tone control face wash works a lot better.</li>
            <li> They need to make a bigger size for men. It does exactly what is says and the commercials show. I have a sick sense of curiosity every time I use these to see what my pores were hiding.</li>
            <li> When I bought my first box of Biore pore strips, they were amazing probably because it was also my first time using it. I have been getting a lot of whiteheads lately under my chin so I bought this type that also contained the face strips. The face strips did not do a great job at removing my white heads under my chin. As far as the nose strips, when I first used these the nose strips from my first box, they were able to pull out a whole lot of whiteheads from my nose. However now that I use it, it does not do a great job. Probably you will need to have a whole lot of blackheads and whiteheads on your nose for the nose strip to actually pull anything  out. I use this once every 3 months and it does not pull out much of my white heads. Maybe good to use once every 6 months. Wish I could get the same result when I first used these strips.</li>
            <li> What can I say, this is as far as I know the best pore strip available. I have tried small ethnic supermarket pore strips which don&#x27;t ever extract as many as the Biore does. The package itself arrived a bit crushed but it didn&#x27;t harm the contents itself so I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S&lt;br /&gt;- reputable brand and very rewarding to use when you get the white/blackheads out.&lt;br /&gt;- For my skin, I did not feel any discomfort using this. People with more sensitive skin may have other results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S&lt;br /&gt;- packaging - but not really a knock on the product.&lt;br /&gt;- inconsistent amount of extracted white/backheads (comedones), but this could just be user error.</li>
            <li> These are great. I&#x27;ve been using them since the early 90&#x27;s when they were given away in promotional gift bags my freshmen year of college. I tell everyone about them. I look at them in amazement every single time I pull them off my nose. A must for anyone&#x27;s beauty regime.</li>
            <li> These really work great to clean your nose pores. It&#x27;s fascinating to see all the stuff it pulls from my pores. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> These do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do: pull out stuff from the pores on your nose. I take pretty good care of my skin, but I do like to occasionally use these pore strips as a supplement to my regular facial care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all: unlike 99% of facial treatments, you can see these ones working immediately after use. There&#x27;s really nothing else like them on the market.</li>
            <li> They work but not as easy or effective as the ponds strips I used to use.</li>
            <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Apply on wet nose.&lt;br /&gt;Leave for long, until hard and dry..&lt;br /&gt;then remove fast</li>
            <li> Works great and cheaper than wal....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old batch or what, but they weren&#x27;t sticky and didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve used these before but this time was very disappointing!</li>
            <li> These things work great. You will notice howo effective they are immediately after you take them off. Make sure to apply lots of water to the area before putting them on, otherwise they won&#x27;t stick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biore pore strips for quite a while now, and I&#x27;ve found that using them after a shower (or bath) seems to work best. It helps if you wash your face to remove oil or make up so that the pore strips will stick better. The box says not to use them every day, but I&#x27;ve had no problems using them two to three days in a row. However, if you have sensitive skin I would stick to the instructions! My pores are particularly bad on my cheeks, sides of my nose, between my eye brows, and my chin (the dreaded T-zone). I just cut the strips in half to stick between my brows or on my chin and they work just fine. Don&#x27;t try saving half a strip after you open the foil package though, because it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. Over the last year, I tried a few other beauty routines such as using facial scrubs, acne face washes, organic face washes, pimple spot-on correction medication, etc. and I&#x27;ve found that the strips work best for my skin type. I have no problem with tweezing or waxing/sugaring pain so these strips don&#x27;t really feel like anything to me other than maybe peeling tape off my face. Also, don&#x27;t do anything that might cause sweating when you have the strips on. Sit somewhere cool, put a fan on your face, or just hang out and do something quiet while it dries - I once forgot I had these on and started cleaning the house and the sweat/oil on my nose prevented the strip from working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on Facebook, type in &#x27;Biore Skincare&#x27; and you&#x27;ll see a link for \\&quot;Prove It!\\&quot;points where you can enter in the \\&quot;Prove It!\\&quot; codes and get coupons, free pore strips (8 ct), deep cleaning cloths, etc. as you rack up \\&quot;Prove It!\\&quot; points. The codes comes in the pore strip boxes. I&#x27;ve been doing this for a while now, and it&#x27;s a nice treat since the strips are a bit pricey (but well worth the money). The Biore site is nice because they don&#x27;t post a bunch of stuff on your stream or your friends stream when you enter in your points or &#x27;like&#x27; their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FUN TIP: If you are ever in a Japanese store, go to the cosmetics section and they sometimes will sell black pore strips for men!/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FUN TIP: If you are ever in a Japanese store, go to the cosmetics section and they sometimes will sell black pore strips for men!</li>
            <li> I use one of these every other week just to help keep my skin clear of the dirt that gets trapped in the pours. The contour strips are the best on the market that I have seen. Just need to make sure that the strip isn&#x27;t on for too long or else its very hard to pull off and can take some skin with it.</li>
            <li> My nose is very oily and the pores always open up. I use these on a weekly basis and they clean my nose really well. It scares my wife a bit when I show her the white strips so it is a fun product as well.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I&#x27;m cursed with pretty oily skin. My pores tend to get clogged and its impossible to keep my nose from getting tons of black heads. At least not until I found these strips. I started using them about 4 years ago and now I put one on almost every sunday as part of my routine. Woman always comment how healthy my skin looks and these bad boys definitely help with that.</li>
            <li> These things work great. You will notice how effective they are immediately after you take them off. Make sure to apply lots of water to the area before putting them on, otherwise they won&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else says, they work. Now the effectiveness can be up for debate, but I have fairly sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t really want to melt my nose off. I am happy that it doesn&#x27;t pull the skin off my nose, yet still seems to get some of the blackheads every time.</li>
            <li> I used Biore strips as a teenager, but felt they never cleaned as well as a normal cleanser and weekly facial mask, so I stopped using them.  My have they changed!  The Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips (nose strips) are now a permanent part of my weekly routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried the new strips, I was familiar with the easy to use instructions.  I applied the strip to my nose and waited for it to harden, so I could see the results.  When I removed the strip, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!  These strips totally cleaned the gunk that was trapped in my pores.  I thought that maybe it was a one time thing, so I tried again, and once again, blackheads and trapped dirt were easily removed--this time a much smaller amount though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips I have noticed a difference in the appearance of the pores on my nose.  In addition the skin on my nose is brighter and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited for these strips and encourage those looking to improve the appearance of their skin while deeply cleaning their pores to try the Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips.</li>
            <li> Awesome, works great, just what I was looking and hoping for.</li>
            <li> I really love how these things work; however, because my pores are so enlarged, I usually have to use an extractor tool following application.  If it doesn&#x27;t grab everything, it will draw what&#x27;s left closer to the surface.</li>
            <li> Okay. So after searching continuously online for about two weeks now on this product, I finally decided to try it out since most comments and video reviews show positive results. When I bought the product, went home and followed the steps EXACTLY.. (I even opened up my pores with heat).. I took the strip off my nose &amp; not even ONE BLACKHEAD came off! ..Very frustrated I tried it a second time &amp; same results. Then I tried it AGAIN and it still didn&#x27;t even pull out ANY blackhead. I&#x27;m so so sooo confused as to why it works for others?! PLEASE,  someone who it works for tell me EXACTLY what you do for it to pull off at least some black heads..I don&#x27;t want to think that I wasted almost $10 for NO REASON.&lt;br /&gt;P.S----- Its also its very weird how the strip doesn&#x27;t seem to harden (HARDLY) ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anddd: I&#x27;m trying it for the FOURTH TIME, while writing this. :/ Please HELP :-( !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> An old classic. Love that I can order these to be delivered straight to my door. Awesome price and always effective. I never get tired of seeing all the gunk on the strips, grosssss! lols..</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THESE AT WALMART AFTER WATCHING A YOUTUBE VIDEO STATING THAT THEY WERE GREAT FOR BLACKHEADS ! THESE BARELY TOOK ANYTHING OFF MY NOSE, MOSTLY ON THE SIDE BUT NOT DOWN THE BRIGDE WHICH IS WHERE I NEEDED IT MOST !! ANDDDDDD THEY BRUISEDDDDD MY NOSE BIG TIME ! IT LOOKS LIKE I GOT PUNCHED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO NOT REPURCHASING THESE , MAYBE MY SKINS TOO SENSITIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS LEFT IT ON FOR THE RECOMMNEDED TIME</li>
            <li> These nose strips did not work very well for me as I have really stubborn blackheads, but I have found that following these steps will completely amaze or disgust (maybe both) you when you pull off that strip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Materials needed:&lt;br /&gt;Cotton Rounds (3 pads or so)&lt;br /&gt;Bowl&lt;br /&gt;Baking soda&lt;br /&gt;One of these nose strips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steps:&lt;br /&gt;1. Take a warm shower for 15-20 minutes to loosen your pores.&lt;br /&gt;2. Fill a bowl with warm water and baking soda: about two parts water and one part baking soda. (you don&#x27;t want it to be pasty, just cloudy)&lt;br /&gt;3. Mix it and dunk the cotton rounds in there for a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;4. Once the cotton rounds are fully saturated with the warm baking soda mixture, completely cover your nose with the pads. (not the nostrils)&lt;br /&gt;5. Keep the cotton rounds on your nose for 15 minutes. The mixture draws out the black heads.&lt;br /&gt;6. Get your strip ready! Twist it softly so the slits open up, allowing optimal placement on your nose. Don&#x27;t wash your face or rinse it!&lt;br /&gt;7. Use the cotton round to dab some more of the baking soda mixture onto your nose (this is the &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; for the nose strip)&lt;br /&gt;8. Place the strip on your nose. Keep on for 15-30 minutes until the strip becomes really firm and you know it&#x27;s ready to be peeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;-These Biore Pore Strips are really effective at removing the gunk on your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-Not a cure, but a treatment. Incredibly effective treatment at that!&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves your nose slightly red, but that&#x27;s obvious given the nature of the strips.&lt;br /&gt;-Little pricey, much better on Amazon than drug stores though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this once a week and it has really gotten rid of my stubborn blackheads. My skin is not that sensitive so it can take the harsh abrasive baking soda, but if your skin is fragile, just use the strips by itself first. I recommend these strips for anyone looking to remove their blackheads!</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not that useful. can not stick pore from nose</li>
            <li> Buying for years, one of the best product invented really! And amazon makes it easier to be delivered to home. With too many coupons n low price always best place to buy</li>
            <li> Used by everyone in my family for that nasty pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> Just removed years of disgustingly filthy clogged pores, in 15 minutes.  Great product, works great and now my nose is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Well these things do work, that&#x27;s for sure. But at what cost? My tongue is nice and smooth but now I can&#x27;t taste anything at all.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here, I got it from a local Walmart store. But unfortunately, it desn&#x27;t work for me. If you never treated the blackheads before, maybe it will work for you. But for those who have tried some ways to fight against blackheads and the skin on their nose is already sort of damaged, probably this won&#x27;t work for you, go somewhere else to find a stronger blackheads remover.</li>
            <li> Works best if you cleanse your face with some sort of deep-cleaning scrub, like those black-head removing creams with blue granules in them, first. That opens up your pores and allows the strips to stick to the clogged dirt/oil/skin inside of them. And you definitely should leave it on a few minutes past when it dries. It should really be bone dry and feel like it&#x27;s tightening your skin before you rip it off. I guarantee these tips will give you better results.</li>
            <li> Works better than I imagined. Helped me to have a better skin on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;No more pain when cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li> Good product and it works perfect.</li>
            <li> Love the pore strips since its a fast simple way the unclog pores and get rid of those ugly blackheads. It doesn&#x27;t get all of them in one strip but it sure gets a bunch and its great being able to see the results and stuff it took out of your pores.</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all. Used as directed, and didn&#x27;t remove anything from my pores. It opens them up a little, but doesn&#x27;t remove any of the dirt or grime in them. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most economical way to buy this product.</li>
            <li> It just works! Best results are too leave it on there until its so dry it almost hurts a little when peeling off. Blackheads be gone!</li>
            <li> Received on time. But the packaging looks different. Never mind they changed the look. Wow that was drastic change. For a known brand to suddenly change into different look is strange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, it gives that little extra help for clean, refined pores. I use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save to ensure I always have a good supply and a better price with free shipping.  Good deal!</li>
            <li> They work well to remove blackheads, but my pores didn&#x27;t look or feel smaller afterwards. They also have a funky hairspray smell that might bother more sensitive people, and I would think that someone with sensitive skin would experience soreness afterwards. That said, it&#x27;s pretty satisfying to see all the gunk on the strip afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product is a must buy. I have used it twice and I can already see the difference on my nose skin. You can actually see the black/white heads on the strip when u peel it off. Very nice skincare product. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these off and on for years and they work as advertised. You may have minor discomfort while pulling them off but when you look at what they pull from your pores you&#x27;ll know why.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of blackheads on my nose and have been looking for something to help remove them. I bought these strips because of the reviews. I would say it works ok, but don&#x27;t expect it to remove all your blackheads. It does good at removing small ones, especially on the sides of the nose, but doesn&#x27;t remove all of them. Your nose is really clean and smooth after though. Overall, worth trying out. Good product.</li>
            <li> If you have used Biore before, well these are the same.  Nothing too new or different, will clean out some pores.  Great deal on these here at Amazon, couldn&#x27;t find them cheaper anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy. I get blackheads on my nose all the time. I try this and see all the crud from my skin. It&#x27;s disgusting. But it works. Definitely makes the pores smaller and cleans them out well. Although i do have a few spots where i&#x27;ll see some left behind, but it&#x27;s okay because the majority of the black heads were removed. For the price i can&#x27;t complain. It does a better job of cleaning out there pores as compared to just washing my face everyday. I reserved a star only because it didn&#x27;t get EVERYTHING, but i&#x27;d still buy this when i run out haha.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use them for years.</li>
            <li> These get rid of whiteheads about 80% of the time and blackheads at most 50% of the time. I think blackheads are hard to remove because there isn&#x27;t enough surface area for these patches to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the best effect, use warm water to rinse your nose before so the pores can open up then just rinse with cold water after the treatment they&#x27;ll close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your body&#x27;s oil production rate, you can expect to use these every 3 days. However, you can maintain a clean nose when you wash your nose two times a day and sleep on a clean pillowcase (Your pillowcase is a goldmine of oil and dirt because you transfer them every night when you sleep so wash your pillowcases every week). Doing all this will lower the chance of dirt and oil from being trapped in your pores.</li>
            <li> great great great great great</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as I expected, and it does not really clean the nose.</li>
            <li> I am more obsessed than most when it comes to removing blackheads and unclogging pores. I&#x27;m also one of those people that notices when others have clogged pores and I wish I could just force everyone to use these strips. They are a staple in my house, I always have them on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them for years but only recently (last 2 years) have I really learned how to use them properly. They work pretty well when used the right way, they don&#x27;t remove everything but no other product really comes close. I&#x27;ve never used a mask or blackhead scrub that was anywhere near as effective as these. Funny thing is the only place they don&#x27;t work for me is my nose. My nose just isn&#x27;t the right shape and the entire thing comes out as an air bubble. To remove blackheads from my nose I use the metal blackhead remover tool from revlon. I use the strips mostly on my chin and forehead. Sometimes I use the face specific strips but the nose strips work as well- I don&#x27;t know why biore claims we can&#x27;t use them in other parts of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cut the strip to properly fit on your nose or face. My biggest piece of advice- cut the strip so it does not stick to the delicate skin near your eye and cheek. That skin is very delicate and in my opinion its just waaaaay too painful to remove the strip from that area once it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. Make sure your face is wet, but don&#x27;t overly wet the strip. You want a paper-mache type feel. If the strip starts to get slimy then you&#x27;ve used too much moisture.&lt;br /&gt;3. Smooth out all air bubbles, those areas won&#x27;t work otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;4. Make sure the strip is COMPLETELY dry before removing&lt;br /&gt;5. Unfortunately, remove the strip very slowly. It&#x27;s painful but much more effective. I would also recommend watching a Youtube video before you remove the first time. They are gross but it really helped me learn to remove the strips properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On stronger areas like my nose and chin the strips really don&#x27;t hurt to remove. But they do really hurt if you get them near the delicate under eye skin, so be careful. Also, like others have mentioned DO NOT use these strips if you have very sensitive, sunburned or dry skin. It says you also shouldn&#x27;t use them if you have acne, but I&#x27;ve definitely used them with a few pimples with no adverse side effects. Also, I only use the strips about once a month. I think more than once or twice a month would just be too abrasive to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!ve.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been cycling for a bit, and started noticing how bad the blackheads were getting on and around my nose, even after showering, scrubbing, and/or using facial cleaner. Got this product, have been following the instructions, and I would get some blackhead removal each time (once every three days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to go in real deep and get all of them in one go, however. Also, it leaves a white adhesive-ish kind of residue in areas that have to be rubbed or washed off. But it works about as well as I expected it to, and my nose looks a lot cleaner than without.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much crud these things pull off of my nose. It was disgusting. Imagine that constantly on ur nose ! These are very necessary everyone should have them in their bathroom cabinet</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping to get rid of blackhead on my nose but It didn&#x27;t work at all. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried every possible instruction, and each time was the same: a few pores were clean. At I thought I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough, so then I tried it for a longer period of time a week later. I had high hopes, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I actually cut one in half and tried it on my chin. I think it might have worked better there than it did on my nose (despite the fact they said not to use it anywhere else but the nose)</li>
            <li> These are like magic, in fact its kinda freaky the first time you do it because you can see the stuff that came out of your pores and they stand up due to the glue.  These things are so much easier than sitting there for hours picking at blackheads.  All you do is wet it, place it on your nose, wait 15 mins for it to dry then rip it off for your \\&quot;surprise\\&quot;.  I also recommend [[ASIN:B000GZWQ06 Oxy Maximum Daily Cleansing Pads, 90 pads]] these will keep those pores clean after removing them with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips for at least five years. These are easy to use and frequency of use depends on season and location. If I am in Florida during the summer I would use them 2-3 times a week. Winter in Chicago is once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Use and application? I wash my face thoroughly with a good cleanser and rinse. Your face must be wet when applying, but your hands should be dry. Remove the strip from the backing and apply over the bridge of your nose. Press in place and make sure the strip adheres thoroughly. Go watch tv or read a book. You will feel this tightening as it dries. When completely dry, remove the strip and wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;This works well. Gross but if you check the strip side which had adhered to your skin you will definitely see spikey little blackheads adhered to the strip. Ick, but ick in a good way.  To look at me you wouldn&#x27;t be aware I had blackheads in this area unless you looked at a magnifying mirror. I think the blackheads have lessened with steady use, but I still deal with surface skin impurities and these strips have been very effective in keeping blackheads, etc. at bay.</li>
            <li> I was super eager to use these when they arrived, the results I found were repulsive as well as impressive. Turns out I had more gunk in my pores than my boyfriend, quite shameful but now my skin feels very smooth and soft, no more bumps or unsightly freckle like features that are in no way freckles (because if they were I may have considered them to be a rather cute and charming feature). Well, case and point is that these work wonderfully, they hurt a little when I pulled mine off to the point my eyes were watering quite a bit, but there was so much stuff on it.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> I bought these today (not from Amazon however) and was really excited to try them out. I take really good care of my face - I use a gentle face wash, a pore refining wash, a hydrating toner, and then moisturizer ever day yet still had a few tiny black heads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions exactly; wet my nose, applied, let dry for 15 minutes, then pulled off. I actually saw nothing on the strips! I don&#x27;t honestly know how well they worked or if they even worked at all. I&#x27;ll try them again in a week and see how they do then.</li>
            <li> i use this all the time.</li>
            <li> this is a great and easy to use product, simple directions are included. i love being able to buy it in bulk on Amazon, and for a very fair price. you can actually see the dirt come off when you peel the strip off.</li>
            <li> This should be called nose strips as you can&#x27;t really use it anywhere else on your body. Extremely painful as well!!</li>
            <li> I found his product to be quite useful. I would recommend though that it should be used more than once a month as you would get the same effect as when u first used the strip</li>
            <li> This product works just as advertised. What I especially liked was the large size box available at this website. No more concerns about running out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Bought it after my lady recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised as the product exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use &amp; quite effective.</li>
            <li> ive always used these strips . and i like them. i use them once every 2 weeks .&lt;br /&gt;they get the job done and it doesnt hurt too much to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;looking forward to buying more</li>
            <li> Love these things!  No product works better at getting junk out of my pores.</li>
            <li> it work well and I have used three times to make my nose more clearly</li>
            <li> I have been a little disappointed in these strips. I followed the directions and even tried a few tricks and the best I could get was so so results. It definitely seem to help to leave it on the full 15 minutes at least. But leaving it on that long or longer seemed to irritate my skin a little. I was never able to get the results described on the commercials where there is a forest of blackheads. I have massive pores and lots of blackheads and after using one of these strips maybe a third of them would be on the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely disappointed and I don&#x27;t think I will be buying more when I run out. Unless the last few uses do something amazing.</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;They actually work; if you apply them correctly (make sure your face is wet; simply getting it damp isn&#x27;t enough to make them stick properly, in my experience, and then press the strip down, paying special attention to anywhere you know you&#x27;ve got blackheads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;It can be difficult to make sure they are in place (my blackheads are only in the creases of my nose, and they didn&#x27;t stick properly unless I held them down for 30 seconds).  It&#x27;s also a bit painful to remove them--but no more painful than peeling a band-aid off and you can remove a layer of skin with the glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re worth it, but use them sparingly; the glue is a bit painful and it can dry out your skin, which means you&#x27;ll need to moisturize, which can clog up the pores you just opened.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no idea that my nose was bad, and it definitely isn&#x27;t compared to a lot of the videos you see out there of massive blackheads being pulled out. BUT! I decided to get this after I was beginning to become bothered by cleaning the pores with my fingers because they were definitely noticeable when you got real close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and before peeling it off, it was almost as though you could actually see the strip sucked into the pores ready to pull stuff out.  Sure enough, the strip came off painlessly, just a little tug on the skin.  If you have really sensitive skin I can see where this would cause problems.  Needless to say from the title, it certainly worked. My nose feels fantastic and I was shocked at how much it got out. It left my nose a little red but that&#x27;s quickly fading and boy oh boy does it feel smooth and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing the real results after a couple uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. It is a waste of money. The strips don&#x27;t stick and fall of 3 secs after</li>
            <li> These strips work great at removing black heads from your nose if you want your nose clean I would definitely recommend these strips!</li>
            <li> I dont have very dirty nose but yes there were black heads which I have been trying to get clear from I dont know how long. I have spend so much so far in saloons trying getting steam and bearing so much paid and shedding tears to get these out but no luck...this product is like a magic...you apply it on your nose on your wet nose (make sure your nose is wet all place where this is getting applied), wait for 20 mins and remove it....voila you see all the dirt and black heads coming out...if the nose is too dirty you may need to repeat twice or thrice but hell...this is amazing....a BIG THANK YOU</li>
            <li> These really work for my face. I love this brand! They were a little costy but totally worth it:) I always refer people with face problems, to buy these</li>
            <li> OH yeah, these things work. Amazing! Where have you been all my life, Biore Pore Strips? I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I simply wet my nose as the instructions said to do, put the strip on and forgot it for about 15 minutes. When I pulled it off I was shocked at what it had pulled from my pores. I put the strip under my &#x27;day&#x27; lamp and a magnifying glass because it looked like dark stubbles of hair! Gross! Especially since I sure don&#x27;t have any hair on my nose -- nor was all that black &#x27;dirt&#x27; visible to my naked eye! I knew my pores were large there but I didn&#x27;t know they were THAT bad. I&#x27;ll be using this weekly now. My nose even felt smoother afterward as if the cleaned out pores had made the skin itself tighter. I highly recommend this product to feel like you&#x27;ve done a super thorough job of cleaning ALL of the skin on your face.</li>
            <li> why dont salons use this for extraction instead of the painful extractor instrument !!&lt;br /&gt;i was skeptical whether it would work for me cos i dont have large pores and my blackeheads are usually deep set ! but it worked - its not 100% but definitely 80 %!! and that is so cool - coz it is literally zero pain ! it works wonders for people will large pores and pulls out almost 95% of grime ! :D&lt;br /&gt;make sure to tone ur skin after use with ice or toner and you will be glowing for next 15 days :)</li>
            <li> Although, yes these strips work to get the dirt out of your pore, they stretch out your pores when you pull them off and getting rid of enlarged pores is almost impossible. And when you stretch out your pores it is easier for them to catch dirt and its just not good! Do more research!</li>
            <li> it always works well to remove the black-heads on nose.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the 14 count package so I can use long time.&lt;br /&gt;The only one my complaint about it is that it is NOT cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The price seems a little bit expensive than the selling in grocery store, at least the grocery store in my area had a better deal than amazon price.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but I&#x27;ve found that it only really cleans the pores that aren&#x27;t deep. It&#x27;s pretty expensive, too when you look at the cost per strip. Still, there aren&#x27;t many products out there that are better.</li>
            <li> These do work at pulling out black heads, but unless you add something else to your regimen to prevent them, they&#x27;re just going to come back. Try a baking soda mask a couple times a week to cut the oil.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use it once a week on my nose and it works great!! I need something fast with having 3 kids and this is fast and easy to apply!!</li>
            <li> best stuff on the market hands down</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used. Very good results.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me but it doesn&#x27;t really working for my wife.</li>
            <li> They work but run out quick</li>
            <li> I received only 2 out of 3 orders (placed and paid for on January 11 th 2013) on January 28th 2013. I will be following up with Customer Service.</li>
            <li> I used to use these all the time when Biore first brought these nose strips out but then they got a little on the pricey side and I eventually stopped using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I forgot how well they do work. They are so easy to use too. Just cleanse your face first, then make sure your nose is wet, apply the nose strip, wait 15 minutes, peel the strip off, and if you&#x27;re like me, look at the strip to see what it pulled. I know it sounds gross and improper to talk about but half of the fun of these strips is seeing what is on the strip once you&#x27;re done with it. And be glad that your face is now cleaner because you used the Biore nose strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure that if your skin can dry out easily to put on some mosturizer after using the strips as they can dry out your skin a bit.</li>
            <li> A blackhead is an enlarged pore clogged with keratin and sebum (an oily secretion of the sebaceous gland).  The black color is not dirt but is oxidation.  It&#x27;s unsightly and should be removed. Bior&amp;eacute; Deep Cleansing Pore Strips do the job quickly, easily and inexpensively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatives? Duct tape might perform as well, but isn&#x27;t sanitary.  Facials are certainly more luxurious, but where can you get a facial for $8.20?  Clearly, the Bior&amp;eacute; Strips are the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, there&#x27;s the convenience of  Bior&amp;eacute; Deep Cleansing Pore Strips.  A facial takes an hour or more at a salon, plus the commute.  With Bior&amp;eacute;, you just slap on the strips and go about your business.  No one&#x27;s the wiser!  Ten to 15 minutes later, you&#x27;re finished, and your skin is clear and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of these cleansing strips are both amazing and appalling. After peeling off the dry strip (yes, this is a bit painful), the blackheads appear on the strip.  When viewed through magnification, those specks on the strips are clearly blackheads.  These cleansing strips really work and leave you with the instant satisfaction of removing and discarding these facial imperfections.</li>
            <li> The strips got off only some of the blackheads on my nose, but not all of them. Sorta disappointed because there were so many great reviews. It works better if you use these after a shower and when you peel them off really slowly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a box of Biore pore strips in over 5 years. I am impressed on several new factors: There is better coverage to more adequately cover the nose area, strips stick much better, and lastly there is no gooey residue that I remember being left behind on the older strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because I like the improvements, however I feel that it didn&#x27;t quite get everything. My pores looked cleaner and there was a definite removal of gunk, but I feel like they didn&#x27;t remove as much as they did on the older version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, these strips work and get some of the dirt out but it will not be a deep clean.</li>
            <li> Who ever came up with this is amazing because this product works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using it, it may also be gross, but i enjoy taking a look afterwards to see... this was on my skin... and i like to know that it&#x27;s no longer there!!!</li>
            <li> I love it, I have sensitive/ combination skin and was worried this might be too harsh for my skin, but it&#x27;s really good. I didn&#x27;t know I had that many blackheads on my nose until I saw it on the peel. It was nasty, but my nose felt so clean. Very effective product. I would post a picture but it&#x27;s really nasty, full of dirty blackheads. But I highly recommend this, you will see the difference.</li>
            <li> I did everything the pack told me to do but every time I use these they don&#x27;t quite get out all that gunk. I mean that they get out only like 40% of everything. Maybe my skin is weird but other strips have worked better for me. They still do something though and aren&#x27;t completely useless - they just don&#x27;t work for me that well.</li>
            <li> Finally!, Ive found the solution to my problem. First time using this was a success. I love how smooth my nose feels now. Ive always struggeld with a oily nose full of blackheads and this product has definitely satisfied my needs. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I used this product just as directed and It did not work out one bit. Zero blackheads taken out dont understand why reviews are so high at all. Wont recommend it and dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I used to use these when they first came out on the market, and I&#x27;m happy to see that they&#x27;re still the same.  I have pores that (TMI alert) pretty much overflow with gunk if I don&#x27;t exfoliate every other day, so my pores are ideal to use with these Biore pore strips.  I get a grossly satisfying amount of little dots of gunk all over the pore strips after I remove them.  However, my pores aren&#x27;t \\&quot;minimized\\&quot; - they&#x27;re mostly left as gaping, empty holes once the plugs of gunk are removed, so I then wash with warm water and facial wash, dry my face, then apply a BHA liquid.  After a few weeks of using these, there&#x27;s really no lasting change in my pores and I didn&#x27;t expect there to be.  My pores are what they are and they require maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice to use every once in a while to get that gunk out, and I do think these strips are more gentle on my skin compared to to \\&quot;expressing\\&quot; the pores to get the gunk out.  But, I still have to exfoliate every other day to keep the pore gunk overflow at bay.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they are supposed to do.  I use them twice a week and my pores look so much smaller and cleaner than they used to.  Quick, easy, not painful, and inexpensive.  What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> This one works somehow, not perfectly. If the size is little bigger it will be better. Hopefully they can make the improvement.</li>
            <li> try them in the past and still think they are absolutely amazing! if your problem is superficial this would work out just fine</li>
            <li> This thing works so well!!! I used them on my husband... and ewwww I saw all that that I didnt want to ( on his nose) and used on me and did a fair job.. but I cud really see the after effect on my darling.. DEfinitely buying them again!!</li>
            <li> This product started stripping my nose and breaking it out after 3 uses. Would not use again, maybe there is one for sensitive skin I am not aware of, but this is not for all skin types.</li>
            <li> The box was damaged, and there is only 10 stripes in my box. When I checked the box, I found out there is a slip on the bottom of this box, so I guess that&#x27;s why I missed 4 stripes. I would like to have other 4 strips back :(</li>
            <li> The product works great and has been a family favorite for years. My only minor quibble is that it&#x27;s usually a good idea to rewash your face, as sticky residue is sometimes left on your skin. Otherwise, it works great, with results you can see...literally!</li>
            <li> I got this product for my wife and she loves it.  She told me it did a great job of cleaning out her pores without any irritation.  Follow the directions though because if you screw it up it won&#x27;t stick correctly and you&#x27;ll have wasted some money.  And these things aren&#x27;t cheap.  But do it right and it will clean out those pores.  She applied one on my nose to show me what it can do and it really did a nice job.  As someone else mentioned, the strip is really gross after you peel it off but that means it did a good job.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Allow me to elaborate: you know those pre-cut slits that allow the strip to flex and adjust to your nose?  Well as physics would have it when they fold and overlap each other, they make this little &amp;#34;tent&amp;#34; that doesn&#x27;t stick to your nose, allowing anything under it to not get pulled out.  It also doesn&#x27;t reach down past the nostrils, which also have a ton of clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that makes any sense :\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the effectiveness of the strip itself, it&#x27;s pretty awesome.  The amount of pulled pore debris is astounding, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;A brief note however: as soon as your nose is cleared, expect your nose to be suddenly oily as hell, now that they&#x27;re given free rein to release oil out of their cleared pores.  Make sure you have some facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has HUGE pores on his nose with blackheads, and when i finally convinced him to use these, he ripped it off his nose and it had pulled so much out! It was actually pretty gross, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. While most imitation brands are basically the same (i.e. Walgreens), Biore is the way to go because I find it to be the most effective. This is the best way to prepare your face for pore strips and the results are great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Take a hot, steamy shower. Make sure to remove all of your makeup before or during your shower. Use a warm bar of soap on your face so that it is completely clean and makeup free.&lt;br /&gt;2) (Skip this step if you have extremely sensitive or damaged skin.) After the shower, combine a small amount of baking soda with water. It should have that \\&quot;wet sand\\&quot; feel. Use this to exfoliate your skin and clean your pores. Do NOT scrub it on your skin. Gently rub this on your face in circular motions for about 30 seconds. Be sure to fully rinse the baking soda off of your face with cold water. I usually stand over the sink and gently rub it off while I splash the cold water onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;3) When you have completely rinsed off the baking soda, make sure your face is still fairly wet from the cold water and place the pore strips on. Keep them on until they are stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It should take about 10-15 minutes. If it is not working for you for some reason, DON&#x27;T panic. Simply wet your entire face until it slides right off. Do NOT rip it off or you will damage your skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These three steps work for me every time. It&#x27;s pretty amazing how much the pore strips pick up. I do this about once every week or two. I&#x27;d love to hear if it helps for you, so please let me know!</li>
            <li> These things are easy to use and they work well.  I like to use them shortly before cleaning my face with a good cleaner to get deep in the pores.</li>
            <li> You may not like what you find but these are great and do the job well, you dont have to keep it on for the full 15, 10 is fine. way cheaper on amazon than at the other stores like target or cvs</li>
            <li> Best out there. Leave on for 30 mins and great result!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought these, I expected them to be like every other product that claimed to magically remove blackheads. But a friend recommended it to me so I thought why not. First, throughly wet the area you want to remove blackheads from and apply the strip. Press down firmly and smooth it out to make sure there are no air bubbles. Wait until the strip is completely dry and peel off. It hurts a bit when you peel it off and to my surprise, it actually worked!  It was incredible! I couldn&#x27;t believe just how much crap was in my pores that I couldn&#x27;t even see. I&#x27;ve been using these for years and I examine the strips for too long every time.Theres an odd satisfaction that comes from seeing all the gross stuff that isn&#x27;t in your face anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this only three stars is that the formula used to be a lot better. The packaging is different and so is the product. It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well now as it used to. Another thing is that it doesn&#x27;t work at all on the center of your nose or on your chin.</li>
            <li> These NEVER work for me. I&#x27;ve tried them again and again because my boyfriend usually has some on hand. I follow all the directions and even always attempt to use them after I&#x27;ve taken a really hot shower and my pores should be &amp;#34;open.&amp;#34; No luck, they never pull anything out. Horrible</li>
            <li> The pore strips work very well, just one suggestion, don&#x27;t leave them on too long,  a must have for removing black &amp; white heads from your nose. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very good! will buy again.</li>
            <li> I think all women love this product.</li>
            <li> I tried these a few times to reduce the amount of blackheads on my nose. After following the instructions to the letter, it did get a few cleared out, but a light squeeze would get more out. It only kinda works as advertised but it doesn&#x27;t get my nose really clean and clear. They&#x27;re pretty expensive only to not work really well. Sorry to say, but I just cannot recommend these strips.</li>
            <li> I have horrible blackheads on my nose always have, when I was younger I tried these and they didn&#x27;t work, I tried every home remedy everything and nothing worked. After just forgeting about it for awhile I went to a wedding and decided to give it another try. I must not have been doing something right because it worked like a dream, a few left but they too left after repeated use.</li>
            <li> A very effecive aid to keep one&#x27;s physical appearance at its best.</li>
            <li> My son uses these so I buy them online.  They are good value.</li>
            <li> I usually use these right after taking a shower when my pores are probably most open.  I&#x27;ve also used them while just dabbing some hot water on my nose.  Seems to work just as well.  Very satisfying when you remove them blackheads.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time and it was a new experience for me,  I&#x27;ve never tried anything like it and in my opinion it was awesome!!  I never thought I had gunk like that coming out of my pores on my nose, yuck!  I give it a good review, it&#x27;s worth buying this product!!  I&#x27;ll not use anything else, even my husband likes it!  I&#x27;ll try out the rest of Biore products!</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition that, during healing, also produces quite a few blackheads. Yeah, skin is sort of gross. Anyway, I can pop one of these on and within ten minutes, all of the blackheads are GONE. Even took a picture of last - rather impressive - haul of blackhead removal with these strips. Just make sure your face is wet before you put the strip on, leave it on about ten minutes, rip it off like a band-aid, and you&#x27;re done. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Great way to unclog your pores. alittle pricey tho.</li>
            <li> My daughters love these. Works as described.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these and claims that nothing else works as well as they do.  I buy her a pack every now and then.  No complaints as it works as expected!</li>
            <li> This strips don&#x27;t&#x27; work, don&#x27;t waste your money and get a good cleanser, they remove some black points but after 10&#x27; you can see them again. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I must agree with other users that the quality seems to have decreased - perhaps the company&#x27;s using less adhesive. Whatever the case may be, the strips do work if you follow the instructions on the box. Here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash your face w/a mild cleanser to remove excess oil.&lt;br /&gt;2. Pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. Steam open your pores for five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Put the strips on (I use them on my forehead too - you wouldn&#x27;t believe how much gunk is beneath your skin!)&lt;br /&gt;5. Let dry until the strips get super hard, like paper mach&amp;eacute;.&lt;br /&gt;6. Pull strips (use good judgment; not too fast, not too slow).&lt;br /&gt;7. Go to a mirror and inspect. The strips won&#x27;t clear every pore so if there&#x27;s a blackhead that&#x27;s noticeable, with a tissue, squeeze it out gently.&lt;br /&gt;8. Rinse your skin with cold water. It&#x27;ll snap shut your pores &amp; you&#x27;ll be left feeling a new kind of clean!</li>
            <li> I love these strips because they&#x27;re so easy to use and very effective.  Its scary to see the stuff these strips will pull out of your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips&lt;br /&gt;Wash gently and thoroughly before applying the strip.&lt;br /&gt;Once the strip is in place let it dry completely!&lt;br /&gt;Remove slowly.&lt;br /&gt;After removing the strip some of the material will stay stuck to your skin.  Wash thoroughly again to avoid clogged pores.</li>
            <li> And I haven&#x27;t a complaint. For me, they work perfectly. I use them right before I do any deep cleaning of my face, and to my mind, I&#x27;d never be without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I did not realize or expect this but on the long run you will have less blackheads if you stop squeezing them out but instead use a strip 1-2 times per week. I do not exactly know why and can only imagine that it is because the squeezing partially damages or clogs again while the strip almost imitates the natural way to get out.&lt;br /&gt;TIP:&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on your nose significantly longer than 10 min. Even if you feel the strip is dry wait a little longer as it works better this way.</li>
            <li> Does the trick as intended and works well. A bit sticky when using and feels &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; to face, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I remember years ago I bought strips like this but they were so different.&lt;br /&gt;First, these go on a wet face and they dry sort of like a cast for a broken bone but they don&#x27;t hurt when they come off.  They peel off easily and gently and leave no residue.  I have some blackheads that are not really visible but this strip did pull them out.  It&#x27;s great. One application and you can have a smoother apprearance on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product and I would recommend it, especially if your trouble spots are the sides of your nose.</li>
            <li> Want clean skin?  Use these.  I cannot live without them.  It&#x27;s like mouthwash for your skin!  Keeps it soft and clean and fresh.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Pulls the large plugs of gunk out, but still leaves some smaller bits.</li>
            <li> I tried both the nose and face strips and neither one stuck to my face.  I even tried rubbing it to keep it on my skin and nada.  Did not stick and certainly didn&#x27;t pull any dirt out. I returned it and got another box thinking that box was defective.  But same thing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I guess this product doesn&#x27;t work on some people. All it did was dry up and then peel off. Pores still&lt;br /&gt;clogged.</li>
            <li> These strips simply don&#x27;t work for me.  They don&#x27;t appear to remove any blackheads from the center of the nose, even when used promptly after a warm shower.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t even work! the adhesive isn&#x27;t strong its very weak....the product stiffens as instructed but part of the sticky stuff remains on my face after I peel it off in 10/15 minutes! Not very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a blackhead sufferer since high school (I&#x27;m in my early 20s now) and I&#x27;ve used scrubs, pore strips etc. and Biore pore strips tend to do a great job with unclogging my pores of blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack does a good job, but often times, the sticky strip would rip as I gently remove the plastic and doesn&#x27;t dry as well as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t pick up as much as I would like the strips to too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve tried the green and pink Biore strip packaging (the Ultra deep cleansing strips I believe they&#x27;re called )before, and I must say, I prefer those over these.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still better than nothing, but I like feeling cleaner in one go, rather than using two strips to feel ultimately clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service and packaging was decent though for standard shipping :)</li>
            <li> If you have black heads chances are that its genetic.  Our skin naturally replenishes itself and the oil build up creates black heads.  I used these and saw the gross little white or black &#x27;trees&#x27; all over the strip, but it did nothing for the day to day black heads I always have.  It removed the biggest ones, but my nose was still covered in black heads.  I used three of them a week for three weeks and I still have just as many.</li>
            <li> I actually like this product, it is so easy to use and makes you feel so clean and refreshed. It definitely does a great job removing black heads. This product is not so great for really deep black heads which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I wish this was a little cheaper, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really worth $1 each. I would recommend getting the 14 ct for about $1 more than the 8 ct. Overall, I would point a friend towards this product.</li>
            <li> It cleaned out a few pores, mostly along the side of the nose. Nothing along the bridge of the nose. Will not be purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed by this product after hearing all the hype. I have very large pores on my nose and expected a lot of junk on the strip when I removed it.  Nearly nothing.  I need to try it again, and will update after I do, but it&#x27;s hard to get motivated to use them again after the first experience. :-(</li>
            <li> Great product.  A little strange to use the first time, and looks kind of icky when you pull it off - it clears the pores out and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how much stuff is on your face! but easy to use, and works.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have used it. He has many blackheads on his head and this thing performed miracles sucking them all out. However, it seems as though the blackheads always come back so I don&#x27;t consider it a permanent solution.  For me I have some blackheads on my nose and it worked, but not that well. Because it worked so well on my husband though, I can&#x27;t complain too much. It&#x27;s a good solution, but not the best for removing blackheads. I recommend a Clarisonic and the Boscia Black Mask, or Apivita&#x27;s green clay mask and those should target the root of the blackhead issue, rather than just temporarily removing them with a strip. This product is fun to use though and see the results immediately.</li>
            <li> Bought them for mum. She loves them!</li>
            <li> Guilty pleasure of mine. I have a blackhead issue from time to time and these certainly pull out some gross stuff. While I&#x27;m not sure 100% of these really help that much in the long run, it sure does give instant satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I have blackheads around my nose. The stuff pulls off most of them in 15 minutes. I do it about once every three weeks for maintenance</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. And the fact you can see the results on the strip is very satisfying.</li>
            <li> Product is good as mentioned</li>
            <li> I Think it is expired.It doesn&#x27;t stick to nose.</li>
            <li> SPIDER VEINS!!!!!!! permanent damage. The directions say &amp;#34;do not use on skin prone to spider veins&amp;#34; Well, I have never had any spider veins until now. However, if you are willing to take the risk of having permanent red lines on your nose, they make your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Works for at the surface and peals off dead skin, but doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads. Not for me at least.</li>
            <li> Great product for the nose.</li>
            <li> I used some strips from the 99p store and they did exactly the same as these. I had never used strips before and cheap ones or these did the same job!</li>
            <li> These are just okay. I use them once a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any real reduction in the amount of blackheads on my nose. Not sure what all the hype is about. But they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I think it could be better. It doesn&#x27;t always take out all black heads. But, it is better than anything else I have come across in the market.</li>
            <li> These work amazing. You can see the results.</li>
            <li> I found this product to work very well.  The most annoying part of these strips is the uncomfortable feeling I have on my face while they are working.  It&#x27;s pretty unbearable, yet, when I take the strips off, I can tell that they definitely worked.  So, I so have mixed emotions... I think I will just squirm for awhile, and have a clear nose.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It really cleans out your pores, you&#x27;ll be amazed! didn&#x27;t get all, but it did get a majority of the blackheads.</li>
            <li> I use these once a week and they&#x27;re amazing!! I was a little doubtful of if it would actually work but you can see it worked when you pull the strip off. There were a ton of blackheads on the strip. After a couple weeks my nose started to look a lot better than it has probably ever.</li>
            <li> My complexion isn&#x27;t too bad but I was certainly hoping to see it do more. My nose feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom but looks close to the same</li>
            <li> Really a great discover to me! I always will wish have something like this in my life because is really helpful and make the difference!!!  I strongly recommend it and my vote is to they invent a more economic box with at least 100 strips inside!</li>
            <li> I am a dog groomer and get tiny dog hair splinters stuck in the creases of my nose.  Although I wash my face every night, Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips are the only product that I can find to remove the tiny splinters that irritate my skin.  The added bonus of removing my blackheads is just icing on the cake.  I have been using them for years with no ill effects.  My skin is fairly sensitive and as long as I moisturize afterwards and treat my nose with a bit of respect for a few days I heal just fine.  My only gripe is that sometimes the strip doesn&#x27;t like to stick in every nook and cranny of my nose creases but I feel it&#x27;s the way that I put it on my nose.  Someday I will find the magic secret that allows me to utilize the strip to it&#x27;s maximum capacity.....</li>
            <li> i love using biore strips, if you use them twice a week your pores will be flawless and clean :) i haven&#x27;t really had a problem with acne or pimples but i get a lot of black heads and popping them only makes my skin look worse. i will continue to use these and recommend anyone with blackheads to use them, they are the bomb (:</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  It did absolutely nothing.  I wonder what the differences in skin conditions must be.</li>
            <li> I used these every 3 days for over a month and there is no visible  shrinkage in my pore size, nor is there a reduction in build-up of blackhead-like dirt in the pores on my nose. I refrained from squeezing the pores during the entire month if that matters. There was definitely dirt pulled from nearly each pore when using the stripes, but one day later it was just all back again, and I wash my face like a fanatic. After a month I tried once more squeezing the pores with a fingernail and in 30 seconds remove two times what a strip does.</li>
            <li> I have had black heads on my noise since I can remember. I used strips like these when I was younger and they did nothing. But I tried these and I loved them. I do use them 2-3 times a week sometimes I forget but if I keep up with it my black heads stay gone. I would totally recommend these...also it says to leave it on for 10-15 minutes..you need to leave it on for at least 15 minutes. I usually leave mine on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Eeeeewwww these work really well!</li>
            <li> They pull some zits out. Not all.</li>
            <li> Different beauty products work on different people and Biore&#x27;s straps have always worked wonders for me. I like to put these on right after I shower while my pores are still enlarged and nose is still moist that way I don&#x27;t have to do any extra work to put them on.</li>
            <li> Works well, shocking to see the pad after first use!  I am a guy and scrub my face 1-2 times a day, I use this every 4-6 weeks and still have a hundred or so black heads on the pad.  With regular washing and these pore strips I have decreased the size of my poor&#x27;s by 80% and my face looks 10 years younger.  Caution:  Use at night or you will look like Rudolf at for the next 4-6 hours.  Do not use more than recommended as it does take a layer of skin off.  Does not hurt much!</li>
            <li> These work pretty well. They don&#x27;t get all of the pores I thought they would. I can still extract from some pores manually after using these.  They do rip off a layer of skin, thus probably why using them not more than once every 3 days is instructed.  Avoid air pockets when applying by carefully pressing to skin as you put it on, sort of like rolling wallpaper, to get in the nose crevices.</li>
            <li> I have try other products, they dont work&lt;br /&gt;I did try it, and I am surprised, worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you need something like this, this is great.</li>
            <li> These really work for my face. I love this brand! They were a little costly but totally worth it :) I always refer people with face problems,</li>
            <li> These strips are the best and easiest thing ever to clear clogged pores on your nose!</li>
            <li> These have been around forever, and they still work.  I find that using an oil absorbing mask first helps to pull the impurities out and get the blackheads closer to the surface.  After washing your face, apply the nose strip.  It will pull out more blackheads this way than if you used the strip alone.</li>
            <li> OK, it&#x27;s basically a hi-tech piece of tape for your face.  It works well, and clears out the gunk in your nose.  Yuck...but that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Works great if you follow the directs exactly.</li>
            <li> I have always used Biore strips and recently decided to start ordering them on Amazon to save time and money. They arrived in good condition and worked as expected. If you&#x27;ve never used them before, they don&#x27;t unclog every single pore but you can see that they do unclog a good 80 - 90%. With repeated use I feel like they definitely help keep my pores more refined and prevent T- Zone breakouts. I use them once or twice a month and I do apply this to my chin as well so the box is the perfect amount for me. They are easy to use, work quickly, and don&#x27;t leave a ton of redness. Only reason I don&#x27;t give them 5 stars is they aren&#x27;t 100% effective at clearing all pores.</li>
            <li> Really works wonders!</li>
            <li> These things did not seem to work for me All it seemed to do was make my nose really red. But they are worth a shot.</li>
            <li> The strips didn&#x27;t work for me. I followed the directions precisely but did not have good results. They unclogged a couple small pores but mostly just removed all of the fine facial hair that was under the strip. I&#x27;m not sure if I have small pores or what the issue is but it seems like the strips have a wide range of results. Judging by the pictures that were posted, they appear to work for some people but definitely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. Doesn&#x27;t get everything :&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do this often due to my sensitive skin so it&#x27;s about once a month, but when I do I&#x27;m always amazed and grossed out, haha. My only complaint is that this doesn&#x27;t come in a full face mask. I&#x27;d say my nose is average to small, and that the strip coves my nose and the beginning parts of my cheeks. Your skin must be thoroughly moistened  for it to really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it right after you&#x27;ve washed your face, splash a little extra water on and then smooth the strip out so there are no air bubbles.</li>
            <li> I don;t know what happened to biore or if I just got a bad batch but these hardly worked. I don&#x27;t buy often because these things are so expensive. The lat time I bought them before this time was probably 5 years ago and at that time they worked amazing. Every time I have used this batch, and yes I use them correctly, right after a steamy shower, I wet my nose and leave it on until it dries, almost all my blackheads are left on my face. Even my boyfriend with huge pores whose blackheads come out easily by squeezing had hardly anything on the strip. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Addictive to see your blackheads come out, but bad for your skin. Use seldom!</li>
            <li> These strips truly clean the pores on your nose and remove everything on them as deep down as is possible. Works better than any facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The strips really work - you get the proof on the strip itself every time you use it ! My pores got smaller too so I try to use them regularly.Hope amazon will carry them for a long time !</li>
            <li> So, I have many blackheads on my nose, I can press them and get the gunk out but they come back. I bought these strips hoping to solve my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I&#x27;d like to note is that the strips LOVE to stick to themselves. The first strip I opened stuck to itself immediately and wouldn&#x27;t come part. The second strip went on fine, it got hard after 10-15 minutes and I peeled the strip off towards the bottom of my nose (like the instructions say to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got a few blackheads, but nothing worth paying for (maybe 4-5 blackheads came out). The rest were left unscathed. Also, the strip leaves your skin uncomfortably dry where it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so conscious of keeping my face clean, especially my nose. A lot of times exfoliating scrubs are not enough especially when pores tend to be a little bigger (like mine are). These pore strips are the answer to everything. They are so powerful and remove nearly all the ugly blackheads. I can&#x27;t image my beauty routine without them. And you&#x27;re going to think I&#x27;m super weird, but seeing the results on the strip kind of excites me...knowing that all that junk is removed from my skin- it&#x27;s such a relief. My nose always feels smoother (and call me crazy, but it feels smaller) after I use these strips.</li>
            <li> I have used these strips for years because they work wonderfully at getting out the lotions and makeup that accumulate in the pores on the sides of my nose. The price here at Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love biore!? I always stock up on these for my biweekly mini facials I do at home. And of course I occasionally pamper the boyfriend&#x27;s nose as well. :)</li>
            <li> doesnt work as good as the deep cleaning ones which is annoying but you only get 6 of those fer same price wtf</li>
            <li> really love this pore strip. i tried to other brands but none works as better as this. worth buying.. had this on subsciption</li>
            <li> Only used one time till now but it is all I need. It cleaned my pores perfectly, I am still feeling it.</li>
            <li> I started using these back in the mid-90&#x27;s in while I was working in Tokyo.  GF complained about my pores and told me to use them and honestly, works extremely well.  They probably could use my strip as an advertisement and to be truthful, most users will get a small perverse pleasure from seeing all the dirt and oil formed in small stalactite formation.  My gf would say it&#x27;s gross but when she used it, she would always examine it like a jeweler and a prized diamond if I wasn&#x27;t looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are ultra (super strength) versions of this in the light green box which I usually use but these seem to work maybe 90% as well.  To be the most effective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-take a warm shower&lt;br /&gt;-wet the strip lightly&lt;br /&gt;-apply, press it to the nose and don&#x27;t touch it for 15-20&lt;br /&gt;-hide in a discrete place so no eyes of judgment will see you especially if you&#x27;re a dude&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to this working is opening the pores up first and making sure your skin and strip are moist.  It&#x27;s activated with water.  I actually pour a little water on it and shake the excess off so when you apply it, it will slide a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use twice a week.  Works better than any other method known to mankind for blackheads and cleaning pores.  The only downside is it totally cleans your pores out so...sometimes makes them even more visible right after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anybody I know is reading this, I deny everything.</li>
            <li> It works! I dont get alot of black heads but I wear makeup so my pores get clogged and this will clear them right out. My hubby gets black heads bad and his nose looks amazing after using these...</li>
            <li> If you have let your skin go for a while you can wind up with deeply embedded sebum in your pores.  Not everyone I&#x27;ve talked to thinks pulling that out is a good idea.  For me personally I think it has helped because I had developed very large blocked pores on my nose.  Over time I&#x27;ve been able to reduce that with biore strips, and comedone extractor and regular use of 5% Benzoyl peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best use you&#x27;ll ever get from the biore strip is the first use where it will probably pull out huge black filaments from your skin.  Initially i used them once a week but now I find once or twice a month is a pretty good schedule.  I do find it is easy to overdo it with the strips as they can be a little bit harsh on sensitive skin.  The only complaint I have is that sometimes the \\&quot;glue\\&quot; sticks to my skin rather than pulling out the sebum as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of the Pore Strips free from the Vine review program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works.  I haven&#x27;t tried other products from Biore, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the brand.  But the deep cleansing pore strips are easy to use, and you can tell they clean the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wash the skin, wet it down, dry your hands, then peel one of the white strips off its backing and smooth it onto the nose area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sticks only when wet.  You have to wait until it dries.  That can be (in dry weather) about as long as it takes to brush your teeth, or maybe read a chapter.  Then you peel off the stiffened strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peeling off can be painful, like peeling off a band-aid.  Afterwards, hold the strip sideways to a light, and you can see where the detritus from each pore has been pulled out.  Gross, yes, but you can see the difference in your skin right away.  Other pore cleansing lotions say they clean your skin, but you have to just believe it.  With this, you can see instantly that it worked.</li>
            <li> I ordered these strips because I noticed some blackheads on my nose that refused to come out with face wash. So glad I got these - they worked just as I expected and needed them to. I was a little worried after reading some reviews that said the strips didn&#x27;t stick... let me just say, whoever wrote those reviews was clearly not following the directions. Your nose has to be wet before applying, and you must stick the smooth side to your nose - the side that is originally stuck to the plastic. I&#x27;ve had no problems, and my blackheads are all gone!</li>
            <li> I have a fairly clear complexion with the exception of my  nose. I bought these in the hopes that it would help, and it did. I find that they are more effective when you leave them on longer, so I left mine on for 40 minutes instead of 20. Taking it off, however much you wet the strip will hurt, so I rip it off very quickly. I DO NOT recommend this product for sensitive/dry skin. I always moisturize before and after, or else it rips at my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Although they don&#x27;t fix the problem at all, they do make it fun to clean out your pores!  I love looking at all the tiny little white/blackheads that come off on it.  It seems they are all back the next day, but it sure is fun!  I probably won&#x27;t buy these again even though they do exactly what they say they will because it&#x27;s more of a novelty.  If it would shrink pores or help keep them from coming back I would be a bigger supporter of the product!</li>
            <li> These are okay. Sometimes they leave a white residue on my skin and is hard to remove even with warm water and vigorous scrubbing... Have not been able to find another decent brand so I always keep coming back to Biore strips. I like the tightening effect on my pores and it makes my skin and pores feel rejuvenated and clean. It&#x27;s pretty amazing when you use these and you think you have clear skin and then see all the gunk come out!</li>
            <li> These work pretty well. You do have to get your face really wet in order for them to really stick. Pulling them off hurts a little, but not too much. However, I&#x27;ve used the nose ones for my upper cheeks and it really hurts to take them off there. The nose is fine, though. When you pull them off, it feels great to see all the black heads on the strip. The wetter you got your face, the better it will stick and the more that will come off. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of everything, but it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> The strips when used properly removes about 60% of the blackheads and unclogs pores. This is temporary though because the pores fill up just as quickly as they were unclogged and many times you&#x27;ll end up with more blackheads than before. The only way to get clear pores is to use this often which can be irritating to the skin and time consuming, especially for guys. The best way to reduce blackheads is just using a scrubbing face wash a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Does the job, mostly. Wet nose, peel strip, place strip on nose. Wait 15 min, peel, and see the junk that was once in your pores...&lt;br /&gt;I have one strip left and have used the product off and on for about 3-4 months. Misses just before the bridge of my nose, and I&#x27;ve tried adjusting the strip, applying different pressure, adding water and putting less water on. For the most part it works!</li>
            <li> my brother recommended this to me and i have to say, it&#x27;s really good. it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the big black heads and it sometimes leaves my skin oily, but it gets rid of most!</li>
            <li> I love them. They take all my blackheads away. I actually feel disappointed when I take it off and there&#x27;s not a whole bunch of junk underneath the product. I know that is gross but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> These strips are amazing! My boyfriend even uses them now! After I peel them off, I have to inspect them, because I think it&#x27;s so cool that so much crap is coming out of my pores. It looks like junkie stuff sticking straight up, like it literally pulls stuff straight out of the pores. It&#x27;s pretty cool. I love knowing that I can get all that junk OUT of my pores!</li>
            <li> face masks work better</li>
            <li> I love these strips, eventhough they hurt like hell to get the off, but they get the job done!!!!! I used them last night my face looks cleaner to me! They got here ultra quick so and also excited about that too!</li>
            <li> Very useful. Arrived on time!</li>
            <li> Works great you just have to really wash your nose well first and make sure its damp otherwise it doesnt work as well</li>
            <li> These are a nice solution for in between facials. They definitely clear up my nose a little, but not all the way.</li>
            <li> Used these in the past. Still works well. Still get grossed out buy all the stuff it pulls off, but cannot NOT look!</li>
            <li> I used this the first time and it did remove a bunch of blackheads from my nose but there were still quite a few still stuck. I was hoping this would remove all of them. I used it a couple days later hoping it would get a lot more. I had taken a shower before to try and open up my pores. It only got a few out. It is so rough on my skin I don&#x27;t think I could use it everyday. I still say it is definitely worth trying. it may work better for your application.</li>
            <li> These things are awesome. I mean the fact that you can actually see all the nastiness that comes out is kind of cool. You can just tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I love these pore strips. They really get everything out, you can see it on the strip. However, make sure you leave the strip on the entire time. I keep mine on for 15 minutes. Tip: After peeling off the strip removing the blackheads, rinse your face and go over the area with an ice cube. Pores close when subject to cold. So closing the pores will help prevent dirt from re accumulating.</li>
            <li> Wow after first use it took almost all dirt from my nose pores. It was so much dirt that I got shocked! I didn&#x27;t know I had so much hahaha. Just do how it says:  after shower, wet your nose and stick the strip. You won&#x27;t regret buying it, I promise ;)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely order it again</li>
            <li> I love these Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips are the best</li>
            <li> I forgot how much fun these are!  Easier to use now that they are peel and stick.  Very effective.  Wish that they came closer to the tip of my nose a little more but I can just position them a little differently every other time I use them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terribly noticeable blackheads, but I saw these at the local grocery store and decided to give them a try and see if they&#x27;re as good as I&#x27;ve heard they are. I followed all the instructions; cleaned my face with warm water, applied a warm washcloth to my nose to help open up my pores, made sure my nose was wet enough, applied the pore strip, and waited a little over 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was very disappointing. The strip literally did nothing except pull off some dead skin and the tiny blond hairs on my nose. It got maybe a couple little blackheads out, but that&#x27;s literally it. The rest of them were untouched. It worked no better than trying to make your own porestrip out of elmer&#x27;s glue (which is also ineffective).The skin on my nose didn&#x27;t even feel significantly softer or smoother, in fact it itches a little now even though I rinsed off any remaining residue and applied moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $7 for a pack of 8 strips, these are definitely not worth the money. Save it and buy something else like those black gel porestrips on Amazon (they&#x27;re cheaper and they&#x27;re much more effective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making a completely useless product, Biore. -_-</li>
            <li> These little strips rip the clog right out of your pores. It&#x27;s amazing and a little gross but VERY satisfying. Even the woman at the spa I see for facials recommends them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results I run a washcloth under hot water to open my pores as much as possible, hold it there for a bit. Then apply the strip to wet/damp skin. As it dries it develops a tight paper mâch&amp;eacute; feeling and you know you&#x27;re ready to excavate. Using even pressure on either side of the strip you pull it off, and then take a look at the side that was on your skin- it&#x27;s like a tiny mountain range of clogged up grossness that was once in your pores.&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s any residue left on your skin, which sometimes happens if your skin is too wet, then that same hot wash cloth will take it right off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve often cut strips in half, to get areas like beneath the corners of my mouth, or upper chin. Carve them up as needed, they still work great. This is a great way to remove blackheads, especially on the nose for men.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny, and they really WORK.&lt;br /&gt;Adding that the removal can sometimes be a little uncomfortable, they stick pretty well- not waxing painful, more like slowly pulling off a bandaid. But WORTH it.</li>
            <li> The instructions say leave a strip on for 10-15 minutes, or until it hardens. I only left one on for about 7 minutes (until it was hard), and it was so difficult to take off. It felt like I was removing a waxing strip from my nose! It made my eyes water and my skin turned very red around the area. I&#x27;m posting this about 10 minutes after I removed the strip, and the area still stings a little bit. I didn&#x27;t have horrible pores to start out with, but I think they&#x27;re worse now... Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these several times over the years and the quality has remained the same. I&#x27;ve found these do a great job at removing blackheads from my nose. One tip I would offer is to use a good exfoliator in the shower before hand then allow the strip to dry completely (15 minutes). It&#x27;s kinda cool/gross to see all the stuff it pulls off your nose.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, but it&#x27;s hard to use and kind of annoying. I tried using it after shower, after steam-toweling my face, and nothing seems to really help. I used up the whole pack without getting any real results. Kiehl&#x27;s Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Masque works a lot better and easier for me, as well as being a more economical choice (that batch lasts forever!) Also, you really can&#x27;t use the strips for other parts of your face, unlike with the mask. If you aren&#x27;t already used to this, I&#x27;d say go the other route and get a pore cleansing mask or lotion or some other product that works better.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m getting older it seems like my pores are getting bigger and I think this works well. I also think their Biore face wash is effective.</li>
            <li> I usually use these after a warm shower or steaming my face, so I can be sure my pores are nice and open. However I&#x27;ve never had any results like they show in the advertisements/other reviewer&#x27;s photos! I follow all the directions so I don&#x27;t understand why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done, my blackheads are slightly less prominent, but I only have a few of those gross yellowy dots on the strip. Hm. I would probably only repurchase if it was on sale or I wasn&#x27;t paying so much.</li>
            <li> I love Biore strips! My nose tends to get very oily, and a few years ago I noticed that I had tons of dark blackheads in my pores. I started using Biore strips once a week to clear the blackheads out of my pores. These strips pull those babies right out - but be warned, it might take a few weeks to get the most stubborn ones out of their homes. Over time, I stopped getting blackheads but still use these strips to clear the whiteheads out of my nose. This is one of my must-have products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these biore strips. I only have to use one every two weeks because it cleans the pores so well!</li>
            <li> nose strips, work, great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years now and I&#x27;ve grown to love them.&lt;br /&gt;So when I found the sale, I jumped right on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 3 strips every month during summer, and during winter my skin seems to be a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;The reason and how I use my 3 strips.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is not a perfect item. (doesn&#x27;t mean it deserves a less of a star though)&lt;br /&gt;I use 1 1/2 strip every 2 weeks during summer.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 1/2 is that the tip of your nose towards the bottom is not covered at all.&lt;br /&gt;I cut one of them in half (quarter did not work for me) and stick it on the from the bottom up and it takes care of the part I need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job for me and I will continue to use these until they fail me.</li>
            <li> Love the product, works well, but when my package came the box was damaged.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought these. They mostly work well, but in both cases I&#x27;ve had a few strips that, when I pull them off after 10 minutes, some of the &#x27;glue&#x27;or whatever the sticky stuff is that is supposed to pull the gunk out, disconnects from the strip and stays on my nose, meaning that all the gunk stays too, and I have to scrub to get the &#x27;glue&#x27;off. Overall though, they do work, when not getting stuck.</li>
            <li> I thought that the pictures I had seen of other people&#x27;s strips were just marketing schlock, but I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions zealously, and waited a full 20 minutes before taking the strip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really have to clean your nose, like, put soap on it and lather, beforehand, for it to work, but boy, does it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the little spikes of brown, oxidized gunk it wicked away were as thin as half a millimeter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose feels renewed, and I have to wonder what effect this would have on other parts of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the lower part of the strip picked up gunk, but I look forward to my second application.</li>
            <li> I love seeing all the junk that these things pull out of my pores.  It&#x27;s amazing and effective.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work on me</li>
            <li> Great product,&lt;br /&gt;My 2 brothers, my husband and myself:&lt;br /&gt;3 men that don&#x27;t do facials or anything are using this every 2 weeks and the results are very good and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Is good for the nose area but also chin and forehead (boy discover that)&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliate, clean and use the product once a month can&#x27;t ask for better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say average reduction of black heads between us 4 &#x3D; 80%</li>
            <li> THESE ARE WONDERFUL. I USE THEM ON MY ENTIRE FACE. KEEP HOPING AS YEARS GO BY THEY WILL MAKE A WHOLE MASK. IT REALLY WITHOUT EFFORT REMOVES &amp;#34;EVERYTHING&amp;#34; ON YOUR FACE THAT SHOULDNT BE IN/OR ON YOUR FACE. ESPECIALLY DREDDED BLACKHEAD AND WHITEHEADS, ALSO SMALL FACIAL HAIR YOU CANT SEE. A GREAT PRODUCT. A TRUE MIRACLE. FOLLOW DIRECTIONS AND DONT REMOVE UNTIL REALLY DRY.</li>
            <li> These make my nose feel cleaner for a couple weeks and then I use another one.</li>
            <li> I like it very much,because it is very suited for me.I think,next time.I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these strips on and off for the past few years and have been immensely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the product is simple to use and painless.  Simply wet your nose, apply the strip, wait 15 min then remove.  If you remove before the strip has hardened too much, removal should be painless.  (Hardening to the point of painful removal usually happens if you wait longer than 15 min.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time and have only once accidentally left it on too long so that removing was painful.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the results.  This removes a lot of dirt from your pores upon your first use.  If you use it regularly after that (such as weekly), you&#x27;ll see a decrease in the amount of dirt in your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not often that I stick with a beauty product (lotion, shampoo, hair conditioner, etc.) for years at a time, but this is the one product that I always turn back to for deep cleaning my pores.  I&#x27;ve found nothing better.  Definitely recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S. Light*</li>
            <li> I guess t works for some people but for me and my husband it did not. Good thing I bought it on amazon and only paid a few bugs and not $20 like at the stores in NYC. I filled the directions very closely and it failed to work.</li>
            <li> i have always liked these strips. they get anything thats left after cleansing my face. wonderful idea. love the face wash too!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective, just need water and maybe some soap to wash your face afterwards. Not smelly or messy.</li>
            <li> I used a Biore Deep Cleaning Pore Strip as a lark. Given my fastidious cleansing regime, I knew there was little chance of it removing any dirt from my nose. Wrong! I pulled the strip off and (ewwww!) it was striped with little spikes of dirt. Enough said. Add Biore Strips to your cleansing regime too if you want to be sure you&#x27;re getting EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, works for some blackheads I never even knew I had but at the same time, does not remove the blackheads I intentionally used it for! So they definitely work, but probably not very well, at least for my nose :( wish it worked better.</li>
            <li> The pores on my nose don&#x27;t get that clogged, but I still use these once a week because it is the only way my boyfriend will do them with me. the pores on his nose are large and clogged, and these clean them out real nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, there is usually only one of two little blackheads pulled out, but my boyfriend&#x27;s strips come out delightfully disgusting and I have found that his nose pores are looking better and less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post pictures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use, the activated glue does leave a nose slightly red and dry, so it is a good idea to clean and moisturize after every use.</li>
            <li> Biore cleansing strips are a great way to remove dirt and oil from the surface of your nose that can cause blackheads. Just peel, moisten, apply to nose... wait a bit, then remove. Post examination of grime removed is oddly satisfying. The only drawback is the price.</li>
            <li> No one wants clogged pores or visible blackheads on their nose. That&#x27;s why the Biore pore strips are so handy. Just wash your face and wet and apply the strip, after it dries, peel it off, and behold what was clogging your pores. These really work and are easy to use. The only way they wouldn&#x27;t be effective is if they are applied wrong or not allowed to dry, unless your skin is so perfect that your pores are clog free.</li>
            <li> I bought these just for shagrins and they have not disappointed! They can get a little tough to remove if you leave them on too long. My skin is always a little sensitive after using them.</li>
            <li> I read and followed the directions exactly as written on the box.  I even let my teenager try one on his nose.  After the strips had been on our noses for about 15 minutes and started feeling really dry, we each pulled them off.  He was impressed.  Me, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.  It didn&#x27;t feel as though it cleaned my pores; in fact, I needed to scrub off some gunk that the strip left on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son didn&#x27;t have gunk.  Maybe because he has younger skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the strips again and got the same results; it doesn&#x27;t feel as though my pores are being cleaned and I still get residual gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, well.  At least one of us liked them!</li>
            <li> it works pretty well, i love it, it is easy to work out and just like it very much ....</li>
            <li> We had bought a similar type product a few years ago and had amazing results, however, I couldn&#x27;t remember what brand it was so I bought these instead. We were totally disappointed. It pulled stuff out from maybe 10 pores onto the strip. We felt as though this product was poor quality. If I had bought it at a store I probably would have returned it, but since it&#x27;s online I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of shipping it back. Waste of money. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I didnt find this product to work very well for me. If you wash your face regularly with something that can scrub and not just hands, this won&#x27;t do much for you. It wont pick up the smaller black heads either. All I can say is wash your face regularly if your worried about black heads and you can save your $15 on this.</li>
            <li> I can see the dirty stuff get out from my pore. Good!</li>
            <li> seriously I never expected this works such a way, it was wonderfull works as expected, worthy Buying for a gal to keep her beauty !!!!! Love this product I will buy it in future too</li>
            <li> Its garbage... Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bior&amp;eacute; pore strips for a while, but this box didn&#x27;t work at all. After I apply the strips to my face and wait the recommended time, I can&#x27;t release them since the &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; is just a yucky mess and it&#x27;s stuck to my face. The strips break after I gently pull them and I have to end up rinsing my face with water to remove all the glue stuck to my face. I don&#x27;t know what happened this time, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was a little disappointed by this product. After reading the description and reviews I was thrilled and looked forward to a miracle. But of course we all know that perfect skin can&#x27;t be obtained overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild acne and scarring, but what really bothers me are the blackheads on my nose. I have really pale skin so any blemishes show up easily. I have tried scrubs and masks before but none helped. Some of my blackheads are very deep and i can feel bumps when I touch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nose strips are very simple. You peel the plastic backing off of the strips and apply it to wet skin. The water on your skin will liquify the gluelike substance on the strips. After the strips dry on you nose you peel it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it did pull out some oil and dirt in my blackheads, it wasn&#x27;t much. And I feel as though the strips only pull out the surface layer of blackheads. So this will not work for deep pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> I thought if I start using all these girly products that I would magically just get prettier, and it&#x27;s been like 4 months and I&#x27;m still the same. What gives? Sure my nose has less noticable pores now, but I ain&#x27;t got noboday loving on me cuz of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well nad make me feel pretty even if I still look (relatively) the same</li>
            <li> i LOVE THESE STRIPS! i HAVE BEEN A FAN OF THEM FOR YEARS AND THEY REALLY WORK. i THINK I WILL NEVER COMPLETELY ELIMINATED THE BLACKHEADS FROM MY NOSE, BUT THIS DEF DOES MAKE IT LOOK LESS GROSS WHEN USED ON A REGULAR BASIS, SAY TWICE A WEEK AND SOME CHEAP FREEDMAN CLAY MASK. oNE THING i HAVE NOTICED!! i BOUGHT THE olay PRO x sCRUB BRUSH (SIMILAR TO CLARISONIC) BUT ONLY 30 BUCKS i NOTICED IF i USED THE pro x AND THEN DO A REALLY GOOD SCRUB WITH THAT THEN PUT A STRIP ON IMMEDIATELY AFTER i PULL OUT SOME PRETTY GROSS YET SATISFYING DIRT OUT OF MY PORES! iT REALLY DOES FEEL GOOD WHEN YOUR STRIP LOOKS NASTY! YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT YOUR MONEYS WORTH. I DONT HAVE ALOT OF MONEY TO SPEND ON SKIN CARE SO i LIKE SIMPLE PRODUCTS AND THIS WORKS.</li>
            <li> I have not used it, but it looks good.</li>
            <li> I was told by a woman who waxed my eyebrows that I had a lot of blackheads - I had never really noticed, but it started to bother me, so I tried these strips. I was amazed by how much crap they pulled off my face! It was disgusting and fascinating at the same time. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it only covers your nose - I think I have blackheads on my cheeks too, and it would be nice if they would make strips for that too.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about purchasing this product after reading some of the reviews. I&#x27;ve used this product for years but was wondering if the ones specifically sold on here were defective or whatnot. I can say for anyone who is wondering the same thing, you need not worry! These work the exact same as the ones I&#x27;ve always bought at the local store. If you use them correctly, they work great! And they are fun to look at afterwards. :) Great product! Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep buying these, its some sort of sick need to see all the junk that accumulates in my pores.  These strips are supposedly really bad for your face, and yet, I buy them.  I find they work fairly well WHEN they work.  According to the directions, you wet the area of your face you&#x27;d like to clean, and stick this on for about 10 minutes until the strip gets hard (like paper mache).  Sometimes, the sticky goop that comes on the back of the strips stays stuck to my face.  Therefore, the strip doesn&#x27;t remove any of the dirt stuck in my pores, and I have glue and gunk stuck on my face.  My skin gets really irritated and red after having to scrub the glue off.  But when they do work, they make for a fun girls night.  These strips + nail polish + funny movie &#x3D; lots of laughter.</li>
            <li> They do everything the package says they do - I just wish they would expand the line to include all-over face strips. My nose isn&#x27;t the only place that needs refining!</li>
            <li> this product have done in one that what all the creams and mask havent done in years...in one shot it took out all the blackheads of my nose and the side also. If you use it several times per week and after use &amp;#34;NATURAL JOJOBA OIL&amp;#34;...you will see long time result.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Be sure to wash you face with a exfoliator BEFORE you use this Strips...get one just as &amp;#34;Garnier Exfoliator with micro beads &amp; Jojoba&amp;#34;. cuz the mayority of the Exfoliators can do small cuts as particles on your face just as the “St Eve Apricot exfoliator”.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I bought these strips based on the great reviews, expecting it to remove a bunch of the white head and black head build up on my nose that I just can&#x27;t seem to wash away. It had gotten to the point where I was starting to scrape at it with my finger nail, so bought these. I applied one, and it removed some build up. I applied another it removed a bit more. I applied a third time, and nothing. Most of it was still there and it failed to remove even the majority of it. Highly disappointed to say the least. I do not recommend this product. It is a very weak white head cleanser and does not work as advertised. I will have to look into another option.</li>
            <li> I really love this product because it helps remove blackheads white head or what ever dirt is hiding in your pores. Your nose ends up looking cleaner smoother.</li>
            <li> These are always a go to product in skin care for quick and immediate results.</li>
            <li> I have used Biore strips since I was in high school. They&#x27;re expensive, but I get good results with them. I think the key to removing the most blackheads is to pull it off extremely slowly.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I use one weekly</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t work *that* well but I knew that going into it. I have so many pin prick sized black heads on my nose and can sometimes squeeze them out, but to be able to get more out a time was my goal. It got maybe 10 out of probably hundreds, which is honestly not bad. Next time I&#x27;m gonna do it right after a shower when my pores have been steamed open more. I&#x27;d rather have 90 blackheads than 100.</li>
            <li> Cleans out your nose!</li>
            <li> I love Biore pore strips! I&#x27;ve been using them since I was a teenager and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buy at the store.  Works exactly the same.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Bior&amp;eacute; Deep-Cleansing Pore Strips are a must for me. Whenever the blackheads on my nose and chin get noticeable, one of these babies will pluck them right off! It is kind of disgusting to see the little blackheads on the sticky sheet, but it&#x27;s so fulfilling to know that gunk is off your face ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them once or twice a month, because using them too often can be irritating. It isn&#x27;t necessarily healthy to be ripping the natural oils and skin cells; in fact, it may, in the long run, cause pores to become clogged (because once they are \\&quot;unclogged,\\&quot; they can be filled right back up with dirt or makeup) or cause permanent pores--huge holes in your face that never disappear! I already have one on the side of my nose that won&#x27;t fill up naturally; I always have to fill it in with concealer. It&#x27;s not noticeable, but up-close, it certainly is. It&#x27;s about the size of a nose piercing hole, but obviously doesn&#x27;t go through my entire nose cartilage. (I&#x27;m actually considering getting a nose piercing right on that spot...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find Bior&amp;eacute; pore strips at pretty much any drugstore and online. I believe a box of 14 strips retails for about $8; Amazon usually has them for cheaper!</li>
            <li> Put one of these on your nose and look at the strip when you pull it off. A ton of blackheads and whiteheads show up when you look at that strip, and that&#x27;s when you know that this has done its&#x27; job. It hurts a bit when you&#x27;re taking it off but, it&#x27;s well worth the result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pore cleaning freak. I love biore strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 and these strips have been around for some time now. Over the years, I have tried these strips and was left disappointed. I&#x27;d stop then years later try again, hoping the product had been improved. Each time, I came away with the same result, disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty oily skin and get acne in my nose and it enlarges my pores. I got these strips again a few weeks ago, again, hoping they&#x27;d improved. But they didn&#x27;t. These strips cost $8 for 14 strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  used an entire box and each time I used one of the strips, it didn&#x27;t work. The instructions say leave on your nose for about 15 minutes, which I do. When I remove them, the strip is clean and fails to serve its purpose. I think its safe to say, I&#x27;d never buy or use these strips ever again. Sorry Biore&#x27;, for me, these strips were a flop.</li>
            <li> These strips are okay, They do work and get our black heads but just not all of them. Ive tried it a few times and it still won&#x27;t get everything out. Its says on the box only to use on your nose but I tried it on my forehead anyways and it worked fine. Just like my nose though it didn&#x27;t get everything out.</li>
            <li> Biore strips work well if your nose pores are really clogged. Like if you haven&#x27;t used strips or mask or exfoliant in a long time. You can actually see the dirt and gunk from inside your pores get stuck on the strip when you remove it. It&#x27;s kind of gross but also satisfying to know that all of that is not in your pores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I feel like they aren&#x27;t as satisfying if you use them regularly, or if you regularly use another pore-cleansing product (like a clay mask). If your pores aren&#x27;t really clogged up, the strips don&#x27;t do very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also leave my nose a tad sensitive, and leave a residue on my nose that I have to wash off afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying once... but I don&#x27;t use them as part of my regular routine.</li>
            <li> These will not stick long enough to pull out anything even when I apply them to a very dry face. They certainly do not \\&quot;lock on and pull out dirt\\&quot;.  I was hoping to pull out a blackhead but so far I have tried 3 of them and they just become loose or fall off long before the 10 or 15 minutes recommended to leave them on.  Maybe the batch I got isn&#x27;t sticky enough?  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awful and does not work! Falls off the nose and does not stick well. Does not remove any blackheads!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect when buying this, but figured it was worth a shot. These work really good. Clears out my dirty pores. Only drawback, sometimes my nose gets irratated for a hour afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time - usually twice a week - which is why I&#x27;m on the subscribe and save 14 count box.  They work, what can I say?  I use them on my nose, forehead, chin ; even my cheeks sometimes.  Seeing the stuff on the strip is my guilty pleasure!</li>
            <li> These things do not work. I did all the steps and made sure my face was clean and makeup free. I got my nose wet, but they still didn&#x27;t stick or pick anything up.. they are too pricey! it&#x27;s more expensive than buying a face scrub that actually works. don&#x27;t waste your money or time...</li>
            <li> Takes away ALL my black heads! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> bought this for my teen and it has done wonders for cleaning up for her face, we are both happy with this product</li>
            <li> I know these are &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; and all but they aren&#x27;t any better than the ones I get from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> First product that I tried. No complains. Pretty long term results. Use it once a month. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  It is morbidly entertaining to see the results, and it can be very surprising.</li>
            <li> Terrific, love the charcoal ones now that those are out!!!!</li>
            <li> They work most of the time.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions as stated on the packaging, you will be very pleased with this product. The instructions are very simple and it only takes a few minutes to rid your nose of hard to remove dirt which embeds in pores and gives a really nice clean feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can actually see the results on the strip if you look at it from the side against a dark background, you will see everything the strip has removed from your face. Great results, I highly recommend these, and I will continue to buy them myself.</li>
            <li> I used it on my nose about 5 times, and each time it does withdraw blackheads but not at the rate or percentage i would love it too. It does leave a few be hind, but over all it works.</li>
            <li> I used a nose strip for the first time today, and I have to say that they work pretty well. I took a shower first to open my pores, and then i left the strip on for about 30 minutes. The strips didn&#x27;t get all of my black heads out, but there was a lot on the strip, so hopefully the rest will come out with continuous use.</li>
            <li> The Biore Strips definately pull out blackheads from my nose. However, I have noticed that when I got to use the strips a few days later, my pore are even more clogged. It seems like a short term solution, not something that will work long term(at least for me).</li>
            <li> I have tried these a few times thus far - and while (in my few experiences) they do work to some extent, they did not remove everything.  I looked at the strip and while there was some stuff there, looking at my nose, it only seemed to remove about 50% of the stuff, which I had to manually remove by the age-old pressing and squeezing a certain way.  My experiences did NOT echo the other reviews here that 100% of the stuff was removed and the exfoliation process of the nose was 100%.  Far from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try these a few more times to see how they work in future tries.  Thus far though, they have only been &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  And yes, I put them on properly, but as stated I will try a few more times.  They just only seemed to remove maybe 40-50% of the stuff..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will amend my review if things improve. I still recommend trying them at least, a box of 14 isn&#x27;t overly expensive (about $8 at Wal-mart), so it won&#x27;t be a huge loss of money if they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Thanks for send the product, excellent.</li>
            <li> These strip work awesome. After time the pores do appear smaller</li>
            <li> I have tried these multiple times over the years, hoping for better results each time. They do remove a little bit of gunk from my pores, but not as much as I had hoped. The reason I am giving this product one star is because the strips actually cause me to break out more after using them. I get large, painful breakouts on the area I used them. Maybe they are just not compatible with my skin type; I don&#x27;t know.  But I followed the directions and everything, and am frustrated to have broken out even worse after using this product. It&#x27;s as if they actually clogged my pores rather than unclogged them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great I&#x27;ve had these before and I knew they were amazing</li>
            <li> The overall reviews on the Biore Pore Strips are very good but they didn&#x27;t work for us. I think I received an old package from an Amazon seller because the strips we received were completely dry and I would think they should be wet or at least moist. We wet them with water and tried them again but they didn&#x27;t work that way either.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it was this easy! I wish I tried this year&#x27;s ago. great product A+ the only thing is my nose still burns a bit. I didn&#x27;t even wash my face just put water on it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a product for the black heads on my nose. I use to just try to pop them but it never worked. When I took off the first strip I was amazed with how much gunk came off with it. These strips are fantastic and I would absolutely recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is my first try, but I need a routine that includes these strips. I like it so far. I probably will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I used these pore strips many years ago as a teenager when they first started being sold. They worked well back then but I never saw the amount of blackheads being removed as others said they did. I decided to try them again as an adult and I think think this product is actually stronger than it used to be. As an adult I don&#x27;t have as many blackheads as I used to, but this strip seems to remove them all. I can see them on the strip after I remove it. This product is designed to be used on your nose, but I&#x27;ve had luck cutting it in half to use on my cheeks or using the entire strip on my forehead. I can definitely tell a difference in my skin after using these strips. My skin appears cleaner but the strips irritate my skin and cause it to turn red. Make sure you don&#x27;t use these right before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints with this product:&lt;br /&gt;- It is very painful to remove the strips! I wait until they are thoroughly dry and peel them off, and it brings tears to my eyes trying to get them off. The package says you can wet the strips to remove them but I thought that might reduce the number of blackheads that will be removed so I have not tried it.&lt;br /&gt;- It takes a while for the strip to dry on your skin - about 15 minutes. In the meantime you&#x27;ll look like a crazy person with a a bandaid on your nose.</li>
            <li> I love these strips they are easy to use and really work. You can actually see them working after first use.</li>
            <li> I got these hoping it would clear my pores a bit or just help reduce any breakouts or oil buildup.  But obviously these are more hype than anything.  By the time you wash, scrub, and dry your face the issue is already fixed and these strips do nothing more than dry  your nose out and make it sticky.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good, the cost is better than drugstore pricing. i would purchase this item again because it is convenient when shipped to your home. You can also subscribe to receive this too.</li>
            <li> Great value. Works best if use after shower.</li>
            <li> I use these on my husband. You can really see the dirt that accumulates and shows up on the used strip - does a great job and makes his nose look great.</li>
            <li> I noticed I was having some blackheads on my nose, so I bought these hoping to clear it up. I used them and and wow talk about gunk. It was pretty gross seeing all that on the strip after, but a bit of relief knowing it was out of my skin. Not sure about the long term use or if these help reduce your blackheads for recurring, but so far I have gotten a ton of&lt;br /&gt;Gunk out every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Elmer&#x27;s glue instead of Biore strips for awhile now, and still actually prefer glue to these strips. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the strips work. But Elmer&#x27;s works just as well and is much cheaper over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One advantage of the strips, though, is that they dry faster :) I seem to have a heavy hand with the glue.</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t turn your skin into porcelain perfection. But they WILL get out studdborn blackheads better than squeezing. I used to do a routine of steaming my face and then scrubbing and masking, which did work but I hardly have time for that any more. With these strips you can use them right after a shower, and the results last about a week, which is okay because they&#x27;re supposed to be used weekly. They do not hurt coming off; pull slowly. Not like wax for hair, which you need to yank off. I use mind only on the end of my nose and not up near delicate eye skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: They do work, make sure not to pull quickly and use after a shower.</li>
            <li> The strips do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to, without any issues. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them for anyone looking for clear pores.</li>
            <li> I used this on my nose for the past few weeks. It gets rid of blackheads, but it takes awhile. Thought it would be faster. Not a big deal, but not one of those &amp;#34;Aw YEAH! moments.&amp;#34; More like, &amp;#34;Aw, ok.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These work great for my husband, who has GIANT blackheads. I have small blackheads (but a lot of them), and only a few get pulled up by the strip.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband I have to say I use them too...they work GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude,  have pretty big pores on my nose I suppose.  I used this thing just for the hell of it, was insanely impressed.  When I pealed it off (effortless and painlessly)  it looked like hundreds of spikes on the other side, was crazy.  I really wanted to do it again right away, but the packaging says only once every three days &#x3D; (  .  Anyhow I recommend this.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I have ever used a nose strip. It hurts, and my nose is red even after a day.</li>
            <li> Work just as described!</li>
