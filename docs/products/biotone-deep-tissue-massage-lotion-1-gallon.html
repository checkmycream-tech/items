    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>arrived quickly, very happy with product</li>
            <li>hands-down, one of the best products in the massage market.  </li>
            <li>The best massage lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>glides wonderfully, very pleasant to use and NO PARABENS!</li>
            <li>Excellent just what a therapist needs</li>
            <li>and works great for all my clients.</li>
            <li>but this cream is great for swedish massage.</li>
            <li>Its great for every massage therapist</li>
            <li>I love Biotone products but was especially impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>smell is pleasant and clients like it</li>
            <li>Extremely good product for massage.</li>
            <li>The feel of the lotion wasn&#x27;t as nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can continue working as a LMP, without inflammation/irritation of my own skin. :)</li>
            <li>Best lotion to use doing deep tissue</li>
            <li>Tissue Massage Lotions gives me the perfect control for my deep tissue work.</li>
            <li>Biotone is the top of the line in massage lotions.</li>
            <li>Advance Therapy is the better product.</li>
            <li>I love the Biotone products  </li>
            <li>I do sports massage mostly</li>
            <li>Too many masseurs insist on putting on tons of lotion where you need just a light coating (unless the client is hairy) and warming it extends out the use of the massage lotion.</li>
            <li>I have worked as a massage therapist for 18 years now and over the years my skin has become more and more sensitive to any kind of lotions and/or soaps/</li>
            <li>that way)&lt;br /&gt;Also: My clients love it, because it is absorbs quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good low slip massage lotion</li>
            <li>This lotion has a nice feel, light and non-greasy with a little bit of grip.</li>
            <li>I tried this lotion professionally and it is very good for deep tissue but the only problem is it smells funny.</li>
            <li>have worked with many different products...........</li>
            <li>VERY watery!</li>
            <li>this is the only massage lotion i will ever use and this seller makes it easy to keep it on my shelf.</li>
            <li>But it gets absorbed so quickly that I doubt a gallon will last me the month!</li>
            <li>Even Biotone creates so many different products that it took a while to find the one that does not harm my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Wether the client wants a light massage or a deep, trigger point massage, I use this on all my clients.</li>
            <li>otherwise very watery).</li>
            <li>A little more grab.</li>
            <li>all natural, many different companies and often Biotone, with very different skin reactions to my hands.</li>
            <li>It is thin enough to assist in a great massage.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Allows hands to glide on body, does not bother those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I definitely went through a lot more of last order twice as fast as I usually do.  </li>
            <li>Considering one gallon is 1/2 the cost of an average one hour massage, the investment is slight and tax deductible if you are a professional doing massage full time (or even part time as long as you are claiming it on your taxes).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best lotion to use doing deep tissue</li>
            <li> I tried to write a review but due to some inane ignorant parameter A rejected it so this is all they get from me. They wasted my time.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice feel, light and non-greasy with a little bit of grip. But it gets absorbed so quickly that I doubt a gallon will last me the month!</li>
            <li> This is the only product on the market, that does not cause an allergic reactions to my skin. I have worked as a massage therapist for 18 years now and over the years my skin has become more and more sensitive to any kind of lotions and/or soaps/detergents.&lt;br /&gt;I have worked with many different products...........all natural, many different companies and often Biotone, with very different skin reactions to my hands. Even Biotone creates so many different products that it took a while to find the one that does not harm my very sensitive skin. Deep Tissues is the ONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep Tissue Massage Lotions gives me the perfect control for my deep tissue work. ( 85% of my clients like it that way)&lt;br /&gt;Also: My clients love it, because it is absorbs quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can continue working as a LMP, without inflammation/irritation of my own skin. :)</li>
            <li> Do not like this product at all.  To watery and need to keep applying</li>
            <li> I find this not too thick and not too thin (as long as you don&#x27;t heat it more than 30 seconds...otherwise very watery). and works great for all my clients. I average about 30-40 clients a month and a bottle lasts close to that long. Too many masseurs insist on putting on tons of lotion where you need just a light coating (unless the client is hairy) and warming it extends out the use of the massage lotion. Wether the client wants a light massage or a deep, trigger point massage, I use this on all my clients. Biotone is the top of the line in massage lotions. Considering one gallon is 1/2 the cost of an average one hour massage, the investment is slight and tax deductible if you are a professional doing massage full time (or even part time as long as you are claiming it on your taxes). So don&#x27;t let the other two so/so reviews discourage you.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times, it works well for me; it&#x27;s non-greasy, but with enough glide for deep tissue work and without leaving the client feeling drenched with oil.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion for my massage business.  It is thin enough to assist in a great massage.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant and clients like it</li>
            <li> Extremely good product for massage. Allows hands to glide on body, does not bother those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> VERY watery! I&#x27;ve been a therapist since 2002 and I will never purchase this again. Advance Therapy is the better product.</li>
            <li> Good low slip massage lotion</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, very happy with product</li>
            <li> I love the Biotone products  especially the advance therapy lotion its not to thick or to running just the right consistency for any type of massage.</li>
            <li> hands-down, one of the best products in the massage market.  i &amp;#60;3 it and so do my clients.  this is the only massage lotion i will ever use and this seller makes it easy to keep it on my shelf.</li>
            <li> The best massage lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> glides wonderfully, very pleasant to use and NO PARABENS! YAYA! I love Biotone products but was especially impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent just what a therapist needs</li>
            <li> I like this cream though I have to say I am partial to Biotone all purpose cream only because that is what I am used to. A little more grab. I do sports massage mostly but this cream is great for swedish massage.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 10 years, but it seems the last couple gallons I ordered seemed inferior.  The feel of the lotion wasn&#x27;t as nice and I definitely went through a lot more of last order twice as fast as I usually do.  I am now using an  different product from a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for almost ten years and dont plan on changing.  Its great for every massage therapist</li>
            <li> lotion  little thick then water,  very  fast dry out,  i have no idea, what i am going to do with it, return ? cost time and money, keep ? difficult use it.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion professionally and it is very good for deep tissue but the only problem is it smells funny.</li>
