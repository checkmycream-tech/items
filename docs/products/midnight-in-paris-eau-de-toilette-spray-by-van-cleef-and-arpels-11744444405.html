            <li>It would be good if Amazon can refund the price difference.</li>
            <li>I thought it was good one for a man thats trying to show a softer side too himself by wearing this.</li>
            <li>The MOST beautiful presentation in my collection.</li>
            <li>I was so excited on ordering this perfume and was also happy that fulfillment was by Amazon itself.</li>
            <li>Look to me femal perfume very light</li>

            <li>MiP EDP is one of my favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic value for an extraordinary fragrance!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a huge fan of Dior Homme and Dior Homme</li>
            <li>My friend uses the same perfume and it is one of the best, but the one I got from Amazon is like some scented water and very dilute.</li>
            <li>Amazing fragrance by a high end designer.  </li>
            <li>&quot; We&#x27;ll, this is quite a different breed, and I recommend it for any male (some females smell great in it too!)</li>

            <li>Intense and MiP shares some similarities with them</li>
            <li>Mad , but just figured the EDP would smell more powerful then the EDT which is more proper for a man too wear  a light soft feminism fragrance as this .</li>
            <li>I usually only purchase EDP for men as most EDT last maybe an hour on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a Highly recommended fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase, and I am tempted to try the other Van Cleef and Arpels cologne available on Amazon for $27.83&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I ordered eau de parfum and I received eau de toilet...</li>
            <li> You may be briefly embarrassed to say the name when others ask what you&#x27;re wearing, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> It is slightly feminine for a mens fragrance</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please don&#x27;t buy this perfume from Amazon as I doubt it&#x27;s not genuine.</li>
            <li> The people who like heavy cologne don,t buy it</li>
            <li> This is my first bad experience with Amazon</li>
            <li> Because its perfume expect slow shipping.</li>
            <li> Also they sad that there is no more EDP to change it...</li>
            <li> This has to be a fake.</li>
            <li> For instance, the EDT isn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li> However when i got it and used it I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have never had any problems with any of my amazon purchases, but I am totally disappointed with this purchase.</li>

            <li> I ordered eau de parfum and I received eau de toilet...after 5 days I noticed that.. I send an email to the Seller and they apologized and refunded the money..Also they sad that there is no more EDP to change it...I must appreciate their effort..For instance, the EDT isn&#x27;t bad...it smells pretty nice and even isn&#x27;t for a time long..is just a EDT..but it is my favorite now..</li>
            <li> I was so excited on ordering this perfume and was also happy that fulfillment was by Amazon itself. However when i got it and used it I was disappointed. This has to be a fake. I can barely smell it even when my wrist is touching my nose soon after applying it and it&#x27;s supposed to be EDP. I have gone through the reviews on various websites and they are contradictory to my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I totally didn&#x27;t expect this from a retailer like Amazon. This is my first bad experience with Amazon and I don&#x27;t know what to do about it.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t buy this perfume from Amazon as I doubt it&#x27;s not genuine.</li>
            <li> Look to me femal perfume very light I don,t like it  . The people who like heavy cologne don,t buy it</li>
            <li> This fragrance is just all around beautiful. FYI Van Cleef and Arpels is jewelry designer house and this shows in the packaging of this cologne. From the box to the bottle to the scent it is just beautiful. It is slightly feminine for a mens fragrance but it does smell good. There this is best for dates and night outs. This is a Highly recommended fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have never had any problems with any of my amazon purchases, but I am totally disappointed with this purchase. This perfume doesn&#x27;t possess any characteristics of a scent. My friend uses the same perfume and it is one of the best, but the one I got from Amazon is like some scented water and very dilute.</li>
            <li> MiP EDP is one of my favorite colognes.  It brings to mind tea, vanilla, tonka, and powder.  I&#x27;m also a huge fan of Dior Homme and Dior Homme Intense and MiP shares some similarities with them (same designer - Dior Homme).  MiP will always be in my rotation.</li>
            <li> have received many positive compliments in the office from this scent, I like it and apparently others in my office also like it</li>
            <li> This thing smells quite simply amazing! It&#x27;s unisex so if you&#x27;re a girl you should check it out as well!</li>
            <li> Fantastic value for an extraordinary fragrance! I wear this all year, in all seasons it&#x27;s perfect for any occasion.</li>
            <li> This is a great, slightly leathery men&#x27;s fragrance which is puzzlingly underpriced relative to its quality. My guess would be that people associate the name with their grandmother&#x27;s \\&quot;Evening in Paris.\\&quot; We&#x27;ll, this is quite a different breed, and I recommend it for any male (some females smell great in it too!) You may be briefly embarrassed to say the name when others ask what you&#x27;re wearing, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> This can not be beat for $35! Because its perfume expect slow shipping. The product arrived just as listed (EdP) and is of great quality. The MOST beautiful presentation in my collection.</li>
            <li> I did not receive Eu de Parfum as stated in the product description. Others have had this problem too. It would be good if Amazon can refund the price difference.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but my friends co.workers compliment @ how I smell all the time, worth the money try it out.</li>
            <li> This was a steal!  Amazing fragrance by a high end designer.  A must have.</li>
            <li> I usually only purchase EDP for men as most EDT last maybe an hour on my skin. I have gotten several compliments on this. The packaging is awesome very reputable product and seller. Thank you</li>
            <li> great parfum. will surley have another buy after am done with this bottle.</li>
            <li> I thought it was good one for a man thats trying to show a softer side too himself by wearing this.I ordered the EDP version but they sent me the EDT version instead.Mad , but just figured the EDP would smell more powerful then the EDT which is more proper for a man too wear  a light soft feminism fragrance as this .</li>
            <li> I already used this cologne before, and got very positive feedback from my friends whenever I would wear it. This is my second purchase, and I am tempted to try the other Van Cleef and Arpels cologne available on Amazon for $27.83&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
