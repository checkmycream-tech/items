            <li>and they explained it perfectly.  </li>
            <li>He is, in my opinion, a very good snake oil charmer.   </li>
            <li>To good health, and not getting ripped off!</li>
            <li>Good luck and great health to all!!</li>
            <li>LOL).  </li>
            <li>Four of us on Princess lines bought into a great presentation by cruise line.  </li>
            <li>This is a great site.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is a miracle on its own, but it helped me shed the water from my hips!</li>
            <li>Revived in good ride and no issued</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I will start by saying I am a HUGE SKEPTIC!!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>that helps anyone wanting an unbiased and honest review of this product.</li>
            <li>the more I wish I would never have tried them......  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone until they researched it more.</li>
            <li>Yes the people who love this program and works for them.</li>
            <li>Because they are exercising, eating healthy.</li>
            <li>I do not have any more energy nor have I lost any weight like the product claims.  </li>
            <li>Depending on your age that is how many years of JUNK you have in your system.</li>
            <li>Seems a tad backwards to me in my opinion :-)</li>
            <li>I am so glad I returned the product while still on the ship.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I returned it all of it...</li>
            <li>mom has kept her weight off after doing this program more than 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I never did the program after many, many months and sold the bottles I had on eBay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not working out any more than I did when I was in college.</li>
            <li>I really love theElemis product, it works just like it said.  </li>
            <li>the intensity would diminish over 10 seconds or so to the point where she was just touching me without moving for about 3 seconds</li>
            <li>Brought up was movie Food Inc, which we have at home and this made him seem a most reliable sprokesman to us.  </li>
            <li>We are exercising and eating organic healthy foods.  </li>
            <li>When I spoke to the Carnival Rep he told me that it would greatly help with the water retention which was a major issue for me.</li>
            <li>and he said that was fine,</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be just as fine.    </li>
            <li>Eat mostly vegetables, get adequate protein, exercise and lots of water.  </li>
            <li>THAT in itself is a HUGE plus for me.</li>
            <li>My advice:  Save your money, find an exercise you enjoy, and eat a plant based diet.     </li>
            <li>I am using Fitness Pal to track food and exercise for free.  </li>
            <li>Too many people expect to just take a pill and things just MAGICALLY and INSTANTLY get better.</li>
            <li>It is the first time I have ever tried a cleanse product and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>You have to give it a MINIMUM of 3 months of FAITHFULLY taking the pills and at minimum drinking water regularly to truly be able to give an honest review of this product.</li>
            <li>Without much effort, I have lost five pounds and all of my clothes fit better than they have in years.</li>
            <li>The only way to effectively lose weight is the 3 part triangle: EXERCISE, NUTRITION, and DETOX.  </li>
            <li>Metamucil works better for a cleanse (same key ingredient) and the amount of nutrients they list are also found in a good multi vitamin.  </li>
            <li>While I am a open minded person I am also honest with myself.</li>
            <li>I just have to laugh now because once you buy it, you&#x27;re out $600.00.      </li>
            <li>You pee them out before they are absorbed</li>
            <li>they know what they are talking about in the selling of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RC Oasis of the Sea cruise was SOOOO much fun.  </li>
            <li>Much of what he said I knew to be true.   </li>
            <li>Generally I eat healthy, so I have not had to adjust my diet drastically.  </li>
            <li>The person on NCL who sold it to me said I would have a deep cleasning of toxins and not to be surprised at how much I \\&quot;detoxed\\&quot; and also how much weight I would lose and how great I would feel.  </li>
            <li>This is DETOX, not simply a diuretic, weight loss product, or a magic pill that will contour your body without doing anything.  </li>
            <li>What did I get the first month?</li>
            <li>My girlfriend also bought this product and she threw up on the first day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s interesting is that earlier in the cruise, they had a seminar on how to do 1000 sit-ups to make your face look thinner.  </li>
            <li>My only excuse is that the fitness instructor selling it had a really good rap -- about  $600 worth.   </li>
            <li>They are still eating pretty much what they want and have been the whole time they were on the program.  </li>
            <li>and I was really athletic then.</li>
            <li>It really was zero value</li>
            <li>The more I found blogs and other sites like this ..</li>
            <li>My mom has never spent one moment in a gym and my sister goes rarely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old and gained about 10 pounds in my first year of college.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been eating slightly healthier, mainly more fruits and vegetables.</li>
            <li>I graduated high school weighing about 140.</li>
            <li>While exercise and eating right is highly recommended, one of the mandatory things is drinking enough water.</li>
            <li>Right now we are trying to get our money back.</li>
            <li>I have just started the product and already I have noticed I go to the the bathroom more often than I usually would.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>I first bought the Elemis Deep Drainage Body Detox as part of a package of 3 Elemis products.  </li>
            <li>I lost 4 the first month, and 2 the second month.</li>
            <li>I have looked up every single ingredients on the internet and while they are all strong herbal ingredients used, the amount they use must be too low to make any difference.  </li>
            <li>You have to drink half your weight in water to CLEAN the junk OUT of your body.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be a MAGIC pill, but for the water weight I thought it would reduce it at least by a pound or two, but not an inch has happened in the month.</li>
            <li>The Fitness Director explained it was a product that would provide a natural cleanse, help with constipation and bloating, appetite suppressant, and increase energy levels.  </li>
            <li>My arms don&#x27;t have much flab on them anymore, and my extra chin went away!</li>
            <li>Just stick with old fashion diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>Ok guys, I have read all the reviews and the bad and good ones are missing the point completely!  </li>
            <li>It is working better than ANYTHING I have tried in the past - especially for regularity.  </li>
            <li>Its been really hard for me to lose weight and this product is what is making it so easy now.</li>
            <li>I am a medical professional</li>
            <li>You will not loose weight from this!</li>
            <li>He told me to watch what I ate the first month, but I would lose a lot of water weight and then go down from there.</li>

            <li> Theres still some fat around my stomach area, but I weigh less than I did in high school</li>
            <li> A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> This product was a complete waste of money, It does nothing to help you loose weight of speed up your system.</li>
            <li> I am fairly active, not exercising regularly but chasing after kids, walking where I need to go and things like that.</li>
            <li> Two months into a 3-month herbal detox which included Elemis Deep Drainage, Cal-Metab Plus, Vitality, and Silhoutte, I started feeling nauseated, headaches, off-balance, dizzy, insomnia, night sweats, fatigue, increased heart palpitations, hot spots on my skin, confused, memory loss, high blood pressure which is not norm for me.</li>
            <li> My response is wow that is a LOT of  unhealthy JUNK we have daily put in our bodies.  </li>
            <li> This is more for those who care about their health and the longevity of their life, cleanse your body from the toxins bad food has placed all your life so that the other diets and exercise will work.  </li>
            <li> With the money being legitimately spent on RC and other cruise lines they should be ASHAMED of doing this to people.  </li>
            <li> I almost bought this aboard a cruise line but had enough common sense not to get the entire line for a year and a half.</li>
            <li> My advice would be to detox in conjunction with the other two, and you WILL get the results you want.  </li>
            <li> I think a lot of the reason some don&#x27;t have results or don&#x27;t &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; they have results is due to the fact they either have no clue how to use the product or have a misconception of what to expect from the product.</li>
            <li> You CAN find it CHEAPER other places if you just HAVE TO try it</li>
            <li> I got up to 150 at college and worked and worked to try to get it down while I was at school and was stuck at 146.</li>
            <li> The other part, he&#x27;s giving seminars on the benefits of acupuncture and trying to convince you to let him stick little needles in you.  </li>
            <li> Why in the WORLD are you getting medical advise from some random person who spends their entire life in the bowels of a ship for months at a time?!?!  </li>
            <li> I am not a huge workout fan, but I do have an active lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> No other diet plans work because they don&#x27;t take care of the root problem, the toxins making you rebound and making your body unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> Stupid me who bought the product on a carnival cruise at the same exact time never bothered to take it.  </li>
            <li> I told him that I didn&#x27;t have the money to waste and needed confirmation that this would work.</li>
            <li> We wasted $616 for 2x3 month supply.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these products promoted on the cruise ships.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste a dime</li>
            <li> However, Silhouette and Vitality were a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Why get afraid when faced with an all natural product to remove that junk?</li>
            <li> There is no magic bullet for health and wellness.   </li>
            <li> I just left my mediocre massage (I think she started to fall asleep during the head, face, and neck massage.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why I gave this even one STAR.  </li>
            <li> While this product my have immediate results for some the main purpose of the product is to help repair your body (liver) from years of pouring bad toxins into it</li>
            <li> I thought at least the \\&quot;cleasning portion\\&quot; would provide a cleansing.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I didn&#x27;t attend any of their other seminars.  </li>
            <li> The hard sell by Princess employee&#x27;s was tough to walk away from.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the bad reviews on this product and had to write a review because for me, the product is definitely working.</li>
            <li> Upon returning home, I have been taking the product for approximately three weeks.  </li>
            <li> How blatantly dishonest is that?!?!  </li>
            <li> I started the 3 month detox and thought I was doing it wrong..</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even try to fake and link they seminar to sit-up technique.  </li>
            <li> Expensive lession for us guilible cruisers.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate when I went on Elemis - the Detox works IF you drink alot with it and do some exercise.</li>
            <li> I JUST HATE WHEN PEOPLE POST UNEDUCATED REVIEWS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product aboard the Carnival Cruise line and it was horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was a complete waste of money, It does nothing to help you loose weight of speed up your system. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> Ok guys, I have read all the reviews and the bad and good ones are missing the point completely!  This is DETOX, not simply a diuretic, weight loss product, or a magic pill that will contour your body without doing anything.  I got it from the Carnival Cruiseline and they explained it perfectly.  The only way to effectively lose weight is the 3 part triangle: EXERCISE, NUTRITION, and DETOX.  Detox alone will not make you lose weight, but it detoxifies your body, removing the toxins from your overloaded liver, bloodstream, and fat cells that PREVENT you from getting the results you want.  My advice would be to detox in conjunction with the other two, and you WILL get the results you want.  No other diet plans work because they don&#x27;t take care of the root problem, the toxins making you rebound and making your body unhealthy.  This is more for those who care about their health and the longevity of their life, cleanse your body from the toxins bad food has placed all your life so that the other diets and exercise will work.  Without detoxing, you wont get the results you want and keep them.  I hope this helps your understanding of what this product is meant to be.  I am a medical professional so the cost was not an issue, and no I don&#x27;t work for the cruiseline or the company, I just know the medical side of dieting and weight loss and know that it wont last without detox.</li>
            <li> I started the 3 month detox and thought I was doing it wrong.. it comes with out any instructions.. I had ZERO results.  I thought at least the \\&quot;cleasning portion\\&quot; would provide a cleansing. The person on NCL who sold it to me said I would have a deep cleasning of toxins and not to be surprised at how much I \\&quot;detoxed\\&quot; and also how much weight I would lose and how great I would feel.  I have looked up every single ingredients on the internet and while they are all strong herbal ingredients used, the amount they use must be too low to make any difference.  The more I found blogs and other sites like this .. the more I wish I would never have tried them......  Metamucil works better for a cleanse (same key ingredient) and the amount of nutrients they list are also found in a good multi vitamin.  3 months-- 300 dollars.. nothing !</li>
            <li> When I spoke to the Carnival Rep he told me that it would greatly help with the water retention which was a major issue for me. He told me to watch what I ate the first month, but I would lose a lot of water weight and then go down from there. I am fairly active, not exercising regularly but chasing after kids, walking where I need to go and things like that. I told him this and he said that was fine, but in month 2 I would need to get regular. Sur no problem. What did I get the first month? Nothing. No change whatsoever. Going into month two now so let&#x27;s see wha tthe Silhouette has in store with regular exercise. I told him that I didn&#x27;t have the money to waste and needed confirmation that this would work. And he said if I had ANY issues to email him. Guess what? three emails with basic questions and not one answer. I would not recommend this product to anyone until they researched it more. Yes the people who love this program and works for them. Why? Because they are exercising, eating healthy. Which is what I know I need to do and will be doing. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be a MAGIC pill, but for the water weight I thought it would reduce it at least by a pound or two, but not an inch has happened in the month.</li>
            <li> I bought this product aboard the Carnival Cruise line and it was horrible. They said it would cause you get rid of toxins and lose excess water weight. It did anything but. It caused a lot of nausea, constipation, bellyaches, headaches, diarrhea, griping, indigestion and skin breakouts. I had to discontinue taking the product. My girlfriend also bought this product and she threw up on the first day. Right now we are trying to get our money back. We wasted $616 for 2x3 month supply. I would not recommend this product. Does anyone know how to get reimbursed?</li>
            <li> This product advertised results are bogus.  It did nothing for me. I wish I could get my money back.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these products promoted on the cruise ships.  They must pay the cruise ships well to lie the way they do.</li>
            <li> Scam!!!  Don&#x27;t waste a dime</li>
            <li> I have taken this product for a month now and have noticed no difference.  I do not have any more energy nor have I lost any weight like the product claims.  I do not feel it  has detoxified my body and see no improvements.</li>
            <li> They sell this on Cruise Line Ships at much larger prices. Carnival is where it purchased mine.  It does nothing.... everything has to be done as a WITH  or you get no results.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles, nothing is a miracle when it comes to body fat and contouring.</li>
            <li> Revived in good ride and no issued</li>
            <li> Cal-Metab + Deep Drainage definitely helped me lose weight and reduced my appetite. However, Silhouette and Vitality were a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying I am a HUGE SKEPTIC!! I recently purchased this product on a Carnival cruise ship where it was explained to me in deep detail how the product works and how and when to take the pills. I think a lot of the reason some don&#x27;t have results or don&#x27;t &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; they have results is due to the fact they either have no clue how to use the product or have a misconception of what to expect from the product. While I am a open minded person I am also honest with myself. I have just started the product and already I have noticed I go to the the bathroom more often than I usually would. THAT in itself is a HUGE plus for me. It means it is cleaning me out like it is supposed to. While exercise and eating right is highly recommended, one of the mandatory things is drinking enough water. You have to drink half your weight in water to CLEAN the junk OUT of your body. The pills can&#x27;t do all the work. Think of it as a truck with no gas. The pills load up the junk to haul it away and your drinking water is the gas that goes in the truck to move it along OUT of the body.  Too many people expect to just take a pill and things just MAGICALLY and INSTANTLY get better. Depending on your age that is how many years of JUNK you have in your system. You have to give it a MINIMUM of 3 months of FAITHFULLY taking the pills and at minimum drinking water regularly to truly be able to give an honest review of this product. While this product my have immediate results for some the main purpose of the product is to help repair your body (liver) from years of pouring bad toxins into it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw one review say &amp;#34;wow that&#x27;s a lot of pills (4) to take daily&amp;#34;. My response is wow that is a LOT of  unhealthy JUNK we have daily put in our bodies.  Why get afraid when faced with an all natural product to remove that junk? Seems a tad backwards to me in my opinion :-) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I DO NOT WORK FOR CARNIVAL NOR DO I SELL OR RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS FROM THIS POST. I JUST HATE WHEN PEOPLE POST UNEDUCATED REVIEWS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps anyone wanting an unbiased and honest review of this product. I know that what I want when I look for reviews on a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Good luck and great health to all!!</li>
            <li> I was desperate when I went on Elemis - the Detox works IF you drink alot with it and do some exercise. Nothing is a miracle on its own, but it helped me shed the water from my hips!</li>
            <li> Two months into a 3-month herbal detox which included Elemis Deep Drainage, Cal-Metab Plus, Vitality, and Silhoutte, I started feeling nauseated, headaches, off-balance, dizzy, insomnia, night sweats, fatigue, increased heart palpitations, hot spots on my skin, confused, memory loss, high blood pressure which is not norm for me. Looked up ingredients one by one and found that 3 different ingredients had the side-effects I was experiencing so I stopped taking the supplement.    Docs are testing kidneys, pancreas, liver and gallbladder and feel my body was stressed by the detox which may take up to 3 months to get back to norm.     I had no weight loss even with exercise and diet plan in place.</li>
            <li> I almost bought this aboard a cruise line but had enough common sense not to get the entire line for a year and a half. However, when I got home I decided to buy one bottle of the Elemis Deep Drainage.  What a joke on me! I wish someone had told me about the product and how it is pushed on every cruise line! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I returned the product while still on the ship.  With no Internet to read reviews I was skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;The personal trainer selling me this product lied and told me the only place I could buy it was there!!&lt;br /&gt;When we got I to port and googled this product could be purchased on line and she sold me a nine months supply for $924.  I am so glad I returned it all of it... If your going to use this product buy it from home with a Dr or personal trainer who you know and can follow up with on your results, not on a cruise ship from someone who you will never see again and who won&#x27;t even take your email address ,, if questions arise...</li>
            <li> Although this is not a weight loss program, my mom who had about 25 lbs to lose lost 20 and my sister who had about 40 pounds to lose lost about 30. They are still eating pretty much what they want and have been the whole time they were on the program.  My mom has never spent one moment in a gym and my sister goes rarely.  They have kept the weight off for about 9 months now.  My sister, without doing anything at all, lost another 5 lbs after she was finished the program.  Stupid me who bought the product on a carnival cruise at the same exact time never bothered to take it.  I&#x27;m going to start in the spring.  Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  June 22, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has kept her weight off after doing this program more than 2 years ago.  She&#x27;s never done any lifestyle changes, gone to the gym or reordered these pills that I know of.  My sister, however has gained back about 70% of what she lost while she was on the program.  I never did the program after many, many months and sold the bottles I had on eBay.</li>
            <li> I first bought the Elemis Deep Drainage Body Detox as part of a package of 3 Elemis products.  The \\&quot;Deep Drainage\\&quot; was the only item that produced visible results.  Since then I have purchased the item several times.  It seems to help me reduce water retention and bloating especially in my hips and thighs.  My only criticism is the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a Princess Cruise.        My only excuse is that the fitness instructor selling it had a really good rap -- about  $600 worth.   Much of what he said I knew to be true.   He is, in my opinion, a very good snake oil charmer.   I just have to laugh now because once you buy it, you&#x27;re out $600.00.      There is no magic bullet for health and wellness.   Eat mostly vegetables, get adequate protein, exercise and lots of water.  Don&#x27;t drink a lot of alcohol.   You&#x27;ll be just as fine.    I gave it one star because there may be some benefit in the product.  Who the hell knows?   You wouldn&#x27;t know without a longitudinal study with a control group with specific controls and objectives.   That will never happen.    My advice:  Save your money, find an exercise you enjoy, and eat a plant based diet.     To good health, and not getting ripped off!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I purchased it on a recent Holland America cruise.  The Fitness Director explained it was a product that would provide a natural cleanse, help with constipation and bloating, appetite suppressant, and increase energy levels.  Upon returning home, I have been taking the product for approximately three weeks.  It is working better than ANYTHING I have tried in the past - especially for regularity.  Generally I eat healthy, so I have not had to adjust my diet drastically.  I am not a huge workout fan, but I do have an active lifestyle.  Without much effort, I have lost five pounds and all of my clothes fit better than they have in years. It is the first time I have ever tried a cleanse product and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the bad reviews on this product and had to write a review because for me, the product is definitely working. I&#x27;m 20 years old and gained about 10 pounds in my first year of college. I graduated high school weighing about 140. I got up to 150 at college and worked and worked to try to get it down while I was at school and was stuck at 146. I went on my internship in Spring of 2012 and lost 2 pounds over 4 months. I wanted to keep losing weight so I purchased the detox program on Carnival cruise line. I&#x27;m on the second month of the program and lost 6 pounds already! I lost 4 the first month, and 2 the second month. I&#x27;ve been eating slightly healthier, mainly more fruits and vegetables. I&#x27;m not working out any more than I did when I was in college. I&#x27;m a pastry chef so I still have an occasional cookie or so. This program has worked for me! My arms don&#x27;t have much flab on them anymore, and my extra chin went away! Theres still some fat around my stomach area, but I weigh less than I did in high school and I was really athletic then. Its been really hard for me to lose weight and this product is what is making it so easy now.</li>
            <li> I really love theElemis product, it works just like it said.  My goal was to eliminate the belly bulge and it did just that, I will order it again and definitely recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m on a RC cruise as I type this.  I just left my mediocre massage (I think she started to fall asleep during the head, face, and neck massage.  She would massage vigorously then the intensity would diminish over 10 seconds or so to the point where she was just touching me without moving for about 3 seconds then she would start to massage vigorously again.  This went on for 2 minutes.  What do you guys think? LOL).  Of course she woke up enough to attempt to sell me the worlds most expensive vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s interesting is that earlier in the cruise, they had a seminar on how to do 1000 sit-ups to make your face look thinner.  The word &amp;#34;sit-up&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere in the hour seminar.  This was, in fact, a sales pitch to sell this Elemis Detox product.  How blatantly dishonest is that?!?!  Talk about bait and switch.  They didn&#x27;t even try to fake and link they seminar to sit-up technique.  Strictly an Elemis sales pitch.  Needless to say I didn&#x27;t attend any of their other seminars.  It&#x27;s all B.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You guys do know that Americans have the most expensive Pee in the world, correct? Why? Because we support an ineffective MULTI-BILLION dollar PER YEAR vitamin addiction.  You pee them out before they are absorbed people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, think of it this way.  Why in the WORLD are you getting medical advise from some random person who spends their entire life in the bowels of a ship for months at a time?!?!  The &amp;#34;LICENSED ACUPUNCTURE SPECIALIST&amp;#34; on RC&#x27;s Oasis of the Sea?  He spends part of his day booking appointments and handing out robes for the steam room.  The other part, he&#x27;s giving seminars on the benefits of acupuncture and trying to convince you to let him stick little needles in you.  Uh....NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parting words for ANYTHING sold on the ships.  You CAN find it CHEAPER other places if you just HAVE TO try it (Like here on Amazon, for instance).  AND....the ship is based out of the Bahamas and NOT THE UNITEDSTATES.  They can give anyone any title they want to pretend to be legitimate specialists and convince you they know what they are talking about in the selling of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RC Oasis of the Sea cruise was SOOOO much fun.  My group of over 100 people has a BLAST and you will too.  Don&#x27;t ruin your cruise getting suckered into spending 100&#x27;s of dollars of your money for cons and scams.  With the money being legitimately spent on RC and other cruise lines they should be ASHAMED of doing this to people.  Shame, shame, shame!</li>
            <li> Four of us on Princess lines bought into a great presentation by cruise line.  Brought up was movie Food Inc, which we have at home and this made him seem a most reliable sprokesman to us.  Our purchase of over $668 for six month program or as we did divide so 1/2 for each of us.  We started with Cal-Metab Plus then to Silhouette and now on Vitality.  This is the plan sold to us.  ZERO results in my opinion.  We are exercising and eating organic healthy foods.  I am using Fitness Pal to track food and exercise for free.  This is a great site.  But the Detox may be detoxing???  But are not a weight loss product.  Not one of us have seen any results from these products.  The hard sell by Princess employee&#x27;s was tough to walk away from.  My rule is never buy any big purchase without walking away and thinking about what is being sold.  We broke our rule and got taken for a ride.  Expensive lession for us guilible cruisers.  Not sure why I gave this even one STAR.  It really was zero value and I should have rated it as Zero Star.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. You will not loose weight from this! After taking it daily for over 3 months my husband ended up in the ER twice without any weight loss. Our doctor told us it was not FDA approved and could cause kidney and liver problems. Just stick with old fashion diet and exercise.</li>
