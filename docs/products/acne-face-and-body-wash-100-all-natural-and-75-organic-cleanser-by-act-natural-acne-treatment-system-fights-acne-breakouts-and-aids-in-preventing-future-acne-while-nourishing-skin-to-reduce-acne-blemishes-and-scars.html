            <li> I got this item free on line as a trial and I used it for several weeks as that is usually when I break out.  I must say that it did prevent any outbreaks.  I did not care for the fragrance of it.  It was rather unappealing. Just due to the odor I probably would not replenish it.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely face wash.  So light and it leaves my skin very soft.  Thank you for this sample.</li>
            <li> I really didnt care for this wash. I felt like i had a leftover residue on my face and body. Even though i got it for free its not something i would recommend.</li>
            <li> The perfect face wash to prevent and clear up acne. Its a soft foam.

            <li> loved this product especially that it is natural. I dont have huge problem with acne but it definitely helps with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> It smells like rubbing alcohol but removes all my blemishes</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. I bought this after seeing many reviews it has, because other products barely have a comment. It is almost like pure water or something, it barely foams although I put quite a lot in each use, and it feels like rubbing water on my face. Acnes borke out every morning after I started using this one. And most of all, I just realized the reason this product has many reviews is many people received this as free or award of something that has to do with writing reviews. I am willing to throw this away.</li>
            <li> Act Natural&#x27;s Acne Face and Body wash is just the product I&#x27;ve been searching for.

            <li> Really small bottle...won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This product did not seem to change the amount of acne I have on my chest and back. I didn&#x27;t see any significant change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product in return of my HONEST review.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been using this product as he has some problems with acne on his back and has tried a lot of products to alleviate it. This wash does not have the harsh chemicals in it that can cause a breakout to become worse and is supposed to be sensitive enough to use on your face even though he does not. It does not have a super girly smell that he would be wearing around for hours after he used it so that was a plus on his side and it does not seem that he is have as many new break outs. All in all seems to be a pretty good product. As of right now our opinions are pretty high for this product and as he continues to use it I will update if there are any changes for the worse. Five Stars. I received this product for free or a reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion as seen above.</li>
            <li> This is the first acne wash i have which is both a face and body wash.&lt;br /&gt;I recently have had too much acne on my chest and back and had tried a lot of creams to prevent it but in vain. But then i tried this and did find a lot of difference. This is made of all natural products so there are no chemicals or paraben or any harmful ingredients which makes it good even for sensitive skin types.&lt;br /&gt;Sample received for honest review.</li>
            <li> Works wonders...i had my doubts, but suprisingly it gives an awesome feeling, leaving a refreshing sensation seconds after applying...thanks much!!!</li>
            <li> This item was free to me. I&#x27;ve only used this stuff for 7 days and i can honestly say that I feel a difference in the texture of my skin. I used to get acne everywhere! Especially my back, shoulders and face. Now it&#x27;s all disappearing! I love it. It works!</li>
            <li> This face wash is great! I am super worried about what I use in my daily cleaning routines because I have very sensitive skin. The wash makes my skin feel very clean without any irritation. I received this wash for my review and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I really like the face wash and I got to review it free thru I love to review</li>
            <li> I have acne on my skin and was very excited to receive this product. It is a small bottle so I am afraid I will run out quickly, but otherwise, it is a great product to have if you have blemishes. I like how it easily pumps and dispenses just the right amount in my hand. I have only tried using it on my face so far and not my body, so my review is based on how it works for my facial acne. It is a great cleanser that leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. My pores feel clean whenever I use it before going to sleep at night, which is my biggest criteria for acne wash. I received this in exchange for an honest review, and so far am happy with it.</li>
