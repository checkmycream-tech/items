            <li> Have been using this for quite a while. Would like it to be more oily as my skin is dry. Fine for summer tho, but may use something with more moisture for winter.</li>
            <li> Love this and all Revision products!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two years now. which means I like it enough to repeat. I use other products with it like Vit C and Vit B.</li>

            <li> Great for my oily skin.  It is hard to find something that will hydrate and not clog. This does the job.  I would recommend and order again.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Love this skincare line.</li>
            <li> I started buying this line of products on the recommendation of the dermatology department at our clinic.  I had periodic breakouts and with this product line, I am experiencing very few breakout.</li>
            <li> This product is to hydrate your skin, but for me it seems to make it makes my face drier than it already is. So, I&#x27;m continuing to use what I&#x27;ve always used. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t order this product again.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing to moisturize my skin! After use my skin is dry, tight and itchy. I was recommended this by the dermatologist product department. They no longer had the product I used and liked.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone! Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> i have normal to oily skin and whatever moisturizer i use, it will leave my skin oily and shinny. this one doesn&#x27;t. it&#x27;s like a gel that the skin absorb quickly. i like it very much. don&#x27;t fool by the size. one pump goes long way.</li>
            <li> This serum was recommended to me by a person in the cosmetic field. I like it very well, but I&#x27;m still looking for that &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; product.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a moisturizer, it&#x27;s a serum.  And it&#x27;s wonderful.  I put it on after my Teamine and before my Revision Moisturizer. It makes my face look great without looking oily.</li>
