            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>The best product I have found.</li>
            <li>this works great!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>However,  I am more impressed with the conditioner than the accompanying shampoo.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY EFFECTIVE product!</li>
            <li>The shampoo delivers a good lather.</li>
            <li>I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and to be honest...</li>
            <li>Did not make my hair feel better.  </li>
            <li>I love how well it works.</li>
            <li>its just ok....</li>
            <li>This makes your hair feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>, I just know this product works better than most to smooth my hair when rinsing.</li>
            <li>Since moving from a place with nice, soft (4 grains per gallon) wonderful water that gave me insanely awesome hair to a place with hard water, my hair got completely ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even feel clean.</li>
            <li>It really helps!!</li>
            <li>Also...I have started pre conditioning my hair before shampoo (using a coconut oil or argan oil) and then shampooing that out, and the results are very positive.  </li>
            <li>she loves it very much</li>
            <li>It was still pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft &amp; smooth, NO frizz!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>During the first wash I immediatedly noticed the softening of my hair; my curls even returned.  </li>
            <li>I used the Ion shampoo first and thought that the conditioner would work for me, however, it didn&#x27;t do what I thought it was going to.</li>
            <li>This is really good for people who have hard water.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I tried the conditioner and really don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>Am really liking this product.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo, not so much the conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t wash out well and leaves my hair weighted down</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My house has hard water and it hasnt been kind to my hair....</li>
            <li>I lived with soft water, I didn&#x27;t really use shampoo.</li>
            <li>I tried apple cider vinegar, baking powder, hot oil treatments and deep conditioning</li>
            <li>It took about 2-3 washes for it to fully feel like my normal, soft hair again.</li>
            <li>We have well water and this has FIXED my hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you leave the conditioner in for at least a minute or two.</li>
            <li>My hair was never that shiny or soft as it used to be.</li>
            <li>I keep apple cider vinegar in an old hairspray bottle and mist that on my hair after washing, then rinse, that  helps too.  </li>
            <li>Dried out my hair, will not purchase again, in my opinion, not a great product..no better than the cheap shampoos</li>
            <li>I will say that I have only used the conditioner, but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t really feel that shampoo is necessary.</li>
            <li>But I used it for the 2nd time this morning &amp; WOW!</li>
            <li>I expected this to take 2 or 3 washes, but I have to say that for me, I felt a noticeable and large difference in my hair after using Ion conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK... but not great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not any better or worse than some cheaper&lt;br /&gt;Conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Just a little bit of Apple Cider Vinegar, and my hair was soft, manageable, gentle waves.</li>
            <li>I have super hard well water and</li>
            <li>Have super hard water.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see how this could be any different than the other things I&#x27;d tried, &amp; after I&#x27;d dried it I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li>My city is notorious for it, so I started looking for some kind of product that would remove or at least neutralize the hard water minerals on my hair.</li>
            <li>shampoo really does work on natural, African-American hair (well, for my hair at least).</li>

            <li> The hard water always makes my hair feel hard and crackly, so I was happy to learn of a conditioner especially for hard water.  </li>
            <li> I have really hard water--it&#x27;s so bad that it strips a good amount of hair from my head in a matter of a week!  </li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other types of hard water, but not so much for me.</li>
            <li> I have very hard water ( high in manganese) from a deep well.  </li>

            <li> Makes my hair shine and only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> The hard water made my hair dry, brittle, dull looking, and a gross brassy color, AND gave me giant balls of knots.</li>

            <li> If you live in an area with hard water &amp; you have frizzy unruly hair, you might just give Ion Hard Water shampoo &amp; conditioner a try.</li>
            <li> I believe I could feel all the minerals and metals wash down the drain along with the dirt as well.</li>
            <li> Now my hair feels heavy and stiff -- not the result I expected.  </li>

            <li> Did not make my hair feel better.  In fact worse</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great! We have well water and this has FIXED my hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ion Hard Water shampoo &amp; conditioner are just awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been a frustratingly frizzy problem for a LONG time. I&#x27;ve tried anti-frizz serums, shampoos, deep conditioners - you name it, At one time, I even decided to just embrace the horror &amp; scrunch-dry it wavy. That didn&#x27;t work, either because all I got was extra frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the last time I got my hair cut (&amp; coloured) I had a long converstion with my stylist &amp; she mentioned hard water as being a possible cause for the the frizziness. My city is notorious for it, so I started looking for some kind of product that would remove or at least neutralize the hard water minerals on my hair. Finally found Ion Hard Water Shampoo &amp; Conditioner at Sally Beauty Supply...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1st time I used it, I was skeptical - I didn&#x27;t really see how this could be any different than the other things I&#x27;d tried, &amp; after I&#x27;d dried it I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference at all. It was still pretty frizzy. But I used it for the 2nd time this morning &amp; WOW! My hair is soft &amp; smooth, NO frizz!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND my colour looks brighter, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... If you live in an area with hard water &amp; you have frizzy unruly hair, you might just give Ion Hard Water shampoo &amp; conditioner a try. I can definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner work well with very hard well water. The best product I have found.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and only a small amount is needed. I will diffently get this again.</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;weekend\\&quot; house is supplied by well water. The hard water always makes my hair feel hard and crackly, so I was happy to learn of a conditioner especially for hard water.  I tried this product today.  Now my hair feels heavy and stiff -- not the result I expected.  Will not use again.</li>
            <li> I have really hard water--it&#x27;s so bad that it strips a good amount of hair from my head in a matter of a week!  I tried apple cider vinegar, baking powder, hot oil treatments and deep conditioning BUT nothing had worked.  Tired of dry, limped, dull hair I resorted to washing my hair with bottled water (which was tedious and laboring).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I had had enough. Did my research and took a gamble on ION hard water &amp; well water: that gamble paid off.  During the first wash I immediatedly noticed the softening of my hair; my curls even returned.  The shampoo delivers a good lather. I believe I could feel all the minerals and metals wash down the drain along with the dirt as well. I am no longer fingering handfuls of hair from my head after washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo really does work on natural, African-American hair (well, for my hair at least).</li>
            <li> I tried the conditioner and really don&#x27;t care for it. I used the Ion shampoo first and thought that the conditioner would work for me, however, it didn&#x27;t do what I thought it was going to. It made my hair seem a little dirty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK... but not great.  I have very hard water ( high in manganese) from a deep well.  It&#x27;s not any better or worse than some cheaper&lt;br /&gt;Conditioners.  Maybe it works for other types of hard water, but not so much for me.</li>
            <li> I moved across the country and started noticing dandruff in my hair. Then, my hair started to feel heavy and nasty after washing. It didn&#x27;t even feel clean. This product saved me from buying an expensive water softening system. I was seriously that desperate. It took about 2-3 washes for it to fully feel like my normal, soft hair again. Make sure you leave the conditioner in for at least a minute or two. It really helps!!</li>
            <li> having hard water problems, seem to solve the hair issue.Would buy it again if needed.xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxx xx</li>
            <li> Still get iron in my hair but it helps keep my hair white.</li>
            <li> she loves it very much</li>
            <li> I expected this to take 2 or 3 washes, but I have to say that for me, I felt a noticeable and large difference in my hair after using Ion conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely hard water--9 grains per gallon, 10 being extreme/most. Since moving from a place with nice, soft (4 grains per gallon) wonderful water that gave me insanely awesome hair to a place with hard water, my hair got completely ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I lived with soft water, I didn&#x27;t really use shampoo. Just a little bit of Apple Cider Vinegar, and my hair was soft, manageable, gentle waves. The hard water made my hair dry, brittle, dull looking, and a gross brassy color, AND gave me giant balls of knots. I could use an entire bottle of conditioner, and it wouldn&#x27;t fix the problem. I had to cut 5 inches off my hair because of the hard water. Yes, I was very....very pissed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried filters and they helped, but not enough. My hair was never that shiny or soft as it used to be. I will say that I have only used the conditioner, but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t really feel that shampoo is necessary. Regardless--this conditioner worked so well for me. I actually have hope for my hair again, short of moving away.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the result I wanted with my hair. There was very little difference. I have very hard water.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair, will not purchase again, in my opinion, not a great product..no better than the cheap shampoos</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo, not so much the conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t wash out well and leaves my hair weighted down it seems.</li>
            <li> I have super hard well water and this works great!</li>
            <li> This is really good for people who have hard water. This makes your hair feel nice and clean. I love how well it works.</li>
            <li> Performance is acceptable for regular conditioing when I don&#x27;t have something for deeper strengthening and moisturizing. However,  I am more impressed with the conditioner than the accompanying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have well water, I do not know if it is hard or soft, I just know this product works better than most to smooth my hair when rinsing. I would recommend and purchase it again</li>
            <li> My house has hard water and it hasnt been kind to my hair....I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and to be honest...I could have skipped buying this...its just ok....I suggest buying the shampoo and using whatever conditioner you prefer instead.  Also...I have started pre conditioning my hair before shampoo (using a coconut oil or argan oil) and then shampooing that out, and the results are very positive.  Another trick for hard water and hair...I keep apple cider vinegar in an old hairspray bottle and mist that on my hair after washing, then rinse, that  helps too.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Am really liking this product. We have very hard water. Not a strong scent</li>
            <li> HIGHLY EFFECTIVE product! Cured my hard water hair.</li>
            <li> Have super hard water.  Bought this with the shampoo and use both about once a week.  My hair was softer and cleaner and it didn&#x27;t stick out anymore from all that mineral coating.  Great.</li>
