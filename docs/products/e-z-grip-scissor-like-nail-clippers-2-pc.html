            <li>very easy on your fingers</li>
            <li>Glad I found them.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>It would have been better, if they had a clipping catcher.</li>
            <li>Love them they work great, got one set for me and one for a friend, as a person gets older</li>
            <li>Great for old fingers.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>they need things like this, but anyone can use them, easy to use, would recommend to others, thank you.</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use....</li>
            <li>I got it before the promised date - everything was fine.</li>
            <li>These are super easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is hard for me to bend over and these are perfect.</li>
            <li>Great little products, easy to order, no processing issues, shipped promptly.</li>
            <li>Well built, sturdy, priced right.</li>
            <li>Good quality &amp; heavy duty.</li>
            <li>They also fold up to a smaller &amp;#34;footprint;&amp;#34; thus are easy to store in a medicine cabinet--or a pocketbook if you&#x27;re so inclined.  </li>
            <li>Really does the job.</li>
            <li>Handles make it convenient but they are not as sharp as most clippers.</li>
            <li>As an older person(76)</li>
            <li>I have an older, regular-type pair of toenail clippers and they just do not &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34; with my nails.  </li>
            <li>Just what we expected - works fine.</li>
            <li>As we age our dexterity suffers, and these clippers are the perfect solution to one of life&#x27;s age related problems.  </li>
            <li>These are a snap to use and very powerful and sharp.  </li>
            <li>what took me so long to decide to find something that worked better than those tiny little ones?  </li>
            <li>The only negative is that there is not a small file attached to clean under the toe- and fingernails.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than conventional clippers.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The finger and thumb holes make it so easy to hold on to when cutting both finger and toe nails.  </li>
            <li> and they do not keep slipping off your fingers.....</li>
            <li> In the past, arthritis in my hands made nail cutting a painful experience.</li>
            <li> I gave one to each of my children, it makes cutting nails easier and all my family likes them.</li>

            <li> A good design. And they do the job. It would have been better, if they had a clipping catcher. But, ya can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use....wish I had them a long time ago.....very easy on your fingers and they do not keep slipping off your fingers.....</li>

            <li> Great little products, easy to order, no processing issues, shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> These are heavy, high quality clippers.  I have an older, regular-type pair of toenail clippers and they just do not &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34; with my nails.  These are a snap to use and very powerful and sharp.  They also fold up to a smaller &amp;#34;footprint;&amp;#34; thus are easy to store in a medicine cabinet--or a pocketbook if you&#x27;re so inclined.  Heck, you can even hang them on a peg or whatever.  The only negative is that there is not a small file attached to clean under the toe- and fingernails.</li>
