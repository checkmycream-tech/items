            <li>something seems too good to be true it probably is????</li>
            <li>Many sellers go THROUGH Amazon to sell their merchandise.</li>
            <li>People within about a foot of me could smell me, but by no means was the scent overwhelming or offensive.</li>
            <li>Hi everyone,   let me begin by saying that i have never been able to find vera wang&#x27;s Princess cheaper than it was here on amazon.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my grand daughter, she loves it</li>
            <li>I would also suggest Marc Jacobs&#x27; Daisy which smells even better.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume..</li>
            <li>My BF and my boyfriend say that they love it.</li>
            <li>All were extremely pleased, myself, granddaughter, mom, and dad.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This was delivered to me on time, and for such a GREAT price!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>He always calls me &#x27;princess&#x27; too :)</li>
            <li>This perfume smells amazing and is definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This perfume is so beautiful it smells great but is subtle.</li>
            <li>It is subtly sweet!</li>
            <li>#34;how strong a scent?&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is amazing--not too feminine for my taste, not too heavy, but definitely an excellent staple perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, and the price is right on Amazon.</li>
            <li>the salesperson suggested Vera Wang Princess as a great smelling substitute to Truly Pink.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this perfume.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe I could get such a good deal.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>What I really like is the heart bottle with the crown top.</li>
            <li>So lucky I didn&#x27;t buy the 100ml</li>
            <li>This is like a very fresh and young perfume, but nonetheless sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Could easily be worn on a date or any occasion, really.</li>
            <li>And the little crown that comes in top is adorable!</li>
            <li>It is girly, feminine, and a bit innocent but never juvenile.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the super deal!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>It is surprisingly more mature than one would expect.</li>
            <li>It is sweet after a while, but the first smell just like alcohol...</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and it is a lighter scent.</li>
            <li>It smells soft and sweet but not overly sweet like cotton candy or anything like that.  </li>
            <li>It was quickly delivered and much to my surprise ..</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than getting in a department store too!</li>
            <li>My mother loves this fragrance [and the cute bottle], I got it to her for Mother&#x27;s Day last year here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 18th birthday, but it&#x27;s really not the kind of  smell</li>
            <li>I first discovered it when my roommate always sprayed some on in the morning before her classes.</li>
            <li>It really makes you feel like a princess!</li>
            <li>It is a good signature or everyday perfume.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it and am definitely going to buy more once my first bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>The cost was pretty low, but does not smell like cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t met a single person who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of Vera Wang Princess :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use up a whole bottle of perfume, but I know I will use every last drop of this one - it smells so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine smelling.    </li>
            <li>I trust Amazon and have never had a problem with receiving anything but REAL perfume.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t do much developing once there.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the quality of this perfume because the price is very cheaper than the store.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I would say its the real deal.  </li>
            <li>i had smelled a sample at my local department store and i fell in love with it instantly, howver</li>
            <li>The only negative is the staying power is not that great</li>
            <li>The scent is delicate and fresh and lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li>However, the top is a little crown that comes off and has a ring with it.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I LOVE this scent and usually buy from Sephora!  </li>
            <li>Also, I am pregnant and Princess is one of the few perfumes I can wear almost daily without becoming nauseous.</li>
            <li>Just because you purchase from Amazon website, does not mean you are buying directly from Amazon itself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too strong.</li>
            <li>It is okay, but does not last long enough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle and sweet with a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>The outside box is actually a little more flimsy than I thought.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I wish I could change about this scent is that it disappears really soon after application.</li>
            <li>Let me just start by saying, ANY perfume purchased directly from Amazon LLC (Prime) is legit.</li>
            <li>I am 20, and I do not BY ANY MEANS wear anything old ladyish.</li>
            <li>After reading a couple negative reviews (a couple people said they didn&#x27;t think it as authentic)</li>
            <li>It is a fruity-floral scent and it&#x27;s soft and feminine and lasts all day...</li>
            <li>So when i saw that amazon had it for such a low price, well i jumped right on it.</li>
            <li>Wang Princess is a beautifully developed perfume, and way more complex than anything a middle schooler or tween would wear.</li>
            <li>I have had this bottle for a couple years and have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li>I said I Googled it for a young teen, and this was one that came up.  </li>

            <li> I said I Googled it for a young teen, and this was one that came up.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those people who perfumes do not last long at all on my skin.</li>
            <li> And the smell doesn&#x27;t last for a long time since it&#x27;s a EDT.</li>
            <li> I only use this only on special days because it is quite expensive for my college student budget, but I have repurchased this multiple times and I cannot be without it.</li>
            <li> This is especially a problem if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> its dead on and not faint smelling or watered down at all!  </li>
            <li> I thought I was going to get some sort of perfume knock off...not the case, it was the same packaging and smell as my empty bottle from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> it does remain intoxicating and lush on my sheets for a few nights.</li>
            <li> and I have waited in a long time (25 days).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not live in Usa.</li>
            <li> so i am returning to truly pink as long as i can find it.</li>
            <li> Personally, I would never buy perfume from any of these sellers because perfumes could be watered down, counterfeit, etc.</li>
            <li> I was looking for truly pink by Vera Wang when a salesperson in a department store told me that they no longer carried it.</li>
            <li> Package looks like the picture, smells like I expected it would.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price on Amazon - at first</li>
            <li> She sprayed it on a fragrance card which i took home and contemplated for a few days.</li>
            <li> Buy the perfume, don&#x27;t waste your money on the Eau de Toilette.</li>
            <li> Its not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t cause that perfume headache you get from others.</li>
            <li> If this is not authentic than boy have they fooled me...</li>
            <li> its rapid vanishing act is so frustrating to me that i now use this perfume as a linen spray.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> &amp; perfume is just way too expensive for me to gamble with.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed by this perfume at all.</li>
            <li> Sephora :(</li>
            <li> It drives my boyfriend crazy, he always asks me what I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My man loves the scent. It is subtly sweet! Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price on Amazon - at first I thought I was going to get some sort of perfume knock off...not the case, it was the same packaging and smell as my empty bottle from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I borrowed a friends before going out and got loads of compliments! Its not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t cause that perfume headache you get from others. It&#x27;s subtle and sweet with a fresh smell. I just love it! And the little crown that comes in top is adorable! You cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, and the price is right on Amazon. The only thing I wish I could change about this scent is that it disappears really soon after application.</li>
            <li> The perfume I ordered (Vera Wang Princess) arrived in the time indicated and in the condition represented.  I am more than happy with this purchase and the way it was handled.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this perfume because of the great reviews and the so cute packaging.  The outside box is actually a little more flimsy than I thought.  However, the top is a little crown that comes off and has a ring with it.  Very cute.    I&#x27;m not in to strong scents and this is perfect.  It&#x27;s very feminine smelling.    This is my staple fragrance now.  It&#x27;s worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying, ANY perfume purchased directly from Amazon LLC (Prime) is legit. Just because you purchase from Amazon website, does not mean you are buying directly from Amazon itself. Many sellers go THROUGH Amazon to sell their merchandise. Personally, I would never buy perfume from any of these sellers because perfumes could be watered down, counterfeit, etc. &amp; perfume is just way too expensive for me to gamble with. I trust Amazon and have never had a problem with receiving anything but REAL perfume. Also, their customer service is wonderful. Now, on to the product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vera Wang Princess is a beautifully developed perfume, and way more complex than anything a middle schooler or tween would wear. It is surprisingly more mature than one would expect. I am 20, and I do not BY ANY MEANS wear anything old ladyish. While i do try to keep a variety of perfumes on hand, I cannot stand anything too florally or musky. Also, I am pregnant and Princess is one of the few perfumes I can wear almost daily without becoming nauseous. I am one of those people who perfumes do not last long at all on my skin. They also don&#x27;t do much developing once there. I can smell Princess on my clothes weeks after applying it. I wore it to work last night (I do 12 hour shifts at a nursing home) and could not only smell it the entire time I was there, but after I got home as well giving it a total longevity of 16 hours on my skin. People within about a foot of me could smell me, but by no means was the scent overwhelming or offensive. Vera Wang&#x27;s princess is for all ages. It is girly, feminine, and a bit innocent but never juvenile. It is a good signature or everyday perfume. Could easily be worn on a date or any occasion, really. I cannot say enough good things about this perfume. Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for truly pink by Vera Wang when a salesperson in a department store told me that they no longer carried it. the salesperson suggested Vera Wang Princess as a great smelling substitute to Truly Pink. She sprayed it on a fragrance card which i took home and contemplated for a few days. i eventually ordered it on Amazon.The fragrance is delightful inviting and lush.However, it seems to evaporate almost instantly. its rapid vanishing act is so frustrating to me that i now use this perfume as a linen spray. it does remain intoxicating and lush on my sheets for a few nights. so i am returning to truly pink as long as i can find it.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone,   let me begin by saying that i have never been able to find vera wang&#x27;s Princess cheaper than it was here on amazon. i had smelled a sample at my local department store and i fell in love with it instantly, howver it was a wopping $80. So when i saw that amazon had it for such a low price, well i jumped right on it. I have not been disappointed by this perfume at all. i get compliments on it all the time. it is such a femine smell, if you are looking for a perfume that reminds you of what its like to be a lady, Princess is the one for you.</li>
            <li> It was awsome just what it was said to b</li>
            <li> Received five days after ordering. Package looks like the picture, smells like I expected it would. Much cheaper than getting in a department store too!</li>
            <li> This perfume lasts all day!  The cost was pretty low, but does not smell like cheap perfume. I don&#x27;t usually use up a whole bottle of perfume, but I know I will use every last drop of this one - it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scent. I constantly receive compliments from people when I wear it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand daughter, she loves it</li>
            <li> My mother loves this fragrance [and the cute bottle], I got it to her for Mother&#x27;s Day last year here on Amazon.  Great scent.  I would also suggest Marc Jacobs&#x27; Daisy which smells even better.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 18th birthday, but it&#x27;s really not the kind of  smell i like. It is sweet after a while, but the first smell just like alcohol... So lucky I didn&#x27;t buy the 100ml one lol. And the smell doesn&#x27;t last for a long time since it&#x27;s a EDT. The outfit is sooo cute and sweet!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume..a little goes a long way.  I have had this bottle for a couple years and have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> Is perfect. Divine!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not live in Usa. I&#x27;m from Vietnam and I have waited in a long time (25 days). I was worried about the quality of this perfume because the price is very cheaper than the store. I revieved it yesterday and everything is perfect. The bottle is so beautiful, the smell is so lovely. My BF and my boyfriend say that they love it. I check the code and see date of manu is April 2014. I&#x27;m very happy and I will buy on Amazon again. Thanks a lot. (i buy amazon seller, not the third seller). Hope my feedback will help you !</li>
            <li> Great price and I&#x27;m running out. Would recommend and buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> This was my granddaughter&#x60;s Christmas present.  Her Mom asked &amp;#34;how strong a scent?&amp;#34;.  I stated don&#x27;t know, it was sealed.  She frowned.  I said I Googled it for a young teen, and this was one that came up.  All were extremely pleased, myself, granddaughter, mom, and dad.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so beautiful it smells great but is subtle. I love it.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but does not last long enough.  This is especially a problem if you have dry skin.  Buy the perfume, don&#x27;t waste your money on the Eau de Toilette.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing and is definitely worth the cost. I would highly recommend it and am definitely going to buy more once my first bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too strong.</li>
            <li> Excelenttt i love the frangace!</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.  It smells soft and sweet but not overly sweet like cotton candy or anything like that.  I must admit that even though this fragrance is marketed for a younger crowd (im 42) I really liked it and will make it a staple in my perfume collection.  The only negative is the staying power is not that great I found that after 4 hr it was fading but thats probably because its a toilette, overall I will continue to purchase this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was delivered to me on time, and for such a GREAT price! I didn&#x27;t believe I could get such a good deal. If you&#x27;ve never smelled this perfume, it&#x27;s wonderful. I haven&#x27;t met a single person who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of Vera Wang Princess :)</li>
            <li> First of all, I LOVE this scent and usually buy from Sephora!  I decided to see if it was on Amazon and made the mistake of reading reviews after I already purchased it.  After reading a couple negative reviews (a couple people said they didn&#x27;t think it as authentic) I tried to cancel my order, but it was already processing.  It was quickly delivered and much to my surprise .. WHAT A BARGAIN I RECEIVED!!!  If this is not authentic than boy have they fooled me...b/c its dead on and not faint smelling or watered down at all!  I would say its the real deal.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get the bigger bottle!  You know how they say &amp;#34;if something seems too good to be true it probably is???? &amp;#34;  Not at all in this case!  I will for sure buy from this seller again!  Thanks for the super deal!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I use it alot. It smells fresh and it is a lighter scent. I would recommend this perfume you others.</li>
            <li> So do NOT care for this scent.  It smells like vanilla vanilla vanilla.  YUCKERS!  It&#x27;s not sexxxy...it&#x27;s airfreshner and nothing like what I sampled @ Sephora :(</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing--not too feminine for my taste, not too heavy, but definitely an excellent staple perfume. Good for fairly girly girls.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is my absolute favorite. It is a fruity-floral scent and it&#x27;s soft and feminine and lasts all day... This is like a very fresh and young perfume, but nonetheless sophisticated. I only use this only on special days because it is quite expensive for my college student budget, but I have repurchased this multiple times and I cannot be without it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I first discovered it when my roommate always sprayed some on in the morning before her classes. What I really like is the heart bottle with the crown top. It really makes you feel like a princess! The scent is delicate and fresh and lasts for most of the day. It drives my boyfriend crazy, he always asks me what I&#x27;m wearing! He always calls me &#x27;princess&#x27; too :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume and this is the best price i could find both in store or online. Would buy it again.</li>
