            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>This review does not reflect on authentic Curve Cologne!  </li>
            <li>The price was really nice, it came on time and it makes me think of my youth.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly for Christmas gift, he loved it.</li>
            <li>have a lot of women around me that love its smell at work</li>
            <li>Better than I had smelled before.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells great, it&#x27;s not too much that it gives me a head ache.</li>
            <li>need more......</li>
            <li>We absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>You will not be remembered by the strong and sometimes wake of very strong fragrance?</li>
            <li>Used this stuff since high school and still get compliments on how I smell great all the time.</li>
            <li>Not too strong and you won&#x27;t have that douche-bag smell you get with Axe.</li>
            <li>smells great, should have bought bigger bottle</li>
            <li>This bottle is travel sized (good to go for airline travel restrictions) and a much better price than my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>This is  one more on the list of sweet, cloying fragrances that are so popular with the general public.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love shopping on Amazon, it usually has better prices.</li>
            <li>Pretty legit to me.</li>
            <li>Men&#x27;s colognes should be dry, fresh and elegant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I have been in love with this smell for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>This cologne lacked the scent that I loved when I have bought curve in the past.  </li>
            <li>It is different and not as strong either.</li>
            <li>They thought by commenting on multiple miscellaneous products on the same day they made this review that we would accept and perceive their review as being authentic!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>All the mentioned above are very fresh and citrusy without an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>This is the original, not fake, only new version.</li>
            <li>With that being said, when you spray this cologne you can clearly see via the distinct clear color of the bottle of cologne that this is a knock off!</li>
            <li>have a few recommendations: St John&#x27;s Lime, George Trumper&#x27;s Extract of Limes, Guerlain&#x27;s Imperiale (not anymore, the White Label one is good for nothing).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended .</li>
            <li>If you like something a little stronger but still elegant, try Annik Goutal&#x27;s Lavender.  </li>
            <li>The new packaging reflects this change, there is the reason for a new bottle and bottom sticker.</li>
            <li>I looked at the most recent reviews and they only reviewed this product only!</li>
            <li>What I received from this company smelled like a very cheap cologne filled in a curve bottle, but the bottle was clear glass instead of the usual green.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Curve on and off for the past seven years and my wife always tells me it smells good compared to my other colognes.  </li>
            <li>Item is in a clear bottle.  </li>
            <li>I recall wearing this as a young man.  </li>
            <li>one goes directly to the trash.</li>
            <li>This is not a knockoff as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>The original curve comes ina Green bottle.  </li>
            <li>A timeless classic, especially for the money!</li>
            <li>This was the exact size shown and definitely will last me for a while.</li>
            <li>Jean Marie Farina will do very nicely For something less expensive try 4711.</li>
            <li>For the price and the convenience, this is the only cologne and the only way to buy it as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, this bottle is clear!</li>

            <li> I receive at least 2-3 compliments per week and the females range from 20&#x27;s to 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product is fake.</li>
            <li> When you spray it the smell is faint!</li>
            <li> This is a FAKE knockoff!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Bought it as a gift and that person loved the cent. Highly recommended .</li>
            <li> have a lot of women around me that love its smell at work</li>
            <li> Wife loves the smell.</li>
            <li> The product fulfilled expectations: I sprayed it on myself, and afterward I smelled good. Better than I had smelled before.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One spray on the wrist in the morning&lt;br /&gt;lasts all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TFS</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden acquired the rights to Curve the fragrance. The new packaging reflects this change, there is the reason for a new bottle and bottom sticker. This is the original, not fake, only new version.</li>
            <li> My husband and son loves Curve Cologne and won&#x27;t use anything else. They have tried others but they always goes back to this one.</li>
            <li> *This review does not reflect on authentic Curve Cologne!  Actual Curve cologne is fantastic!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne received was not Curve cologne.  I have been using Curve cologne for over 10 years.  What I received from this company smelled like a very cheap cologne filled in a curve bottle, but the bottle was clear glass instead of the usual green.  This is a FAKE knockoff!!</li>
            <li> I recall wearing this as a young man.  The price was really nice, it came on time and it makes me think of my youth.</li>
            <li> Well, my wife loves it when I wear it!</li>
            <li> Great for winter time smell.  Attracts ladies in droves.  Not too strong and you won&#x27;t have that douche-bag smell you get with Axe.</li>
            <li> I have used curve for a long time and its finally at a price it should be at. It&#x27;s a classic fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This is  one more on the list of sweet, cloying fragrances that are so popular with the general public. Men&#x27;s colognes should be dry, fresh and elegant.  Most colognes that one finds in stores seem to be designed for males prostitutes and to be positively annoying to other people. One can smell them 20 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one goes directly to the trash. Money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few recommendations: St John&#x27;s Lime, George Trumper&#x27;s Extract of Limes, Guerlain&#x27;s Imperiale (not anymore, the White Label one is good for nothing). If you like something a little stronger but still elegant, try Annik Goutal&#x27;s Lavender.  Roger &amp; Gallet&amp;#34;s Jean Marie Farina will do very nicely For something less expensive try 4711. All the mentioned above are very fresh and citrusy without an overpowering smell. You will not be remembered by the strong and sometimes wake of very strong fragrance? but by the lingering and delicate freshness.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great, it&#x27;s not too much that it gives me a head ache. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> For the price and the convenience, this is the only cologne and the only way to buy it as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I receive at least 2-3 compliments per week and the females range from 20&#x27;s to 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Used this stuff since high school and still get compliments on how I smell great all the time. A timeless classic, especially for the money!</li>
            <li> This cologne lacked the scent that I loved when I have bought curve in the past.  It is different and not as strong either.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice lingering smell on me for upwards of 7+ hours! And the scent stays in my shirt through the next day! Will definitely purchase again...</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly for Christmas gift, he loved it.</li>
            <li> Perfect, thank you !!</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this smell for as long as I can remember. This bottle is travel sized (good to go for airline travel restrictions) and a much better price than my local drugstore. I buy it for my boyfriend, who smells delicious when he wears it. This is not a knockoff as far as I can tell. Smells, looks, and lasts like the same one I buy in the drugstore, only this one is less expensive. That&#x27;s why I love shopping on Amazon, it usually has better prices.</li>
            <li> Just a great smell. My favorite cologne by Claiborne!!!!</li>
            <li> perfect i loved it for my man... need more need more...... i want a bigger bottle for him to use</li>
            <li> also buy this every year for a gift</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last as if it was watered down :/</li>
            <li> will be ordering again and again and again.</li>
            <li> You never know when a listing is a fake when it comes to perfume or personal product. This was the exact size shown and definitely will last me for a while.</li>
            <li> smells great, should have bought bigger bottle</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to replace my bottle that I purchased from Ross. The \\&quot;original\\&quot; bottle&#x27;s color is green. On the other hand, this bottle is clear! When you spray it the smell is faint! I looked at the most recent reviews and they only reviewed this product only! They attempted to comment on other products in a hope to disguise their review. They thought by commenting on multiple miscellaneous products on the same day they made this review that we would accept and perceive their review as being authentic! WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the bottle that I brought at Ross and Walmart on multiple occasions is the same price, $16.99, as this knock off by which the color of the bottle is green! With that being said, when you spray this cologne you can clearly see via the distinct clear color of the bottle of cologne that this is a knock off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Curve on and off for the past seven years and my wife always tells me it smells good compared to my other colognes.  I can also appreciate the orange tab and protective tin to keep it from spraying while travelling.</li>
            <li> A few reviews say this stuff is clear/in a clear bottle and/or fake? Pretty legit to me. Good purchase. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item.  Item is in a clear bottle.  The original curve comes ina Green bottle.  In my opinion this product is fake.</li>
            <li> bought it for my boyfriend, he loves it, his brother uses it too.</li>
            <li> Best smelling mens cologne around. My husband has been using this for 9 years! We absolutely love it.</li>
