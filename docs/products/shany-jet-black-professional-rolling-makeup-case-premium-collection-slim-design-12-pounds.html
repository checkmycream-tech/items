            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Seems really nice and spacious.</li>
            <li>Very roomy and for even though  the price, its wonderful!</li>
            <li>The exterior of the case is nice, though I think it will show scratches.  </li>
            <li>Looks great, works great, very multifunctional.</li>
            <li>It is so helpful to keep all my make up organized and nice and neat.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I really liked the size and layout of the case.</li>
            <li>and I have my own clientele.</li>
            <li>art know how nice that feature is.</li>
            <li>I would def recommend this to anyone looking for a travel friendly case!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the Rolls Royce of cases, but it looks good, is light weight, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>When the package arrived, I noticed that the box was in near perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Best space available for when u have very busy days!!</li>
            <li>Overall, the storage capacity is amazing, the quality and condition is beautiful and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li>, Could be a great first makeup case.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>im in love with this</li>
            <li>, quality is great,will buy more from shany</li>
            <li>Seya is sturdy and the quality just feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>this case does not come with a top cover for your bottom rolling case.</li>
            <li>This involved replacing rivets and also touching up cosmetic damage.</li>
            <li>and I feel confident that had I received one of these damaged</li>
            <li>Especially not on a product this great!</li>
            <li>CAUSE TO 2 SLIDING TRAYS ON THE TOP</li>
            <li>I PAID $20.00 MORE AND GOT ONE WITHOUT THE TRAY SLIDE</li>
            <li>SO I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING THIS CAUSE OF THE TOP 2 SLIDING TRAYS.  </li>
            <li>Also I incurred greater shipping charges than I thought.</li>
            <li>Love the look and space of this case</li>
            <li>&quot; I assumed it would be a safe purchase.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE DETACHABLE CASE</li>
            <li>It also gives people the impression of you being organize and neat thus people trusting you more with the makeup.</li>
            <li>The exterior may give an impression of professionalism, but the interior is CHEAP!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I just love the way I can organize everything.  </li>
            <li>Love the convenience of the rolling wheels.</li>
            <li>i love love love the color.</li>
            <li>My clients love it and they even purchased it</li>
            <li>I LOVE this case.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the design and decided that I would continue using it, propping the unit on a box in order for it to sit evenly on the ground.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for a makeup artist, it has enough room for all your makeup needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a match for the person who likes original style!</li>
            <li>Its sleek and sophisticated and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I love this case it rolls so easily, it is easy to take along.</li>
            <li>Shany is a great company in my own personal experience</li>
            <li>The compartments allow for you to keep the most important things on top and the extras or spares in the bottom.</li>
            <li>Looks very nice for a new makeup artist to try and give some use to</li>
            <li>Rolls along with handle for easy transportation.  </li>
            <li>but if you see me out with it you&#x27;d think im a professional which i enjoy very much lol.</li>
            <li>I have also found that I can easily store my makeup in here instead of having it thrown everywhere.</li>
            <li>makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>This black rolling makeup case is the perfect gift for any makeup artist.</li>
            <li>After that, it was fine.     </li>
            <li>Took it out of town with me for 2 weeks and worked perfectly for a small makeup artist. :)</li>
            <li>The large space in the bottom is great for large containers or bulky things like bags of sponges &amp; cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slimming profile makes it perfect to set in your little compact vehicle or traveling across the globe</li>
            <li>It was dented and the material is cheap.  </li>
            <li>The wheels roll smoothly and do not get stuck either.  </li>
            <li>It just has that cheap feel to it</li>
            <li>its great obviously to take on the go.</li>
            <li>It is just fabulous for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Lots of storage space inside to fit all my tools.</li>
            <li>It is light weigh</li>
            <li>VERY DURABLE AND STURDY!!!</li>
            <li>Much like the zebra one, it&#x27;s perfect for freelance makeup artists who may not want such a bold print on their trolley.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, helps you stay really organized, and is so easy to carry around!</li>
            <li>I love all of the little compartments, it comes in handy when you have OCD!</li>
            <li>The removable top section is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I love this rolling case so much fits everything and anything in it.</li>
            <li>AND INSTEAD THE TOP 3 TRAYS SEPARATE AND ARE VERY STURDY.  </li>
            <li>I really want another one so that I can add more to it</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for some type of storage or traveling set for personal use, this is probably not your best option, but they do seperate and you can use them for various things.</li>
            <li>Not much to say with that kind of title!</li>
            <li>MY NEW TRAIN CASE ALSO HAS MORE ROOM.</li>
            <li>but I thought it would last more than 35 days!  </li>
            <li>So stylish and sleek, I look like a professional!</li>
            <li>It was over-all very cheaply made, the draws on slides slid completely apart without stopping, the lining was coming unattached from the walls</li>
            <li>Worth its weight in gold</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t even worth $10, item fell apart as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li>This case is super sturdy and makes anyone look like a true professional!!</li>
            <li>but if you just need something small for storage its a great item.</li>
            <li>It is very sleek and full of make-up.</li>
            <li>The case looked used and years old, which is upsetting because it was advertised as a really nice, practical train case for professional use.</li>
            <li>I hope the seller looks into this issue because I&#x27;m betting most people who buy this aren&#x27;t comfortable with making extensive repairs to their new case.</li>
            <li>Is very roomy, though, and it is very easy to organize items in the different sections.  </li>
            <li>I HAD TO CARRY THIS HUGE BOX, NOT HEAVY</li>
            <li>The lock broke off after the first time I traveled with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comfortable purchasing \\&quot;off-brand\\&quot; items--but for $150 this was completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>I am always doing friends and family members&#x27; makeup, and this makes transporting my makeup so much easier!</li>
            <li>A very professional-looking case!</li>
            <li>I bought a case similar to this in Iraq for $5, but the Iraqi case is more sturdy.</li>
            <li>Most likely not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty positive that the people who received these damaged were a fluke and not all of them come that way.</li>
            <li>however, When I received the product, opened it, one of the roller fell apart, I thought it might need to be assembled, however, it is not the case, the roller really broke on the first day I received, and also when I opened the case, one of the container inside broke.</li>
            <li>Linings are not attached to interior walls/trays, and main tray does not slide!  </li>
            <li>The exterior was abrasively scratched (or ruined) in certain places, and the latches had a very \\&quot;shaky\\&quot; lock to them.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s exactly what my entrepreneurial wife needed for her business!  </li>
            <li>Latches are secure, extra lid included.  </li>
            <li>The very bottom of the case was broke.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care about the siding though.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this train case for makeup!</li>
            <li>It is a Seya brand and absolutely qualify</li>
            <li>While the case is a good size and has all the right compartments, the build quality is surprisingly poor.  </li>
            <li>Love the classic black color, looks clean and professional.</li>
            <li>I would be very careful with it as it isn&#x27;t a safe.</li>
            <li>Its kind of small if your a working artist</li>
            <li>I love that its black and can go with anything.</li>
            <li>The design and quality of manufacturing are both decent.</li>
            <li>I should have paid a little more for a sturdier product.</li>
            <li>But after the lock fell off while I wheeled it through the airport, I was COMPLETELY humiliated and very upset with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>The top and bottom piece does not fit correctly.</li>
            <li>, they would go above and beyond to make it right.</li>
            <li>First, this is a decent case overall.</li>
            <li>I have it for about 3 years and still looks like new.</li>
            <li>I am a new make up artists</li>
            <li>Looks very professional &amp; gives the impression of sanitation and organization.  </li>
            <li>makes me look very professional even though im</li>
            <li>It is very professional and and sleek.</li>
            <li>This looks extremely professional!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was to be my second pro rolling box as my first one was over-full.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone who does on-location makeup or needs something large to store products.</li>
            <li>As the pictures clearly show that the case should have some type of logo...</li>
            <li>Sleek professional looking trolley.  </li>
            <li>It is no where professional.</li>
            <li>Needed a professional way of transporting airbrush equipment and makeup, so I ordered this case from Shany via Amazon.</li>
            <li>Bringing this anywhere makes it look like you&#x27;re a professional.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as much as I used to because it is such a hassel at the airports anymore.  </li>
            <li>I definately think this case would be a must have for the budding makeup artist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly doing someones makeup on scene and having this portable item make my job so much easier.</li>
            <li>The aluminum frame is flimsy, the locks poorly designed, and the side nothing more than easily damage material not nearly durable enough for a rolling case.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, roomy yet fits right in my small car, adjustable compartments, this case is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this few days ago, they were really helpful, shipped it on time, and respond back to me quickly about my concern.</li>
            <li>Wow this jet black professional rolling make up case really does look PRO!</li>
            <li>I went back there and got my new one from there instead.</li>
            <li>Extremely cheap and a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li>After gentle and limited use (2 days a week)</li>
            <li>I purchased this case in January, 2012 and was extremely please with the design for the first six weeks.</li>
            <li>I just super glued the sides back down.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit in your car or trunk and will hold just about anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this case definitely had promise, the build quality just isn&#x27;t what it should be for a professional makeup case.</li>
            <li>The case arrived with some of the felt peeling off the insides and the drawers in the top section came broken.  </li>
            <li>The internal lining of the makeup case was damaged (scars and deep dents), the dividers were coming apart (as they are cheaply glued) and the tray that slides in the upper half of the makeup tower barely moved at all.</li>
            <li>One major thing I wanted was big compartments and this rolling case has it.</li>
            <li>It has now been a little over six months of the same gentle, and limited use and the whole entire bottom trunk is falling apart.</li>
            <li>obviously this product failed my expectation completely, hopefully they can do better job next time.</li>

            <li> Its sleek and sophisticated and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I love this case it rolls so easily, it is easy to take along.</li>
            <li> Shany is a great company in my own personal experience</li>
            <li> The compartments allow for you to keep the most important things on top and the extras or spares in the bottom.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice for a new makeup artist to try and give some use to</li>
            <li> Rolls along with handle for easy transportation.  </li>
            <li> but if you see me out with it you&#x27;d think im a professional which i enjoy very much lol.</li>
            <li> I have also found that I can easily store my makeup in here instead of having it thrown everywhere.</li>
            <li> makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> This black rolling makeup case is the perfect gift for any makeup artist.</li>
            <li> After that, it was fine.     </li>
            <li> Took it out of town with me for 2 weeks and worked perfectly for a small makeup artist. :)</li>
            <li> The large space in the bottom is great for large containers or bulky things like bags of sponges &amp; cotton balls.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slimming profile makes it perfect to set in your little compact vehicle or traveling across the globe</li>
            <li> It was dented and the material is cheap.  </li>
            <li> The wheels roll smoothly and do not get stuck either.  </li>
            <li> It just has that cheap feel to it</li>
            <li> its great obviously to take on the go.</li>
            <li> It is just fabulous for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Lots of storage space inside to fit all my tools.</li>
            <li> It is light weigh</li>
            <li> VERY DURABLE AND STURDY!!!</li>
            <li> Much like the zebra one, it&#x27;s perfect for freelance makeup artists who may not want such a bold print on their trolley.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, helps you stay really organized, and is so easy to carry around!</li>
            <li> I love all of the little compartments, it comes in handy when you have OCD!</li>
            <li> The removable top section is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I love this rolling case so much fits everything and anything in it.</li>
            <li> AND INSTEAD THE TOP 3 TRAYS SEPARATE AND ARE VERY STURDY.  </li>
            <li> I really want another one so that I can add more to it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for some type of storage or traveling set for personal use, this is probably not your best option, but they do seperate and you can use them for various things.</li>
            <li> Not much to say with that kind of title!</li>
            <li> MY NEW TRAIN CASE ALSO HAS MORE ROOM.</li>
            <li> but I thought it would last more than 35 days!  </li>
            <li> So stylish and sleek, I look like a professional!</li>
            <li> It was over-all very cheaply made, the draws on slides slid completely apart without stopping, the lining was coming unattached from the walls</li>
            <li> Worth its weight in gold</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even worth $10, item fell apart as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li> This case is super sturdy and makes anyone look like a true professional!!</li>
            <li> but if you just need something small for storage its a great item.</li>
            <li> It is very sleek and full of make-up.</li>
            <li> The case looked used and years old, which is upsetting because it was advertised as a really nice, practical train case for professional use.</li>
            <li> I hope the seller looks into this issue because I&#x27;m betting most people who buy this aren&#x27;t comfortable with making extensive repairs to their new case.</li>
            <li> Is very roomy, though, and it is very easy to organize items in the different sections.  </li>
            <li> I HAD TO CARRY THIS HUGE BOX, NOT HEAVY</li>
            <li> The lock broke off after the first time I traveled with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comfortable purchasing \\&quot;off-brand\\&quot; items--but for $150 this was completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I am always doing friends and family members&#x27; makeup, and this makes transporting my makeup so much easier!</li>
            <li> A very professional-looking case!</li>
            <li> I bought a case similar to this in Iraq for $5, but the Iraqi case is more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Most likely not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive that the people who received these damaged were a fluke and not all of them come that way.</li>
            <li> however, When I received the product, opened it, one of the roller fell apart, I thought it might need to be assembled, however, it is not the case, the roller really broke on the first day I received, and also when I opened the case, one of the container inside broke.</li>
            <li> Linings are not attached to interior walls/trays, and main tray does not slide!  </li>
            <li> The exterior was abrasively scratched (or ruined) in certain places, and the latches had a very \\&quot;shaky\\&quot; lock to them.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s exactly what my entrepreneurial wife needed for her business!  </li>
            <li> Latches are secure, extra lid included.  </li>
            <li> The very bottom of the case was broke.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care about the siding though.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this train case for makeup!</li>
            <li> It is a Seya brand and absolutely qualify</li>
            <li> While the case is a good size and has all the right compartments, the build quality is surprisingly poor.  </li>
            <li> Love the classic black color, looks clean and professional.</li>
            <li> I would be very careful with it as it isn&#x27;t a safe.</li>
            <li> Its kind of small if your a working artist</li>
            <li> I love that its black and can go with anything.</li>
            <li> The design and quality of manufacturing are both decent.</li>
            <li> I should have paid a little more for a sturdier product.</li>
            <li> But after the lock fell off while I wheeled it through the airport, I was COMPLETELY humiliated and very upset with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> The top and bottom piece does not fit correctly.</li>
            <li> , they would go above and beyond to make it right.</li>
            <li> First, this is a decent case overall.</li>
            <li> I have it for about 3 years and still looks like new.</li>
            <li> I am a new make up artists</li>
            <li> Looks very professional &amp; gives the impression of sanitation and organization.  </li>
            <li> makes me look very professional even though im</li>
            <li> It is very professional and and sleek.</li>
            <li> This looks extremely professional!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was to be my second pro rolling box as my first one was over-full.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone who does on-location makeup or needs something large to store products.</li>
            <li> As the pictures clearly show that the case should have some type of logo...</li>
            <li> Sleek professional looking trolley.  </li>
            <li> It is no where professional.</li>
            <li> Needed a professional way of transporting airbrush equipment and makeup, so I ordered this case from Shany via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bringing this anywhere makes it look like you&#x27;re a professional.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as much as I used to because it is such a hassel at the airports anymore.  </li>
            <li> I definately think this case would be a must have for the budding makeup artist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly doing someones makeup on scene and having this portable item make my job so much easier.</li>
            <li> The aluminum frame is flimsy, the locks poorly designed, and the side nothing more than easily damage material not nearly durable enough for a rolling case.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, roomy yet fits right in my small car, adjustable compartments, this case is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this few days ago, they were really helpful, shipped it on time, and respond back to me quickly about my concern.</li>
            <li> Wow this jet black professional rolling make up case really does look PRO!</li>
            <li> I went back there and got my new one from there instead.</li>
            <li> Extremely cheap and a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> After gentle and limited use (2 days a week)</li>
            <li> I purchased this case in January, 2012 and was extremely please with the design for the first six weeks.</li>
            <li> I just super glued the sides back down.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit in your car or trunk and will hold just about anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this case definitely had promise, the build quality just isn&#x27;t what it should be for a professional makeup case.</li>
            <li> The case arrived with some of the felt peeling off the insides and the drawers in the top section came broken.  </li>
            <li> The internal lining of the makeup case was damaged (scars and deep dents), the dividers were coming apart (as they are cheaply glued) and the tray that slides in the upper half of the makeup tower barely moved at all.</li>
            <li> One major thing I wanted was big compartments and this rolling case has it.</li>
            <li> It has now been a little over six months of the same gentle, and limited use and the whole entire bottom trunk is falling apart.</li>
            <li> obviously this product failed my expectation completely, hopefully they can do better job next time.</li>
            <li> You can store everything neatly and organize small and large products.</li>

            <li> I am a high-volume professional makeup artist and I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead arriving on location for a job with this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> when you&#x27;re on location, or when you just leave for a long trips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a traveling makeup artist and was appalled at how this could actially pass as a good product.</li>
            <li> It was large, all black and extremely heavy, the wheels were NOT recessed at all.  </li>
            <li> The case is so poorly made, extremely cheap and not supportive enough for all my makeup.</li>
            <li> This came broken and is very generically made!  </li>
            <li> and it breaks down into smaller cases</li>
            <li> I gave this item 3 stars because I don&#x27;t know how typical these shipping problems are or how likely you may be to have damage to your case when it arrives.</li>
            <li> This is a plain jet black case and looks very professional if you are doing makeup jobs or on the go.</li>
            <li> You could certainly make a worse choice.    </li>
            <li> I say that because the inner manufacturer&#x27;s box had heavy damage, but the outer Amazon box was pristine.</li>
            <li> Item is to bulky and not very portable.</li>
            <li> All other reviews aside.</li>
            <li> The bottom is lose, the lining of the inside is falling off, and it looks extremely tacky and unprofessional.</li>
            <li> Also is less sturdy and stable than we had expected it would be.  </li>
            <li> I unfortunately am returning my broken case for a refund and am going to have to pay more for a quality product.</li>
            <li> NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> I loved the way the item looked when I recivedit until I looked inside and noticed how horribly made it was.</li>
            <li> It seems a little pricey, but let me tell you you won&#x27;t find a cheaper 3 piece set.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR $$$$</li>
            <li> The trays weren&#x27;t even bubble wrapped (not to mention the mirror missing as well).</li>
            <li> The compartments were stiff.</li>
            <li> the weight is actually 25 lbs which makes it difficult to move about.</li>
            <li> Needless to say this train case is on its way back to the hell from whence it came.</li>
            <li> Usually you get what you pay for, but in this case you just get ripped off.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this was a fluke or not.</li>
            <li> One side wouldn&#x27;t slide to expose the bottom section of the case and the other side was completely broken off the plastic rails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent twice this amount on a smaller version from a different company and the quality was terrible.</li>
            <li> It has a compartment for eyerthing a makeup fanatic would need.</li>
            <li> This case came broken and heavily damaged in the mail.  </li>
            <li> its so sleek and sheek, and it doesnt ever look dirty or messy inside since its dark.</li>
            <li> lining of case was completely loose and coming off, tracks that control the pull out trays was broken (probably because it&#x27;s made of thin, brittle plastic), pull up trays would not come out because the tracks were broken.</li>
            <li> I dont know if mine is a bootleg, Im not sure.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you are a serious make up artist.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with a broken latch.  </li>
            <li> It is poorly made and not durable at all.</li>
            <li> I received the case today and it was broken when I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li> I received as a Christmas gift and unfortunately surpassed the time frame to return.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Foam was glued very sloppy.</li>
            <li> This makeup  case is so disappointing.  </li>
            <li> THe keys are dirty as well as the bottom piece insides.</li>
            <li> No one should let one person&#x27;s bad experience deter them from a purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife was greatly disappointed with this case.  </li>
            <li> I was completely disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have it for about 3 years and still looks like new. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> im in love with this, i had a coupon too n got a barg  ain, quality is great,will buy more from shany</li>
            <li> Its kind of small if your a working artist but if you just need something small for storage its a great item.</li>
            <li> Looks very professional &amp; gives the impression of sanitation and organization.  Sturdy, roomy yet fits right in my small car, adjustable compartments, this case is exactly what I was looking for.  The large space in the bottom is great for large containers or bulky things like bags of sponges &amp; cotton balls.  Latches are secure, extra lid included.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who does on-location makeup or needs something large to store products.</li>
            <li> The case came in an amazon box without any type of protection.  It was dented and the material is cheap.  The inside of my rolling case was peeling, flimsy and scratched.  I bought another rolling case from Seya and did a comparison.  Seya is sturdy and the quality just feels so much better.  Note: this case does not come with a top cover for your bottom rolling case.</li>
            <li> Sleek professional looking trolley.  Rolls along with handle for easy transportation.  Drawers lock and has enough room to stow all products.</li>
            <li> Seems really nice and spacious. I love that its black and can go with anything. Has tons of compartments to store makeup or nail supplies depending on what you do or want to use this case for.Looks very nice for a new makeup artist to try and give some use to so I&#x27;d have to say try it, Could be a great first makeup case.</li>
            <li> This makeup  case is so disappointing.  I received as a Christmas gift and unfortunately surpassed the time frame to return. I will keep but I would never purchase another item from this company. The case is so poorly made, extremely cheap and not supportive enough for all my makeup. The track for draw came cracked so I can&#x27;t slide back and forth. PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR $$$$</li>
            <li> This black rolling makeup case is the perfect gift for any makeup artist. Its sleek and sophisticated and easy to maneuver. The wheels roll smoothly and do not get stuck either.  One major thing I wanted was big compartments and this rolling case has it. You can store everything neatly and organize small and large products. Great for traveling and if you don&#x27;t want to roll everything you can just pop off the top and use the train case.</li>
            <li> First, this is a decent case overall. The design and quality of manufacturing are both decent. It&#x27;s not the Rolls Royce of cases, but it looks good, is light weight, and gets the job done. You could certainly make a worse choice.    The problem is that it arrived looking like it was shipped through a war zone on its way to the seller. I say that because the inner manufacturer&#x27;s box had heavy damage, but the outer Amazon box was pristine. I had to make repairs to the item before it was usable. This involved replacing rivets and also touching up cosmetic damage. After that, it was fine.     I gave this item 3 stars because I don&#x27;t know how typical these shipping problems are or how likely you may be to have damage to your case when it arrives. If it had arrived in pristine condition, I would have given it 4 stars. It still requires some babying to get the parts back together. The locks and telescoping handle both feel somewhat flimsy.     I hope the seller looks into this issue because I&#x27;m betting most people who buy this aren&#x27;t comfortable with making extensive repairs to their new case.</li>
            <li> AWFUL quality. lining of case was completely loose and coming off, tracks that control the pull out trays was broken (probably because it&#x27;s made of thin, brittle plastic), pull up trays would not come out because the tracks were broken. I am a high-volume professional makeup artist and I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead arriving on location for a job with this piece of garbage. If a rating of \\&quot;zero stars\\&quot; existed, I wouldn&#x27;t have even given this item one star.</li>
            <li> NOT worth the money. As the pictures clearly show that the case should have some type of logo...My case did not.     The lining of the inside&#x27;s were coming off. The very bottom of the case was broke. The top and bottom piece does not fit correctly. THe keys are dirty as well as the bottom piece insides. I will post pics if I can figure it out...    I bought the for my girlfriend for her birthday and I cant give her this. It is no where professional. I dont know if mine is a bootleg, Im not sure. It just has that cheap feel to it</li>
            <li> Product arrived with a broken latch.  Also is less sturdy and stable than we had expected it would be.  Is very roomy, though, and it is very easy to organize items in the different sections.  The removable top section is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I do nails on the side and I have this case and it is truly amazing!! It holds everything but the kitchen sink I do In home appointments so for me this is money on wheels!! Worth its weight in gold dont pass It up get yours today!![[ASIN:B003QA8XFK Shany Jet Black Professional Rolling Makeup Case Premium Collection, Slim Design, 12 Pounds]]</li>
            <li> Not much to say with that kind of title! I love this rolling case so much fits everything and anything in it. Awesome for anyone including us Makeup artists!</li>
            <li> Much like the zebra one, it&#x27;s perfect for freelance makeup artists who may not want such a bold print on their trolley.</li>
            <li> Ok. All other reviews aside. Let&#x27;s look at this. I&#x27;m pretty positive that the people who received these damaged were a fluke and not all of them come that way. Shany is a great company in my own personal experience and I feel confident that had I received one of these damaged, they would go above and beyond to make it right. No one should let one person&#x27;s bad experience deter them from a purchase. Especially not on a product this great! This is my go to case when I have to do a wedding, or any type of make-up function on location. I spent twice this amount on a smaller version from a different company and the quality was terrible. If you&#x27;re looking for some type of storage or traveling set for personal use, this is probably not your best option, but they do seperate and you can use them for various things. Overall, the storage capacity is amazing, the quality and condition is beautiful and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> This case is gorgeous, and a must have for the price. This is a plain jet black case and looks very professional if you are doing makeup jobs or on the go. Every beginner must have this to travel. Many compartments for lots of things!</li>
            <li> If you have a gig coming up this is perfect for storage and travel! It&#x27;s a match for the person who likes original style! It seems a little pricey, but let me tell you you won&#x27;t find a cheaper 3 piece set. It&#x27;s slimming profile makes it perfect to set in your little compact vehicle or traveling across the globe</li>
            <li> I HAD TO RETURN IT CAUSE TO 2 SLIDING TRAYS ON THE TOP WOULD NOT STAY ON THE TRACK AND I COULD NOT SEE PAYING $150.00 FOR SOMETHING THAT DID NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY....I PAID $20.00 MORE AND GOT ONE WITHOUT THE TRAY SLIDE AND INSTEAD THE TOP 3 TRAYS SEPARATE AND ARE VERY STURDY.  I HAD TO CARRY THIS HUGE BOX, NOT HEAVY THOUGH, BACK TO THE POST OFFICE SO I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING THIS CAUSE OF THE TOP 2 SLIDING TRAYS.  MY NEW TRAIN CASE ALSO HAS MORE ROOM.</li>
            <li> My wife was greatly disappointed with this case.  While the case is a good size and has all the right compartments, the build quality is surprisingly poor.  The case arrived with some of the felt peeling off the insides and the drawers in the top section came broken.  One side wouldn&#x27;t slide to expose the bottom section of the case and the other side was completely broken off the plastic rails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this case definitely had promise, the build quality just isn&#x27;t what it should be for a professional makeup case.</li>
            <li> What I received was not even close to this description. It was large, all black and extremely heavy, the wheels were NOT recessed at all.  Amazon needs to cross-check and verify what is being sent out.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice makeup case. I would be very careful with it as it isn&#x27;t a safe. I love all of the little compartments, it comes in handy when you have OCD!</li>
            <li> the weight is actually 25 lbs which makes it difficult to move about. Also I incurred greater shipping charges than I thought. Item is to bulky and not very portable.</li>
            <li> Love the look and space of this case but I thought it would last more than 35 days!  The lock broke off after the first time I traveled with it. Also, the siding on the inside started to peel off.   I didn&#x27;t really care about the siding though. I just super glued the sides back down. But after the lock fell off while I wheeled it through the airport, I was COMPLETELY humiliated and very upset with this purchase.  I should have paid a little more for a sturdier product.</li>
            <li> Needed a professional way of transporting airbrush equipment and makeup, so I ordered this case from Shany via Amazon. Opened the box to find the outer frame dented, the side clasp ripped out, and the tray&#x27;s foam dividers separating from the&#x27; particle board it was glued to. The case looked used and years old, which is upsetting because it was advertised as a really nice, practical train case for professional use.The trays weren&#x27;t even bubble wrapped (not to mention the mirror missing as well). Needless to say this train case is on its way back to the hell from whence it came.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews and collective stars this item has \\&quot;earned\\&quot; I assumed it would be a safe purchase. Unfortunately, I was wrong.  When the package arrived, I noticed that the box was in near perfect condition. \\&quot;Good news,\\&quot; I thought...and then I unpacked the case. The exterior was abrasively scratched (or ruined) in certain places, and the latches had a very \\&quot;shaky\\&quot; lock to them. The internal lining of the makeup case was damaged (scars and deep dents), the dividers were coming apart (as they are cheaply glued) and the tray that slides in the upper half of the makeup tower barely moved at all. I&#x27;m comfortable purchasing \\&quot;off-brand\\&quot; items--but for $150 this was completely unacceptable. I have filed for a return and look forward to purchasing another case...perhaps in person this time.</li>
            <li> This case came broken and heavily damaged in the mail.  It looked like it was damaged before amazon even got it.  It is poorly made and not durable at all.</li>
            <li> Very roomy and for even though  the price, its wonderful! makes me look very professional even though im only 16!</li>
            <li> THIS IS PERFECT FOR A MAKEUP ARTIST!! VERY DURABLE AND STURDY!!! GREAT FOR TRAVELING...MAKEUP WILL BE WELL PROTECTED IN THIS CASE..I LOVE THE DETACHABLE CASE AS WELL!!</li>
            <li> These are great for a make up artist that is always on the go and travling as you have a varity of portable caes with wheels and holds up to 12 pounds of make up, That is alot of make up products!</li>
            <li> Bringing this anywhere makes it look like you&#x27;re a professional. It also gives people the impression of you being organize and neat thus people trusting you more with the makeup.</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing! So great for traveling makeup artist who need all of their products on the go! Perfect fit for all makeup products for all makeup lovers!</li>
            <li> The exterior of the case is nice, though I think it will show scratches.  Interior of case is horrible.  Linings are not attached to interior walls/trays, and main tray does not slide!  The exterior may give an impression of professionalism, but the interior is CHEAP!</li>
            <li> This case appears to be a durable one but in fact is a flimsy piece of junk not designed for the job it is made for.  The aluminum frame is flimsy, the locks poorly designed, and the side nothing more than easily damage material not nearly durable enough for a rolling case.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s exactly what my entrepreneurial wife needed for her business!  Looks great, works great, very multifunctional. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This looks extremely professional! It&#x27;s light weight, helps you stay really organized, and is so easy to carry around! Love it!</li>
            <li> this makeup case looks awsome. It has a compartment for eyerthing a makeup fanatic would need. I would reccomend this case for all makeup lovers. It is small enough to fit in your car or trunk and will hold just about anything.</li>
            <li> Update 10/1/12 I absolutely LOVE this! It is so helpful to keep all my make up organized and nice and neat. I really want another one so that I can add more to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this for traveling as I&#x27;m not a MUA so I don&#x27;t need to take everything with me all the time. What I do use it for is storage, I keep it next to my vanity with all my make up in it. It fits everything and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my nephews getting into it. Great buy!</li>
            <li> this rolling makeup case is so amazing! its great obviously to take on the go. when you&#x27;re on location, or when you just leave for a long trips. its a must have for suree!</li>
            <li> I received the case today and it was broken when I took it out of the box. One of the wheels was pushed all the way through the bottom which looks like covered cardboard. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I really liked the size and layout of the case. If it were made of stronger materials I would have loved it. I unfortunately am returning my broken case for a refund and am going to have to pay more for a quality product.</li>
            <li> This make-up case is convenient because of the weels.It is very sleek and full of make-up.All that and only 12 pounds.Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I loved the way the item looked when I recivedit until I looked inside and noticed how horribly made it was. Foam was glued very sloppy. The lining is falling apart and the tracks for the drawers broke. Extremely cheap and a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I ordered this few days ago, they were really helpful, shipped it on time, and respond back to me quickly about my concern. however, When I received the product, opened it, one of the roller fell apart, I thought it might need to be assembled, however, it is not the case, the roller really broke on the first day I received, and also when I opened the case, one of the container inside broke. I didnt expect I would get any supreme product, I just want to get some daily use makeup case. obviously this product failed my expectation completely, hopefully they can do better job next time.</li>
            <li> This came broken and is very generically made!  It smelled as if it was in moth balls for years.  DO NOT GET THIS!!  I&#x27;m a traveling makeup artist and was appalled at how this could actially pass as a good product.</li>
            <li> My Husband gave me one of these cases for Christmas.  I love it.  It is just fabulous for traveling.  I can carry all of my cosmetics and bath items in the case along with extras you just want to have along.  I don&#x27;t use it as much as I used to because it is such a hassel at the airports anymore.  If I am just going on a weekend or 2-3 day trip I will take it and substitute it for one of my suit cases. I&#x27;ll carry my lingerie and shoes in the bigger lower section. I love this case it rolls so easily, it is easy to take along. As a matter of fact it rolls easier than my suitcase. I just love the way I can organize everything.  I definately think this case would be a must have for the budding makeup artist. I definatly recommend this case to evertone. Linda W.</li>
            <li> Love the classic black color, looks clean and professional. Lots of storage space inside to fit all my tools. Love the convenience of the rolling wheels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly doing someones makeup on scene and having this portable item make my job so much easier. never have to have multiple bag again. Before this product my life was such a headache and now don&#x27;t my job is a breeze!</li>
            <li> its a bargin, great quality and it does the job. i love love love the color. its so sleek and sheek, and it doesnt ever look dirty or messy inside since its dark. im still in beauty school but if you see me out with it you&#x27;d think im a professional which i enjoy very much lol.</li>
            <li> This is the highest priced item that I have ever purchased when dealing with makeup - but I&#x27;m glad I did ! I am always doing friends and family members&#x27; makeup, and this makes transporting my makeup so much easier! So stylish and sleek, I look like a professional! I have also found that I can easily store my makeup in here instead of having it thrown everywhere. This is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I am a new make up artists and I freelanced and I have my own clientele. My clients love it and they even purchased it</li>
            <li> This is a great case! I bring it to every on-site gig. It has the room to store/organize everything. Great value!</li>
            <li> This case is super sturdy and makes anyone look like a true professional!! The quality is amazing and is perfect for traveling. I would def recommend this to anyone looking for a travel friendly case!!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the case has a shiny sealant on the surface of the makeup case to protect it hopefully from scratches so it is durable. The locks &amp; keys are great also. A very professional-looking case!</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this train case for makeup! it is perfect for traveling and very sleek! it has wheel so very easy to roll around! perfect for a makeup artist on the go like myself or if you are just looking for a way to store yur makeup!</li>
            <li> I received it and sent it back the next day. It was over-all very cheaply made, the draws on slides slid completely apart without stopping, the lining was coming unattached from the walls all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was to be my second pro rolling box as my first one was over-full.  I&#x27;d purchased my wonderful one from Yazmo and after this one from Amazon was so horrible I went back there and got my new one from there instead. It is a Seya brand and absolutely qualify</li>
            <li> I LOVE this case. It is very professional and and sleek. Took it out of town with me for 2 weeks and worked perfectly for a small makeup artist. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this case in January, 2012 and was extremely please with the design for the first six weeks. After gentle and limited use (2 days a week) one of the wheels broke after only six weeks. I really enjoyed the design and decided that I would continue using it, propping the unit on a box in order for it to sit evenly on the ground. It has now been a little over six months of the same gentle, and limited use and the whole entire bottom trunk is falling apart. The bottom is lose, the lining of the inside is falling off, and it looks extremely tacky and unprofessional. I will not be ordering this case again.</li>
            <li> Wow this jet black professional rolling make up case really does look PRO! I think its at a great price</li>
            <li> This thing is a P.O.S. and had I been in the country when it arrived... I would have returned it out of the box. I bought a case similar to this in Iraq for $5, but the Iraqi case is more sturdy. I would be embarrassed to use this thing at home, never mind using it with professionals. Usually you get what you pay for, but in this case you just get ripped off.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this was a fluke or not. Most likely not. My case came damaged. The inside lining was peeling. The case was dented. The compartments were stiff. it would not align properly when locking. Do not buy if you are a serious make up artist.</li>
            <li> Best space available for when u have very busy days!! U can carry everything u need. The compartments allow for you to keep the most important things on top and the extras or spares in the bottom. Sleek color, not bulky, lightweight!!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for a makeup artist, it has enough room for all your makeup needs. It is light weigh and it breaks down into smaller cases makes it easy to travel with. It also has wheels and a handle and all make up art know how nice that feature is.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even worth $10, item fell apart as soon as it arrived. It is made out of cheap plastic, cardboard separators &amp; poorly glued foam. I was completely disappointed.</li>
