            <li> Other removers are either too oily or too dry or a lot of rubbing is required.  </li>
            <li> but it irritates my eyes and leaves a film that over time causes me to develop blepharitis which I&#x27;ve gotten a few times from these types of cream removers.</li>
            <li> Love this for removing annoying eye make up with out irritating eyes!</li>
            <li> Even if I ordered through an Avon representative I would still have to pay shipping which stinks.  </li>

I thought it was gentle but it irritates my eyes and leaves a film that over time causes me to develop blepharitis which I&#x27;ve gotten a few times from these types of cream removers.

            <li> Have always like this eye make-up remover lotion.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it much</li>
            <li> The items arrived on time, and they were of good quality.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyemakeup remover I will use.  I received a sample of it years ago and even though I&#x27;ve tried other, much more expensive removers, this is still the best.  Other removers are either too oily or too dry or a lot of rubbing is required.  This is a lotion.  You do not need much product and you do not have to rub a lot to get all the makeup off.  Plus you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye makeup remover. Buy it with confident</li>
