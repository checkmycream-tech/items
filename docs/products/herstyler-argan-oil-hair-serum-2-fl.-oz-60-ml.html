            <li>My hair smells great, has added shine, and combs through easily.</li>
            <li>Thought I would give it a try as I had been using coconut oil (once a month overnight treatments) for my hair that did a pretty good job at keeping my hair softer, scalp more moisturized, etc., but this Argon Oil is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing.</li>

            <li>, I figured that I should start getting the products that go with my irons to see if there can be even more of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I personally love how it smells.  </li>
            <li>I have just purchased 2 more and have used this product for two years.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>

            <li>Best strangers and hair treatment for dry damaged hair I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Very soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome......and works great for curly, wild hair!</li>
            <li>The best product for dry hair!</li>
            <li>This serum works great and keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I was excited that I was able to order this through Amazon.</li>
            <li>i put it on my hair before i blowdry and it makes my hair easy to straighten.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft, manageable, and smell amazing!</li>
            <li>My hair was shiny, looked healthy and had full volume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li>It smells good, very soft, and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>They wanted over 1000% more then it cost here and for the very exact product.</li>
            <li>i love it soo much!!</li>
            <li>Works just like the free sample I was given at the mall in SF.  </li>
            <li>If your thinking of buy this product to keep your hair smooth and feeling silky and soft..do not hesitate...buy it.</li>
            <li>After a while they caught on to my cheap ways of always taking their examples but not buying a bottle of this stuff.</li>
            <li>BUT it is cheap.</li>
            <li>It protects my hair from the heat and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Keeps damaged hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, shiny, and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>Know u will enjoy.</li>
            <li>THE REAL ARGON OIL!!!</li>
            <li>3 or4 pumps of this oil works great with my fine long hair.</li>
            <li>Original packaging.</li>
            <li>I have the original hair serum with aloe &amp; I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so excited because I ordered it</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, but it costs a pretty penny...</li>
            <li>I decided to try the argan oil version of the Herstyler hair serum since i already had the original one that had vitamin e.</li>
            <li>This serum keeps your hair shiny, it makes your curls set better and look better, it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li>This stuff by far is the best for my hair, I color it constantly but not always bleach it everytime.  </li>
            <li>but yes, like many others have mentioned - after a while, it really smells like cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, my hair has never been this soft.</li>
            <li>I have had multiple people tell me that I smell good when I wear this in my hair.</li>
            <li>more reasonably price than at the kiosk.</li>
            <li>I love this product, i have been looking for something like this for years, i have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li>thanks :)</li>
            <li>Love how this makes my hair feel, very sort.</li>
            <li>I do wish it could control my frizz just a tad bit more, but I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only  product that I use now.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the hair soft and shine, also has a nice fragrance on it.</li>
            <li>Cosmetic ingredients should be listed from greatest percentage in the product to the least, and all ingredients disclosed.</li>
            <li>lol anyways it&#x27;s like any other serum.</li>
            <li>This Argon oil is for your hair , it makes it smell incredibly clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair super silky not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I was in the mall here in Hawaii and saw this very exact product.</li>
            <li>I originally bought my first herstyler at the mall and these gels go for $12-$20</li>
            <li>No fake products here!</li>
            <li>Once my hair dries it becomes very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>:) As a serum, I&#x27;d say it does a pretty decent job in taming my impossible-to-tame hair.</li>
            <li>to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my hair feel soft and look shiny.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s still worth it all though.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell as a sample size, but not when I started to use it regularly.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>i love the way it  makes my hair so soft and shiny...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how soft, shiney and vibrant</li>
            <li>It smells nice and does protect my hair from the heat of the flat iron.</li>
            <li>I would  recommend this product,  After using it the first time my hair feel so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>For this price you cant go wrong for such a GREAT product and the woman in my life was so happy about getting it.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and very easy to style with my flat iron.</li>
            <li>also decided to try it in my own hair which is dry and damaged from bleaching.</li>
            <li>Really makes my hair soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>During very humid summer days I noticed my hair was still looking good instead of turning into one huge frizz ball like it usually does.</li>
            <li>pricing is very reasonable and affordable.</li>
            <li>They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li>this serum really really work!</li>
            <li>Dont use too much or your hair will get greasy!</li>
            <li>and it is soft and smooth like silk.  </li>
            <li>I first learned of it from a sample at the Mall of America.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to give it a try!</li>
            <li>Never had a better stylist than my current one, until today!!</li>
            <li>I have tried many and they all feel the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in love with Moroccan oil treatment for the last two years or so, but been wanting to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li>First sample I got was at a business Expo.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair smell so wonderfull, it keeps the shine in all day and i absolutely love it overall.</li>
            <li>This oil makes it feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time trying it and will do again.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordrered</li>
            <li>this was my first time using Argan oil..</li>
            <li>it got delivered fast!</li>
            <li>Got this for my friend and she said it made her hair super soft !!</li>
            <li>Works fantastic for me with my flat iron, love the smell, and makes my straw-like hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I found this at the Holyoke Mall in Massachusetts and I loved the little sample so much</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and shiney!</li>
            <li>I found this on Amazon, saw the positive reviews, and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>Although I usually just straighten my hair (which isn&#x27;t good, I know)</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>It certainly works well with the styler and does not leave a residue on the styler.  </li>
            <li>I am a new customer for life !!</li>
            <li>This serum can be used on either dry or wet hair and is great for controlling hair in humid weather.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really like how it smells too.</li>
            <li>got it fast.</li>
            <li>They want way to much $$$ anyways.</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair really greasy if you do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much on their website.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely undisclosed fragrance added to this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The smell is like bug spray, but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Like it real well.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>It is really true that it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.  </li>
            <li>And there is no way the percentage of Argan oil is greater than the other ingredients listed...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this Hair Serum!</li>
            <li>Be careful putting it near your roots or using more than a quarter of a dime because it will make your hair feel oily.  </li>
            <li>The awesome thing about this serum is that you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday because the serum lasts for at least 2days.</li>
            <li>I recently finished my second bottle and is here to shop for more but inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair heavy but gives it a nice sheen and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I told her the same exact product is available online for any where from 5-20 dollars she said the ingredients were different!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend everyone try this.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER ON THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>The flat iron always makes it silky smooth even without product use, but as I was searching Amazon.com, I ran across this one, which naturally has vitamin E in it AND from what I&#x27;ve heard, Argan oil is like liquid gold for hair.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair soo soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li>but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Not thick oil.</li>
            <li>because my hair is kind of thick</li>
            <li>Love this Argon oil for my wiry, very coarse, curly &amp; dry hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that I found it on Amazon, it&#x27;s significantly less than buying it at the mall!!!  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t live without this one.</li>
            <li>My hair has lots of body and a very natural shine.  </li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews, but I have to for this</li>
            <li>Argon serum is a wonderful product for your hair, but Herstyler, A.K.A. Golden Skin Care is the absolute worst company in terms of customer service.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly the same as the &amp;#34;$90&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I use it before and after drying, leaving my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Seels my ends and still keeps it soft!</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I use this throughout the day, everyday, I am African American and my hair has been damaged by way of perming, this oil makes my hair so soft, shiny, manageable and it smells so good</li>
            <li>Most of the time the new growth doesn&#x27;t revert back to the tight curls...</li>
            <li>It seems OK, but obviously has less Argan oil smell, compare to the sample I got.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>It reduces frizz and makes her hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and is not heavily scented.  </li>
            <li>It has made my hair soft and adds volume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i have no relaxer in my hair, it&#x27;s all natural .</li>
            <li>So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny, it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d wear it as a body oil if I could, but some people who are sensitive to things might not like it.  </li>
            <li>Where have you been all my adult life?</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>Long, thick baby fine curly hair is now tamed, straight with the little bit of flare I love.</li>
            <li>Got the original in a little packet in something I got in the mail.</li>
            <li>I have thin longer blonde hair and this serum is so light I can put it in my hair dry and within a few minutes my ends are smooth and my hair feels soft and I&#x27;m able to run my fingers threw it all day and its still not greasy.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair on days when I don&#x27;t even straighten it -- it has an odd, sweet smell, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I finally decided to get some of the Herstyler serum mainly to help with flyaways.  </li>
            <li>I make soaps and I have a small bottle of straight Argan oil right here.</li>
            <li>6 year old has thick, long curly hair and it knots up very easily.</li>
            <li>Compared to the one with just vitamin e, the original Herstyler hair serum actually kept my hair soft for about a week and even a little longer.</li>
            <li>She has thin, L&#x27;Oreal colored blond hair and it makes her hair very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have to use too much product &amp; go over my hair with the flat iron several times to get it straight.maybe</li>
            <li>Other times, it just lasts a few hours, which is still a great feat for MY hair, which usually has a mind of</li>
            <li>I am African Americna and have natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this product, but i always have to apply it every time i straighten my hair, which is like every other day.</li>
            <li>I apply to my hair prior to flat ironing and it leaves my hair feeling soft, silky and not oily</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t even believe the flat iron would work was was proven wrong when demonstrated own my hair one day</li>
            <li>but I only need a little to cover my whole hair.</li>
            <li>I thought that 6 dollars was too much for the other stuff I can get anywhere, but I spent 20 dollars as a whole to get it and get it sent to me because there is no super saver shipping for this item...</li>

            <li> I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft, manageable, and smell amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair was shiny, looked healthy and had full volume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li> It smells good, very soft, and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> They wanted over 1000% more then it cost here and for the very exact product.</li>
            <li> i love it soo much!!</li>
            <li> Works just like the free sample I was given at the mall in SF.  </li>
            <li> If your thinking of buy this product to keep your hair smooth and feeling silky and soft..do not hesitate...buy it.</li>
            <li> After a while they caught on to my cheap ways of always taking their examples but not buying a bottle of this stuff.</li>
            <li> BUT it is cheap.</li>
            <li> It protects my hair from the heat and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Keeps damaged hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, shiny, and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> Know u will enjoy.</li>
            <li> THE REAL ARGON OIL!!!</li>
            <li> 3 or4 pumps of this oil works great with my fine long hair.</li>
            <li> Original packaging.</li>
            <li> I have the original hair serum with aloe &amp; I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so excited because I ordered it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but it costs a pretty penny...</li>
            <li> I decided to try the argan oil version of the Herstyler hair serum since i already had the original one that had vitamin e.</li>
            <li> This serum keeps your hair shiny, it makes your curls set better and look better, it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li> This stuff by far is the best for my hair, I color it constantly but not always bleach it everytime.  </li>
            <li> but yes, like many others have mentioned - after a while, it really smells like cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, my hair has never been this soft.</li>
            <li> I have had multiple people tell me that I smell good when I wear this in my hair.</li>
            <li> more reasonably price than at the kiosk.</li>
            <li> I love this product, i have been looking for something like this for years, i have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li> thanks :)</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my hair feel, very sort.</li>
            <li> I do wish it could control my frizz just a tad bit more, but I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only  product that I use now.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the hair soft and shine, also has a nice fragrance on it.</li>
            <li> Cosmetic ingredients should be listed from greatest percentage in the product to the least, and all ingredients disclosed.</li>
            <li> lol anyways it&#x27;s like any other serum.</li>
            <li> This Argon oil is for your hair , it makes it smell incredibly clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair super silky not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I was in the mall here in Hawaii and saw this very exact product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought my first herstyler at the mall and these gels go for $12-$20</li>
            <li> No fake products here!</li>
            <li> Once my hair dries it becomes very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> :) As a serum, I&#x27;d say it does a pretty decent job in taming my impossible-to-tame hair.</li>
            <li> to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair feel soft and look shiny.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s still worth it all though.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell as a sample size, but not when I started to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> i love the way it  makes my hair so soft and shiny...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how soft, shiney and vibrant</li>
            <li> It smells nice and does protect my hair from the heat of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I would  recommend this product,  After using it the first time my hair feel so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> For this price you cant go wrong for such a GREAT product and the woman in my life was so happy about getting it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and very easy to style with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> also decided to try it in my own hair which is dry and damaged from bleaching.</li>
            <li> Really makes my hair soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> During very humid summer days I noticed my hair was still looking good instead of turning into one huge frizz ball like it usually does.</li>
            <li> pricing is very reasonable and affordable.</li>
            <li> They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li> this serum really really work!</li>
            <li> Dont use too much or your hair will get greasy!</li>
            <li> and it is soft and smooth like silk.  </li>
            <li> I first learned of it from a sample at the Mall of America.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Never had a better stylist than my current one, until today!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many and they all feel the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with Moroccan oil treatment for the last two years or so, but been wanting to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li> First sample I got was at a business Expo.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair smell so wonderfull, it keeps the shine in all day and i absolutely love it overall.</li>
            <li> This oil makes it feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time trying it and will do again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordrered</li>
            <li> this was my first time using Argan oil..</li>
            <li> it got delivered fast!</li>
            <li> Got this for my friend and she said it made her hair super soft !!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic for me with my flat iron, love the smell, and makes my straw-like hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I found this at the Holyoke Mall in Massachusetts and I loved the little sample so much</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and shiney!</li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon, saw the positive reviews, and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> Although I usually just straighten my hair (which isn&#x27;t good, I know)</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> It certainly works well with the styler and does not leave a residue on the styler.  </li>
            <li> I am a new customer for life !!</li>
            <li> This serum can be used on either dry or wet hair and is great for controlling hair in humid weather.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like how it smells too.</li>
            <li> got it fast.</li>
            <li> They want way to much $$$ anyways.</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It will make your hair really greasy if you do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much on their website.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely undisclosed fragrance added to this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The smell is like bug spray, but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Like it real well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> It is really true that it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.  </li>
            <li> And there is no way the percentage of Argan oil is greater than the other ingredients listed...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this Hair Serum!</li>
            <li> Be careful putting it near your roots or using more than a quarter of a dime because it will make your hair feel oily.  </li>
            <li> The awesome thing about this serum is that you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday because the serum lasts for at least 2days.</li>
            <li> I recently finished my second bottle and is here to shop for more but inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair heavy but gives it a nice sheen and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I told her the same exact product is available online for any where from 5-20 dollars she said the ingredients were different!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend everyone try this.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER ON THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron always makes it silky smooth even without product use, but as I was searching Amazon.com, I ran across this one, which naturally has vitamin E in it AND from what I&#x27;ve heard, Argan oil is like liquid gold for hair.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair soo soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li> but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> Not thick oil.</li>
            <li> because my hair is kind of thick</li>
            <li> Love this Argon oil for my wiry, very coarse, curly &amp; dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that I found it on Amazon, it&#x27;s significantly less than buying it at the mall!!!  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t live without this one.</li>
            <li> My hair has lots of body and a very natural shine.  </li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews, but I have to for this</li>
            <li> Argon serum is a wonderful product for your hair, but Herstyler, A.K.A. Golden Skin Care is the absolute worst company in terms of customer service.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly the same as the &amp;#34;$90&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use it before and after drying, leaving my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Seels my ends and still keeps it soft!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I use this throughout the day, everyday, I am African American and my hair has been damaged by way of perming, this oil makes my hair so soft, shiny, manageable and it smells so good</li>
            <li> Most of the time the new growth doesn&#x27;t revert back to the tight curls...</li>
            <li> It seems OK, but obviously has less Argan oil smell, compare to the sample I got.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> It reduces frizz and makes her hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and is not heavily scented.  </li>
            <li> It has made my hair soft and adds volume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i have no relaxer in my hair, it&#x27;s all natural .</li>
            <li> So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny, it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wear it as a body oil if I could, but some people who are sensitive to things might not like it.  </li>
            <li> Where have you been all my adult life?</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> Long, thick baby fine curly hair is now tamed, straight with the little bit of flare I love.</li>
            <li> Got the original in a little packet in something I got in the mail.</li>
            <li> I have thin longer blonde hair and this serum is so light I can put it in my hair dry and within a few minutes my ends are smooth and my hair feels soft and I&#x27;m able to run my fingers threw it all day and its still not greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair on days when I don&#x27;t even straighten it -- it has an odd, sweet smell, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I finally decided to get some of the Herstyler serum mainly to help with flyaways.  </li>
            <li> I make soaps and I have a small bottle of straight Argan oil right here.</li>
            <li> 6 year old has thick, long curly hair and it knots up very easily.</li>
            <li> Compared to the one with just vitamin e, the original Herstyler hair serum actually kept my hair soft for about a week and even a little longer.</li>
            <li> She has thin, L&#x27;Oreal colored blond hair and it makes her hair very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have to use too much product &amp; go over my hair with the flat iron several times to get it straight.maybe</li>
            <li> Other times, it just lasts a few hours, which is still a great feat for MY hair, which usually has a mind of</li>
            <li> I am African Americna and have natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I really do like this product, but i always have to apply it every time i straighten my hair, which is like every other day.</li>
            <li> I apply to my hair prior to flat ironing and it leaves my hair feeling soft, silky and not oily</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t even believe the flat iron would work was was proven wrong when demonstrated own my hair one day</li>
            <li> but I only need a little to cover my whole hair.</li>
            <li> I thought that 6 dollars was too much for the other stuff I can get anywhere, but I spent 20 dollars as a whole to get it and get it sent to me because there is no super saver shipping for this item...</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and the constant usage of a hairdryer and flat iron take a tole.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel even silkier after using the flat iron or if you just want to touch it up for flyaways or extra shine.  </li>
            <li> the people at the mall kiosk who sells the flat irons and the wads tried to tell me this same size bottle for $75!  </li>
            <li> Does not make my dark hair natural curly hair look oily.</li>
            <li> This works well in flat ironmg my hair.  </li>
            <li> I got this along with the HerStyler flat iron</li>
            <li> I use this serum  when i use the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I got this at a mall kiosk with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> A little goes  a long way and my hair feels normal.</li>
            <li> A Must Have if you use a Flat Iron!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it worked on my hair (I&#x27;m Black)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my hair soft, manageable, and with less split ends.</li>
            <li> although the smell is something of an old ladies flower perfume, the only complaint I have is major; the product may do the job</li>
            <li> I actually have a Herstyler ceramic flat iron kit, which is the only reason I know about any of their other products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stretching my relaxer for as long as I can, so every week after I wash and dry it, I flat iron it out.  </li>
            <li> I was given samples of this from one of those pushy kiosks at a mall a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, a lot of hair, and it gets frazzled from blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I guess I expected a similar result with this item</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and seals dead ends fantastically.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, so I just used three pumps and spread it through out my hair.</li>
            <li> I will continue buying this product as long as it is avaliable.</li>
            <li> Excuse me ahead of time because I am so excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> Do miracles in dry and freezy hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy hair that tends to dry out quite often, thus I am quite picky when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li> I have health issues that cause my hair to be dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened it up, I ran to go wash and dry my hair</li>
            <li> but it did not live up to my expectation.  </li>
            <li> It does make difference on my  hair , the price is right ( not as expensive as the same brand sold at the mail )</li>
            <li> My hair was BURNED due to my stylist not paying attention and leaving bleach on too long.</li>
            <li> I put about a dime size and apply to wet hair.</li>
            <li> So anyway, I was asked while purchasing the flat iron set if I wanted to get any of the other items like previous version of this serum</li>
            <li> It was on the brink of irritating my eyes ( I have a few allergies, but strangely enough it didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes!)</li>
            <li> This product is EXACTLY the same as I purchased at the Mall for a crazy price.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the smell is to die for.</li>
            <li> As with any serum, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I put a dime size amount onto wet towel dried hair and blow dry then curl or streighten my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product!</li>
            <li> , I will not buy any other product again.</li>
            <li> There are other places to find argon oil hair serum</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this product and allow this company to treat interested customer so carelessly.</li>
            <li> I use this serum everyday for that sleek long hair i have to avoid the humidity.</li>
            <li> neither do any of the other ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other products.</li>
            <li> and it was supposed to actually get here late next week, but it came a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure the ratio is the same.</li>
            <li> not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> alot of products don&#x27;t hold down the frizz or the poofy, semi-afro</li>
            <li> I like this serum; however, it does weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke!</li>
            <li> I put a small dab of it on my damp hair and my ends look less frayed and dry.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and shiny and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is protect my ebony locks from the big bad straightener and mean old blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day (using it everyday makes my hair a bit too oily) while my hair is damp.</li>
            <li> Before I forget, let me mention that I&#x27;m black and use relaxers.  </li>
            <li> Smells terrific but subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> and i think that comes in a black bottle.</li>
            <li> Regardless of how this product works for smoothing, getting beyond the extremely strong perfume smell is nearly impossible!</li>
            <li> Not to mention she is autistic and hates her hair to be brushed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t be used to help with dead ends OR split ends.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel oily, greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> The bottle was missing the cover.</li>
            <li> came broken and the styler went back</li>
            <li> The only difference is it is considerably LESS EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on her hair and no more tangles which means no tears when I brush her hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this product everyday!</li>
            <li> however i try to put a small amount.</li>
            <li> the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it smells weird.</li>
            <li> I have never used Argan oil before, soI&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s supposed to smell.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but u need only a couple drops ....</li>
            <li> It does tame my frizzy rats nest of hair!</li>
            <li> it was put through, nothing to hard</li>
            <li> To oily, hard to get off your hands.</li>
            <li> Have tried to find a product that works remotely as well as this and was unable to.  </li>
            <li> After trying countless products and conditioners and not wanting to cut my hair off unless desperate, this product made a difference.</li>
            <li> I do have thick hair</li>
            <li> Have been buying it for a few yrs now, and don&#x27;t see myself stopping anytime soon!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, nothing too bad but works well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look dirty.</li>
            <li> And I have very thick shoulder length hair;</li>
            <li> NO MORE FRIZZ (HOORAY)!!</li>
            <li> I have crazy curly and frizzy hair that I have to wear up everyday for work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally not very fond of the smell - don&#x27;t hate me</li>
            <li> I feel insecure with the bottle being like in the picture, no cap.</li>
            <li> product i would say is very mediocre</li>
            <li> I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> (if you have any allergies and think you might have a bad reaction, you should do some research on Argan oil to avoid any the possibilities of it happening to you), so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand those annoying keyosk people at the mall.</li>
            <li> I hate using hair products</li>
            <li> This company is CRAP!</li>

            <li> Works just like the free sample I was given at the mall in SF.  The only difference is it is considerably LESS EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome......and works great for curly, wild hair!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. It makes my hair so soft but not greasy. It also has a lovely smell. Great price too compared to the pricess at the mall. I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it! It leaves my hair smelling wonderful and smooth! Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> not a day goes buy, that i don&#x27;t put this onto my hair!...it keeps my hair from drying out and splitting. It really is that good!  If your thinking of buy this product to keep your hair smooth and feeling silky and soft..do not hesitate...buy it. I have used every product out there...and i&#x27;m telling you..this serum really really work!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it works great with my hair when I want to apply any heat.</li>
            <li> great price and product thank you</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my daughter.  Her hair is damaged from coloring and heat styling.  She loves it.  It reduces frizz and makes her hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Original packaging.</li>
            <li> Use this every day, and love it!  Keeps hair shiny and controls frizzy ends during day.&lt;br /&gt;Does not weigh hair down. Perfect for daily use after washing hair, before styling.</li>
            <li> I like this Argan oil serum.  It is lightweight and is not heavily scented.  It certainly works well with the styler and does not leave a residue on the styler.  My hair has lots of body and a very natural shine.  I will definitely purchase this product as a stand alone.</li>
            <li> I love the texture, it works so good with blow drying, before I use with the curling iron.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Dont use too much or your hair will get greasy! A little goes a long way with this product!</li>
            <li> I was given samples of this from one of those pushy kiosks at a mall a long time ago.  Have tried to find a product that works remotely as well as this and was unable to.  I have long hair, a lot of hair, and it gets frazzled from blow drying.  A teeny tiny drop of this and it is soft and smooth like silk.  No joke.  And it smells incredible!  Love this stuff.  Be careful putting it near your roots or using more than a quarter of a dime because it will make your hair feel oily.  Very happy I found it again at a much more reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Pretty good! And cheap!</li>
            <li> thus is my favorite oil--it smells amazing and makes my hair super soft---use sparingly</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews, but I have to for this product.&lt;br /&gt;My 6 year old has thick, long curly hair and it knots up very easily. Not to mention she is autistic and hates her hair to be brushed.&lt;br /&gt;I used a sample of this hair oil that I got at the mall on her hair and it worked wonders. I have been using this product on her hair and no more tangles which means no tears when I brush her hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also decided to try it in my own hair which is dry and damaged from bleaching. It has made my hair soft and adds volume.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this and how it makes my hair feel! Especially on rainy days!</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I had used the Herstyler Hair Serum with Aloe Vera and Vitamin E.  I guess I expected a similar result with this item but it did not live up to my expectation.  I have very short hair and I used a minimum amount, however, I did not find that it added any shine to my hair.  It just appeared oily.</li>
            <li> NO SUCH COMPANY KNOWN AS HERSTYLE.  GOOGLE IT FOR YOURSELF.</li>
            <li> I work in a mall and there are always samples that people drop laying around my store. I found a couple packets of Her Styler Hair Serum under a table and thought I would try it. My hair was BURNED due to my stylist not paying attention and leaving bleach on too long. I have not gone back to her. After trying countless products and conditioners and not wanting to cut my hair off unless desperate, this product made a difference. It&#x27;s not greasy like most serums and has a pleasant smell. A little goes  a long way and my hair feels normal. I looked up the company website and it sells for $48!! No way. Amazon price was great and it&#x27;s the real product. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Love it. I really like how it smells too. I have had multiple people tell me that I smell good when I wear this in my hair. And it makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> got it fast. it does it&#x27;s job. i have no relaxer in my hair, it&#x27;s all natural . This works well in flat ironmg my hair.  more reasonably price than at the kiosk.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft, manageable, and smell amazing!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on the 12th of September and its estimated date was the 18th, and it came two days ahead. I&#x27;m impressed with the speed it got sent, really.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself was great too! I first learned of it from a sample at the Mall of America. I have African-American hair as well as another person who left a comment, and alot of products don&#x27;t hold down the frizz or the poofy, semi-afro my hair develops into without being straightened... Although I usually just straighten my hair (which isn&#x27;t good, I know) this helped with controlling it. It leaves a really good shine and softness along too. I&#x27;m personally not very fond of the smell - don&#x27;t hate me xD - but others have liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a great product and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand those annoying keyosk people at the mall. After a while they caught on to my cheap ways of always taking their examples but not buying a bottle of this stuff. They want way to much $$$ anyways. Enter Amazon!! This stuff is worth every penny spent. I have crazy curly and frizzy hair that I have to wear up everyday for work. This gets the job done in slicking my hair back and keeping the frizz at bay and smelling oh so nice!!</li>
            <li> Used it before and seems to help my hair. Reduces static and dryness.</li>
            <li> Best products I&#x27;ve ever bought. For my hair! Love this and the smell is incredible. I hope this never goes away, I will not buy any other product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I really like this product. It seems to help maintain healthy hair and protect it too</li>
            <li> This serum can be used on either dry or wet hair and is great for controlling hair in humid weather.</li>
            <li> This product smells like tears of angels. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this product everyday! It will make your hair really greasy if you do. I started using it like once every 3 days then once my hair started getting softer and healthier I used it once a week. I would wash my hair only with shampoo and then a couple pumps of this (not a lot comes out, so you might need to pump it a lot.) although the smell is something of an old ladies flower perfume, the only complaint I have is major; the product may do the job BUT it is cheap. It shouldn&#x27;t be used to help with dead ends OR split ends. It does the same thing conditioner does so if you run out, this product is a go to.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and was a speedy transaction.</li>
            <li> I originally bought my first herstyler at the mall and these gels go for $12-$20 so I am happy with the price. Great deal right here. I ordered two. I do have thick hair but I only need a little to cover my whole hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, i have been looking for something like this for years, i have very frizzy hair and this seams to work the best!</li>
            <li> Argon serum is a wonderful product for your hair, but Herstyler, A.K.A. Golden Skin Care is the absolute worst company in terms of customer service. There are other places to find argon oil hair serum and you should seek them out. Please do not buy this product and allow this company to treat interested customer so carelessly.</li>
            <li> Great product and great value!</li>
            <li> I bought this because i got caught up in the argan oil mumbo jumbo.but I have the original hair serum with aloe &amp; I loved that. But the argan oil hair serum is to wattery &amp; I have to use too much product &amp; go over my hair with the flat iron several times to get it straight.maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Herstyler hair serum is by far one of the best products I have ever used in my hair, it makes my hair feel like silk after I flatiron my hair and it does not make it look oily at all and does not take a lot ! I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My stylist has nothing on me anymore. I just outstyled his efforts and in minutes. Long, thick baby fine curly hair is now tamed, straight with the little bit of flare I love. I wasn&#x27;t expect much for the price and for alllllllll the hair I have, it took a few drops. From now on, he can color and trim, I&#x27;ll style it. Never had a better stylist than my current one, until today!! Now I&#x27;m the best! Herstyler fan big time!! Gong to see what else they have!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Got the original in a little packet in something I got in the mail.</li>
            <li> Coats well on my hair strands! Amazing product! Do miracles in dry and freezy hair.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and makes my hair silky and smooth! I put a small dab of it on my damp hair and my ends look less frayed and dry.</li>
            <li> I was in the mall here in Hawaii and saw this very exact product. They wanted over 1000% more then it cost here and for the very exact product. Great product for a great price. in fact I purchased it twice ( 2 ) more. For this price you cant go wrong for such a GREAT product and the woman in my life was so happy about getting it. she uses it for strighting her hair. you will be happy with this purchase!!  I know she was and when the woman is happy the man s happy!</li>
            <li> WOW!  Do I like this stuff!  Makes my wispy thinning hair look healthy.</li>
            <li> I love it. I get nothing but good comments about how pretty and how good my hair smells. thanks :)</li>
            <li> I receive lots of compliments for my hair. I use this serum everyday for that sleek long hair i have to avoid the humidity. It makes my hair not only sleek but also has flowery smells.</li>
            <li> I love this, I use it on my hair every time I curl it or straighten it. It protects my hair from the heat and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky. Still waiting to see how it will help with my split ends and frizz but so far I really like it. And it smells good too. Not too greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I would  recommend this product,  After using it the first time my hair feel so soft and healthy. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Lays on top of the hair no moisture or penetration at all</li>
            <li> Works as well as the sample from the mall kiosk without fending off the attack of the commissioned salespeople. The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought one here and the rest I bought them at the swat meet... for $5 each...lol anyways it&#x27;s like any other serum. I didn&#x27;t see something magical. I have tried many and they all feel the same.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my hair feel, very sort.</li>
            <li> love love love love love love love this its amazing for your hair and doesnt make it feel greasy compared to the vitamine e oil</li>
            <li> Best yet for humidity control. Not as good as the mall sample . It does tame my frizzy rats nest of hair! I will order again.</li>
            <li> I got a sample given to me at the Promenade and I just had to have it. First time I tried it I loved it. My hair was shiny, looked healthy and had full volume.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it said it was Vitamin E serum with aloe vera. What was sent to me was Argan oil with Aloe vera. I have tons of Argan oil - so it was a total wastage of my money. Next time I wil think twice before ordering on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shraddha</li>
            <li> Great hair product at a fabulous price.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and I would recommend it.  I shouldnt have to keep writing when I have already stated my feelings of the product</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy hair that tends to dry out quite often, thus I am quite picky when it comes to hair products. I&#x27;ve been in love with Moroccan oil treatment for the last two years or so, but been wanting to find a cheaper alternative. I found this on Amazon, saw the positive reviews, and decided to try it out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and It&#x27;s very good - I love the texture and scent. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky and oily. Once my hair dries it becomes very smooth and soft. I do wish it could control my frizz just a tad bit more, but I really can&#x27;t complain. I get wonderful results. I think I will be sticking with this for awhile.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products!!  The smell is amazing and it works just like they claim!!  Speedy delivery, got it in 2 days!! Leaves hair soft and seals dead ends fantastically. My husband loves the way it makes my hair feel and smell.. I&#x27;m thrilled that I found it on Amazon, it&#x27;s significantly less than buying it at the mall!!!  I would totally recommend this to anyone that has curly or frizzy hair or anyone that heat styles their hair!!!</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair feel soft and look shiny.  Also notice how is seals the cuticles to prevent split ends.</li>
            <li> Best stuff in the world! Smells amazing and makes your hair feel so light! One bottle will last forever!</li>
            <li> I apply to my hair prior to flat ironing and it leaves my hair feeling soft, silky and not oily</li>
            <li> very good, will buy again soon</li>
            <li> OMG!!! The best serum I&#x27;ve ever used. A little goes a long way and the smell is to die for. This serum keeps your hair shiny, it makes your curls set better and look better, it&#x27;s not heavy. The awesome thing about this serum is that you don&#x27;t have to use it everyday because the serum lasts for at least 2days. I would recommend to every person with hair on their head, I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
            <li> do what it says it would do&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good too&lt;br /&gt;but ive had better hair essence in my life...&lt;br /&gt;this product i would say is very mediocre</li>
            <li> I use this throughout the day, everyday, I am African American and my hair has been damaged by way of perming, this oil makes my hair so soft, shiny, manageable and it smells so good, I take a dab a rub it on my arms too! I use it along with the herstyler hair and body mist \\&quot;devotion\\&quot; the two are fabulous, both are very light and fragrant! these items are on my \\&quot;Must Have\\&quot; obsession list!!</li>
            <li> The product make my hair greasy and not shiny however i try to put a small amount. I dont like it</li>
            <li> This Argon oil is for your hair , it makes it smell incredibly clean and fresh. I put about a dime size and apply to wet hair. If you want to have your hair smell good all day and be moisturized this is the product to buy! I love it</li>
            <li> So far, I like it. I recently finished my second bottle and is here to shop for more but inexpensive. It&#x27;s too much on their website.Not recommended in humid weather. It smells good, very soft, and does not leave an oily residue. I use this after showers and straightening my hair for extra shine.</li>
            <li> Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only  product that I use now.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves the hair soft and shine, also has a nice fragrance on it.</li>
            <li> Good product, my hair is soften after using it.</li>
            <li> I found this at the Holyoke Mall in Massachusetts and I loved the little sample so much but the lady said the actual product (this) is $90 but she&#x27;d give it to me for $40 and I go on here and find it for $8??? Lol America just loves to rip off its own citizens doesn&#x27;t it BUT ANYWAY I love this and it&#x27;s exactly the same as the &amp;#34;$90&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair so shiny and soft. I&#x27;ve been getting tons of compliments since I started using it.</li>
            <li> This product is magical for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However: Argan oil has practically no scent to it... neither do any of the other ingredients listed. There is absolutely undisclosed fragrance added to this product. I am 100% sure!!! I make soaps and I have a small bottle of straight Argan oil right here. It has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This said, I question the validity of their ingredient list. Cosmetic ingredients should be listed from greatest percentage in the product to the least, and all ingredients disclosed. Frankly, somebody could sue them for an allergic reaction to undisclosed fragrance. And there is no way the percentage of Argan oil is greater than the other ingredients listed... my hair would be a grease ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this product  is magical for hair, but be wary if you have a fragrance allergy because there is definitely fragrance added to this serum.</li>
            <li> I loved this! I have long hair, so I just used three pumps and spread it through out my hair. My hair smells great, has added shine, and combs through easily.</li>
            <li> I got this along with the HerStyler flat iron and i&#x27;m very happy with the serum. It smells so good. I was surprised that it worked on my hair (I&#x27;m Black) because my hair is kind of thick but it worked and i&#x27;m happy. I will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li> I love this oil! First sample I got was at a business Expo. After trying it at home I immediately ordered it. I have health issues that cause my hair to be dry and brittle. This oil truly helps the condition and look of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am African Americna and have natural hair.  I use this serum  when i use the flat iron. It does not make my hair heavy but gives it a nice sheen and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> awesome product! does great job and smells wonderful! highly recommended! pricing is very reasonable and affordable. will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> The stuff serves it&#x27;s purpose but doesn&#x27;t have that great of a smell... It was priced well enough that I would recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for hair oil on social occasions, smells great and feels really healthy. Going to be a permanent part of my toiletries pouch!</li>
            <li> This stuff by far is the best for my hair, I color it constantly but not always bleach it everytime.  It does help to keep my hair healthy</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. It also leaves my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this Hair Serum! I use it every other day (using it everyday makes my hair a bit too oily) while my hair is damp. It&#x27;s made my hair soft, manageable, and with less split ends. I have very long hair and it only takes two pumps to coat it all. I highly recommend everyone try this.</li>
            <li> Best strangers and hair treatment for dry damaged hair I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily, greasy or heavy. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look dirty. I hate using hair products but I can&#x27;t live without this one.</li>
            <li> Regardless of how this product works for smoothing, getting beyond the extremely strong perfume smell is nearly impossible!</li>
            <li> I love it! Makes my hair super soft and shiney! And goes great with their hair wand as well :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I was excited that I was able to order this through Amazon. I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other products.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. 2 ounces last a ling time.  Argan is the ingredient that helps with the softness.</li>
            <li> It as for my daughter but I tried it and loved it!</li>
            <li> Affordable and work well! wish it come with a cap for the bottle. I feel insecure with the bottle being like in the picture, no cap.</li>
            <li> Does not make my dark hair natural curly hair look oily. Not thick oil. Very soft and smells great. Adds the shine.</li>
            <li> Love this hair serum. Keeps damaged hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> I love this hair serum! Can&#x27;t go a day without it! I love the shine it gives to my hair, and also the brilliant softness!! It&#x27;s great for the fuzziness and fly-aways!! It also has this wonderful smell! Must buy hair product. Have been buying it for a few yrs now, and don&#x27;t see myself stopping anytime soon!!</li>
            <li> Love this serum....ive used a lot of serums and they are not created equal...this is a very good one....i put it on my hair before i blowdry and it makes my hair easy to straighten. ..i would buy it again</li>
            <li> this one gives me headaches...i dont know why.. it smells really nice, controls frizzy hair. but cant take head ache.</li>
            <li> I love this product it puts the shine in your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It doesn&#x27;t make my already oil hair look more oily. It makes my hair super soft. The smell is like bug spray, but I don&#x27;t really care. The ingredients on the box and label matched: aloe, vita E, &amp; argan oil. No fake products here!</li>
            <li> The best product for dry hair!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair smell so wonderfull, it keeps the shine in all day and i absolutely love it overall. im running out of this stuff and i need to buy more!! :D</li>
            <li> Love this Argan Oil. Really makes my hair soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> It does make difference on my  hair , the price is right ( not as expensive as the same brand sold at the mail ) I love the smell</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my hair on days when I don&#x27;t even straighten it -- it has an odd, sweet smell, but not overpowering. It leaves hair soft and shiny and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is protect my ebony locks from the big bad straightener and mean old blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Great smell, gorgeous hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shine up!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not mention it how good it feels on a skin, like a clouds! Angel me!!</li>
            <li> Love this Argon oil for my wiry, very coarse, curly &amp; dry hair. This product was recommended to me by a trusted friend that purchases it from Amazon. Thought I would give it a try as I had been using coconut oil (once a month overnight treatments) for my hair that did a pretty good job at keeping my hair softer, scalp more moisturized, etc., but this Argon Oil is wonderful. Makes my hair shiny and very easy to style with my flat iron. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love me HerStyler products!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I use it before and after drying, leaving my hair soft and shiny! Been raving about this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great on my hair and smells awesome. I will def keep using it from now on.</li>
            <li> I seldom provide feedback, reviews, but I loved this product !</li>
            <li> Works great makes my hair look great</li>
            <li> A Must Have if you use a Flat Iron!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I love the smell and feel of it.</li>
            <li> The bottle was missing the cover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous serums. this has got to be the best. it does leak but it&#x27;s a wonderful product. WOO!</li>
            <li> Like it real well. Shipped in good time</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny, it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again.  I do recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product works ! It leaves hair super silky not greasy at all. Totally worth it the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it smells weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product from amazon.com for a couple of months now.  The product is just as described and I always get it in a timely manner.  I will continue buying this product as long as it is avaliable.</li>
            <li> This is miracle oil for my hair</li>
            <li> I love this product and buy it on Amazon for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is the best serum for my hair.  Leaves my hair smelling wonderful, shiny, and soft. I had to stock up :)</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair is smooth, shiny, and frizz free.  During very humid summer days I noticed my hair was still looking good instead of turning into one huge frizz ball like it usually does.</li>
            <li> came broken and the styler went back</li>
            <li> I got this at a mall kiosk with the flat iron. It&#x27;s absolutely excellent to put at the tips of your hair and I noticed it helps prevent split ends. Additionally, it smells great. As with any serum, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This hair serum is the best I have found and Amazon&#x27;s price is the best.  I love the way it makes my hair shine and smell.</li>
            <li> I like this serum; however, it does weigh my hair down.  It smells nice and does protect my hair from the heat of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and the constant usage of a hairdryer and flat iron take a tole.  This serum works great and keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic for me with my flat iron, love the smell, and makes my straw-like hair feel soft.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I love it!! Is the best product I have ever used to straighten hair.... I will never stop using it ....</li>
            <li> To oily, hard to get off your hands.</li>
            <li> Great for using with the Heated Curler !!</li>
            <li> Excuse me ahead of time because I am so excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay.  I actually have a Herstyler ceramic flat iron kit, which is the only reason I know about any of their other products.  Before I forget, let me mention that I&#x27;m black and use relaxers.  So anyway, I was asked while purchasing the flat iron set if I wanted to get any of the other items like previous version of this serum and I declined.  I figured that the ORS Olive Oil Heat Protection serum that I always buy would suffice.  It&#x27;s fine...I still will use it in the future and am looking at about 3 FL OZ left over from the 6 FL OZ bottle that I&#x27;m on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I finally decided to get some of the Herstyler serum mainly to help with flyaways.  The flat iron always makes it silky smooth even without product use, but as I was searching Amazon.com, I ran across this one, which naturally has vitamin E in it AND from what I&#x27;ve heard, Argan oil is like liquid gold for hair.  I&#x27;m not allergic to it (if you have any allergies and think you might have a bad reaction, you should do some research on Argan oil to avoid any the possibilities of it happening to you), so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited because I ordered it and it was supposed to actually get here late next week, but it came a few days ago.  As soon as I opened it up, I ran to go wash and dry my hair so I could try it out.  I&#x27;m stretching my relaxer for as long as I can, so every week after I wash and dry it, I flat iron it out.  Most of the time the new growth doesn&#x27;t revert back to the tight curls...Other times, it just lasts a few hours, which is still a great feat for MY hair, which usually has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  Since I didn&#x27;t even believe the flat iron would work was was proven wrong when demonstrated own my hair one day, I figured that I should start getting the products that go with my irons to see if there can be even more of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as the heat protection...I have never used Argan oil before, soI&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s supposed to smell.  I personally love how it smells.  I&#x27;d wear it as a body oil if I could, but some people who are sensitive to things might not like it.  It was on the brink of irritating my eyes ( I have a few allergies, but strangely enough it didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes!) but didn&#x27;t.  It is really true that it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.  Makes your hair feel even silkier after using the flat iron or if you just want to touch it up for flyaways or extra shine.  My hair still flows/moves like it was just freshly washed and free of products and smells wonderful!  Love this stuff, but it costs a pretty penny...I thought that 6 dollars was too much for the other stuff I can get anywhere, but I spent 20 dollars as a whole to get it and get it sent to me because there is no super saver shipping for this item...I guess it&#x27;s still worth it all though.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for all hair types. I put a dime size amount onto wet towel dried hair and blow dry then curl or streighten my hair. It&#x27;s amazing how soft, shiney and vibrant my hair is. The product is weightless and non-greasy with the correct amount applied. I have just purchased 2 more and have used this product for two years.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it. She has thin, L&#x27;Oreal colored blond hair and it makes her hair very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Does its job but yes, like many others have mentioned - after a while, it really smells like cheap perfume. I liked the smell as a sample size, but not when I started to use it regularly. Just personal preference. :) As a serum, I&#x27;d say it does a pretty decent job in taming my impossible-to-tame hair.</li>
            <li> I have coarse curly hair that I straighten.  This oil makes it feel so soft and smooth.  I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells terrific but subtle and not overpowering. Expensive but u need only a couple drops .... And I have very thick shoulder length hair; African American. And when done massaging thru hair .... I rub on my elbows for extra measure! Know u will enjoy. Worth the money</li>
            <li> i love this oil, it makes my hair shiny and it smells great</li>
            <li> It seems OK, but obviously has less Argan oil smell, compare to the sample I got. I am not sure the ratio is the same.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, my hair has never been this soft. I am a new customer for life !!</li>
            <li> I like it ;it makes shine and not grece.</li>
            <li> This product is EXACTLY the same as I purchased at the Mall for a crazy price.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER ON THIS PRODUCT.  You have to purchase the one with &amp;#34;argon oil&amp;#34;.  I love this product.  I&#x27;m glad I paid the price from the Mall because I would not have known about the product.  It&#x27;s wonderful...</li>
            <li> Herstyler has the best products. A little bit goes a long way. I love how my hair feel and it is great protection from heat</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell, nothing too bad but works well</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT NO MORE FRIZZ (HOORAY)!!</li>
            <li> 3 or4 pumps of this oil works great with my fine long hair.</li>
            <li> Got this for my friend and she said it made her hair super soft !! Will be purchasing more when my own of this exact product runs out!</li>
            <li> Love it! Excellent results THANKYOU!  THE REAL ARGON OIL!!!</li>
            <li> i love it soo much!! my hair feels amazing when i use it! it makes my hair soo soft and shiny!! and it smells good too!!</li>
            <li> Another good product it absorbs well and smells good. This was the first time trying it and will do again.</li>
            <li> (My hair type is thick/course/wavy) I decided to try the argan oil version of the Herstyler hair serum since i already had the original one that had vitamin e. I really do like this product, but i always have to apply it every time i straighten my hair, which is like every other day. Compared to the one with just vitamin e, the original Herstyler hair serum actually kept my hair soft for about a week and even a little longer. I do suggest buying the Herstyler with vitamin e and i think that comes in a black bottle. Still, it&#x27;s a very nice product when straightening with. Seels my ends and still keeps it soft!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  the people at the mall kiosk who sells the flat irons and the wads tried to tell me this same size bottle for $75!  I told her the same exact product is available online for any where from 5-20 dollars she said the ingredients were different!  When i showed her she had nothing to say!  Im in sales you cant fool me!</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my adult life?</li>
            <li> I have thin longer blonde hair and this serum is so light I can put it in my hair dry and within a few minutes my ends are smooth and my hair feels soft and I&#x27;m able to run my fingers threw it all day and its still not greasy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordrered</li>
            <li> this was my first time using Argan oil..i love the way it  makes my hair so soft and shiny...my hair has never felt this way before</li>
            <li> great serum! been using it since I got it! it got delivered fast!</li>
            <li> This is so amazing . I swear since i bought this i seen improvement in my hair ! Love this product</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast. But this product has a really really strong perfume smell to it!!!!! Way too over powering!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
