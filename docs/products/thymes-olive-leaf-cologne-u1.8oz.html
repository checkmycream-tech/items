            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I have bought less expensive that I liked better.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh - my hubby loves it!</li>
            <li> love the scent .... fresh, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have been a philosophy fan for years.  I love Inner Grace, but it&#x27;s just too expensive for me.  I found this scent at a local store and fell in love.  The Naia scent by the same company is also awesome.  They are half the cost of philosophy perfume and I enjoy their scents more.  I will be slowly adding to my collection.</li>
            <li> Because I loved the fragrance of the hand soap/lotion, I was pleasantly surprised to find there was also this cologne.  It&#x27;s very light and fresh smelling...  I&#x27;ve received many &amp;#34;You smell really good&amp;#34; compliments &amp;Uuml;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is authentic cologne, the scent does not last like it should.  I remember this scent lasting more than 24 hours. This one doesn&#x27;t last 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I have worn the same perfume for too many yrs to say, but I have finally switched from Estee Lauder Beautiful to Thymes, Olive Leaf. My hubby has given me the bath salts &amp; lotion in yrs past but I didn&#x27;t know they had the scent too. I am so thrilled.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!  I get compliments when I wear it and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, which is a problem I have with many of the popular fragrances.  I do wish that the duration of the scent would last longer.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I have yet to receive a compliment on it though.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents and hard to find locally. Priced right, too!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent  --  very light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Great scent for my husband!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a little fresher and lighter than it was; if you like Fresh&#x27;s \\&quot;Cannabis Santal\\&quot; you will probably like this. A little too heavy and earthy for me. Lovely bottle, perfectly fine fragrance, etc. Just not suited to my taste and body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in Yelm, wa. at JZ knights &amp;#34;outback&amp;#34; store, I fell in LOVE with this scent. its completely distinctive, I have never smelled anything like it. yep... its VERY &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; as many have mentioned, its really organic and so natural to me it actually smells LIKE me to me now... its not the only scent I wear, but it IS my personal favorite, the one I wear when im REALLY aligned with just being ME. I found some of thymes other scents at a local casino and was pleasantly surprises that ALL their scents are rather unique. but ill stick with olive leaf for ever !!!</li>
            <li> On time, smells great as usual---same scent. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely fragrance. I miss the fig leaf and cassis fragrance. I wish it lasted longer once you put it on.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is earthy, clean, everything I was anticipating , Will order again for sure, will recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Have worn this for several years and male friends have asked what I&#x27;m wearing so they can get it for their wives.</li>
            <li> love the aroma of this product..i use the whole line great to layer the fragrance with the soap then body lotion then spray&lt;br /&gt;gives you that fresh clean smell all day&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of compliments</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne in the world; good seller sent promptly and for a reasonable price</li>
