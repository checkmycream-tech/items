            <li>The clips are adorable.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to make sure you have a way to keep them organized or you&#x27;ll have to sort through them to find the matching pairs.</li>
            <li>Mine also came in a cute box to store them in.</li>
            <li>These are really cute and work well even if the child doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair yet.</li>

            <li>but they&#x27;re cute.</li>
            <li>Maybe some no slip gripping would help.</li>
            <li>These were so cute</li>
            <li>These are absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>Strong,beautiful &amp; cute......</li>
            <li>Adorable.</li>
            <li>They stay in place and are adorable.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t recommend buying them :)</li>
            <li>They are cute for babies.</li>
            <li>clips stay put for the most part (until my daughter accidentally pulls it out of her hair)</li>
            <li>These clips were well made &amp; are strong enough for my 2 year olds head of hair......and adorable and work great!</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors and a great variety.</li>
            <li>Great product recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Super cute in person!</li>
            <li>and they are SUPER cute!</li>
            <li>But clips still very cute and colorful.</li>
            <li>These clips are well put together, nice big clips and very cute!  </li>
            <li>They were shipped quickly and came in a nice padded gift box where they are kept.</li>
            <li>The colors are great - there is a nice variety to wear with all sorts of different outfits.</li>
            <li>These clips are so cute and they stay on fine hair quite well.</li>
            <li>We always keep a close eye on her when she is wearing them, but so far they are great</li>
            <li>These are great for keeping my two year old&#x27;s hair out of her face.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the money spent.</li>
            <li>They have held up very well, which is good since they were pricey.</li>
            <li>I loved them so much</li>
            <li>I place them near the elastic bands of the ponytails and the size is very nice.  </li>
            <li>These bows fall apart easily</li>
            <li>Colors are cute and the polka dot ones are sweet.  </li>
            <li>Bought for a one year&lt;br /&gt;Old with fine hair.</li>
            <li>They also stay in fine hair well.  </li>
            <li>The clips stay put in her fine hair and there is a color for every outfit.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and the color assortment is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>These are well made and super cute...</li>
            <li>They are SUPER cute and work well.</li>
            <li>my baby looks super cute in these.  </li>
            <li>--they are a perfect size for little heads.  </li>
            <li>These are high quality and very cute.</li>
            <li>Each bow is attractive and, can be mixed and matched or stand alone.  </li>
            <li>But they matched great and are a big hit!</li>
            <li>My kids love the fun selection of colors and patterns.</li>
            <li>but it would more useful to have colors that ALL hair colors can benefit from.</li>
            <li>Fit well for my toddler</li>
            <li>look great in their blonde hair!</li>
            <li>These are so fabulous, I ordered two sets for my daughter&#x27;s pigtails.</li>
            <li>Their cute and their just what I thought they would be, they make a great add on to all the other hair clips I wear</li>
            <li>These weren&#x27;t the cheapest bow clips, but they are well worth the money!  </li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Love the colors and its a very well made product!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these snaps could be used for a lot of hair, but for a small child they are perfect.</li>
            <li>These are adorable and very well made!</li>
            <li>:) I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like them :)</li>
            <li>and I know they will look so sweet</li>
            <li>These are really cute and slide easily into my 2 year old&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping super cute product more detail in them then normal hair bow.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty and durable.</li>
            <li>These bows are very pretty.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old has very fine hair</li>
            <li>These look so cute on my little girl; I am going to need to order more!</li>
            <li>Not only are they cute, they stay in place!  </li>
            <li>Pretty also!</li>
            <li>Great for little girls heads...</li>
            <li>Fun colors</li>
            <li>And, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>old grand daughters pig tails.  </li>
            <li>The colors are more for babies than for 4 year old.</li>
            <li>Very nice hair bows for a little girl...</li>
            <li>Really cute and just right for my two year old daughter.</li>
            <li>High quality, nice classy designs and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Would love to have the bow a little more centered lengthwise.  </li>
            <li>I loved the little hair bows.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well done, you could tell that it&#x27;s hand made and they did an excelent job!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>My grand daughter is only 2  </li>
            <li>There are also several colors and patterns, which match most of her clothes.</li>
            <li>The clips are adorable and look like the picture, exact same colors and designs, but, to put it on a baby head...</li>
            <li>They stay put much better than traditional &amp;#34;alligator clip&amp;#34; bows which is a must when trying to keep her curly hair out of her eyes.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what i was expecting..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost enough of them now that I need to order more</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely ordering more of these.</li>
            <li>Love the extra fashion material wrapped around clip to match the bow.  </li>
            <li>When I received I realized that there was only one of each design, which doesn&#x27;t make sense as most girls wear one on each side.  </li>
            <li>So many colors, but where is blue?  </li>
            <li>So cute, I just wish the clip part was a bit bigger</li>
            <li>They are just a basic metal hair clip wrapped in ribbon, but the ribbon gives them a more secure grip and keeps them from slipping in fine hair.</li>
            <li>These hair clips are very cute and would make any would compliment any little girls outfit.  </li>
            <li>Love the vibrant colours and that for every solid colour there is a dotted equivalent.  </li>
            <li>These little clips are so cute and they are made well!  </li>
            <li>My daughter wears one everyday and her friends just love them!  </li>
            <li>They are perfect for ages 2-4, large enough to look pretty but not so big or heavy that they fall out.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re well made and stay in my hair, and the colors are vibrant; exactly what you get in the picture.</li>
            <li>These are very practical.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t slip out of my 4 and 1 year olds&#x27;s hair and they are very well made.  </li>
            <li>Our granddaughter is very exited with them.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay in very well</li>
            <li>They are high quality!  </li>
            <li>I got it on time and ready to use</li>
            <li>My 3-1/2 year old granddaughter loves the clip kind because she tries to do her hair all by herself</li>
            <li>The clip part that actually holds the hair is wrapped with ribbon which is great for two reasons: One, one of my twin daughters has fine, thin hair and these really hold her hair better than any other snap clip I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old loves to line them up and pick the right one for her outfit.</li>
            <li>This was a great bargain and I would suggest to any parent whose constantly fixing your little girls hair to consider buying these bows!</li>
            <li>These are cute, but they seem awfully large for a little one&#x27;s heads.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for for my two year old daughter.</li>
            <li>my new granddaughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>wish that there were more brighter, child-friendly colors in lieu of the black and brown tones</li>
            <li>Older girls would most likely want larger bows.</li>
            <li>Too big for 1 year olds maybe be better for big kids</li>
            <li>Wow they are better then I expected.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>First--they come in a lovely little box for storing them which my toddler loves to look through each morning to pick out bows to go with her outfit.  </li>
            <li>Lovely set for little girls, must have.</li>
            <li>This is a cute little set of bows.  </li>
            <li>Came in a cute little box.</li>
            <li>These bows fit as expected...</li>
            <li>Well made and they grasp very fine, small amounts of hair.</li>
            <li>Small and strong!</li>
            <li>These pieces are small and cute</li>
            <li>These are the first hairclips I have bought that my 2.5 year old will actually wear.  </li>
            <li>If the clips get wet the metal parts rust and the ribbon is so short that it detaches easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 17 so buying these when they were made for little girls is kind of awkward, but they were really too cute to pass up.</li>
            <li>Used on my 8 month old granddaughter who doesn&#x27;t even notice that she has them in her hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this a gift, and the receiver just raves about the bows for her 2 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>so I use them for my 18 month old baby and my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li>My 21 month old wears these every day.  </li>
            <li>My 6 yr old is growing out her bangs and these</li>
            <li>but nearly every one of the bows and come off the clips.</li>
            <li>Our 5 year old daughter loves matching the clips and putting them in her hair.</li>
            <li>Bought for 1.5yr old niece.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for my 7-month old daughter who has a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>It was sent in a small necklace or earring size box which made it easy to gift wrap</li>
            <li>maybe a little big for my 18mo old with fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Be prepared with a little super glue as some of the bows come off the cilp...</li>
            <li>I think the size will be still be large enough for her for several years.</li>
            <li>and her hair is very fine and thin.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these even though my daughter is barely 6 months.  </li>
            <li>The clips are sturdy enough to hold up to frequent use.  </li>
            <li>Finally found some bows my 1.5 year old will keep in hair.</li>
            <li>You can get nicer handmade hair accessories for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li>old daughter has a lot of hair and traditional infant or toddler hair ties do not do the trick.  </li>
            <li>all of the bows fell off quickly exposing a small dot of glue holding it together.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected but made very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these bow clips for little girls between the ages of 3 and 7 or 8 years old.  </li>
            <li>The wrapping protects my little ones hair from sticking &amp; looks much cuter than the metal snap.</li>
            <li>My little one loves to dump them out of the box and pick out the one she wants to wear for the day.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a little more delicate looking.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll have to make sure you have a way to keep them organized or you&#x27;ll have to sort through them to find the matching pairs.</li>
            <li> Mine also came in a cute box to store them in.</li>

            <li> Adorable clips.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re cute.</li>
            <li> Maybe some no slip gripping would help.</li>
            <li> These were so cute</li>
            <li> These are absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> Strong,beautiful &amp; cute......</li>
            <li> Adorable.</li>
            <li> They stay in place and are adorable.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t recommend buying them :)</li>
            <li> They are cute for babies.</li>
            <li> clips stay put for the most part (until my daughter accidentally pulls it out of her hair)</li>
            <li> These clips were well made &amp; are strong enough for my 2 year olds head of hair......and adorable and work great!</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors and a great variety.</li>
            <li> Great product recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Super cute in person!</li>
            <li> and they are SUPER cute!</li>
            <li> But clips still very cute and colorful.</li>
            <li> These clips are well put together, nice big clips and very cute!  </li>
            <li> They were shipped quickly and came in a nice padded gift box where they are kept.</li>
            <li> The colors are great - there is a nice variety to wear with all sorts of different outfits.</li>
            <li> These clips are so cute and they stay on fine hair quite well.</li>
            <li> We always keep a close eye on her when she is wearing them, but so far they are great</li>
            <li> These are great for keeping my two year old&#x27;s hair out of her face.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the money spent.</li>
            <li> They have held up very well, which is good since they were pricey.</li>
            <li> I loved them so much</li>
            <li> I place them near the elastic bands of the ponytails and the size is very nice.  </li>
            <li> These bows fall apart easily</li>
            <li> Colors are cute and the polka dot ones are sweet.  </li>
            <li> Bought for a one year&lt;br /&gt;Old with fine hair.</li>
            <li> They also stay in fine hair well.  </li>
            <li> The clips stay put in her fine hair and there is a color for every outfit.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and the color assortment is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> These are well made and super cute...</li>
            <li> They are SUPER cute and work well.</li>
            <li> my baby looks super cute in these.  </li>
            <li> --they are a perfect size for little heads.  </li>
            <li> These are high quality and very cute.</li>
            <li> Each bow is attractive and, can be mixed and matched or stand alone.  </li>
            <li> But they matched great and are a big hit!</li>
            <li> My kids love the fun selection of colors and patterns.</li>
            <li> but it would more useful to have colors that ALL hair colors can benefit from.</li>
            <li> Fit well for my toddler</li>
            <li> look great in their blonde hair!</li>
            <li> These are so fabulous, I ordered two sets for my daughter&#x27;s pigtails.</li>
            <li> Their cute and their just what I thought they would be, they make a great add on to all the other hair clips I wear</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t the cheapest bow clips, but they are well worth the money!  </li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and its a very well made product!</li>
            <li> Worth the price!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these snaps could be used for a lot of hair, but for a small child they are perfect.</li>
            <li> These are adorable and very well made!</li>
            <li> :) I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like them :)</li>
            <li> and I know they will look so sweet</li>
            <li> These are really cute and slide easily into my 2 year old&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping super cute product more detail in them then normal hair bow.</li>
            <li> They are very pretty and durable.</li>
            <li> These bows are very pretty.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old has very fine hair</li>
            <li> These look so cute on my little girl; I am going to need to order more!</li>
            <li> Not only are they cute, they stay in place!  </li>
            <li> Pretty also!</li>
            <li> Great for little girls heads...</li>
            <li> Fun colors</li>
            <li> And, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> old grand daughters pig tails.  </li>
            <li> The colors are more for babies than for 4 year old.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair bows for a little girl...</li>
            <li> Really cute and just right for my two year old daughter.</li>
            <li> High quality, nice classy designs and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Would love to have the bow a little more centered lengthwise.  </li>
            <li> I loved the little hair bows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well done, you could tell that it&#x27;s hand made and they did an excelent job!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> My grand daughter is only 2  </li>
            <li> There are also several colors and patterns, which match most of her clothes.</li>
            <li> The clips are adorable and look like the picture, exact same colors and designs, but, to put it on a baby head...</li>
            <li> They stay put much better than traditional &amp;#34;alligator clip&amp;#34; bows which is a must when trying to keep her curly hair out of her eyes.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what i was expecting..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost enough of them now that I need to order more</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely ordering more of these.</li>
            <li> Love the extra fashion material wrapped around clip to match the bow.  </li>
            <li> When I received I realized that there was only one of each design, which doesn&#x27;t make sense as most girls wear one on each side.  </li>
            <li> So many colors, but where is blue?  </li>
            <li> So cute, I just wish the clip part was a bit bigger</li>
            <li> They are just a basic metal hair clip wrapped in ribbon, but the ribbon gives them a more secure grip and keeps them from slipping in fine hair.</li>
            <li> These hair clips are very cute and would make any would compliment any little girls outfit.  </li>
            <li> Love the vibrant colours and that for every solid colour there is a dotted equivalent.  </li>
            <li> These little clips are so cute and they are made well!  </li>
            <li> My daughter wears one everyday and her friends just love them!  </li>
            <li> They are perfect for ages 2-4, large enough to look pretty but not so big or heavy that they fall out.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re well made and stay in my hair, and the colors are vibrant; exactly what you get in the picture.</li>
            <li> These are very practical.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t slip out of my 4 and 1 year olds&#x27;s hair and they are very well made.  </li>
            <li> Our granddaughter is very exited with them.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay in very well</li>
            <li> They are high quality!  </li>
            <li> I got it on time and ready to use</li>
            <li> My 3-1/2 year old granddaughter loves the clip kind because she tries to do her hair all by herself</li>
            <li> The clip part that actually holds the hair is wrapped with ribbon which is great for two reasons: One, one of my twin daughters has fine, thin hair and these really hold her hair better than any other snap clip I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old loves to line them up and pick the right one for her outfit.</li>
            <li> This was a great bargain and I would suggest to any parent whose constantly fixing your little girls hair to consider buying these bows!</li>
            <li> These are cute, but they seem awfully large for a little one&#x27;s heads.  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for for my two year old daughter.</li>
            <li> my new granddaughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> wish that there were more brighter, child-friendly colors in lieu of the black and brown tones</li>
            <li> Older girls would most likely want larger bows.</li>
            <li> Too big for 1 year olds maybe be better for big kids</li>
            <li> Wow they are better then I expected.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> First--they come in a lovely little box for storing them which my toddler loves to look through each morning to pick out bows to go with her outfit.  </li>
            <li> Lovely set for little girls, must have.</li>
            <li> This is a cute little set of bows.  </li>
            <li> Came in a cute little box.</li>
            <li> These bows fit as expected...</li>
            <li> Well made and they grasp very fine, small amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> Small and strong!</li>
            <li> These pieces are small and cute</li>
            <li> These are the first hairclips I have bought that my 2.5 year old will actually wear.  </li>
            <li> If the clips get wet the metal parts rust and the ribbon is so short that it detaches easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 17 so buying these when they were made for little girls is kind of awkward, but they were really too cute to pass up.</li>
            <li> Used on my 8 month old granddaughter who doesn&#x27;t even notice that she has them in her hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a gift, and the receiver just raves about the bows for her 2 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> so I use them for my 18 month old baby and my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li> My 21 month old wears these every day.  </li>
            <li> My 6 yr old is growing out her bangs and these</li>
            <li> but nearly every one of the bows and come off the clips.</li>
            <li> Our 5 year old daughter loves matching the clips and putting them in her hair.</li>
            <li> Bought for 1.5yr old niece.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for my 7-month old daughter who has a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> It was sent in a small necklace or earring size box which made it easy to gift wrap</li>
            <li> maybe a little big for my 18mo old with fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Be prepared with a little super glue as some of the bows come off the cilp...</li>
            <li> I think the size will be still be large enough for her for several years.</li>
            <li> and her hair is very fine and thin.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these even though my daughter is barely 6 months.  </li>
            <li> The clips are sturdy enough to hold up to frequent use.  </li>
            <li> Finally found some bows my 1.5 year old will keep in hair.</li>
            <li> You can get nicer handmade hair accessories for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li> old daughter has a lot of hair and traditional infant or toddler hair ties do not do the trick.  </li>
            <li> all of the bows fell off quickly exposing a small dot of glue holding it together.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but made very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these bow clips for little girls between the ages of 3 and 7 or 8 years old.  </li>
            <li> The wrapping protects my little ones hair from sticking &amp; looks much cuter than the metal snap.</li>
            <li> My little one loves to dump them out of the box and pick out the one she wants to wear for the day.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little more delicate looking.</li>
            <li> They are big enough to be seen, but not huge and are also varied in color so they match so much stuff.</li>
            <li> It is fun having such a big assortment so that she typically has at least one that matches.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s used to have stuff in her head all the time, but this is so hard to close that she tries to take them out right after.</li>
            <li> My daughter just turned 4 and if she could wear every single one of them on her head at the same time she would.</li>
            <li> But still does not stay for long.</li>
            <li> The only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because the bow clips are very heavy and easily slides out of my toddlers thin hair.</li>
            <li> They could work for younger kid with less hair maybe.</li>
            <li> the are super expensive</li>
            <li> They are well made - only one clip out of the bunch was a little bit loose.</li>
            <li> they arrive inside a white little box whitch</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful to watch if she &amp;#34;ditches&amp;#34; any clips.</li>
            <li> -- my daughter has dark brown hair and can&#x27;t see those clips</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are no more expensive than a product you would find at Claire&#x27;s, but the quality is much higher.</li>
            <li> They are little</li>
            <li> compared to other bow clippies I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I purchased these bow clips as gifts for little girls during a visit to Mongolia.  </li>
            <li> would recommend them for any little girl.</li>
            <li> So durable my daughter hasn&#x27;t destroyed it like other hair accessories in the past.</li>
            <li> Hopefully her little sister will when the time comes.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone with a little girl.</li>
            <li> They are a little pricey, but the quality doesn&#x27;t suffer.</li>
            <li> I like the way these clip in tightly, but are not so heavy that they pull her hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I like the clips because the work on it looks neat. , but unfortunately the red polka dot bow was missing from one of the clips.....</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s par for the course with this style and the way that little kids abuse them!</li>
            <li> My daughter wears these everyday!</li>
            <li> Since then I agree with previous reviewers that the quality is not good..  </li>
            <li> Two, if there are any hardware holding the clip together which could get caught in the hair, it is concealed behind the ribbon</li>
            <li> The cloth sticking comes out, bow comes out and clip becomes useless, unless you want to glue it again.</li>
            <li> but they are really expensive there is no point in buying something so expensive</li>
            <li> so we would have matching clips made it an expensive purchase.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy these!  </li>
            <li> My granddaughter has very thin hair and these clips work wonders!</li>
            <li> :(</li>

            <li> Fun colors and they stay in my daughter&#x27;s very fine hair.  They have held up very well, which is good since they were pricey.</li>
            <li> These bows are terrific.  First--they come in a lovely little box for storing them which my toddler loves to look through each morning to pick out bows to go with her outfit.  Second--they offer an excellent variety of colors, so they go with any outfit.  Third--they are a perfect size for little heads.  My daughter will wear two or three at a time and her head isn&#x27;t overwhelmed.  Fourth--because the clip part is wrapped in ribbon, the clip doesn&#x27;t rip out her hair when I remove it.  These weren&#x27;t the cheapest bow clips, but they are well worth the money!  Well done Hipgirl Boutique!</li>
            <li> Lovely set for little girls, must have. Only gripe I have is no two clips match but I guess thats the theme</li>
            <li> These bows are the perfect size for my two year old granddaughter, There are plenty of choices in this assortment of bows. They are little but she keeps them in her hair because they don&#x27;t bother her.</li>
            <li> Lovely array of clips.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s very well done, you could tell that it&#x27;s hand made and they did an excelent job! :) I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The cloth sticking comes out, bow comes out and clip becomes useless, unless you want to glue it again. But still does not stay for long.</li>
            <li> This is an adorable collection! Lots of great colors and they seem to be holding up ok compared to other bow clippies I&#x27;ve bought in the past. Be prepared with a little super glue as some of the bows come off the cilp...but that&#x27;s par for the course with this style and the way that little kids abuse them!</li>
            <li> Love these clips! I&#x27;ve been looking for clips like these and finally did on Amazon. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Best buy for the money. Cute and well made. Bought for a one year&lt;br /&gt;Old with fine hair. She kept&lt;br /&gt;It in.</li>
            <li> These are high quality and very cute. I bought them for my preschooler and love that the snap barrettes are ribbon wrapped. The color assortment is great. These are very practical. You can&#x27;t beat the price on this. I will definitely repurchase as gifts.</li>
            <li> Great product!  They stay in and my daughter loves them!</li>
            <li> My daughters love these!  I love Hipgirl products.  They don&#x27;t slip out of my 4 and 1 year olds&#x27;s hair and they are very well made.  The price is perfect too!  Great value!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these even though my daughter is barely 6 months.  We always keep a close eye on her when she is wearing them, but so far they are great and I love them.  My daughter has TONS of hair and they work great!</li>
            <li> I purchased these bow clips as gifts for little girls during a visit to Mongolia.  The clips are sturdy enough to hold up to frequent use.  Each bow is attractive and, can be mixed and matched or stand alone.  I highly recommend these bow clips for little girls between the ages of 3 and 7 or 8 years old.  Older girls would most likely want larger bows.</li>
            <li> The clips are adorable.  It was sent in a small necklace or earring size box which made it easy to gift wrap but the pins were in a plastic bag.  You&#x27;ll have to make sure you have a way to keep them organized or you&#x27;ll have to sort through them to find the matching pairs.</li>
            <li> These sweet bows are perfect.  The snap is well wrapped with fabric that perfectly matches the bow on each snap. The wrapping protects my little ones hair from sticking &amp; looks much cuter than the metal snap. They are big enough to be seen, but not huge and are also varied in color so they match so much stuff. Mine also came in a cute box to store them in. I would buy these again!</li>
            <li> This is a cute little set of bows.  Very light weight.  Used on my 8 month old granddaughter who doesn&#x27;t even notice that she has them in her hair.  She loves looking at herself in the mirror when she has them on because they are so colorful.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them for any little girl.</li>
            <li> There are made of good material and brightens up the style of her hair. The only thing is the are not in pairs, which would have been a plus.</li>
            <li> Their cute and their just what I thought they would be, they make a great add on to all the other hair clips I wear</li>
            <li> I was worried I&#x27;d end up with a hodge podge of different colors when I bought two boxes... But they matched great and are a big hit!</li>
            <li> These are really cute and slide easily into my 2 year old&#x27;s hair.  They also stay in fine hair well.  Colors are cute and the polka dot ones are sweet.  Very nice hair bows for a little girl...and we&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li> Adorable bows! They are the perfect size for my one year old. The clips stay put in her fine hair and there is a color for every outfit.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping super cute product more detail in them then normal hair bow. Only thing I wish they gave you a holder for them I bought two bulk orders of hair bows and needed to buy two hair bow holders</li>
            <li> These are really cute and work well even if the child doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair yet. They are very cute and are a great price!</li>
            <li> Fantastic bows!  As the Mom of two girls, we&#x27;ve tried many bows and barrettes.  These are great!  They&#x27;re well made and you get so many for the cost!  I&#x27;ve already recommended to friends!</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter is very exited with them.&lt;br /&gt;She wears them everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Will probably repeat the purchase when she looses all of them.</li>
            <li> These hair clips are very cute and would make any would compliment any little girls outfit.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to order them.</li>
            <li> I loved the little hair bows.  They are easy to use and the color assortment is fantastic.  I loved them so much I purchased a second box to have matching bows when two bows are needed at the same time.</li>
            <li> Very good product as Well as useful. I like everything of this product. I world recomend it to moms with newborns.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and match any outfit my daughter has!</li>
            <li> I bought this a gift, and the receiver just raves about the bows for her 2 year old daughter.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> My kid loved it......</li>
            <li> Finally found some bows my 1.5 year old will keep in hair. Love the variety of colors and stays in place.</li>
            <li> These are cute, but they seem awfully large for a little one&#x27;s heads.  I was hoping for something a little more delicate looking.</li>
            <li> These bows fit as expected... maybe a little big for my 18mo old with fine hair.  Would love to have the bow a little more centered lengthwise.  But clips still very cute and colorful.</li>
            <li> Super cute in person!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and its a very well made product! So durable my daughter hasn&#x27;t destroyed it like other hair accessories in the past. Definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> These are very cute.  My grand daughter is only 2  and her hair is very fine and thin.  They don&#x27;t stay in very well but.....  they do stay in better than any others we have tried!!  Awesome range of colors!</li>
            <li> These pieces are small and cute so I use them for my 18 month old baby and my 3 yr old.They are surprisingly durable and that is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love these clips.  They are very cute.</li>
            <li> My daughter wears them every day, has for 2 years.  They are so cute, and the color options are great.  I haven&#x27;t met an outfit yet that they don&#x27;t work with.</li>
            <li> Too big for 1 year olds maybe be better for big kids</li>
            <li> These hair bows are very cute and they work well in my one-year-old daughter&#x27;s medium length, curly hair!  There are also several colors and patterns, which match most of her clothes.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money! :) These clips were well made &amp; are strong enough for my 2 year olds head of hair......and adorable and work great!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my toddler. Lots of colors to match all of her outfits.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good construction, and really cute designs. I am very happy with this product.  I would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> The clips are adorable and look like the picture, exact same colors and designs, but, to put it on a baby head... hassle and pain.&lt;br /&gt;My baby is 11 months and she&#x27;s used to have stuff in her head all the time, but this is so hard to close that she tries to take them out right after. I ended up using it to keep my hair in place.</li>
            <li> After my child borrowed a barette like these from a friend and it actually stayed in her hair I was thrilled to find them here on Amazon. They are just a basic metal hair clip wrapped in ribbon, but the ribbon gives them a more secure grip and keeps them from slipping in fine hair. My kids love the fun selection of colors and patterns. They are well made - only one clip out of the bunch was a little bit loose. They were shipped quickly and came in a nice padded gift box where they are kept.</li>
            <li> great buy and held up well</li>
            <li> I bought these clips for my 2 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair. They stay put, which is great, and they&#x27;re wrapped with ribbon so they don&#x27;t rip her hair out when she pulls on them. They&#x27;re also not too big, which is helpful.</li>
            <li> These are cute but not as cute as I thought they might be.  My daughter does not reach for them at all.  Hopefully her little sister will when the time comes.  I also think they were kind of pricey.  You can get nicer handmade hair accessories for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 10 mo and they are SUPER cute!</li>
            <li> I got these for my baby girl and I love them! Well made and they grasp very fine, small amounts of hair. Very pleased and she receives lots of compliments. :)</li>
            <li> My 2 yr. old daughter has a lot of hair and traditional infant or toddler hair ties do not do the trick.  I like the way these clip in tightly, but are not so heavy that they pull her hair.  She isn&#x27;t constantly pulling at the bows trying to take them out.  Also, they are sturdy, fabric-wise....should last.</li>
            <li> I love these bows! They are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for for my two year old daughter. They stay put much better than traditional &amp;#34;alligator clip&amp;#34; bows which is a must when trying to keep her curly hair out of her eyes. The clip itself is wrapped in ribbon so it doesn&#x27;t pull at her hair. The colors are great - there is a nice variety to wear with all sorts of different outfits. My little one loves to dump them out of the box and pick out the one she wants to wear for the day. They are perfect for ages 2-4, large enough to look pretty but not so big or heavy that they fall out. I&#x27;d purchase again!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what i was expecting..i received 22 different bow clips(not pair),and my daughter loves them..they arrive inside a white little box whitch makes them look even more adorable!!!</li>
            <li> My 21 month old wears these every day.  They match with almost every outfit.  I either make a side braid or just clip her hair back with them.  She took them off in the beginning, but now she leaves them on.</li>
            <li> I really like them :)</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these clips. She can&#x27;t do her hair enough times during the day to switch them around. They are very pretty and durable. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> These boutique are pretty and very nice. My niece love it .</li>
            <li> Cute and great colors but all of the bows fell off quickly exposing a small dot of glue holding it together. We&#x27;re left with just the clip part now. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Cute and good quality.</li>
            <li> She lost some so I had to order more because they&#x27;re too cute</li>
            <li> I love these snap clips! I bought them for my twin daughters&#x27; hair and they are awesome! The colors are great and the picture is truly representative of what you get. The clip part that actually holds the hair is wrapped with ribbon which is great for two reasons: One, one of my twin daughters has fine, thin hair and these really hold her hair better than any other snap clip I&#x27;ve found. Two, if there are any hardware holding the clip together which could get caught in the hair, it is concealed behind the ribbon so I these have never caught in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;One of my 3-year olds takes the clips (any clips) out of her hair so I have to be careful to watch if she &amp;#34;ditches&amp;#34; any clips. I&#x27;ve lost enough of them now that I need to order more and I&#x27;m definitely ordering more of these. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are well made and super cute... plus my daughter LOVES them.</li>
            <li> I love these! She has one to fit almost every outfit! Durable, cute and perfect size for my big headed cutie.</li>
            <li> I have been using these almost every day since I got these on my girls hair and on mine. They are SUPER cute and work well. My 3 year old has very fine hair but these help hold her bangs out of her face no problem. Wish I had found them sooner!</li>
            <li> These are excellent in my daughter&#x27;s hair, they don&#x27;t fall out! I love that I can match them to her outfits.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that there were more brighter, child-friendly colors in lieu of the black and brown tones -- my daughter has dark brown hair and can&#x27;t see those clips so I won&#x27;t end up using those. I realize that some people have blond or red hair but it would more useful to have colors that ALL hair colors can benefit from.</li>
            <li> These are the first hairclips I have bought that my 2.5 year old will actually wear.  It is fun having such a big assortment so that she typically has at least one that matches. If only we had a navy and a gray...those neutrals are essential! They hold well and are the perfect size for a toddler with bangs falling in her eyes.</li>
            <li> These bows are the perfect size for my 3 year old daughter.  Tons of great colors - she has so much fun picking one out each day.</li>
            <li> These are great for keeping my two year old&#x27;s hair out of her face. I would recommend to anyone with a little girl.</li>
            <li> These are so cute. Fit well for my toddler</li>
            <li> Great bows, look adorable in, well-made and stays put.</li>
            <li> High quality, nice classy designs and sturdy.  Girls love it.  Wearing them already at school.  look great in their blonde hair!</li>
            <li> These are perfect! My 6 yr old is growing out her bangs and these are the only clips we&#x27;ve had that don&#x27;t slide out!  And with so many colors to match her outfits!</li>
            <li> Adorable clips. They fit perfectly in my daughter&#x27;s hair and do a wonderful job keeping my daughter&#x27;s hair out of her face.</li>
            <li> Wow they are better then I expected. They do not pull my daughters hair and the stay in place. I am very happy with the money spent.</li>
            <li> These bows fall apart easily but they&#x27;re cute.</li>
            <li> I love these kind of hair bows with the clips. My granddaughter has very thin hair and these clips work wonders!</li>
            <li> Pretty bows, well made, great colors. The only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because the bow clips are very heavy and easily slides out of my toddlers thin hair. Maybe some no slip gripping would help.</li>
            <li> I like the clips because the work on it looks neat. , but unfortunately the red polka dot bow was missing from one of the clips.....</li>
            <li> These were so cute and I loved the colors but nearly every one of the bows and come off the clips. :( I keep having to glue them back on if they fall off in the house but if it happens at school....gone! Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> These clips are well put together, nice big clips and very cute!  My daughter loved them!  We gave them away in her birthday party favor bags.</li>
            <li> There are times you wish you were a kid again (Jello, naptime, coloring all day) ... this product is one of the many, many reasons it would be great to be a kid again. These are absolutely adorable. My daughter just turned 4 and if she could wear every single one of them on her head at the same time she would. They are excellent quality and absolutely gorgeous. And, well worth the price. These are no more expensive than a product you would find at Claire&#x27;s, but the quality is much higher.</li>
            <li> Really cute and just right for my two year old daughter. Even the clips are wrapped in ribbon. I&#x27;ll buy these again!</li>
            <li> These hair bow snap clips are very cute. Vibrant colors and a great variety. My daughter wears these everyday! The variety of colors go with all her outfits. They stay in place nicely. I&#x27;m very happy with them and certainly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Best clip bows I ever purchased for my daughter!  They are high quality!  Love the extra fashion material wrapped around clip to match the bow.  My daughter wears one everyday and her friends just love them!  I would definitely purchase again.  Great variety in box.  Worth the price!  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy these!  Quality and cute!</li>
            <li> These look so cute on my little girl; I am going to need to order more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 17 so buying these when they were made for little girls is kind of awkward, but they were really too cute to pass up. They&#x27;re well made and stay in my hair, and the colors are vibrant; exactly what you get in the picture. They are a little pricey, but the quality doesn&#x27;t suffer.</li>
            <li> Excellent clips! Great for little girls heads... Small and strong! Only wish I had ordered two to have matching pairs.</li>
            <li> Strong,beautiful &amp; cute......</li>
            <li> Big hit with my niece!</li>
            <li> These clips are so cute and they stay on fine hair quite well.</li>
            <li> These little clips are so cute and they are made well!  I used them to help decorate a diaper cake and I know they will look so sweet&lt;br /&gt;in my new granddaughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these snaps could be used for a lot of hair, but for a small child they are perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter whose hair kept falling in her face.  Not only are they cute, they stay in place!  This was a great bargain and I would suggest to any parent whose constantly fixing your little girls hair to consider buying these bows!</li>
            <li> These are just darling and they stay in my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Love them! My 3 year old loves to line them up and pick the right one for her outfit. Adorable. Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> These bows are very pretty.  I bought 2 packs so that I could have two of each color and pattern for a two yr. old grand daughters pig tails.  I place them near the elastic bands of the ponytails and the size is very nice.  I think the size will be still be large enough for her for several years.</li>
            <li> Good I got it on time and ready to use</li>
            <li> These are so fabulous, I ordered two sets for my daughter&#x27;s pigtails. They stay in place and are adorable. The bows are especially great for those mornings when my husband is tasked with dressing our daughter-- he can pop them into her hair in a second!</li>
            <li> Very GOOD set. Pretty also! GREAT Buy.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but made very well.</li>
            <li> These bows look very beautiful but they are really expensive there is no point in buying something so expensive the are super expensive so I don&#x27;t recommend buying them :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this and didn&#x27;t pay attention to the picture.  When I received I realized that there was only one of each design, which doesn&#x27;t make sense as most girls wear one on each side.  Having to order a second set so we would have matching clips made it an expensive purchase.  Since then I agree with previous reviewers that the quality is not good..  If the clips get wet the metal parts rust and the ribbon is so short that it detaches easily.  So many colors, but where is blue?  I would not order again</li>
            <li> These clips are amazing.  My 3-1/2 year old granddaughter loves the clip kind because she tries to do her hair all by herself and she can actually do the clips.  Great product recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Love the vibrant colours and that for every solid colour there is a dotted equivalent.  Our 5 year old daughter loves matching the clips and putting them in her hair.</li>
            <li> Bought for 1.5yr old niece. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully wrapped, bows are secured well, excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> Came in a cute little box. And all the colors!! So many to choose from and so cute! I snap one in my 7 month daughter&#x27;s hair, and we are good to go!</li>
            <li> Love clippies! These have a different color for all of my outfits! So cute, I just wish the clip part was a bit bigger</li>
            <li> So cute! ! Bigger than you think~</li>
            <li> Super-fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and color selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these for my 7-month old daughter who has a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> They are cute for babies. I wanted something for my 4 year old and they are not really what I thought. They could work for younger kid with less hair maybe. The colors are more for babies than for 4 year old.</li>
            <li> my baby looks super cute in these.  enough said. buy it!  clips stay put for the most part (until my daughter accidentally pulls it out of her hair)</li>
            <li> These are adorable and very well made! I love the variety of colors and styles!  They will be put to good use!</li>
            <li> it looks nice, but the cloth sticking come out easily</li>
