            <li>I have used this developer for many years now.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this if you are looking to lighten your hair by two or more levels.</li>
            <li>I was able to get my hair to change to a nice, bright shade of red.</li>
            <li>so be sure it is 40 volume that you want, but all the L&#x27;oreal developers have worked great for me on many different hair types.</li>
            <li>It helps my hair dye be super bright love it with my red hair dye &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Worked great with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Quick Blue Powder Bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides a good level of lightening for very blonde shades.</li>
            <li>full well I might be burning my hair off by bleaching it again.</li>
            <li>I used this creme developer along with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach and got good results.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Great developer if you need to bleach very dark hair.</li>
            <li>If used correctly with the right bleach it works miracles, however mine&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved my results and used this in combination with loreal highlights for dark haired in blonde and got a gorgeous caramel brown on both my natural hair and extensions</li>
            <li>but when I just need to touch up or don&#x27;t want to break the bank on my hair, this product does very little damage and lightens very effectively.</li>
            <li>SO SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>Use it all the time and it lasted 3 or 4 different hair dyeing times I love it.</li>
            <li>so I had to use this more than once to get Blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I used this developer with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach 1 Lb (available on Amazon.com)</li>
            <li>My hair was damaged, but still not as light as I wanted, so I took a chance and used this with the Quick Blue, knowing</li>
            <li>Great product, turned my hair from medium brown to blonde, but I would highly recommend using the blue lightning powder to go with it to achieve maximum results.</li>
            <li>find out that it not cheap than i though, and it is strong, just dye one time and can get light blond</li>
            <li>It was surprisingly gentle on my hair for a 40 volume developer.</li>
            <li>The shade I was aiming for seemed to be achieved with less time and greater result using this level.</li>
            <li>I used this developer with Quick Blue hair bleach.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this developer.</li>
            <li>nice thick formula, made for minimum dripping</li>
            <li>In the long run, it is cheaper to buy this and the Quick Blue than multiple boxed kits and the color is much more natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only brand of developer that I trust to deliver consistent results.</li>
            <li>Would totally recommend to anyone who wants to bleach or lift color at home.</li>
            <li>I used this with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue and it bleaches my dark brown hair to blonde.</li>
            <li>I have jet black hair that takes color pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Paired with Quick Blue, this will take you from black to blonde within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Also, the combination of this with the Quick Blue achieved a dark blonde on my naturally dark brown hair and the new color isn&#x27;t brassy at all.</li>
            <li>This product performs as advertised to go with my L&#x27;oreal HiColor dye, helping to bleach my black hair to a strawberry blonde, and works better than developers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>i was tryn to get my dark hair vibrant red and with this product i finally achieved it...</li>

            <li> Arrived quickly. Worked great.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I used this with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue and it bleaches my dark brown hair to blonde.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started forcing myself to look at the companies that make the beauty products I&#x27;m considering purchasing.  L&#x27;Oreal has funded great research into developing an alternative to animal testing.  But it hasn&#x27;t actually stopped animal testing, yet.  It&#x27;s close.  I&#x27;m only writing this review to save someone else time in researching this.  I hate having to research cruelty-free hair products.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Dark black hair is now brightest red!  Feeling like a mermaid!  Use as directed.  Don&#x27;t be lazy measure the amount to be used.</li>
            <li> If used correctly with the right bleach it works miracles, however mine&lt;br /&gt;was 1/4 empty when i got it in the mail and didnt have a seal??</li>
            <li> nice thick formula, made for minimum dripping</li>

            <li> this product worked great for the look I was trying to achieve. It is very easy to use. Do not forget to always use gloves with this product.</li>
            <li> I used this developer with the Clairol Bw2 powder lightner and it worked perfectly! I dyed my hair from black to an ombre of colors blonde, auburn and dark brown so this developer does the job...I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I used this developer with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach 1 Lb (available on Amazon.com) and I&#x27;m totally thrilled with the results. I do visit a salon when I can afford to spend a day there but when I just need to touch up or don&#x27;t want to break the bank on my hair, this product does very little damage and lightens very effectively. I am dark blond and use 40 vol creme with the aforementioned bleach powder to lighten my hair to platinum in about a half hour. Really good stuff, have been bleaching for almost 7 years and this is a great product compared to others I&#x27;ve tried. Would totally recommend to anyone who wants to bleach or lift color at home.

            <li> I used this with the L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Hicolor Highlights to dye my hair red. Worked great. I was able to get my hair to change to a nice, bright shade of red.</li>
            <li> Worked great with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Quick Blue Powder Bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Minimal smell.&lt;br /&gt;-Didn&#x27;t make my skin hurt.&lt;br /&gt;-Good sturdy bottle (my order was packed rather badly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-none.</li>
            <li> SO SO MUCH! It came on time, I use it on my hair when i want to bleach it. Its good... no more to say.</li>
            <li> This product performs as advertised to go with my L&#x27;oreal HiColor dye, helping to bleach my black hair to a strawberry blonde, and works better than developers I&#x27;ve used in the past. I would definately buy again.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time and it lasted 3 or 4 different hair dyeing times I love it. It helps my hair dye be super bright love it with my red hair dye &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I just touch up my roots with it...no surprises ...always works the way I need it to work...I trust this product...</li>
            <li> I like the produkt and the hole transaction was quick and &amp;iacute;&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the different brands of developer they all do the same thing. For me it was just about watching and seeing what the end result would be and taking my time. I absolutely loved my results and used this in combination with loreal highlights for dark haired in blonde and got a gorgeous caramel brown on both my natural hair and extensions and it only took 2 hours from shampoo washing and dying to rinsing and blow drying. VERY Satisfied!</li>
            <li> Goes great with loreal quick.blue bleach powder</li>
            <li> Great developer if you need to bleach very dark hair. My hair is dark brown and after bleaching was a yellowish blonde</li>
            <li> Works great, and has a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it works great. The one I received was packaged poorly resulting in the lid breaking at some point. When I opened it the developer was all over the inside of the box and there was mud smeared across the bottle. Spend a few extra dollars and buy from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and does a good job of lifting.  It&#x27;s the only brand of developer that I trust to deliver consistent results.</li>
            <li> I used this developer with Quick Blue hair bleach. It was surprisingly gentle on my hair for a 40 volume developer. I had previously only used boxed kits to bleach my hair. My hair was damaged, but still not as light as I wanted, so I took a chance and used this with the Quick Blue, knowing full well I might be burning my hair off by bleaching it again. My hair lightened with no visible additional damage. Also, the combination of this with the Quick Blue achieved a dark blonde on my naturally dark brown hair and the new color isn&#x27;t brassy at all. Very pleased with this. In the long run, it is cheaper to buy this and the Quick Blue than multiple boxed kits and the color is much more natural. I would highly recommend this developer.</li>
            <li> i was tryn to get my dark hair vibrant red and with this product i finally achieved it...awsome product for dark hair</li>
            <li> Great product, turned my hair from medium brown to blonde, but I would highly recommend using the blue lightning powder to go with it to achieve maximum results.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, tight curled hair that&#x27;s been through many keratin treatments. My hairdresser has used it for over 2 years and it&#x27;s AMAZING!! I tried it myself (I moved recently) and it worked just as well when I did it!</li>
            <li> Great for lifting hair -- if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Good quality developer!</li>
            <li> Great value. Great price. Worked great.</li>
            <li> Invariably I would end up with lots of extra powder from my &amp;#34;lightening&amp;#34; packet.....but without sufficient creme developer.  Now, with the additional creme,  I don&#x27;t waste the extra powder.  This saves me money, space, and time.  The developer is excellent in quality, as well.</li>
            <li> find out that it not cheap than i though, and it is strong, just dye one time and can get light blond</li>
            <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t make me hair feel damaged after dye. I&#x27;ve bought like 4 over the past year and will be buying it next time I dye mine or someone else&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> Loved it. I used this creme developer along with L&#x27;Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach and got good results. My wife&#x27;s hair is Jet Black so I had to use this more than once to get Blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Worked well and didn&#x27;t have any issues. Came on time and worked as intended.</li>
            <li> great price good product fast ship</li>
