    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but I am definitely impressed with what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>and I love the results!!!</li>
            <li>I used Latisse after trying this product and received good results, then went on to use LiLash which gave me incredible results!  </li>
            <li>Hey, I&#x27;m not complaining, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff!  </li>
            <li>I am a huge skeptic of products that advertise incredible results.</li>
            <li>I also see that some strands are growing on top my my lashes!</li>
            <li>You will love the results!</li>
            <li>I will be honest and admit that there was about a 3 month break in which I didn&#x27;t use any.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s and never had the greatest lashes.  </li>
            <li>I will gladly pay $96.00 a tube to keep these lashes of mine looking like they do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do! :)</li>
            <li>look better than ever.</li>
            <li>My lashes are longer, fuller and more noticeable even without mascara.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply -</li>
            <li>It will take about 4 weeks to see results but it really works, love it!</li>
            <li>but I got cheap and tried to save some money.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone, no matter what size your original lash size is.</li>
            <li>so I am looking forward to seeing the full effect of the product in 20 days time.</li>
            <li>Also, the product has a full year guarantee</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff, at great expense, a few months ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey; but worth every penny and one tube lasts for about three months.  </li>
            <li>Enormous Lash by Beauty Society produces nice results within 7 to 14 days.    </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off spending a little more and getting Revitalash instead.</li>
            <li>I very much recommend EL &amp; will buy it again.</li>
            <li>First off, my lashes did grow.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit much for the size, but it works!</li>
            <li>I recommended this product to several of my girlfriends who are now true believers of this product!</li>
            <li>The good news is, a bottle can last you a very long time (even with 2 applications per day).</li>
            <li>I used Revitalash last year and noticed a HUGE change in length after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>To address the eye irritation issue, don&#x27;t put so much formula on your brush.  </li>
            <li>also have had the professional semi permanent lashes before and my lashes now look 2X&#x27;s better than when I paid over $500.00 for the semi permanent ones that didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t blessed with those georgous long full lash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even looking into Beauty Society other products available.</li>
            <li>My lashes definitely have more volume to them - there is the odd lash that is longer than the rest.</li>
            <li>So far the product has been working as advertised, will continue to use, and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>ENORMOUS LASH really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes about 3 weeks to really see a big difference in the growth but</li>
            <li>Okay, I go out of my way to by products like this and to only find out I wasted my time and money!</li>
            <li>highly recommend Enormous Lash to one and ALL!!!!</li>

            <li> I only have to use a small amount of mascara to really set them off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just yesterday at lunch a friend of mine was going on and on about how long my eye lashes looked.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to work some, but I&#x27;ve been using for 4 weeks and by no means are my lashes long and luscious.</li>
            <li> I used this in the past (back in late 2009) and saw some decent results... growth... a bit stronger... but noticed with the next purchase my eyelashes were gradually going back to there former stubby selves.  </li>
            <li> The other 9 months I did use this product on a daily basis.    </li>
            <li> man, give it 4 weeks and they almost are too long!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a single lash fall out during this time.</li>
            <li> my icy turquoise blue eyes turned dull blue with no lashes after 45 days of use.</li>
            <li> Turned out to be a big waste.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other products that I tried, EL did not irritate my eyes as LiLash did.  </li>
            <li> I used this products for about 3 months with absolutely no results!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can claim to be getting results from this when it doesn&#x27;t have an active ingredient.</li>
            <li> So in the end I did see slight results.</li>
            <li> Before EL I was using thickening/lengthening mascaras &amp; now I&#x27;m using black tinting mascara &amp; my lashes</li>
            <li> I found their products mediocre, but the enormous lash was the biggest let down.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve taken a before pic, as the results are slow so its very hard to judge the actual change.</li>
            <li> and there is no (or very little) difference.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on in the morning and after I wash my face before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> Normally I am very impatient with products</li>
            <li> Waterproof mascara can be very harsh on your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost year now and see no results, not even a little... don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would make my lashes darker (like some reviewers claim) but putting on a coat of mascara is the least of my worries.</li>
            <li> It works slowly</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not too bad of a growth, but not enough to justify paying $100/bottle.</li>
            <li> I got a bit annoyed and thought I had just waisted a lot of my money.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other brands on the market and have paid almost twice the price and have been disappointed by all the others.  </li>
            <li> so I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been following directions and using this product for 10 weeks now and there is no (or very little) difference. I used Revitalash last year and noticed a HUGE change in length after 6 weeks. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product. You&#x27;re better off spending a little more and getting Revitalash instead. I wish I stayed with the product I knew worked but I got cheap and tried to save some money. Turned out to be a big waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s and never had the greatest lashes.  They are short and now getting thinner.  After using this product, they are noticeably thicker and somewhat longer.  It took a while; but that was not an issue.  Unlike other products that I tried, EL did not irritate my eyes as LiLash did.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey; but worth every penny and one tube lasts for about three months.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far the product has been working as advertised, will continue to use, and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff, at great expense, a few months ago. I gave it 6 weeks, and saw no result, so moved on to Lilash (does work, but not as well as Latisse/Lumigan). Not only did Enormous Lash not work, but it has a greasy consistency that made my makeup disappear after application. Save your money -- invest in Lilash or Latisse.</li>
            <li> I have been using Enormous Lash for about a year, and I finally have decided to stop. The reason being: not enough results for the money I invest. I started using Enormous Lash about a year ago. I will be honest and admit that there was about a 3 month break in which I didn&#x27;t use any. The other 9 months I did use this product on a daily basis.    First off, my lashes did grow. I have extremely short eyelashes to start with (I am Asian), and in the end my lashes are about 30% longer. That&#x27;s not too bad of a growth, but not enough to justify paying $100/bottle. The good news is, a bottle can last you a very long time (even with 2 applications per day). So in the end I did see slight results. I just don&#x27;t have the patience nor money to continue using this product any further.</li>
            <li> I used this products for about 3 months with absolutely no results!  I used Latisse after trying this product and received good results, then went on to use LiLash which gave me incredible results!  Just yesterday at lunch a friend of mine was going on and on about how long my eye lashes looked.  I was a distributor for the Enormous Lash company (Beauty Society).  I found their products mediocre, but the enormous lash was the biggest let down.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!</li>
            <li> my icy turquoise blue eyes turned dull blue with no lashes after 45 days of use. i&#x27;m devastated and demand compensation</li>
            <li> Okay, I go out of my way to by products like this and to only find out I wasted my time and money! SO I been searching for something like this by trying different types of product after looking at reviews after reviews I decided to try this one. ENORMOUS LASH really works. I&#x27;m asian so I wasn&#x27;t blessed with those georgous long full lash but after 3 weeks of trying out this product I totally see the difference not only is it longer I also see that some strands are growing on top my my lashes! I highly recommend this. I&#x27;m even looking into Beauty Society other products available.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!  I have purchased other brands on the market and have paid almost twice the price and have been disappointed by all the others.  This one is a keeper!  I will gladly pay $96.00 a tube to keep these lashes of mine looking like they do.&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 3 weeks to really see a big difference in the growth but man, give it 4 weeks and they almost are too long! Hey, I&#x27;m not complaining, it&#x27;s great.  I only have to use a small amount of mascara to really set them off.&lt;br /&gt;I also have had the professional semi permanent lashes before and my lashes now look 2X&#x27;s better than when I paid over $500.00 for the semi permanent ones that didn&#x27;t last but maybe 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Enormous Lash to one and ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost three weeks now. I haven&#x27;t noticed a single lash fall out during this time. The product is easy to apply - I usually put it on in the morning and after I wash my face before going to sleep. My lashes definitely have more volume to them - there is the odd lash that is longer than the rest. On the product description it states that maximum results take 45-90 days so I am looking forward to seeing the full effect of the product in 20 days time. I have already recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Normally I am very impatient with products so when I didn&#x27;t see immediate results I got a bit annoyed and thought I had just waisted a lot of my money. But I kept on using Enormous lash every night before going to sleep and after about 6 weeks I noticed a big difference in the length and thickness of my lashes! Especially when I applied mascara. I would recommend this product to anyone, no matter what size your original lash size is. You will love the results! I do! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can claim to be getting results from this when it doesn&#x27;t have an active ingredient. That prostaglandin they&#x27;re bragging about removing? Yeah, that&#x27;d be the growth stimulator. I wish I had done my homework instead of shelling over money for a glorified eyelash conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am a huge skeptic of products that advertise incredible results. The only reason I bought this was because I had just gotten some cash for my birthday... I would never go into my monthly budget for something like this. Also, the product has a full year guarantee so I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;ve been using EL for 5 (maybe 6) weeks. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve had the results some of the reviewers claim but I am definitely impressed with what I&#x27;ve seen. I wish I would&#x27;ve taken a before pic, as the results are slow so its very hard to judge the actual change. My lashes don&#x27;t look like the after pic advertised but they are thicker, fuller &amp; longer. I was hoping it would make my lashes darker (like some reviewers claim) but putting on a coat of mascara is the least of my worries. Before EL I was using thickening/lengthening mascaras &amp; now I&#x27;m using black tinting mascara &amp; my lashes look better than ever. I very much recommend EL &amp; will buy it again. BUY IT &amp; TRY IT ... you have nothing to lose!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Enormous Lash for almost a year now and I love the results!!! My lashes are longer, fuller and more noticeable even without mascara. I recommended this product to several of my girlfriends who are now true believers of this product!</li>
            <li> It will take about 4 weeks to see results but it really works, love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Enormous Lash for about a month now. My lashes are longer and seem thicker. I started noticing a difference after a couple of weeks. The directions say that after lashes reach the desired length you can reduce the use to 3 times/week.</li>
            <li> I noticed a co-workers lashes were longer than they used to be and she recommended this product.  It works slowly but you&#x27;ll see a difference in about a month of use.  Now when I put mascara, you can see longer lashes.  I use it for my eyebrows as well.  The price is a bit much for the size, but it works!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands.  Enormous Lash by Beauty Society produces nice results within 7 to 14 days.    Waterproof mascara can be very harsh on your eyelashes.  One coat of Enormous Lash and a coat of CILS lash conditioner by Lancome before going to bed and problem solved.    To address the eye irritation issue, don&#x27;t put so much formula on your brush.  A little goes a long way.  My tubes of Enormous Lash have lasted 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Does not work! I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost year now and see no results, not even a little... don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I used this in the past (back in late 2009) and saw some decent results... growth... a bit stronger... but noticed with the next purchase my eyelashes were gradually going back to there former stubby selves.  I&#x27;m guessing the formula was changed.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work some, but I&#x27;ve been using for 4 weeks and by no means are my lashes long and luscious.</li>
