            <li>It is a convenient size and easy to find.</li>
            <li>Having these makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Great multiple package prices here on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really is a nice &amp; handy thing, but the only thing that makes me prefer some of the rice paper versions more (when I can get them) is that the material really isn&#x27;t all that healthy for the environment.</li>
            <li>I really feel that&#x27;s a great deal for how much you get.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t rub off any makeup, and you can see the oil they clean off your face.</li>
            <li>The clean and clear oil-absorbing sheets are amazing, Works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love that these really do absorb the oil without removing any makeup.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with these oil absorbing pads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has become more the &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; type and</li>
            <li>I love Clean &amp; Clear oil-absorbing sheets!</li>
            <li>these are great for oily skin and hot weather, when you cannot wash your face but need a little clean.</li>
            <li>Less oil on my skin which lets my pores breath a bit more!!</li>
            <li>The oil absorption is much greater than other brands, but the most important part of these oil absorbing sheets is the fact that it is easy to tell how much of the sheet has been used.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>It takes away the shine and leaves my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I used to powder my face constantly, but this is a MUCH better solution.</li>
            <li>These oil-absorbing sheets do exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I use them daily and love how they remove oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks again  5 STARS!</li>
            <li>My skin gets oily during the day and it helps me to remove the oil in a second without touching any make</li>
            <li>ALSO keeps your make up on while absorbing oil!</li>
            <li>I use them daily at the office to keep my oily skin looking and feeling better.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s lovely to carry around ONE product -- these sheets -- instead of extra foundation, concealer, etc.)</li>
            <li>, it would be that these packages come inside an excessive amount of plastic, most of which is surely going to end up in a landfill.</li>
            <li>do exactly the job they were intended to do.</li>
            <li>and you can see how much oil you got off!</li>
            <li>As I go to school in a hot, humid city, I was once used to coming home covered in grease (yuck) and feeling like I needed to towel off my skin.</li>
            <li>and you may be able to find these for around $3 each at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>This helped me soo much!</li>
            <li>I have been A Clean &amp; Clear fan..</li>
            <li>Thanks, Clean &amp; Clear!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and these remove the excess oil but leaves any makeup intact.</li>
            <li>Color was off - nothing like the real product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t absorb face oil as well as the real product.</li>
            <li>Really takes away that bothersome shine I been trying to get rid of for a while.</li>
            <li>Really I like this product because it takes the shine away from my face.</li>
            <li>I really like the oil-absorbing sheets.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years &amp; really like them.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re curious about oil absorbing sheets in general, they work great for mid day touch ups or those nights before bed when you don&#x27;t want to get your face wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>These were great for getting rid of the oil on my nose and keeping my glasses from slipping down my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and wow, i can&#x27;t believe how much oil it can find!</li>
            <li>They feel like a plastic glove, which is odd, but I am definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I started using these in high school or college.</li>
            <li>I have real oily skin, The sheets are soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li>Overall, these are worth every penny for one who has oily or combination skin.</li>
            <li>They work better than dry shampoo and no white residue!  </li>
            <li>and I live in a humid part of the country.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, clear n clear oil absorbing sheets are a must have.</li>
            <li>My handkerchief doesn&#x27;t have to work as hard to remove the oil from my face :-)</li>
            <li>I use several a day and am always amazed at how much excess oil they remove.</li>
            <li>I have tried some of the Japanese versions of this product and none of them really are absorbent as these sheets.</li>
            <li>The sticky area will pick up a sheet and have it ready for you, the next time you want to use one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While these may be more expensive to buy than some of the others on Amazon, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It also does not mess up your makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One sheet is enough to keep me oil free for a few hours, but I always touch up when I&#x27;m looking shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for those whose faces look like an oil spill, or you know, even if it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li>and they turn clear so you can see that they are actually working.</li>
            <li>Some other brands make it hard to tell if a sheet is all used up, so many extra may be wasted trying to clean up all of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t mess up your make up while absorbing the oil.</li>
            <li>I am quite an oily face and usually with other types of oil absorbing sheets they break after absorbing the oil.</li>

            <li> I am quite an oily face and usually with other types of oil absorbing sheets they break after absorbing the oil.</li>
            <li> Plus like the other reviewer stated, the huge plastic packaging for the packet is completely unnecessary &amp; wasteful for something that you are just going to throw away a second later.</li>
            <li> whatever material this is) absorbing sheets, I usually prefer this brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow! cleans up my slick in seconds - and actually seems to keep it from coming back!</li>
            <li> We have tried other brands that have the blue paper (CVS and Walgreens brands) and they work just as well.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, doesn&#x27;t ruin if make-up if you have it on and leaves oily skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> This is a major advantage when you don&#x27;t have time to wash your face, don&#x27;t want to redo your makeup, or have no easy access to running water.</li>
            <li> The packet has a little sticky bit on it so that when you open it, a sheet will pop out for use.</li>
            <li> At least the rice paper will eventually disintegrate, while this will stick around for far longer.</li>
            <li> After I get done using it, my face feels so much fresher and free on all those nasty oils.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice a little rectangle of paper on the inside of the carrier cover.</li>
            <li> My 3 daughters use these little sheets.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave them four stars is due to the excessive and unnecessary plastic packaging.</li>
            <li> I used to wash my face a few times a day, but now I just carry one of these packs around with me in my coat</li>
            <li> With the sheets i can go a few hours before i have to use 1 or 2 of them again</li>
            <li> He won&#x27;t go anywhere without them and uses them a few times a day.</li>
            <li> They are small but work well,</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin that I manage with lemon soap, lemon lotion, daily mud/mint masks, and exfoliating; not to mention these bad boys.</li>
            <li> learned this the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> noticed a negative review where the reviewer indicated there were difficulties involved in getting the sheets out of the carrier.</li>
            <li> I had one complaint</li>
            <li> buy this product with caution if you&#x27;re a serious make-up wearer like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking concealer, foundation, setting powder, highlighting, and everything that goes with serious make-up application.</li>
            <li> it is very hard to set a piece of sheet out of package and did not work well on my face</li>
            <li> These are expensive though, so do some price comparison</li>

            <li> Great to use. Works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those individuals who are unlucky enough to have an oily face. That&#x27;s why sheets like these are such a necessity for me. Out of all of the brands of the plastic (or whatever material this is) absorbing sheets, I usually prefer this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheets work like a dream- I can feel the difference almost immediately as well as see the immediate results via my face &amp; the oil sheet. The packet has a little sticky bit on it so that when you open it, a sheet will pop out for use. (Although over time some of the sticky bits have faded, depending on how often you open the packet.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a nice &amp; handy thing, but the only thing that makes me prefer some of the rice paper versions more (when I can get them) is that the material really isn&#x27;t all that healthy for the environment. At least the rice paper will eventually disintegrate, while this will stick around for far longer. Plus like the other reviewer stated, the huge plastic packaging for the packet is completely unnecessary &amp; wasteful for something that you are just going to throw away a second later.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful - they really do absorb the oil on my forehead easily and take the shine off my nose. will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, doesn&#x27;t ruin if make-up if you have it on and leaves oily skin feeling dry. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I discovered these!  I have very oily skin and these remove the excess oil but leaves any makeup intact. I used to powder my face constantly, but this is a MUCH better solution. I use several a day and am always amazed at how much excess oil they remove.</li>
            <li> These oil-absorbing sheets do exactly as advertised. I use them after work and before going out for the night. I also recommend them for the mornings when camping or during airplane travel. They don&#x27;t rub off any makeup, and you can see the oil they clean off your face. This is a major advantage when you don&#x27;t have time to wash your face, don&#x27;t want to redo your makeup, or have no easy access to running water. The only reason I gave them four stars is due to the excessive and unnecessary plastic packaging. Overall, these are worth every penny for one who has oily or combination skin.</li>
            <li> Counterfeit product! Came from Thailand. Took MONTHS to arrive. Color was off - nothing like the real product. Didn&#x27;t absorb face oil as well as the real product.</li>
            <li> These work great! I (like many ppl) suffer from an oily face. I work in a profession where I interact with people constantly and I often worry about how &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; my face may appear. I used to wash my face a few times a day, but now I just carry one of these packs around with me in my coat pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do a great job of cleaning up the oil and they turn clear so you can see that they are actually working. A must have for anyone with an oily face.</li>
            <li> I use one sheet a day and it is just enough for me. You can see how well they work because when the sheet absorbs oil it becomes transparent. They feel like a plastic glove, which is odd, but I am definitely satisfied. My acne has become bearable!</li>
            <li> these are wonderful if you have oily skin.  I use them daily and love how they remove oil. I will get these again for sure.</li>
            <li> Really takes away that bothersome shine I been trying to get rid of for a while. I been looking for this product but couldnt find it in stores. Will purchase again after these 4 packs run out. Please keep them in stock, Thanks again  5 STARS!</li>
            <li> I use these in an unconventional fashion....I use them on my short hair cut to absorb oil and refresh my hair style on days that I don&#x27;t have time to shampoo!  They work better than dry shampoo and no white residue!  I rub them into the fringes on the side of my temples and use on bang hairline and back of my neck hairline.  My hair isn&#x27;t oily, so I don&#x27;t need them on the part or root areas.  I just think the oil and night time facial treatments run into my hair line.  They don&#x27;t fall apart like the paper blotting tissues.  I rub them into those areas and that refreshes my hair style too!  Great multiple package prices here on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Great product for men with oily skin..been using this for a year and will continue using it..better than rice paper</li>
            <li> wow! cleans up my slick in seconds - and actually seems to keep it from coming back!</li>
            <li> great product, it is the only brand i have been using for so many years. It won&#x27;t mess up your make up while absorbing the oil.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot! My skin gets oily during the day and it helps me to remove the oil in a second without touching any make up!&lt;br /&gt;It sits in my purse as the emergency kit!</li>
            <li> these are great for oily skin and hot weather, when you cannot wash your face but need a little clean. ALSO keeps your make up on while absorbing oil!</li>
            <li> I have tried some of the Japanese versions of this product and none of them really are absorbent as these sheets. I use them daily at the office to keep my oily skin looking and feeling better. Great product.</li>
            <li> I started using these in high school or college. At the time, I wore glasses and had fairly oily skin. These were great for getting rid of the oil on my nose and keeping my glasses from slipping down my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has become more the &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; type and I have gotten contact lenses, but I still have a use for these sheets -- getting rid of shine in the mid-to-late afternoon. I love that these really do absorb the oil without removing any makeup. (It&#x27;s lovely to carry around ONE product -- these sheets -- instead of extra foundation, concealer, etc.) I simply remove a sheet from the carrier and blot it on any oily areas. The sheets can take a fair amount of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a negative review where the reviewer indicated there were difficulties involved in getting the sheets out of the carrier. You&#x27;ll notice a little rectangle of paper on the inside of the carrier cover. Remove that to reveal a sticky area. Then simply close the carrier. The sticky area will pick up a sheet and have it ready for you, the next time you want to use one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one complaint, it would be that these packages come inside an excessive amount of plastic, most of which is surely going to end up in a landfill. However, the product itself exceeds expectations!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with oily skin and I live in a humid part of the country. Having these makes a huge difference.My handkerchief doesn&#x27;t have to work as hard to remove the oil from my face :-)</li>
            <li> Arrived just as described. Great price for the amount of items. Will purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Great for those whose faces look like an oil spill, or you know, even if it&#x27;s not that bad. They work really great and they don&#x27;&#x27;t wipe off your make up.</li>
            <li> I keep one in the car, bathroom, and in my camera bag.  Best way to get the oil and shine off without soap and water.  Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I am quite an oily face and usually with other types of oil absorbing sheets they break after absorbing the oil. These sheets are great because they are quite durable and you can see whichj parts of the sheet is used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using oil absorbing sheets for a few years now. While these may be more expensive to buy than some of the others on Amazon, it&#x27;s worth the price. The oil absorption is much greater than other brands, but the most important part of these oil absorbing sheets is the fact that it is easy to tell how much of the sheet has been used. Some other brands make it hard to tell if a sheet is all used up, so many extra may be wasted trying to clean up all of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re curious about oil absorbing sheets in general, they work great for mid day touch ups or those nights before bed when you don&#x27;t want to get your face wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t cut corners, just get the best.</li>
            <li> These work fantastically well.  I keep them in my purse for midday touch ups at work.  Easy to use and they don&#x27;t disturb my makeup.</li>
            <li> These oil sheets are phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do exactly the job they were intended to do. Couldn&#x27;t Recommend more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars!</li>
            <li> Great item good quality, my wife love it</li>
            <li> My 3 daughters use these little sheets.&lt;br /&gt;They are athletic and go from school to sports to work or socializing.&lt;br /&gt;They like the way it cleans up their sweaty faces without causing them&lt;br /&gt;to have to wash over and over. Plus it keeps the pores open so they&lt;br /&gt;are not worried about breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is the most inexpensive ways to control oil/facial shine.  It does not add a powder to your face, it mearly blots the oil and you look matte.  It does not clog your pores.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> The clean and clear oil-absorbing sheets are amazing, Works as advertised. I have real oily skin, The sheets are soft and absorbent.I have always had a shiny oily face, I wash my face 3 times a day. With the sheets i can go a few hours before i have to use 1 or 2 of them again, I just wish they were bigger i would say 5in by 5in. They are small but work well, Great product and i will have to buy more when i run out. Im glad i bought the 4 pack, 50 sheets in each. 5 star, wish i could give it a 10.</li>
            <li> I have been A Clean &amp; Clear fan.. these oil-absorbing sheets work like magic! My face looks younger removing oilyness! ♡♡♡</li>
            <li> Really I like this product because it takes the shine away from my face. I gave it a 4 because I have to keep using sheet, after sheet for it to get all of the oil out my skin, but all in all I highy recommend.</li>
            <li> It comes very quick and very happy with the product and price</li>
            <li> Fantastic standby for a fashionista with oily skin, like me!</li>
            <li> After I get done using it, my face feels so much fresher and free on all those nasty oils.  I also love the fact that it comes with so many of them!  I really feel that&#x27;s a great deal for how much you get.  I&#x27;m happy with this product and will most likely order it again when I run out...whenever that may be considering there are so many!</li>
            <li> Best things ever- I need them several times per day.  Works great and you can see how much oil you got off!</li>
            <li> I love Clean &amp; Clear oil-absorbing sheets! Not only are they relatively inexpensive, they work well at getting all of the oil off of my nose. As I go to school in a hot, humid city, I was once used to coming home covered in grease (yuck) and feeling like I needed to towel off my skin. No longer do I fear the sun and sweat. Thanks, Clean &amp; Clear!</li>
            <li> I really like the oil-absorbing sheets. They work and are a great quick clean-up to get rid of shine on the go. Wish they came in bulk packages.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. It takes away the shine and leaves my skin feeling fresh. It is a convenient size and easy to find. I use these all the time and they seem to even help with my breakouts. Less oil on my skin which lets my pores breath a bit more!! It also does not mess up your makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this product is never discontinued. I am absolutely in love with these oil absorbing pads. The brand also makes a difference too, I tried to switch to a cheaper version but it did not do as good of a job!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, and these are the best. I have really oily skin and I use these daily.</li>
            <li> it is very hard to set a piece of sheet out of package and did not work well on my face</li>
            <li> I buy these in bulk because I use them ALL the time. I have extremely oily skin that I manage with lemon soap, lemon lotion, daily mud/mint masks, and exfoliating; not to mention these bad boys. One sheet is enough to keep me oil free for a few hours, but I always touch up when I&#x27;m looking shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But buy this product with caution if you&#x27;re a serious make-up wearer like me. I&#x27;m talking concealer, foundation, setting powder, highlighting, and everything that goes with serious make-up application. If you use these while wearing make-up be sure to DAB your face, DO NOT SMEAR THESE OVER YOUR FACE LIKE A BUTTER KNIFE ON TOAST. If you do this, your make-up will spread and you will look crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned this the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re careful using them while wearing make-up and love getting a great deal, then this product is for you!</li>
            <li> Does the job - cleans off the oil and leaves no powder or residue on my face. I just need one for my face so I expect these packs to last for a while. It&#x27;s a great purchase!</li>
            <li> If you have a oily face these are amazing! I have a problem with pimples and its from touching my face I use these twicw a day and my face is clearing up! And couldnt beat this deal!</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, clear n clear oil absorbing sheets are a must have. You instantly can see the oil oil removed. I always carry them with me.</li>
            <li> Husband always keeps a pack of these in his back pocket. He won&#x27;t go anywhere without them and uses them a few times a day. We have tried other brands that have the blue paper (CVS and Walgreens brands) and they work just as well. These are expensive though, so do some price comparison and you may be able to find these for around $3 each at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Works great and the boxes make it easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years &amp; really like them. The brands with powder break my skin out, but these work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this product! You actually see a big difference when you use it. Sometimes i wish they were bigger, but that is my only issue.</li>
            <li> Amazing one of my best purchases</li>
            <li> This helped me soo much! Every night and day I use it and wow, i can&#x27;t believe how much oil it can find!</li>
