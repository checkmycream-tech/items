            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying it.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is very moisturizing  and unscented.</li>
            <li>The lotion isn&#x27;t too heavy and it leaves your skin smooth, moist, and calm.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and hydrated.</li>

            <li> I love the skin milk shower gel   accidentally bought the lotion   so now I love both</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and hydrated. Awesome purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this through amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. Great moisturizer, great smell.   CONS: I have to buy a 5 package just for me, It&#x27;s been a year, I&#x27;ve only used two or three of them. So, the supplier should sell mixed package too.</li>
            <li> Love the subtle fragrance and the way it makes  my skin soft not greasy. Coupled with the body wash it&#x27;s a fresh start to each new day.</li>
            <li> SkinMilk is the best moisturizing and conditioning body lotion I have ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried several. I use to be able to buy it locally but can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my area any more so I did a search on SkinMilk to find out where I could buy it and Amazon.com had the best deal. I like it so much I bought a 6 pack. SkinMilk leaves your skin nice and soft without an overpowering fragrance. It&#x27;s made with real milk proteins which is good for your skin. They have several other products which I didn&#x27;t know about until now and I plan on trying some of them too. I&#x27;m sure if you try it you will like it too. It also makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a long time.  It has been increasingly hard to find in the local stores in my area.  I was so happy to be able to find it on Amazon.  The price was very good, too.</li>
            <li> SkinMilk Body Lotion is a pleasant, nice smelling body lotion.  As a real bonus, it prevents noseum bugs from bothering you.  Those are those pesky bugs that fly up from a lawn when mown.</li>
            <li> Nice feel, overwhelming scent. Unfortunately, due to all the positive reviews, I bought several bottles. I gave them all away.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this lotion.  So glad that I could find it on Amazon.  My local store has stopped carrying this and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  Thanks Amazon for carrying it.  I bought a six pack and shared it with my niece.  Great price, too!</li>
            <li> Smells really really nice but it really ain&#x27;t the most hydrating/moisturising lotion around. Not for dry skin. i&#x27;d recommend for oily skin only.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great and I love the smell of all their products.&lt;br /&gt;This brand is getting hard to find so I don&#x27;t mind ordering in bulk online.</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion 5 years ago. I was able to buy it off the shelf until now. I live in a small town and none of the stores carry it anymore so I started looking online. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at such a good price. The lotion is very moisturizing  and unscented.</li>
            <li> I can see a huge difference in my skin after using these for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Our family has always used this lotion ever since we bought it from the store. The lotion isn&#x27;t too heavy and it leaves your skin smooth, moist, and calm. This is actually great for dry skin, especially in the winter! The smell is very light and pleasant but not overwhelming at all!</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Excellent for severe dry skin. Especially during these brutal cold temps. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good lotion if you put on everyday. No greesy feel afterwards. Good summer lotion. I need something heavier in the winter.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several years now.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a great product this &amp; the shower gel.I use the body lotion to shave.just works good not greasy.</li>
            <li> The lotion is light and smooth. The fragrance is subtle and clean. It has a light vanilla scent and is a great value.</li>
