            <li>It works well, smells nice, and is a good value (especially if you subscribe and save).  </li>
            <li>This is a fine hand and face soap.</li>

            <li>Not disappointed.</li>
            <li>While this soap may not necessarily be the very best option for organic/environmentally friendly/good for you hand soaps, it certainly works very well.</li>
            <li>I saw this soap initially at Whole Foods and have now started buying it online at a much better price.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t, I would not have one useful dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hands has a nice lather</li>
            <li>Very high quality soap that is worth the price.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t like about it was that after you use it for a while the bottle loses air so it doesn&#x27;t pump that great.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this soap, which I bought on sale at my local grocery.</li>
            <li>is the first multi pack of this item that I have seen.</li>
            <li>A glass bottle sliding into the bowl would be pretty disasterous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ever since I had my first baby, I&#x27;ve been in search of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; non-toxic household products.  </li>
            <li>This soap smells heavenly, and leaves my hands clean and soft.</li>
            <li>This soap is every bit as effective at removing the grease, grime, and oil from my hands but it keeps them soft and moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all of the soaps.  </li>
            <li>Also, unlike a lot of liquid products I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon, the bottle and nozzle are very sturdy and I&#x27;ve never had one leak during shipping</li>
            <li>Great smell, feel, long lasting, value for the money, and is of much better quality than other similar hand soap products that I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the lather and that the soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands even though I wash them a lot.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend for the bathroom and kitchen.</li>
            <li>It does take some work to get it to lather, but it does clean dirty hands nicely once you can get the lather</li>
            <li>We are parents of young kids</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I really like this product so much.</li>

            <li> She is not going back to her old stuff.</li>
            <li> I like that this one is thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> Softsoap or other normal soaps you can find at local stores used to make my hands so dry during the wintertime that they would crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this soap for the past 2 years, my hands are back to normal!</li>
            <li> Usually they&#x27;re overpriced and don&#x27;t work very well, but this soap has been an exception.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got dry, chapped hands, then this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li> Antibacterial soap always leaves my hands dry and scaly with the skin peeling off.</li>
            <li> ; emollient remains on skin after cleansing to prevent dry skin...</li>
            <li> I found a single bottle of this at Trader Joe&#x27;s for $3.99 and Amazon is selling 3 for $18+.</li>
            <li> not really</li>
            <li> The soap is so thick, that is probably why it is hard to get it to come out at first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m knocking it off a star because the price is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> Two of the three pumps wouldn&#x27;t open, one of them is broken inside the container and one came loose so that even if I could get the pump to work, I would have to get tweezers and attempt to reassemble</li>
            <li> so washing our hands is a frequent occurrence and with the cold winters this soap actually helps the skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> And the dark green bottle and label art give me something to admire while I&#x27;m washing.</li>
            <li> A few of the bottles were delivered and the soap had leaked all down the bottle.</li>
            <li> Am I missing something?</li>
            <li> It does take approximately 20 pumps to get the soap to come out initially</li>
            <li> I now keep a few containers at home and at the office.</li>
            <li> The bottle pusher is a little bit hard to operate.</li>
            <li> Hate to go out and buy new empty dispensers and then do a messy transfer of liquid soap.</li>
            <li> I may just add a touch of water to a bottle to see if it helps because it comes out so thick, it is hard to get it lathering before it slides off your hands and down the drain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still expensive, but unless I can find a cheaper brand with the same quality, I&#x27;ll be sticking with this!</li>
            <li> I work in an industry where we are constantly dealing with heavy fittings, valves, and pipes, and that lends itself to creating filthy hands anytime you touch the materials.</li>
            <li> The pump is a little difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I also have been getting sick less and less.</li>
            <li> All six containers came with broken pumps.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there&#x27;s a correlation between me not getting sick and not using anti bacterial soap, but just something to throw out there.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really go wrong, unless the price goes way up.</li>
            <li> Too bad so sad!</li>
            <li> Engineering of product container terrible.</li>

            <li> It does have an ok smell.  What I didn&#x27;t like about it was that after you use it for a while the bottle loses air so it doesn&#x27;t pump that great.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! The smell is wonderful! My mom uses it and is impressed. She is not going back to her old stuff. Reccommend this and their shampoo and conditioners to anyone.</li>
            <li> Product arrived packaged safely and everything intact. Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics Liquid hand soap feels great and has a great scent, lavendar and aloe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all of the soaps.  I like that this one is thick and rich.  I use one pump and get some nicely washed hands.  The detergent in this works well without drying out my hands.  It&#x27;s on my permanent list of &#x27;buys&#x27;</li>
            <li> This soap smells so nice. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hands has a nice lather and I love that it&#x27;s organic. Would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I saw this soap initially at Whole Foods and have now started buying it online at a much better price. It smells great, lasts a good long time, and I use it in all of my bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I ordered a three-pack and cannot get the dispensers to open up. I turn in the direction of the open arrow and still it will not open. Am I missing something? Hate to go out and buy new empty dispensers and then do a messy transfer of liquid soap. Would not order again.</li>
            <li> Although not use it yet, but  hope it can keep water for my hands . Think this is good product.</li>
            <li> A very good product to protect your hand.</li>
            <li> Great natural soap with a wonderful smell!  We are parents of young kids so washing our hands is a frequent occurrence and with the cold winters this soap actually helps the skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> This soap smells heavenly, and leaves my hands clean and soft. I love it and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> The hands with which I&#x27;m typing smell wonderful. (This is not always the case.) I am so pleased with this soap, which I bought on sale at my local grocery. I don&#x27;t know so much about the aloe yet, since my hands are chronically dry, but the lavender aroma is delicious. The twist top opens comparatively easily. The soap does not drip when it&#x27;s dispensed - the last drop is sufficiently viscous that it retreats back up the nozzle to rejoin its soapy comrades-in-arms. And the dark green bottle and label art give me something to admire while I&#x27;m washing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got dry, chapped hands, then this is the soap for you. Immediate difference. Don&#x27;t use just any soap, get the best and this IS the best.</li>
            <li> Relaxing, moisturizing, pleasing scent.  Highly recommend for the bathroom and kitchen.</li>
            <li> Great soap that does is gentle on your skin, and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;This is the first multi pack of this item that I have seen.</li>
            <li> Great smell, feel, long lasting, value for the money, and is of much better quality than other similar hand soap products that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda herbal-ly, seems to do a good job, washes off nicely. The bottle pusher is a little bit hard to operate. I am not sure if I really like this product so much. I might try another one as I am not too fascinate by it.</li>
            <li> Antibacterial soap always leaves my hands dry and scaly with the skin peeling off. Ever since I started using this soap for the past 2 years, my hands are back to normal! I also have been getting sick less and less. I am not sure if there&#x27;s a correlation between me not getting sick and not using anti bacterial soap, but just something to throw out there. I&#x27;m knocking it off a star because the price is pretty expensive. I found a single bottle of this at Trader Joe&#x27;s for $3.99 and Amazon is selling 3 for $18+. It&#x27;s still expensive, but unless I can find a cheaper brand with the same quality, I&#x27;ll be sticking with this!</li>
            <li> The soap arrived promptly. One thing I did not see mentioned is that the bottles are plastic. For our home situation, this was ideal because of the design of our pedastal sink. A glass bottle sliding into the bowl would be pretty disasterous.&lt;br /&gt;I had no issues with the pump as some people have mentioned. It does take approximately 20 pumps to get the soap to come out initially and you do have to look at the pump to see what direction you should turn the spigot to the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position before you start pumping.&lt;br /&gt;After that, no problems. The soap is so thick, that is probably why it is hard to get it to come out at first.  I may just add a touch of water to a bottle to see if it helps because it comes out so thick, it is hard to get it lathering before it slides off your hands and down the drain. It does take some work to get it to lather, but it does clean dirty hands nicely once you can get the lather going.&lt;br /&gt;I like the product for the scent, the lingering softness and the aloe.</li>
            <li> This liquid soap has an excellent gentle lavender fragrance and very mild feel. Very high quality soap that is worth the price. I Just reordered to stock up.</li>
            <li> great scent!  The pump is a little difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Our daughter used this soap and when we visited her we liked it, so we purchased it.  Not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The bottle is attractive and made well.  The scent of the soap is nice and not over-powering.  A few of the bottles were delivered and the soap had leaked all down the bottle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smelling and no harsh chemicals.  I really enjoy the lather and that the soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands even though I wash them a lot.</li>
            <li> This is great soap that I use to wash my hands and face.  The only problem I had was when receiving the soap some of the contents had leaked from one of the containers.</li>
            <li> Ever since I had my first baby, I&#x27;ve been in search of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; non-toxic household products.  Usually they&#x27;re overpriced and don&#x27;t work very well, but this soap has been an exception.  It works well, smells nice, and is a good value (especially if you subscribe and save).  Also, unlike a lot of liquid products I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon, the bottle and nozzle are very sturdy and I&#x27;ve never had one leak during shipping</li>
            <li> This is a fine hand and face soap. A lovely organic scent, a nice anti drying mixture with mild suddsing and a clean finish. An excellent bargain to boot.</li>
            <li> Product is good. Engineering of product container terrible. Two of the three pumps wouldn&#x27;t open, one of them is broken inside the container and one came loose so that even if I could get the pump to work, I would have to get tweezers and attempt to reassemble it.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I bought the three-pack. If I hadn&#x27;t, I would not have one useful dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you find another hand soap. There are plenty.&lt;br /&gt;Or buy it in the store where you can be sure you&#x27;ve got a working mechanism before you leave.</li>
            <li> Very nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice. All six containers came with broken pumps. The stem inside the bottle breaks away from the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product advertises a lavender scent. It&#x27;s actually non-scented.</li>
            <li> While this soap may not necessarily be the very best option for organic/environmentally friendly/good for you hand soaps, it certainly works very well. I work in an industry where we are constantly dealing with heavy fittings, valves, and pipes, and that lends itself to creating filthy hands anytime you touch the materials. Softsoap or other normal soaps you can find at local stores used to make my hands so dry during the wintertime that they would crack and bleed. This soap is every bit as effective at removing the grease, grime, and oil from my hands but it keeps them soft and moisturized at the same time. What a difference some good hand soap can make! I now keep a few containers at home and at the office. I like it better than Method, which was the alternative I used previously. Buy it!</li>
            <li> excellent product; emollient remains on skin after cleansing to prevent dry skin...the best body wash I have ever found!</li>
            <li> Has this happened to you? I have a back deck with a fence and every time I order anything from Amazon the guy throws it back there which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;I order this soap last week and I never got it. Of corse it says it was delivered but I got NOTHIN! So I will try one more time I can&#x27;t find where it is sold in the city. I&#x27;m sure it is but I can&#x27;t find it. I asked for a refund and they actually emailed me back laughing..... okay not really but I could still feel it.&lt;br /&gt;S.O.L. Mamma son! Too bad so sad! Hopefully I will receive this package. Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> love this soap. great scent, nice looking bottle, and organic. can&#x27;t really go wrong, unless the price goes way up.</li>
