            <li>This product is a great bargain.</li>
            <li>I researched and found great reviews with Youth Code</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>I found this to be a really great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>For myself it wasn&#x27;t as great as I was hoping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loreal please keep making it just like this, my skin loves it and is a great duo/trio with the BB Cream Illuminator and under eye cream.</li>
            <li>I am truly happy with the serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, feels great</li>
            <li>and I am just as happy with that product.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have been happy with the freshness in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am assuming with all the great reviews, it just must be me...</li>
            <li>Very Nice</li>
            <li>good good good !</li>
            <li>I have used many products on the market and this one has been one of the best.</li>
            <li>Thus, if I want to replace the product which I paid $23.00 for, I will have to once again shell out another $13.00 of my own money!  </li>
            <li>This product is truly remarkable.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite products been using for a year and my skinny looks amazing!!  </li>
            <li>She now rubs her skin with organic fair trade coconut oil once a day</li>
            <li>as good as i used before.</li>
            <li>I just finished using Lancome Genifique which did a good job.  </li>
            <li>I believe in quality skin care and don&#x27;t mind paying for a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I loved what Genifique did for my skin</li>
            <li>I pumped a drop on my skin, it smells good</li>
            <li>i have been using this serum for years and found a really good price for it here on amazon.</li>
            <li>and I think this may be good prevention as well.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if this is a good product or not, because I cannot tolerate the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>After reserching this, It seemed to be a good product, so I figured I would try it.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you don&#x27;t start out with good skin, it may be good.</li>
            <li>Price is fair for OTC product.</li>
            <li>and my face look good after using it for a while.</li>
            <li>Not as good as i thought</li>
            <li>texture was good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells so good</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>The packag was good, but when I start using it</li>
            <li>It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and is very effective for</li>
            <li>I wear it under makeup and on clean face before bed for best results.</li>
            <li>Absorption is very rapid, moist degree is also very good, I feel very good.</li>
            <li>Bargain buy, very satisfied</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using Youth Code until something better comes along -- my skin is looking great, and I&#x27;m saving a ton of money over the high-priced Genifique.</li>
            <li>Has a nice texture and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>Awesome Seller, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>best stuff ever love love love it</li>

            <li>love using it!</li>
            <li>&amp; I love them!</li>
            <li>Love this serum!</li>
            <li>This is NOT as effective as de-crease serum but since Loreal happily discontinues all their most effective products each yaer,  I&#x27;m using what I can afford.</li>
            <li>Another L&#x27;oreal product that I love!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>each monthly salary was $625 people, really want to buy！！！！！This product is very good, very suitable for me....!!!hahahha~~</li>
            <li>This product I have purchased many times in the Amazon, it is very suitable for my skin。I would recommend this product to my family and close friends.</li>
            <li>This would be a great product if it were fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Light and smells great.</li>
            <li>This stuff was so amazing that I bought the day lotion as well.</li>
            <li>The cream has a nice scent</li>
            <li>I got a 7-day sample of Lancome Genifique which I really liked.</li>
            <li>and it is just as good as Lancome Genifique if not even better.</li>
            <li>So fat it seems to be just as effective.</li>
            <li>Hydrate really nice and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>it worked really well and its the best skin care ive ever used.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Good cheap price of good activities</li>
            <li>Deluxe serum.  </li>
            <li>:I got this product for testing in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li>Not oily and drys nicely.</li>
            <li>I love skincare, have great skin and have tried many products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve often said you find out how effective a product is when you run out.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this after comparing it to Lancome&#x27;s Genefique which is a great product &amp; pricey at about $84/oz.</li>
            <li>very good product - feels soft and smells good</li>
            <li>Very easy to use，Delicate texture</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use this any more!</li>
            <li>Very light, smells nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my opinion that Youth Code serum is by far the best I have</li>
            <li>It is my opinion that Youth Code serum is by far the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This has a very light feeling on my face when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>what I like about it is that it helps the moisturizer go on very smoothly after it</li>
            <li>Love this product, and hope they never discontinue it.  </li>
            <li>Love Amazon also.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I can say is that the price on Amazon is better than Walmarts.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>However, Youth Code leaves my face feeling and looking better than Genifique.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am alergic to most products but this one has not caused me a problem.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have a love affair with serums.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look more awake.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;OREAL Youth code regenerating.</li>
            <li>I think the Lancôme genefique does a better job.  </li>
            <li>s&#x27;ok but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>i love this product and i use it morning and night, on my face, neck, and chest.</li>
            <li>I did like the smell, much better than most</li>
            <li>Love this serum.</li>
            <li>This serum contains much more liquid than the lotion/cream in the line and works better.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use too many skin care products</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li>hoping that she would have better luck with it.</li>
            <li>serum absorbs well, isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne or clog pores, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch or become red/inflamed like so many products</li>
            <li>Youth Code is ok but maybe for someone younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference, but I love using this product.</li>
            <li>And there are SO MANY products with SO MANY promises to try.</li>
            <li>there are probably better serums out there.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>she love the corlour</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s so lightweight</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>In just 3 days, I have noticed smoothness over my face and it made my skin looks brighter and more luminous .</li>
            <li>and most people still say I pass for 25.</li>
            <li>I have used many skin care products, some I am allergic to, but the symptoms always go away except for this one.</li>
            <li>Most don&#x27;t believe I am 50 until they see my kids.....</li>
            <li>I must say the entire \\&quot;advertising\\&quot; got me into the product, and honestly I am very happy I did try it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed is that I seem to be breaking out more and wonder if this is a trade-off for being youthful looking?</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I decided to try the Youth Code line of the L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li>Not the most helpful review, but</li>
            <li>, my skin is better than 10 years ago,...</li>
            <li>love it and 10 dollars cheaper than walgreens and Walmart</li>
            <li>I bought an oil of olay serum instead and it works so much better</li>
            <li>I purchased the bottle with the idea that I would be taken care of, in a safe manner but</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I love Lancome skin serums &amp; everyone</li>
            <li>I do not understand why there are so many rave reviews on here.</li>
            <li>I generally love L&#x27;Oreal products but this did not work for my skin type and concerns.</li>
            <li>, the return policy is much better, I could have returned it If I had purchased from CVS.</li>
            <li>I love what the serum does to your skin.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using Genifique for about two years, I&#x27;m very familiar with the texture and results and this is much better.</li>
            <li>While youth code cream is not bad, this serum is very light and fairly effective.</li>
            <li>And to make my eyes happy, too, since they see those pesky new wrinkles every day.  </li>
            <li>the absorption is quick - and effective.  </li>
            <li>feels smooth and light, not the sticky kind of serum.</li>
            <li>I love the fine art of skin care and makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Genifique, along with a complete Lancome skin regimen for over two years with great results.</li>
            <li>Love the smooth feeling on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I was using Skin Genesis Serum and loved it, it really improved how my skin looked.</li>
            <li>The second time in the amazon to buy this, use the effect is very good, and the price is cheap</li>
            <li>It feels cool to the skin and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product because of a lot of amazing reviews for it here.</li>
            <li>One pump glides all over my face easily.</li>
            <li>It is strong and clinging and cloying, so I have abandoned it.  </li>
            <li>Nice, like it very much</li>
            <li>The serum is very light but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li>A sweet gift for my wife:)</li>
            <li>It adds illuminousity to the skin and smooths out fine lines.</li>
            <li>Still, I would expect to see some diminishing in the fine lines I already have, and I haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The price - even with shipping was less than the best price I could get in a store.</li>
            <li>I have some pigmintation issues and fine lines/dehydration creping to contend with along with loss of elasticity.</li>
            <li>very good!this product is my favorite thing,i&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li>my wife love it very much!</li>
            <li>In only 2 days my skin has improved greatly.</li>
            <li>nice item, fast express</li>
            <li>Also, I wish it were fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and even use acne free.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth.</li>
            <li>For me seems to be too light.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel smooth and silky</li>
            <li>I like the light silky feel and no perfumes.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>After using this product makes me feel the skin becomes smooth, and I like this feeling.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat this product for smooth young-looking skin.  </li>
            <li>knows Loreal is just cheap Lancome</li>
            <li>Thanks L&#x27;Oreal, I love and use many of your products.  </li>
            <li>So far so good (after using it for 13 days).</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m a fairly youthful 41-year old who has stayed out of the sun, never smoked, etc.</li>
            <li>For a tiny bit more money you can get a really good serum from The Body Shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love how this product does not leave an oily film and seems to sink right into the skin.    </li>
            <li>The product is very good, next time also to buy, thank you very much for amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product very much.</li>
            <li>awesome product that lasts because you need to use very little.</li>
            <li>but my skin has cleared up significantly</li>
            <li>After 90 days, there was a significant difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead I picked up a Neutragena Rapid Skin Repair and found the results to be ten times more satisfying!</li>
            <li>By the way, I was even more impressed by the speedy delivery, I ordered with the standard shipping and received the product within the same week.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure it was a reaction to the product.</li>
            <li>so my face feels bare, and the scent is pleasant and mild.</li>
            <li>Heck, I even bought the two newest Loreal foundations, Visible Lift Serum Absolute, and Magic Smooth Souffle.</li>
            <li>Heck, I even bought the two newest Loreal foundations, Visible Lift Serum Absolute, and Magic Smooth Souffle.</li>
            <li>this does great things for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Recently I tried a brand called &#x27;&#x27;Nude&#x27;&#x27; (also made in France) which worked okay, didnt break me out, and i liked knowing there wasnt parabens and stuff in it</li>
            <li>I had bought this serum several weeks ago and have been very impressed with the look of my smile lines which were the most bothersome to me in recent times.  </li>
            <li>I wear it daily and have seen amazing results in clearing some fine lines and light spots.</li>
            <li>This is a good solid one and it delivers.</li>
            <li>I love Clinique&#x27;s clinical dark-spot corrector, but again, I&#x27;m trying to be very frugal at the moment.</li>
            <li>It did leave my skin feeling incredibly soft and it smells nice</li>
            <li>She uses the product on a regular basis and has good things to say about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>and I am very particular about what I use of my fair sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li>Another great side effect: The first few times I put it on, my husband couldn&#x27;t stop kissing my face :).</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly and seems also to help absortion of follow on moistrerizer.</li>
            <li>, it drys too quick, I didn&#x27;t feel it does anything to the skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is adequate.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I need to mention that this seller is off the chain quick.  </li>
            <li>I like the feeling when you apply to your face, it absorbs so quick.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a perfect daily serum and finally found one that works for my skin!</li>
            <li>My skin texture is softer, there is a more even skin tone, and I definitely see a more youthful look.</li>
            <li>Seems to be very effective, just as the other reviews I had read.</li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s pretty affordable, and I like the idea of using a light serum before my thicker (La Mer) moisturizer.</li>
            <li>High end product, I feel the skin become soft after using, like face returned to 18 years old, is very good</li>
            <li>Not too happy with the price, right after I purchased it, the price went down</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s actually a starter kit of this particular system available for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>I also work under harsh lighting and receive tons of compliments on how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>The whole youthcode line is fabulous, &amp; I will continue to use them faithfully.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended Youth Code, she said it has basically the same effective ingredients.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell a specific good point of it, but i just like it and keep using it.</li>
            <li>But I started using this serum after my face wash in the morning and almost immediately I noticed my face is extremely soft, and it feels so light on my skin that my skin stays supple and moisturized all day!</li>
            <li>Love this coz it makes my skin really young</li>
            <li>I would say this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Love this product left my Skin feeling smooth and silky</li>
            <li>Activating Face and EyeSerum - a far better choice)!&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
            <li>when I wake up I look fresh and my wrinkles get smoother every day.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful serum and just as effective as the more expensive serums from Lancome and other high-end cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Lancome, you can shell more out of pocket for larger sizes, and get a significant discount per ounce.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my skin has improved vastly since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Right now, I spend $80 on day cream,$80 on Genifique, $80 on night cream, and $60 each on eye cream and eye serum.</li>
            <li>I see the change right away, but after you discontinued, appear again, I can said is just during</li>
            <li>This give you energized skin, seems to give it a healthy pink cheek look, smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>My first time using this fresh glow L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Regenarating Skincare</li>
            <li>I am 35 and am becomming more and more aware of those little pesky lines around my eyes every day.  </li>
            <li>I love the Serum, has made my skin look very youthfull, less wrinkles and very smooth</li>
            <li>i will continue to use this serum as long as it is appropriate for my skin type because i really like the way my skin feels after i apply it: smooth but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>easy to apply, very smooth and skin feels tight immediately;</li>
            <li>I have since gone back to using the texture perfector that I love very much.</li>
            <li>I put it on and instantly feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually quite better than Genifique.</li>
            <li>This product makes my aging skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This serum is definitely going to help though. :)</li>
            <li>This product made my face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>but my mistake- i do use it occassionally not on a regular basis like the correcot which I love.</li>
            <li>Youth Code is even better, not only for the price, but this:  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li>but this has really made a difference in the feel and appearance of my skin!</li>
            <li>Thanks, L&#x27;OREAL!</li>
            <li>When first applied, it does leave the skin feeling firmer.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t use this product unless you try it on your arm first.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is light and does not bother my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I use the entire youth code line and my skin has changed for the better</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as promised, and came DAYS before promised.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it has helped even out my skin tone and gives me a pretty \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>He loves the way it smells and how it makes my face feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I suddenly look so much better</li>
            <li>and I am definitely seeing tighter and more luminous skin.</li>
            <li>and so far do not see any noticeable difference in my skin but do like the light feeling and not feeling like it&#x27;s plugging up the pores on my face.  </li>
            <li>I got this product because it was on sale and the packaging seemed pretty enticing.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Just love it and am ordering a 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li>So I read online and found that many people believe that the Youth Code (this product) is \\&quot;THE SAME THING, IF NOT</li>
            <li>It sinks in quickly and leaves the area around my eyes immediately softer, smoother, and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the texture perfector but decided I wanted a little more anti aging.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that my skin tone has completely changed, so I feel comfortable leaving the house without makeup for the first time in a long time!</li>
            <li>It does make my skin glow more, not majorly</li>
            <li>On the bright side I didn&#x27;t breakout or anything like that, there was just no difference neither good nor bad.</li>
            <li>I have bright red, itchy, zit like bumps all over my face that are starting to come to a head.</li>
            <li>My fine lines disappeared, and the two vertical lines between my eyebrows (i.e. \\&quot;elevens\\&quot;) are barely visible.  </li>
            <li>it is not Lancôme Genifique, leaving more skin glow &amp; softness.&lt;br /&gt;Genifique is soooo expensive, this is a really good alternative</li>
            <li>Regenerating Skincare Serum Intense Daily Treatment through Allure&#x27;s list of award winning products.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many skin care products, but this is the one I wish I had a long time ago.</li>
            <li>first I was really liking it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really explain exactly what I like about this.  </li>
            <li>But since I got such good results from this low cost serum, I am ready to try anything from this brand.</li>
            <li>It feels good, not sure I think it is doing anything to the wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li>This lasted a pretty long time, I use it during the daytime on dry areas, and was surprised how effective, but light it was!</li>
            <li>Youth Code serum doesn&#x27;t seem to do much, it does not give me the rich texture, healthy, firm and hydrated skin</li>
            <li>I really liked Lancome Genifique, so I thought I&#x27;d try this L&#x27;Oreal product which is supposed to be their version at half the price.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and apply, that I would definitely recommend and reorder this item.</li>
            <li>Loreal has certainly earned my respect and business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loreal has certainly earned my respect and business.     </li>
            <li>However, if you have dryer skin then this will certainly do the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is certainly plenty of room for improvement...</li>
            <li>and I do see an overall improvement of fine lines and clarity.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not noticing any changes with my complexion or the fine lines that I&#x27;m starting to develop.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay a little more for something useful</li>
            <li>have great skin to begin with, but have gotten a few brown spots over the years and wanted to try this out to see if I notice anything different.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because I can&#x27;t really tell if it did anything.</li>
            <li>IT’S VERY CHEAPER FOR CHINA</li>
            <li>i have/had sun damage on my chest from too much sun.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have to say I really like this product.</li>
            <li>But I really am suprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li>very good，my skin  like it</li>
            <li>I purchased the whole product line and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day</li>
            <li>I bought the Youth Code Serum Intense to try it up.  </li>
            <li>The chemical burn was intense.  </li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fast to ship to my country.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no doubt, that the Genifique at $78 per ounce performs where this does nothing much at all.</li>
            <li>Boo-hoo as I was really, really cheering for this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much so that I gave it to my grandma</li>
            <li>66 and spent many hours in the sun.</li>
            <li>This is really the alternatives to Lancome Genefique.</li>
            <li>i did not like this product as much as i like the loreal youth code spot correcting serum.</li>
            <li>the beginning of jowls, but one or both are doing the trick very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and if I put too much on, it gets flaky and just sits on the surface of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It really works on the crow feet area.</li>
            <li>I also have very combo skin with an oily t-zone.</li>
            <li>Well, as others have mentioned it does not take much product to cover your whole face, which is sort of nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good, and feels delicate.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised that the first three ingredients on L&#x27;Oreals Youth Code is identical to the first three on &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any real improvement of lines/wrinkles, but that is not really the purpose of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is refreshing</li>
            <li>And because the Lancome is the more expensive one, they probably put MORE of the expensive good healthy ingredients that will help our skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps me looking young!!!</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in the overall tone and texture of my skin from using this line.</li>
            <li>the active ingredients are comparable to lancome&#x27;s product (genifique, i think), though i am sure the lancome version must have more of the active ingredient, because otherwise it seems like there would have been a whistleblower case by now.</li>
            <li>Goes on so smoothly under my make-up that you can barely tell you have it on and it protects my skin from irritation from cosmetics, as i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I felt like it didn&#x27;t really sink in but kind of formed small pills on my skin.</li>
            <li>Make up goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to absorb.</li>
            <li>This product is fine - just can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better or worse than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle to my face.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this new booster</li>
            <li>So when I read the good and bad reviews about this serum, I was leaning more towards \\&quot;it</li>
            <li>Did not feel particularly good.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It was better enough that I could tell the difference the following day.  </li>
            <li>this left my face luminous, smooth, &amp; a natural youthful glow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product, but I don&#x27;t think it has done a ton to improve my skin.</li>
            <li>Comparatively, I found Genifique to be much richer to the point where it is almost moisturizing, whereas Youth Code is quickly absorbed and disappears on my skin totally.</li>
            <li>Many people seem to believe that because L&#x27;oreal and Lancome are under the same parent company, they believe that the Youth Code line is the same as the Genifique line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it is just that I have enough good products that really seem to make a difference for me, and there is just no more room, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend every woman to try it.  </li>
            <li>I know my expectations are too high.</li>
            <li>This is my go to BB cream, comparable to premium brands without the high price tag.</li>
            <li>High alcohol content I think, drying, smells like my grandma.</li>
            <li>High cost performance, but I use the allergy</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are very similar, but the Youth Code has a couple of other skin loving ingredients that Genifique lacks.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal essence muscle bottom liquid, a very high cost-effective cosmetic liquid, apply clear gloss, we recommend a beauty liquid.</li>
            <li>It also helps clear up pimples, at age 30 one would figure I didn&#x27;t break out as much as I do, anyway</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t expected Youth Code to feel so smooth</li>
            <li>It does have a floral odor that many of you could find too heavy.</li>
            <li>and I have used it long enough to say that I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>The normal question is did I have plastic surgery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20s and don&#x27;t really have wrinkles or age spots to treat yet, so I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkle fighting claims, but I do love it so much I plan on buying it again and continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>I am 48 - and have sensitive skin - and this product is for me - quick, simple, and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to do my skin treatment right after cleansing though, so I&#x27;m going back to my serum from Wexler.</li>
            <li>But Loreal discontinued it and came out with this new product.</li>
            <li>Really needs to be paired with a more substantial cream if you&#x27;re looking for hydration, but my skin is less red and blotchy.</li>
            <li>I will use occasionally at night to help fight wrinkles and to enjoy the softness I just can&#x27;t use daily.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had no irritation like with other products that have helped with the fine lines and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Packaging was very old looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I bought it and used it for the first time last night before going to bed and this morning.</li>
            <li>then again, I started using it because I wanted to avoid deep wrinkles in the first place, so maybe I just can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>After the first couple of days I started breaking out and this is the only change I made to my skin routine.</li>
            <li>But the smell is a little bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li>what really amazes me about this particular product is that it is definitely plumping my lips, not Olay.</li>
            <li>I am not seeing any result on this product and it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed too well on my dry skin</li>
            <li>I went back to my usual products &amp; got back my good results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard not to appreciate their potent moisturizing effects and the way they freshen skin.</li>
            <li>just so you know that I&#x27;m not an 18 year old reviewing wrinkle products).</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe how soft and luminous my face has become.</li>
            <li>i am a young looking 60 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>I have been amazed at how the lines on my chest have become much softer to the point where I can wear a low necked  shirt again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Genefique leaves my face soft and youthful but youth code does nothing.</li>
            <li>I am battling adult acne and the medication I use dries out my face.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it helps wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have any so far</li>
            <li>No miracles so far, but I am a patient person.</li>
            <li>I am a 34-year old researcher/teacher who enjoys taking care of his skin.  </li>
            <li>I checked the batch code when I got the product, and it was about 5 years old.  </li>
            <li>(Quite old for skincare.)  </li>
            <li>As a 45 year old, I need something that hydrates without making me breakout.  </li>
            <li>I use it at least once a day and often after my morning shower as well as at bed time and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it three stars because it has too much fragrance in it for me.</li>
            <li>am 65 years old and my peers think I&#x27;m 59.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product and thought it would be great for helping with the small dark sun spots I&#x27;ve been starting to get.</li>
            <li>I used 3 pumps of it - 2 pumps for whole face and neck, then 1 extra pump for my eyes, forehead, and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It seems to keep my skin soft and soften wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle on this and didn&#x27;t notice any difference, it claims that pores wouldn&#x27;t look as obvious which it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft...</li>
            <li>It revive to boost to make my face alive.</li>
            <li>With continued use of this product, my upper and lower lips are very noticeably fuller.</li>
            <li>And so far no breakouts using it morning and night...</li>
            <li>Followed directions completely.</li>
            <li>It also felt very sticky and I didn&#x27;t since any extra hydration that I was expecting.</li>
            <li>He diagnosed me with Rosacea which I never knew I had before I ordered the Youth Code Intense daily serum.  </li>
            <li>My guess is they probably change the proportion of how much of each ingredient goes into the different products.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s as good as the serum, I can&#x27;t see a reason to spend hundreds of dollars on expensive creams.</li>
            <li>it makes me feel good looking in the mirror, not looking as tired as I feel!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very concentrated that a single drop contains enough moisture for me to apply all over my face and my neck (true, I don&#x27;t have a big face but still)  </li>
            <li>This Youth Code has a lovely scent, not strong but just enough when applying.  </li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, so I was surprised by this result.</li>
            <li>I got better results when I put the serious anti-aging cream directly on my skin without the Youth Code barrier between my skin and the cream.  </li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal Paris youth code skincare serum is not only for the young and youthful looking women but also for those of us who are getting older.  </li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal Paris youth code skincare serum is not only for the young and youthful looking women but also for those of us who are getting older.</li>
            <li>This little bottle really IS as good as Lancome&#x27;s Genifique and at a small fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>but, on my fair skin, face turns red and slight burning sensation after a few seconds.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the L&#x27;Oreal serum that gave my skin such dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 20s and started to notice creases in my forehead that are becoming permanent.</li>
            <li>Of course I usually put an oil free moisturizer with SPF over it</li>
            <li>I used the last of my Youth Code serum before xmas, and didn&#x27;t buy a new bottle until 10 days ago.</li>
            <li>I also started using a BB cream at the same time, so the two combined are really whipping my facial skin into shape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used it for a couple weeks and didn&#x27;t see a difference, but then tried it at a different time of day when my skin wasn&#x27;t wet and could see a noticeable difference in my laugh lines.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s style ,feel very soft and i will be back again!</li>
            <li>I read somewhere that the human eye is not able to see fine lines around the eyes - that what we are seeing is the shadow of a wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>I am generally one to doubt the efficiency of cosmetic products.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed, but for some reason considered re-buying it until I saw a review on Youtube that shed more light on it: Alcohol is a no no for the skin, as well as perfume.</li>
            <li>I am a young 78 and have been using this product for several months now and those wrinkles around my mouth have disappeared</li>
            <li>By the way, my skin is a combination skin, so even drinking 8 glasses of water, barely wearing makeup, and washing my face twice a day still doesn&#x27;t keep pimples away.</li>
            <li>The box says to use 2-3 drops, but one drop is enough to completely cover my face and part of my neck quite liberally</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know which of the two products, this or Oil of Olay, has definitely improved (almost completely eliminating)</li>
            <li>I find that this stuff really works, I am on my third bottle of it, It actually has the same ingredients as the Lancome genifique.  </li>
            <li>I am a young 78 and have been using this product for several months now and those wrinkles around my mouth have disappeared</li>
            <li>I saw immediate results, but want to know will it actually fade the old acne scars and age spots.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really noticed any big improvements from this, other than it helps to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>There is a slight tingle when I first put it on, but otherwise, no irritation.</li>
            <li>I am in my 20s, two months ago I noticed a slight line right under my left eye.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much results other than that.  </li>
            <li>For me, at least, this product is worth it for 24/7 plump lips!</li>
            <li>I was looking for some face serum, and I&#x27;m on a pretty tight budget at the time.</li>
            <li>Not a single line.</li>
            <li>I completely finished the bottle only to find my face the way it was prior to my purchase.</li>
            <li>it keeps the skin soft for a reallly long time.</li>
            <li>Personally I was using it for past acne redness, because the Dark Spot Corrector Version didn&#x27;t have as many rave reviews.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a decent drugstore substitute, based on some other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am mid-forties with very sensitive skin, so I have to pick carefully what I put on it.</li>
            <li>I usually apply it right after washing my face and briefly towel drying.</li>
            <li>La Mer, EMK Placental, and other high end products are my regular routine type products and I didn&#x27;t think this 15 dollar serum would make the cut</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I mixed in a half scoop of Philosophy Turbo Booster C powder in the a.m. to this serum, so the combination of these two products may be why my skin has improved so much.  </li>

            <li> Although my face looks great as a result, my bank account does not.</li>

            <li> Honestly, these are the two best foundations I have ever owned.</li>

            <li> Youth Code serum may work great for you.</li>
            <li> This product is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> I researched and found great reviews with Youth Code</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> I found this to be a really great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> For myself it wasn&#x27;t as great as I was hoping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loreal please keep making it just like this, my skin loves it and is a great duo/trio with the BB Cream Illuminator and under eye cream.</li>
            <li> I am truly happy with the serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, feels great</li>
            <li> and I am just as happy with that product.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have been happy with the freshness in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am assuming with all the great reviews, it just must be me...</li>
            <li> Very Nice</li>
            <li> good good good !</li>
            <li> I have used many products on the market and this one has been one of the best.</li>
            <li> Thus, if I want to replace the product which I paid $23.00 for, I will have to once again shell out another $13.00 of my own money!  </li>
            <li> This product is truly remarkable.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite products been using for a year and my skinny looks amazing!!  </li>
            <li> She now rubs her skin with organic fair trade coconut oil once a day</li>
            <li> as good as i used before.</li>
            <li> I just finished using Lancome Genifique which did a good job.  </li>
            <li> I believe in quality skin care and don&#x27;t mind paying for a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I loved what Genifique did for my skin</li>
            <li> I pumped a drop on my skin, it smells good</li>
            <li> i have been using this serum for years and found a really good price for it here on amazon.</li>
            <li> and I think this may be good prevention as well.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this is a good product or not, because I cannot tolerate the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> After reserching this, It seemed to be a good product, so I figured I would try it.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if you don&#x27;t start out with good skin, it may be good.</li>
            <li> Price is fair for OTC product.</li>
            <li> and my face look good after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> Not as good as i thought</li>
            <li> texture was good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells so good</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> It smells good.</li>
            <li> The packag was good, but when I start using it</li>
            <li> It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and is very effective for</li>
            <li> I wear it under makeup and on clean face before bed for best results.</li>
            <li> Absorption is very rapid, moist degree is also very good, I feel very good.</li>
            <li> Bargain buy, very satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Youth Code until something better comes along -- my skin is looking great, and I&#x27;m saving a ton of money over the high-priced Genifique.</li>
            <li> Has a nice texture and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome Seller, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> best stuff ever love love love it</li>

            <li> love using it!</li>
            <li> &amp; I love them!</li>
            <li> Love this serum!</li>
            <li> This is NOT as effective as de-crease serum but since Loreal happily discontinues all their most effective products each yaer,  I&#x27;m using what I can afford.</li>
            <li> Another L&#x27;oreal product that I love!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> each monthly salary was $625 people, really want to buy！！！！！This product is very good, very suitable for me....!!!hahahha~~</li>
            <li> This product I have purchased many times in the Amazon, it is very suitable for my skin。I would recommend this product to my family and close friends.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if it were fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Light and smells great.</li>
            <li> This stuff was so amazing that I bought the day lotion as well.</li>
            <li> The cream has a nice scent</li>
            <li> I got a 7-day sample of Lancome Genifique which I really liked.</li>
            <li> and it is just as good as Lancome Genifique if not even better.</li>
            <li> So fat it seems to be just as effective.</li>
            <li> Hydrate really nice and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> it worked really well and its the best skin care ive ever used.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Good cheap price of good activities</li>
            <li> Deluxe serum.  </li>
            <li> :I got this product for testing in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> Not oily and drys nicely.</li>
            <li> I love skincare, have great skin and have tried many products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often said you find out how effective a product is when you run out.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this after comparing it to Lancome&#x27;s Genefique which is a great product &amp; pricey at about $84/oz.</li>
            <li> very good product - feels soft and smells good</li>
            <li> Very easy to use，Delicate texture</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use this any more!</li>
            <li> Very light, smells nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is my opinion that Youth Code serum is by far the best I have</li>
            <li> It is my opinion that Youth Code serum is by far the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This has a very light feeling on my face when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> what I like about it is that it helps the moisturizer go on very smoothly after it</li>
            <li> Love this product, and hope they never discontinue it.  </li>
            <li> Love Amazon also.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I can say is that the price on Amazon is better than Walmarts.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> However, Youth Code leaves my face feeling and looking better than Genifique.  </li>
            <li> Love the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am alergic to most products but this one has not caused me a problem.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have a love affair with serums.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look more awake.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;OREAL Youth code regenerating.</li>
            <li> I think the Lancôme genefique does a better job.  </li>
            <li> s&#x27;ok but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> i love this product and i use it morning and night, on my face, neck, and chest.</li>
            <li> I did like the smell, much better than most</li>
            <li> Love this serum.</li>
            <li> This serum contains much more liquid than the lotion/cream in the line and works better.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use too many skin care products</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li> hoping that she would have better luck with it.</li>
            <li> serum absorbs well, isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne or clog pores, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch or become red/inflamed like so many products</li>
            <li> Youth Code is ok but maybe for someone younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference, but I love using this product.</li>
            <li> And there are SO MANY products with SO MANY promises to try.</li>
            <li> there are probably better serums out there.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> she love the corlour</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s so lightweight</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> In just 3 days, I have noticed smoothness over my face and it made my skin looks brighter and more luminous .</li>
            <li> and most people still say I pass for 25.</li>
            <li> I have used many skin care products, some I am allergic to, but the symptoms always go away except for this one.</li>
            <li> Most don&#x27;t believe I am 50 until they see my kids.....</li>
            <li> I must say the entire \\&quot;advertising\\&quot; got me into the product, and honestly I am very happy I did try it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed is that I seem to be breaking out more and wonder if this is a trade-off for being youthful looking?</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I decided to try the Youth Code line of the L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> Not the most helpful review, but</li>
            <li> , my skin is better than 10 years ago,...</li>
            <li> love it and 10 dollars cheaper than walgreens and Walmart</li>
            <li> I bought an oil of olay serum instead and it works so much better</li>
            <li> I purchased the bottle with the idea that I would be taken care of, in a safe manner but</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> I love Lancome skin serums &amp; everyone</li>
            <li> I do not understand why there are so many rave reviews on here.</li>
            <li> I generally love L&#x27;Oreal products but this did not work for my skin type and concerns.</li>
            <li> , the return policy is much better, I could have returned it If I had purchased from CVS.</li>
            <li> I love what the serum does to your skin.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using Genifique for about two years, I&#x27;m very familiar with the texture and results and this is much better.</li>
            <li> While youth code cream is not bad, this serum is very light and fairly effective.</li>
            <li> And to make my eyes happy, too, since they see those pesky new wrinkles every day.  </li>
            <li> the absorption is quick - and effective.  </li>
            <li> feels smooth and light, not the sticky kind of serum.</li>
            <li> I love the fine art of skin care and makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Genifique, along with a complete Lancome skin regimen for over two years with great results.</li>
            <li> Love the smooth feeling on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was using Skin Genesis Serum and loved it, it really improved how my skin looked.</li>
            <li> The second time in the amazon to buy this, use the effect is very good, and the price is cheap</li>
            <li> It feels cool to the skin and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because of a lot of amazing reviews for it here.</li>
            <li> One pump glides all over my face easily.</li>
            <li> It is strong and clinging and cloying, so I have abandoned it.  </li>
            <li> Nice, like it very much</li>
            <li> The serum is very light but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li> A sweet gift for my wife:)</li>
            <li> It adds illuminousity to the skin and smooths out fine lines.</li>
            <li> Still, I would expect to see some diminishing in the fine lines I already have, and I haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The price - even with shipping was less than the best price I could get in a store.</li>
            <li> I have some pigmintation issues and fine lines/dehydration creping to contend with along with loss of elasticity.</li>
            <li> very good!this product is my favorite thing,i&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li> my wife love it very much!</li>
            <li> In only 2 days my skin has improved greatly.</li>
            <li> nice item, fast express</li>
            <li> Also, I wish it were fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and even use acne free.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It feels smooth.</li>
            <li> For me seems to be too light.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel smooth and silky</li>
            <li> I like the light silky feel and no perfumes.</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> After using this product makes me feel the skin becomes smooth, and I like this feeling.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this product for smooth young-looking skin.  </li>
            <li> knows Loreal is just cheap Lancome</li>
            <li> Thanks L&#x27;Oreal, I love and use many of your products.  </li>
            <li> So far so good (after using it for 13 days).</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m a fairly youthful 41-year old who has stayed out of the sun, never smoked, etc.</li>
            <li> For a tiny bit more money you can get a really good serum from The Body Shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love how this product does not leave an oily film and seems to sink right into the skin.    </li>
            <li> The product is very good, next time also to buy, thank you very much for amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product very much.</li>
            <li> awesome product that lasts because you need to use very little.</li>
            <li> but my skin has cleared up significantly</li>
            <li> After 90 days, there was a significant difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead I picked up a Neutragena Rapid Skin Repair and found the results to be ten times more satisfying!</li>
            <li> By the way, I was even more impressed by the speedy delivery, I ordered with the standard shipping and received the product within the same week.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty sure it was a reaction to the product.</li>
            <li> so my face feels bare, and the scent is pleasant and mild.</li>
            <li> Heck, I even bought the two newest Loreal foundations, Visible Lift Serum Absolute, and Magic Smooth Souffle.</li>
            <li> Heck, I even bought the two newest Loreal foundations, Visible Lift Serum Absolute, and Magic Smooth Souffle.</li>
            <li> this does great things for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Recently I tried a brand called &#x27;&#x27;Nude&#x27;&#x27; (also made in France) which worked okay, didnt break me out, and i liked knowing there wasnt parabens and stuff in it</li>
            <li> I had bought this serum several weeks ago and have been very impressed with the look of my smile lines which were the most bothersome to me in recent times.  </li>
            <li> I wear it daily and have seen amazing results in clearing some fine lines and light spots.</li>
            <li> This is a good solid one and it delivers.</li>
            <li> I love Clinique&#x27;s clinical dark-spot corrector, but again, I&#x27;m trying to be very frugal at the moment.</li>
            <li> It did leave my skin feeling incredibly soft and it smells nice</li>
            <li> She uses the product on a regular basis and has good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> and I am very particular about what I use of my fair sensitive skin, and</li>
            <li> Another great side effect: The first few times I put it on, my husband couldn&#x27;t stop kissing my face :).</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and seems also to help absortion of follow on moistrerizer.</li>
            <li> , it drys too quick, I didn&#x27;t feel it does anything to the skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is adequate.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I need to mention that this seller is off the chain quick.  </li>
            <li> I like the feeling when you apply to your face, it absorbs so quick.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a perfect daily serum and finally found one that works for my skin!</li>
            <li> My skin texture is softer, there is a more even skin tone, and I definitely see a more youthful look.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very effective, just as the other reviews I had read.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s pretty affordable, and I like the idea of using a light serum before my thicker (La Mer) moisturizer.</li>
            <li> High end product, I feel the skin become soft after using, like face returned to 18 years old, is very good</li>
            <li> Not too happy with the price, right after I purchased it, the price went down</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s actually a starter kit of this particular system available for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> I also work under harsh lighting and receive tons of compliments on how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> The whole youthcode line is fabulous, &amp; I will continue to use them faithfully.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended Youth Code, she said it has basically the same effective ingredients.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a specific good point of it, but i just like it and keep using it.</li>
            <li> But I started using this serum after my face wash in the morning and almost immediately I noticed my face is extremely soft, and it feels so light on my skin that my skin stays supple and moisturized all day!</li>
            <li> Love this coz it makes my skin really young</li>
            <li> I would say this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Love this product left my Skin feeling smooth and silky</li>
            <li> Activating Face and EyeSerum - a far better choice)!&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
            <li> when I wake up I look fresh and my wrinkles get smoother every day.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum and just as effective as the more expensive serums from Lancome and other high-end cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Lancome, you can shell more out of pocket for larger sizes, and get a significant discount per ounce.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, my skin has improved vastly since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Right now, I spend $80 on day cream,$80 on Genifique, $80 on night cream, and $60 each on eye cream and eye serum.</li>
            <li> I see the change right away, but after you discontinued, appear again, I can said is just during</li>
            <li> This give you energized skin, seems to give it a healthy pink cheek look, smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> My first time using this fresh glow L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Regenarating Skincare</li>
            <li> I am 35 and am becomming more and more aware of those little pesky lines around my eyes every day.  </li>
            <li> I love the Serum, has made my skin look very youthfull, less wrinkles and very smooth</li>
            <li> i will continue to use this serum as long as it is appropriate for my skin type because i really like the way my skin feels after i apply it: smooth but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, very smooth and skin feels tight immediately;</li>
            <li> I have since gone back to using the texture perfector that I love very much.</li>
            <li> I put it on and instantly feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite better than Genifique.</li>
            <li> This product makes my aging skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This serum is definitely going to help though. :)</li>
            <li> This product made my face feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> but my mistake- i do use it occassionally not on a regular basis like the correcot which I love.</li>
            <li> Youth Code is even better, not only for the price, but this:  </li>
            <li> I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li> but this has really made a difference in the feel and appearance of my skin!</li>
            <li> Thanks, L&#x27;OREAL!</li>
            <li> When first applied, it does leave the skin feeling firmer.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t use this product unless you try it on your arm first.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is light and does not bother my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use the entire youth code line and my skin has changed for the better</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as promised, and came DAYS before promised.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it has helped even out my skin tone and gives me a pretty \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> He loves the way it smells and how it makes my face feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I suddenly look so much better</li>
            <li> and I am definitely seeing tighter and more luminous skin.</li>
            <li> and so far do not see any noticeable difference in my skin but do like the light feeling and not feeling like it&#x27;s plugging up the pores on my face.  </li>
            <li> I got this product because it was on sale and the packaging seemed pretty enticing.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Just love it and am ordering a 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li> So I read online and found that many people believe that the Youth Code (this product) is \\&quot;THE SAME THING, IF NOT</li>
            <li> It sinks in quickly and leaves the area around my eyes immediately softer, smoother, and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the texture perfector but decided I wanted a little more anti aging.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that my skin tone has completely changed, so I feel comfortable leaving the house without makeup for the first time in a long time!</li>
            <li> It does make my skin glow more, not majorly</li>
            <li> On the bright side I didn&#x27;t breakout or anything like that, there was just no difference neither good nor bad.</li>
            <li> I have bright red, itchy, zit like bumps all over my face that are starting to come to a head.</li>
            <li> My fine lines disappeared, and the two vertical lines between my eyebrows (i.e. \\&quot;elevens\\&quot;) are barely visible.  </li>
            <li> it is not Lancôme Genifique, leaving more skin glow &amp; softness.&lt;br /&gt;Genifique is soooo expensive, this is a really good alternative</li>
            <li> Regenerating Skincare Serum Intense Daily Treatment through Allure&#x27;s list of award winning products.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many skin care products, but this is the one I wish I had a long time ago.</li>
            <li> first I was really liking it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really explain exactly what I like about this.  </li>
            <li> But since I got such good results from this low cost serum, I am ready to try anything from this brand.</li>
            <li> It feels good, not sure I think it is doing anything to the wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> This lasted a pretty long time, I use it during the daytime on dry areas, and was surprised how effective, but light it was!</li>
            <li> Youth Code serum doesn&#x27;t seem to do much, it does not give me the rich texture, healthy, firm and hydrated skin</li>
            <li> I really liked Lancome Genifique, so I thought I&#x27;d try this L&#x27;Oreal product which is supposed to be their version at half the price.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and apply, that I would definitely recommend and reorder this item.</li>
            <li> Loreal has certainly earned my respect and business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loreal has certainly earned my respect and business.     </li>
            <li> However, if you have dryer skin then this will certainly do the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is certainly plenty of room for improvement...</li>
            <li> and I do see an overall improvement of fine lines and clarity.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not noticing any changes with my complexion or the fine lines that I&#x27;m starting to develop.</li>
            <li> I would rather pay a little more for something useful</li>
            <li> have great skin to begin with, but have gotten a few brown spots over the years and wanted to try this out to see if I notice anything different.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I can&#x27;t really tell if it did anything.</li>
            <li> IT’S VERY CHEAPER FOR CHINA</li>
            <li> i have/had sun damage on my chest from too much sun.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have to say I really like this product.</li>
            <li> But I really am suprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li> very good，my skin  like it</li>
            <li> I purchased the whole product line and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day</li>
            <li> I bought the Youth Code Serum Intense to try it up.  </li>
            <li> The chemical burn was intense.  </li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fast to ship to my country.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no doubt, that the Genifique at $78 per ounce performs where this does nothing much at all.</li>
            <li> Boo-hoo as I was really, really cheering for this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much so that I gave it to my grandma</li>
            <li> 66 and spent many hours in the sun.</li>
            <li> This is really the alternatives to Lancome Genefique.</li>
            <li> i did not like this product as much as i like the loreal youth code spot correcting serum.</li>
            <li> the beginning of jowls, but one or both are doing the trick very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> and if I put too much on, it gets flaky and just sits on the surface of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It really works on the crow feet area.</li>
            <li> I also have very combo skin with an oily t-zone.</li>
            <li> Well, as others have mentioned it does not take much product to cover your whole face, which is sort of nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells good, and feels delicate.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised that the first three ingredients on L&#x27;Oreals Youth Code is identical to the first three on &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any real improvement of lines/wrinkles, but that is not really the purpose of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is refreshing</li>
            <li> And because the Lancome is the more expensive one, they probably put MORE of the expensive good healthy ingredients that will help our skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps me looking young!!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in the overall tone and texture of my skin from using this line.</li>
            <li> the active ingredients are comparable to lancome&#x27;s product (genifique, i think), though i am sure the lancome version must have more of the active ingredient, because otherwise it seems like there would have been a whistleblower case by now.</li>
            <li> Goes on so smoothly under my make-up that you can barely tell you have it on and it protects my skin from irritation from cosmetics, as i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I felt like it didn&#x27;t really sink in but kind of formed small pills on my skin.</li>
            <li> Make up goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to absorb.</li>
            <li> This product is fine - just can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better or worse than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle to my face.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this new booster</li>
            <li> So when I read the good and bad reviews about this serum, I was leaning more towards \\&quot;it</li>
            <li> Did not feel particularly good.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It was better enough that I could tell the difference the following day.  </li>
            <li> this left my face luminous, smooth, &amp; a natural youthful glow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, but I don&#x27;t think it has done a ton to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> Comparatively, I found Genifique to be much richer to the point where it is almost moisturizing, whereas Youth Code is quickly absorbed and disappears on my skin totally.</li>
            <li> Many people seem to believe that because L&#x27;oreal and Lancome are under the same parent company, they believe that the Youth Code line is the same as the Genifique line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it is just that I have enough good products that really seem to make a difference for me, and there is just no more room, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend every woman to try it.  </li>
            <li> I know my expectations are too high.</li>
            <li> This is my go to BB cream, comparable to premium brands without the high price tag.</li>
            <li> High alcohol content I think, drying, smells like my grandma.</li>
            <li> High cost performance, but I use the allergy</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are very similar, but the Youth Code has a couple of other skin loving ingredients that Genifique lacks.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal essence muscle bottom liquid, a very high cost-effective cosmetic liquid, apply clear gloss, we recommend a beauty liquid.</li>
            <li> It also helps clear up pimples, at age 30 one would figure I didn&#x27;t break out as much as I do, anyway</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t expected Youth Code to feel so smooth</li>
            <li> It does have a floral odor that many of you could find too heavy.</li>
            <li> and I have used it long enough to say that I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> The normal question is did I have plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s and don&#x27;t really have wrinkles or age spots to treat yet, so I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkle fighting claims, but I do love it so much I plan on buying it again and continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> I am 48 - and have sensitive skin - and this product is for me - quick, simple, and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to do my skin treatment right after cleansing though, so I&#x27;m going back to my serum from Wexler.</li>
            <li> But Loreal discontinued it and came out with this new product.</li>
            <li> Really needs to be paired with a more substantial cream if you&#x27;re looking for hydration, but my skin is less red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> I will use occasionally at night to help fight wrinkles and to enjoy the softness I just can&#x27;t use daily.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had no irritation like with other products that have helped with the fine lines and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Packaging was very old looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought it and used it for the first time last night before going to bed and this morning.</li>
            <li> then again, I started using it because I wanted to avoid deep wrinkles in the first place, so maybe I just can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> After the first couple of days I started breaking out and this is the only change I made to my skin routine.</li>
            <li> But the smell is a little bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li> what really amazes me about this particular product is that it is definitely plumping my lips, not Olay.</li>
            <li> I am not seeing any result on this product and it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed too well on my dry skin</li>
            <li> I went back to my usual products &amp; got back my good results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard not to appreciate their potent moisturizing effects and the way they freshen skin.</li>
            <li> just so you know that I&#x27;m not an 18 year old reviewing wrinkle products).</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe how soft and luminous my face has become.</li>
            <li> i am a young looking 60 year old woman.  </li>
            <li> I have been amazed at how the lines on my chest have become much softer to the point where I can wear a low necked  shirt again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Genefique leaves my face soft and youthful but youth code does nothing.</li>
            <li> I am battling adult acne and the medication I use dries out my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it helps wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have any so far</li>
            <li> No miracles so far, but I am a patient person.</li>
            <li> I am a 34-year old researcher/teacher who enjoys taking care of his skin.  </li>
            <li> I checked the batch code when I got the product, and it was about 5 years old.  </li>
            <li> (Quite old for skincare.)  </li>
            <li> As a 45 year old, I need something that hydrates without making me breakout.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day and often after my morning shower as well as at bed time and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it three stars because it has too much fragrance in it for me.</li>
            <li> am 65 years old and my peers think I&#x27;m 59.  </li>
            <li> I saw this product and thought it would be great for helping with the small dark sun spots I&#x27;ve been starting to get.</li>
            <li> I used 3 pumps of it - 2 pumps for whole face and neck, then 1 extra pump for my eyes, forehead, and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It seems to keep my skin soft and soften wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle on this and didn&#x27;t notice any difference, it claims that pores wouldn&#x27;t look as obvious which it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soft...</li>
            <li> It revive to boost to make my face alive.</li>
            <li> With continued use of this product, my upper and lower lips are very noticeably fuller.</li>
            <li> And so far no breakouts using it morning and night...</li>
            <li> Followed directions completely.</li>
            <li> It also felt very sticky and I didn&#x27;t since any extra hydration that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> He diagnosed me with Rosacea which I never knew I had before I ordered the Youth Code Intense daily serum.  </li>
            <li> My guess is they probably change the proportion of how much of each ingredient goes into the different products.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s as good as the serum, I can&#x27;t see a reason to spend hundreds of dollars on expensive creams.</li>
            <li> it makes me feel good looking in the mirror, not looking as tired as I feel!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very concentrated that a single drop contains enough moisture for me to apply all over my face and my neck (true, I don&#x27;t have a big face but still)  </li>
            <li> This Youth Code has a lovely scent, not strong but just enough when applying.  </li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, so I was surprised by this result.</li>
            <li> I got better results when I put the serious anti-aging cream directly on my skin without the Youth Code barrier between my skin and the cream.  </li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris youth code skincare serum is not only for the young and youthful looking women but also for those of us who are getting older.  </li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris youth code skincare serum is not only for the young and youthful looking women but also for those of us who are getting older.</li>
            <li> This little bottle really IS as good as Lancome&#x27;s Genifique and at a small fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> but, on my fair skin, face turns red and slight burning sensation after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the L&#x27;Oreal serum that gave my skin such dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and started to notice creases in my forehead that are becoming permanent.</li>
            <li> Of course I usually put an oil free moisturizer with SPF over it</li>
            <li> I used the last of my Youth Code serum before xmas, and didn&#x27;t buy a new bottle until 10 days ago.</li>
            <li> I also started using a BB cream at the same time, so the two combined are really whipping my facial skin into shape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple weeks and didn&#x27;t see a difference, but then tried it at a different time of day when my skin wasn&#x27;t wet and could see a noticeable difference in my laugh lines.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s style ,feel very soft and i will be back again!</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that the human eye is not able to see fine lines around the eyes - that what we are seeing is the shadow of a wrinkle.  </li>
            <li> I am generally one to doubt the efficiency of cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, but for some reason considered re-buying it until I saw a review on Youtube that shed more light on it: Alcohol is a no no for the skin, as well as perfume.</li>
            <li> I am a young 78 and have been using this product for several months now and those wrinkles around my mouth have disappeared</li>
            <li> By the way, my skin is a combination skin, so even drinking 8 glasses of water, barely wearing makeup, and washing my face twice a day still doesn&#x27;t keep pimples away.</li>
            <li> The box says to use 2-3 drops, but one drop is enough to completely cover my face and part of my neck quite liberally</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know which of the two products, this or Oil of Olay, has definitely improved (almost completely eliminating)</li>
            <li> I find that this stuff really works, I am on my third bottle of it, It actually has the same ingredients as the Lancome genifique.  </li>
            <li> I am a young 78 and have been using this product for several months now and those wrinkles around my mouth have disappeared</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results, but want to know will it actually fade the old acne scars and age spots.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed any big improvements from this, other than it helps to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingle when I first put it on, but otherwise, no irritation.</li>
            <li> I am in my 20s, two months ago I noticed a slight line right under my left eye.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much results other than that.  </li>
            <li> For me, at least, this product is worth it for 24/7 plump lips!</li>
            <li> I was looking for some face serum, and I&#x27;m on a pretty tight budget at the time.</li>
            <li> Not a single line.</li>
            <li> I completely finished the bottle only to find my face the way it was prior to my purchase.</li>
            <li> it keeps the skin soft for a reallly long time.</li>
            <li> Personally I was using it for past acne redness, because the Dark Spot Corrector Version didn&#x27;t have as many rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a decent drugstore substitute, based on some other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am mid-forties with very sensitive skin, so I have to pick carefully what I put on it.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it right after washing my face and briefly towel drying.</li>
            <li> La Mer, EMK Placental, and other high end products are my regular routine type products and I didn&#x27;t think this 15 dollar serum would make the cut</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I mixed in a half scoop of Philosophy Turbo Booster C powder in the a.m. to this serum, so the combination of these two products may be why my skin has improved so much.  </li>
            <li> obvious effect, and cheaper than lancome。i will use it for long time, i think i will buy the bigger one.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that I did not need to spend $$$$$ for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> +, dry hormonal skin, I&#x27;d been using Olay&#x27;s Regenerist and Total Effects with some Neutrogena items thrown in also for quite awhile, but I&#x27;d hit a point where they weren&#x27;t working so well for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a year and a half, and my skin has this soft focus effect &amp; a glow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 35 with just a couple of wrinkles, but my skin is normally dry, somewhat flaky, deep pores, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other products but had never seen such a lasting effect.     </li>
            <li> the other hand, after using it nightly for a few weeks I can&#x27;t tell that it really does anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a horrible smell, it&#x27;s just that my dog goes crazy and keeps trying to lick my face.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this for that long.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to try it.  </li>
            <li> Still experimenting with this product after a few weeks but don&#x27;t feel or notice any difference in skin texture or tone so far.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be similar to lancome visionairee</li>
            <li> (I hate when one of my favorite items is discontinued and I have to start a new search.)</li>
            <li> the bottle has lasted me a VERY long time, i&#x27;m just now running out (Aug)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American male and about ten years ago, I slightly burned parts of my face, leaving me with subtle dark spots that were very much noticeable from afar.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been fickle, between being too oily, or too dry, or even acne ridden.</li>
            <li> I have acne pron skin that is dry</li>
            <li> With age, my lips have thinned considerably, especially my upper lip, which was basically a thin, almost straight line.</li>
            <li> If the sole purpose of you buying L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s &amp;#34;Youth Code&amp;#34; is to remove dark spots from your face, RUN.</li>
            <li> I do not normally spend obscene amounts of money on skin care products.</li>
            <li> As I am running out of the Genifique Youth Activator, I was looking to buy a new one, but for $100, I found the price hard to justify.</li>
            <li> Lasts very long as just one drop is required for the face!</li>
            <li> This product seems to irrigate my pores, so present wrinkles are less noticeable and plumps up my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not dry now, its used to looked like a dried piece of foundation cake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely not seeing a decrease in the wrinkles on my forehead but my skin became immediately softer and being winter, usually I need a heavy cream to keep my skin from drying out but so far,</li>
            <li> Second purchase a little problem, Amazon has been resolved.</li>
            <li> It helps also to prevent the rapid lines due to my face is dry.</li>
            <li> only bad thing I can say about the Youth Code is I notice a little more perfume-y scent to this compared to the Genifique, but it dissipates in a minute or</li>
            <li> but it does give your skin a great base for your makeup!</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks like they used the cheapest perfume available.</li>
            <li> No thanks to this garbage L&#x27;oreal product.</li>
            <li> Sorry that I can&#x27;t give any info to anyone wondering if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Trouble is, only one coupon can be used at a time, and the largest of them was for $10.00.  </li>
            <li> One tries.</li>
            <li> I will probably just pay for the Lancome products that I know work from now on instead of wasting money on unknown products.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and leaves no residue behind.</li>
            <li> The parcel faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I found out one of the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> I am not totally certain that this eliminates any wrinkles</li>
            <li> Very dry skin becomes drier!</li>
            <li> I used for a couple of weeks and notice only a very slight difference in skin.</li>
            <li> The Youth Code Serum seems to be soaked into your skin to make it soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> I think for a $20 serum (which I paid for at the local Walmart in Southern California), it is NOT a good deal.</li>
            <li> So many similar products are crazy expensive, but Amazon had a coupon to knock an extra 25% off this one making it</li>
            <li> this point, after I finish my other department store products, I will try the other Loreal creams.</li>
            <li> and I not planning to change  using it, like I have done with other products.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try due to its lower price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way cheaper than chemical peels (ouch) and the other brands.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it, but due to a problem with the bottle, it did not dispense.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other creams and they did not seem to help.</li>
            <li> the only concern is that the tube is quite small.</li>
            <li> Its no miracle worker like some other products from the EMK Placental line I use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m encouraged to buy the other creams.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face extremely moisturized so if you&#x27;re on the oiler side</li>
            <li> and I can honesly say, that I do see some difference, but I also use other products.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it works in a different way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I spent so much money on this.</li>
            <li> so my skin is aged a little past my actual years.  </li>
            <li> but once you stop using this, and see nothing but dull skin staring back at you in the mirror, trust me, you&#x27;ll keep using it like me.</li>
            <li> Every time I buy a new face product I expect to see dramatic changes...</li>
            <li> Youth Code contains N Hydroxysuccinimide, which is an ester used in skincare that helps reduce dark pigments and inflammation of the skin.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not worth it...</li>
            <li> My only negative</li>
            <li> I have tried to get rid of a dark spot on my nose.</li>
            <li> I am 28 yrs old &amp; have the beginning of the thin creased lines on each side of my mouth-</li>
            <li> It does not feel as tight as the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Im not afraid to buy the expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> and she has way less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The texture is almost identical, but the Youth Code is less slimy.</li>
            <li> I tried a less expensive version of a similar product and it did not have the same results.  </li>
            <li> Slight.</li>
            <li> so I end up using much less.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several weeks and find that I have gotten the same results from less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I give it four stars because, though, i&#x27;ve seen results the \\&quot;main\\&quot; wrinkle i have along my forehead, has made but a slight change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks now and my face is a mess.</li>
            <li> This is not true.</li>
            <li> is a bit tight</li>
            <li> to carry&lt;br /&gt;Not tight after use</li>
            <li> But the price is a little steep for me...</li>
            <li> little background:  </li>
            <li> I think it has made a little difference around my eyes since I have been using it for about a month.  </li>
            <li> , sometimes when I get a little irritation or notice SOMETHING, that means change (cellular turnover, improvements,</li>
            <li> I do think my pores are shrinking a little, and that my skin feels a little bit softer.  </li>
            <li> little pimples appear, so had to stop using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a little over 2 months</li>
            <li> But I have decided, it will be painful, but Genifique Youth Activator is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So I picked up a few samples of Lancome&#x27;s Genifique serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after a few weeks I can compare Lancome&#x27;s Genifique Youth Activating Concentrate and the L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code Serum.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a happy solution for me, and L&#x27;Oreal is definitely off my list.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of uneven skin and also scarring from acne.  </li>
            <li> I did use one moisturizer frm this company &amp; it was too heavy for my skin &amp; broke me out.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for about a month and my face went back to looking tired and my skin showed signs of sagging.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I just wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> Will have to use it for a few months to give a fairer assessment of the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am disappointed, but it was worth a try for me</li>
            <li> However, after only 2 days, my skin has broken out into thousands of little bumps!!</li>
            <li> I have been a little lax in my regimen lately</li>
            <li> but if I stop using it, within a few days my skin &amp;#34;dulls.&amp;#34; Its hard to explain to people but my skin just lacks a bit of luster that I do notice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice a difference in the past 2 weeks of using the product twice a day.</li>
            <li> not sure it works.</li>
            <li> I was scheduled to spend about $1000 on collagen injections at my dermatologists this past week.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to believe all the hype, but you have to try it to find out if it works for you.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s,</li>
            <li> My skin was not loving it.</li>
            <li> My nose was not loving it - smells like bug spray to me.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used the Philosophy product alone, and my skin didn&#x27;t improve in the way it has lately.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used at least 3-4 bottles of this product.</li>
            <li> Will not buy again...at least for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also has an awful cheap smell to it (which goes away after awhile).</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Sticky, thick but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is NOT to be taken seriously.</li>
            <li> After using Youth Code, now that annoying line is gone completely!</li>
            <li> This product is not good if you have an acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> The redness would fade but was still irritating.</li>
            <li> I figured I would start a skin care regimen before these wrinkles got worse.</li>
            <li> Made worse by the fact that I cannot return the product.</li>
            <li> my skin had been looking exhausted, probably because I have been and this did the trick-</li>
            <li> My wrinkles have increased &amp; seem worse now.</li>
            <li> I paid for two but only  one usable, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> And doe not have any effect on my skin, it may be fake.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I received a fake one.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that it did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately got lots of pimples too.</li>
            <li> I got this product hoping that it would work as well as all the reviews said it would unfortunately my skin did not agree too well with it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the review I read, but not any longer.</li>
            <li> bought this after getting one of these expensive test facials at a department stores, didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on a serum,&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> but is just too expensive.</li>
            <li> And it made my skin break out worse than it ever has in my life!</li>
            <li> Not impressed by this product, would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> but it feels to be a very thin layer</li>
            <li> Too bad this wasn&#x27;t unscented.</li>
            <li> so I doubt it&#x27;s a bad reaction with something else I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> No manual products, feeling bad, ask to return money.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist told me not to use Youth Code because it has alcohol in it, and he says it is bad for my face.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also the animal testing is incredibly cruel.  </li>
            <li> but this junk is just awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal test their products on animals. I convince my friends mom to stop putting this on her skin because of all the toxic chemicals in this product. Also the animal testing is incredibly cruel.  She stopped buying it and said it didn&#x27;t work anyway. She now rubs her skin with organic fair trade coconut oil once a day and she has way less wrinkles. No thanks to this garbage L&#x27;oreal product. Pay attention to the ingredients in the things you put in and on your body!</li>
            <li> Oh to sell a time machine in a bottle, NOT!!! Does nothing, absolutely nothing!&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money. Very dry skin becomes drier!</li>
            <li> as good as i used before.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris youth code skincare serum is not only for the young and youthful looking women but also for those of us who are getting older.  I am a young 78 and have been using this product for several months now and those wrinkles around my mouth have disappeared and I have no crows feet at the eyes, I even use it on my neck.  Love this product, and hope they never discontinue it.  I am buying some for my daughters who are 55 and 53.    Thanks L&#x27;Oreal, I love and use many of your products.  I odered it from Amazon and it is a continuous order.  Amazon automatically sends it to me monthly at a great price.  Love Amazon also.  Never have to go out and shop.  Just go to Amazon and find shoes, prisms for my lamp that broke.  What a life, no running from store to store just sitting and searching and push the \\&quot;enter\\&quot; button and the shopping is finished.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I can&#x27;t really tell if it did anything. The cream has a nice scent but otherwise I just can&#x27;t say. Sorry that I can&#x27;t give any info to anyone wondering if it&#x27;s worth it.The one thing I can say is that the price on Amazon is better than Walmarts. That&#x27;s one of the reasons I tried it.</li>
            <li> I got a 7-day sample of Lancome Genifique which I really liked. But the price is a little steep for me... My friend recommended Youth Code, she said it has basically the same effective ingredients. So I tried this and it is just as good as Lancome Genifique if not even better. I am in my 20s, two months ago I noticed a slight line right under my left eye. It was not noticeable unless I stuck my face into the mirror but I was worried it&#x27;s a start of something. After using Youth Code, now that annoying line is gone completely! I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> IT’S VERY CHEAPER FOR CHINA</li>
            <li> I just finished using Lancome Genifique which did a good job.  However, Youth Code leaves my face feeling and looking better than Genifique.  I would recommend it to women over 50.  So far so good (after using it for 13 days).</li>
            <li> After reading lots of reviews of various products I decided to give this one a try.  So many similar products are crazy expensive, but Amazon had a coupon to knock an extra 25% off this one making it the winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m loving it!  I am 35 and am becomming more and more aware of those little pesky lines around my eyes every day.  This product diminishes the look of those lines immediately!  I put it on and instantly feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, very smooth and skin feels tight immediately; but, on my fair skin, face turns red and slight burning sensation after a few seconds. After about 1 minute, the redness disappears and skin almost &#x27;cools off&#x27;. I stuck w/it for a month and decided to try something else to see if its my skin, or the product.</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> As a strictly department store skin care gal,I decided to try Youth Code because of its similarities to Lancome&#x27;s Genifique. I&#x27;ve been using Genifique, along with a complete Lancome skin regimen for over two years with great results. However, I&#x27;m finishing my college degree and money is a bit tight (I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s, just so you know that I&#x27;m not an 18 year old reviewing wrinkle products). Therefore, I decided to try Youth Code since it made similar claims as Lancome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how soft and luminous my face has become. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and it&#x27;s truly wonderful. It&#x27;s actually quite better than Genifique. No comparison. Since Lancome is owned by Loreal, I decided to check out the ingredients list for both products. They are very similar, but the Youth Code has a couple of other skin loving ingredients that Genifique lacks. They both seem to make the same claims that are also rooted in genetic research. The texture is almost identical, but the Youth Code is less slimy. Since I&#x27;ve been using Genifique for about two years, I&#x27;m very familiar with the texture and results and this is much better. Most importantly, my skin has improved vastly since the first time I used it. Even my hands are softer, since I use them to apply the product. I did not experience these same results with the pricier product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, after I finish my other department store products, I will try the other Loreal creams. There&#x27;s actually a starter kit of this particular system available for a pretty good price. If it&#x27;s as good as the serum, I can&#x27;t see a reason to spend hundreds of dollars on expensive creams. Right now, I spend $80 on day cream,$80 on Genifique, $80 on night cream, and $60 each on eye cream and eye serum. Although my face looks great as a result, my bank account does not. I believe in quality skin care and don&#x27;t mind paying for a good product. But since I got such good results from this low cost serum, I am ready to try anything from this brand. Heck, I even bought the two newest Loreal foundations, Visible Lift Serum Absolute, and Magic Smooth Souffle. Honestly, these are the two best foundations I have ever owned. They are particularly wonderful if used after applying Youth Code serum and a moisturizer. Loreal has certainly earned my respect and business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my opinion that Youth Code serum is by far the best I have ever tried.s brand.

            <li> best stuff ever love love love it</li>
            <li> I have been using Youth Code Serum for 3 months and I not planning to change  using it, like I have done with other products.  I love the Serum, has made my skin look very youthfull, less wrinkles and very smooth and I use it along with the day/night cream every day and night.  I truly like them and I highly recommend every woman to try it.  They will like it, I am sure! just like I do.</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and seems also to help absortion of follow on moistrerizer. feels smooth and light, not the sticky kind of serum. Like it and will buy again</li>
            <li> i am a young looking 60 year old woman.  i have/had sun damage on my chest from too much sun.  i had noticable vertical lines on my declotee.  i began using youth code there, as well as on my face.  I have been amazed at how the lines on my chest have become much softer to the point where I can wear a low necked  shirt again.  I also work under harsh lighting and receive tons of compliments on how great my skin looks.  love how this product does not leave an oily film and seems to sink right into the skin.    i just can&#x27;t say enough about the virtues of this product.  Simply Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I was using Skin Genesis Serum and loved it, it really improved how my skin looked. But Loreal discontinued it and came out with this new product. So I tried it. My skin was not loving it. It got red and irritated. The redness would fade but was still irritating. My nose was not loving it - smells like bug spray to me. So off to find something else that will make my skin and nose happy again. And to make my eyes happy, too, since they see those pesky new wrinkles every day.  (I hate when one of my favorite items is discontinued and I have to start a new search.) Eveyone&#x27;s skin is different. Youth Code serum may work great for you. It did not for me.</li>
            <li> I was using Genefique before youth code. I decided to give this a try due to its lower price. I finished the bottle but I must say this is nothing like genefique.&lt;br /&gt;Genefique leaves my face soft and youthful but youth code does nothing. Anyway I am back to using genefique.</li>
            <li> I think it is very good for me</li>
            <li> This product makes my aging skin feel smooth and soft. I am alergic to most products but this one has not caused me a problem.</li>
            <li> I am generally one to doubt the efficiency of cosmetic products. So when I read the good and bad reviews about this serum, I was leaning more towards \\&quot;it&#x27;s not gonna work for me\\&quot; side...I bought it and used it for the first time last night before going to bed and this morning. When I looked at myself in the mirror the spots seemed lighter, but I doubted myself (being pessimistic) and went about my day. Then tonight I checked again and my eyes were not lying! Let me tell you!!! My post acne marks are TWO shades lighter. This product is wonderful! Believe me, I know it&#x27;s hard to believe all the hype, but you have to try it to find out if it works for you. It&#x27;s way cheaper than chemical peels (ouch) and the other brands. By the way, my skin is a combination skin, so even drinking 8 glasses of water, barely wearing makeup, and washing my face twice a day still doesn&#x27;t keep pimples away. This serum is definitely going to help though. :)</li>
            <li> Bargain buy, very satisfied</li>
            <li> I have used many products on the market and this one has been one of the best. I bought this after reading the reviews and tried it along with my facial regimen. This product made my face feel smooth and soft. I am battling adult acne and the medication I use dries out my face. I am also at the age where I worry about wrinkles, especially around my eyes. I&#x27;ve notice a difference in the past 2 weeks of using the product twice a day.</li>
            <li> It doe not have the container. I got two bottles, each one Is 0.05oz. It looks like is used. And doe not have any effect on my skin, it may be fake. I Do not like this item</li>
            <li> So it looks like L&#x27;Oreal finally repackaged its Genifique-related patents into cheaper offerings for the mass market. So fat it seems to be just as effective. Excellent serum!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Amazon comes through again.</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s lightweight. I use it for morning. I can&#x27;t really tell a specific good point of it, but i just like it and keep using it.</li>
            <li> I thought I bought the corrector- but my mistake- i do use it occassionally not on a regular basis like the correcot which I love.</li>
            <li> I have tried many skin care products, but this is the one I wish I had a long time ago. In only 2 days my skin has improved greatly. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have to say I really like this product. I love the fine art of skin care and makeup and I am very particular about what I use of my fair sensitive skin, and Im not afraid to buy the expensive stuff! :) But I really am suprised at how well this works. it makes me feel good looking in the mirror, not looking as tired as I feel! This give you energized skin, seems to give it a healthy pink cheek look, smooth and fresh. I dont know if this has antioxidants in it or what, but Im hooked. Give it a try</li>
            <li> I have a love affair with serums. It&#x27;s hard not to appreciate their potent moisturizing effects and the way they freshen skin. This is a good solid one and it delivers. The box says to use 2-3 drops, but one drop is enough to completely cover my face and part of my neck quite liberally so I feel that I&#x27;m getting lots of bang for my buck with this one. It makes my skin look more awake. It does have a floral odor that many of you could find too heavy. This product is a great bargain. I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not mistaken, this product will be sold to 300 yuan in China，The equivalent of about 46 US dollars。For each monthly salary was $625 people, really want to buy！！！！！This product is very good, very suitable for me....!!!hahahha~~</li>
            <li> It feels good, not sure I think it is doing anything to the wrinkles on my face. Not ordering anymore.</li>
            <li> NOTE:  The picture Amazon is showing is incorrect, this is not in a tube, it&#x27;s in an air-pump bottle.  I have uploaded a photo of the correct item you will receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background:  I&#x27;m 45+, dry hormonal skin, I&#x27;d been using Olay&#x27;s Regenerist and Total Effects with some Neutrogena items thrown in also for quite awhile, but I&#x27;d hit a point where they weren&#x27;t working so well for me.  So I picked up a few samples of Lancome&#x27;s Genifique serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after a few weeks I can compare Lancome&#x27;s Genifique Youth Activating Concentrate and the L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code Serum.  In case you don&#x27;t know, L&#x27;Oreal owns Lancôme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I loved what Genifique did for my skin I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $80 for 1 ounce of serum. Youth Code is even better, not only for the price, but this:  After comparing these two serums, their ingredient deck is almost identical, except Youth Code contains two beneficial peptides that Genifique doesn&#x27;t have, as well as Youth Code contains N Hydroxysuccinimide, which is an ester used in skincare that helps reduce dark pigments and inflammation of the skin.  Additionally, Lancome&#x27;s Genifique contains castor oil, which I&#x27;d rather not ingest through my skin or my mouth (yuck!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I can say about the Youth Code is I notice a little more perfume-y scent to this compared to the Genifique, but it dissipates in a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth Code has taken my skin up a notch from the Olay products.  I&#x27;m using Youth Code until something better comes along -- my skin is looking great, and I&#x27;m saving a ton of money over the high-priced Genifique.</li>
            <li> nice item, fast express</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;OREAL Youth code regenerating. I use this daily and night as well. it keeps my skin hydrated. I use cream too at night.</li>
            <li> it looks good，I give my mom</li>
            <li> Love this product! Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The item I received from 1000beauty has a worn packing with detached sticker.  I pumped a drop on my skin, it smells good but it feels to be a very thin layer, it drys too quick, I didn&#x27;t feel it does anything to the skin.  I think the Lancôme genefique does a better job.  Or maybe I received a fake one.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum and just as effective as the more expensive serums from Lancome and other high-end cosmetics.  I use it daily and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and started to notice creases in my forehead that are becoming permanent. I figured I would start a skin care regimen before these wrinkles got worse. I researched and found great reviews with Youth Code so I bought this, [[ASIN:B0047F708O L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Day Lotion, SPF 30, 1.7-Fluid Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B0047F71SS L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Day/Night Cream, 1.6-Fluid Ounce]]. It just came in on December 23rd so I don&#x27;t expect to have results yet that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m rating it 3 stars. I&#x27;m definitely not seeing a decrease in the wrinkles on my forehead but my skin became immediately softer and being winter, usually I need a heavy cream to keep my skin from drying out but so far, no flakes. Also, I wish it were fragrance free. It&#x27;s not a horrible smell, it&#x27;s just that my dog goes crazy and keeps trying to lick my face. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update this review in a month or so.</li>
            <li> s&#x27;ok but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been fickle, between being too oily, or too dry, or even acne ridden. But I started using this serum after my face wash in the morning and almost immediately I noticed my face is extremely soft, and it feels so light on my skin that my skin stays supple and moisturized all day! Of course I usually put an oil free moisturizer with SPF over it but my skin has cleared up significantly AND my redness has lessened!!! I&#x27;ve only had this a week!! I was hesitant because of the price but this has really made a difference in the feel and appearance of my skin! I will definitely continue to use it over the years of my life!</li>
            <li> i have been using this serum for years and found a really good price for it here on amazon. at drug stores it is $20. the active ingredients are comparable to lancome&#x27;s product (genifique, i think), though i am sure the lancome version must have more of the active ingredient, because otherwise it seems like there would have been a whistleblower case by now. i love this product and i use it morning and night, on my face, neck, and chest. it hydrates my skin without being greasy and i use it before my sunscreen without reaction. in winter, i use a heavier face lotion, which i apply after using this product. i will continue to use this serum as long as it is appropriate for my skin type because i really like the way my skin feels after i apply it: smooth but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This product is adequate. I did like the smell, much better than most and it&#x27;s not too heavy. Really needs to be paired with a more substantial cream if you&#x27;re looking for hydration, but my skin is less red and blotchy. I use it in conjunction with a moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Hydrate really nice and lasts all day.  Don&#x27;t know if it helps wrinkles as I don&#x27;t have any so far and I think this may be good prevention as well. Great product</li>
            <li> Great price and great product!</li>
            <li> it worked really well and its the best skin care ive ever used.</li>
            <li> very good，my skin  like it</li>
            <li> Every time I buy a new face product I expect to see dramatic changes...I know my expectations are too high. This product is fine - just can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better or worse than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Has a nice texture and feels good on skin. Smells nice too. No miracles so far, but I am a patient person.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st and best serum I have ever used, I 1st used a trial kit and have been stuck on it ever since! Good buy!</li>
            <li> I am a 34-year old researcher/teacher who enjoys taking care of his skin.  Understanding chemicals and how some can help improve my skin, I tried Youth Code serum based on its ingredients.  I am impressed.  I&#x27;ve been using these products, and eating vegetables only, for some time.  The comments on my face keep piling in.  \\&quot;You look like you&#x27;re in your 20s!\\&quot;. Thanks, L&#x27;OREAL!</li>
            <li> USA produced, bought it for my mother, hope she like it.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this is a good product or not, because I cannot tolerate the smell of it.  It is strong and clinging and cloying, so I have abandoned it.  Too bad this wasn&#x27;t unscented.</li>
            <li> Beware!  I checked the batch code when I got the product, and it was about 5 years old.  (Quite old for skincare.)  Packaging was very old looking.  Made worse by the fact that I cannot return the product.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and see no changes. When first applied, it does leave the skin feeling firmer. However, it wears off. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and even use acne free.  As a 45 year old, I need something that hydrates without making me breakout.  This stuff feels silky on my skin and I have used it long enough to say that I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This has a very light feeling on my face when I put it on.  It feels cool to the skin and very comfortable.  I think it has made a little difference around my eyes since I have been using it for about a month.  Not a miracle, but I like it.</li>
            <li> This serum contains much more liquid than the lotion/cream in the line and works better.  I use it at least once a day and often after my morning shower as well as at bed time and have been pleased with the results.  There is no miracle cream out there but this has made a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.  Smooths my skin.  I use it day and night and it keeps my skin moisturized all day.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I put this on before my mosturizer in the morning and nite.  It adds illuminousity to the skin and smooths out fine lines.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy. This is my go to BB cream, comparable to premium brands without the high price tag. Leaves a glowing summery look on your skin with some coverage.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if it were fragrance free.  I only gave it three stars because it has too much fragrance in it for me.</li>
            <li> I was using Estee Lauder anti-aging products, but wanted to try something cheaper.  After reserching this, It seemed to be a good product, so I figured I would try it.  I am sorry to say that it did nothing for me.  Actually since I stopped using the Estee Lauder I noticed that the results Estee Lauder had given me were gone.  I kept using Youth code, but after a month still nothing. I will be going back to my Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product. I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s with very sensitive skin that&#x27;s combination that still breaks out from time to time. I have noticed a significant difference in the overall tone and texture of my skin from using this line. The serum is very light but absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s not greasy and seems to not only work on tone and texture but also breakouts. I purchased the whole product line and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and I just love it!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Seruum Intense,&lt;br /&gt;I am 65 years old and my peers think I&#x27;m 59.  I bought the Youth Code Serum Intense to try it up.  My eyes burned from using this product.  The chemical burn was intense.  I have had to use aloe cream on the under eye skin because it was chemicaly burned from this product.  Please don&#x27;t use this product unless you try it on your arm first.  Beware girlfriends.&lt;br /&gt;Marge K.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal essence muscle bottom liquid, a very high cost-effective cosmetic liquid, apply clear gloss, we recommend a beauty liquid. The next stage of purchase</li>
            <li> Excellent product! A must buy with both day and night cream. Lasts very long as just one drop is required for the face! Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It really works well. I can see a noticeable difference within a week of using it. I tried a less expensive version of a similar product and it did not have the same results.  I won&#x27;t change again.</li>
            <li> It smells good！I like it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fast to ship to my country. good!!!</li>
            <li> I saw this product and thought it would be great for helping with the small dark sun spots I&#x27;ve been starting to get. However, after only 2 days, my skin has broken out into thousands of little bumps!! It&#x27;s like all of my pores are clogged. I don&#x27;t use too many skin care products so I doubt it&#x27;s a bad reaction with something else I&#x27;ve been using. I generally don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, so I was surprised by this result. I think the bumps will go away in a couple days but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to use this any more! As anyone else had this problem?</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product at a local store.  I tried to use it, but due to a problem with the bottle, it did not dispense.  Since I had lost my receipt, I called the company with my problem.  They apologized, and offered me the equivalent of my purchase price, in 3 coupons.  Trouble is, only one coupon can be used at a time, and the largest of them was for $10.00.  Thus, if I want to replace the product which I paid $23.00 for, I will have to once again shell out another $13.00 of my own money!  In order to use all 3 coupons, I would have to buy a total of 3 of their products, adding cash to the coupon amount to purchase each one. This is NOT a happy solution for me, and L&#x27;Oreal is definitely off my list.</li>
            <li> Just one pump of this product is enough to do my entire face, and then another pump covers my neck and decollete area.  It sinks in quickly and leaves the area around my eyes immediately softer, smoother, and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for close to 2 weeks and I do see an overall improvement of fine lines and clarity.  I also started using a BB cream at the same time, so the two combined are really whipping my facial skin into shape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it just under my eyes and on my cheeks/neck/chest during the day, and at night I apply it all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and the comparisons to genefique by Lancome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve smeared it on several days in a row now, for over a week. It&#x27;s not bad. I just feel there is no THERE there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, no breakout, no---nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just has a cooling feel upon applying, but I can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, sometimes when I get a little irritation or notice SOMETHING, that means change (cellular turnover, improvements, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is just that I have enough good products that really seem to make a difference for me, and there is just no more room, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. And the youth code eye cream seemed even more useless.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this for that long.  Maybe only a month or so.  I do think my pores are shrinking a little, and that my skin feels a little bit softer.  I have not seen much results other than that.  I have a lot of uneven skin and also scarring from acne.  I also wish my lines on my forehead would go away (I&amp;#34;m only 28 by the way but I have some lines creeping in).</li>
            <li> Moisturize the skin once applied. Very Nice</li>
            <li> Nice, like it very much</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than in China.Good!</li>
            <li> This lasted a pretty long time, I use it during the daytime on dry areas, and was surprised how effective, but light it was!</li>
            <li> It was so-so, after it was gone I went back to my usual products &amp; got back my good results. Perhaps if you don&#x27;t start out with good skin, it may be good.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are so similar to Lancome&#x27;s Genifique that I don&#x27;t know how this managed to not work as well. I used both and there&#x27;s no doubt, that the Genifique at $78 per ounce performs where this does nothing much at all. Boo-hoo as I was really, really cheering for this one.&lt;br /&gt;At Lancome, you can shell more out of pocket for larger sizes, and get a significant discount per ounce. Even so, Genifique is still a head spinner price-wise.</li>
            <li> A bit irritated my skin. Slight. It can also. Did not feel particularly good.&lt;br /&gt;But my friend said with.&lt;br /&gt;。</li>
            <li> I found this to be a really great product. I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li> High alcohol content I think, drying, smells like my grandma. So much so that I gave it to my grandma hoping that she would have better luck with it.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully, twice per day after I washed my face.  I used 3 pumps of it - 2 pumps for whole face and neck, then 1 extra pump for my eyes, forehead, and around my mouth.  After 90 days, there was a significant difference in my skin.  My fine lines disappeared, and the two vertical lines between my eyebrows (i.e. \\&quot;elevens\\&quot;) are barely visible.  This product works as well as Lancome Genifique, which is, depending on where you get it, 5-7 times the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum absorbs well, isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne or clog pores, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch or become red/inflamed like so many products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I mixed in a half scoop of Philosophy Turbo Booster C powder in the a.m. to this serum, so the combination of these two products may be why my skin has improved so much.  But I&#x27;ve used the Philosophy product alone, and my skin didn&#x27;t improve in the way it has lately.  So, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the L&#x27;Oreal serum that gave my skin such dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> Good cheap price of good activities</li>
            <li> I like the serum feels when I applied to the face. It feels smooth. However, I found some times, after the serum I should put some moisturizer on, it has some mud feeling stuff appear on the face. It is appeared not on every type of moisturizer, the showing one is Clinique moisturizer (yep, I used different brand after this serum)</li>
            <li> I had bought this before to try out from retail store ($20).  I use it on my face and upper chest.  It seems to keep my skin soft and soften wrinkles.  I am a senior citizen and people are amazed at my face skin.  The normal question is did I have plastic surgery. I had tried other creams and they did not seem to help. Your online price is very good compared to retail store.  Yea!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is light and does not bother my sensitive nose. Price is fair for OTC product. I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and have yet to see any changes. I do like the fact it does not make my face to oily.</li>
            <li> High cost performance, but I use the allergy</li>
            <li> I got better results when I put the serious anti-aging cream directly on my skin without the Youth Code barrier between my skin and the cream.  It was better enough that I could tell the difference the following day.  Youth Code is ok but maybe for someone younger.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 66 and spent many hours in the sun.</li>
            <li> it is perfect. and my face look good after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal products for years.  This product is very similar to Lancome, however, in my assertion it is even nicer - the absorption is quick - and effective.  I am 48 - and have sensitive skin - and this product is for me - quick, simple, and non-irritating.  I read somewhere that the human eye is not able to see fine lines around the eyes - that what we are seeing is the shadow of a wrinkle.  Let&#x27;s put it this way - I am seeing fewer shadows.  This product is truly remarkable.  The entire line of Youth Code is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I need to mention that this seller is off the chain quick.  You no sooner order - and it is on its&#x27; way.  This is my second order from this seller - and I am hooked.</li>
            <li> This product seems to irrigate my pores, so present wrinkles are less noticeable and plumps up my skin.  Like it a lot!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure i will buy it again~~fantastic!</li>
            <li> Not as good as i thought</li>
            <li> Love this coz it makes my skin really young but unfortunately got lots of pimples too. This product is not good if you have an acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my skin so soft. I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to try it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the smooth feeling on your skin.  Can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference, but I love using this product.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle on this and didn&#x27;t notice any difference, it claims that pores wouldn&#x27;t look as obvious which it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. On the bright side I didn&#x27;t breakout or anything like that, there was just no difference neither good nor bad.</li>
            <li> I saw this recommended on Dr Oz a while back. I don&#x27;t remember what it is supposed to do but what I like about it is that it helps the moisturizer go on very smoothly after it so I end up using much less.</li>
            <li> Still experimenting with this product after a few weeks but don&#x27;t feel or notice any difference in skin texture or tone so far. One tries. And there are SO MANY products with SO MANY promises to try.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several weeks and find that I have gotten the same results from less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products been using for a year and my skinny looks amazing!!  I use the entire youth code line and my skin has changed for the better</li>
            <li> High end product, I feel the skin become soft after using, like face returned to 18 years old, is very good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months and haven&#x27;t seen any difference in wrinkles... then again, I started using it because I wanted to avoid deep wrinkles in the first place, so maybe I just can&#x27;t tell. Still, I would expect to see some diminishing in the fine lines I already have, and I haven&#x27;t. For the price, it&#x27;s not worth it... there are probably better serums out there.</li>
            <li> not sure it works. texture was good</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it but made my rosacea/little pimples appear, so had to stop using.</li>
            <li> Very good, buy lover ~!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fully absorb like I thought it should. I wash it off in the morning and it&#x27;s slimy feeling. Don&#x27;t like it. I used for a couple of weeks and notice only a very slight difference in skin.</li>
            <li> OK. For me seems to be too light. I have to wait for results.</li>
            <li> very good!this product is my favorite thing,i&#x27;ll buy it again! good good good !&lt;br /&gt;easy to carry&lt;br /&gt;Not tight after use</li>
            <li> This was an excellent experience. I thought I&#x27;d shop online when i was running low on this product to see if I could save a dollar or two. The price - even with shipping was less than the best price I could get in a store. The product was exactly as promised, and came DAYS before promised. Great experience!</li>
            <li> my wife love it very much! she love the corlour and it&#x27;s style ,feel very soft and i will be back again!</li>
            <li> this left my face luminous, smooth, &amp; a natural youthful glow.  The whole youthcode line is fabulous, &amp; I will continue to use them faithfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a little over 2 months and I really love it! It makes my skin so smooth and I feel like it has helped even out my skin tone and gives me a pretty \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. I love how it&#x27;s so lightweight so my face feels bare, and the scent is pleasant and mild. I&#x27;m in my early 20s and don&#x27;t really have wrinkles or age spots to treat yet, so I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkle fighting claims, but I do love it so much I plan on buying it again and continuing to use it. My favorite part is that my skin tone has completely changed, so I feel comfortable leaving the house without makeup for the first time in a long time! Another great side effect: The first few times I put it on, my husband couldn&#x27;t stop kissing my face :). He loves the way it smells and how it makes my face feel so soft and smooth.  I would say this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. it keeps the skin soft for a reallly long time. I have used other products but had never seen such a lasting effect.     the only concern is that the tube is quite small.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this serum. It&#x27;s a decent product, but I don&#x27;t think it has done a ton to improve my skin. That being said, I&#x27;m a fairly youthful 41-year old who has stayed out of the sun, never smoked, etc. I like it because it&#x27;s pretty affordable, and I like the idea of using a light serum before my thicker (La Mer) moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very good, very good.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because of a lot of amazing reviews for it here. Personally I was using it for past acne redness, because the Dark Spot Corrector Version didn&#x27;t have as many rave reviews. I just finished the bottle, so I figured at this point I could write a review for it. For myself it wasn&#x27;t as great as I was hoping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was really liking it. It made my skin feel smooth and silky, It made it kinda glow, and I was using it twice a day religiously. I never saw any results in my skin texture, redness, or anything else that would give me a reason to repurchase however. I was disappointed, but for some reason considered re-buying it until I saw a review on Youtube that shed more light on it: Alcohol is a no no for the skin, as well as perfume. So why include them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead I picked up a Neutragena Rapid Skin Repair and found the results to be ten times more satisfying!</li>
            <li> my skin had been looking exhausted, probably because I have been and this did the trick- I suddenly look so much better and it&#x27;s so soft...love using it!</li>
            <li> I love this. I am 28 yrs old &amp; have the beginning of the thin creased lines on each side of my mouth- the \\&quot;parenthesis\\&quot; creases. After using this &amp; the moisturizers that go along with the youth code line, they almost vanished! I have only been using these products for a month now &amp; I love them! I did use one moisturizer frm this company &amp; it was too heavy for my skin &amp; broke me out. This youth code line works great tho!!</li>
            <li> This is really the alternatives to Lancome Genefique. It works just like genefique, and i noticed immediate effect after application. In just 3 days, I have noticed smoothness over my face and it made my skin looks brighter and more luminous . I look forward to what else this can do.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this product works. I stopped using it for about a month and my face went back to looking tired and my skin showed signs of sagging. I am 34 and have started seeing a lot of changes in my skin over the last two years. With Youth Code it seems to reverse some of that and most people still say I pass for 25. Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchased this item. It works well with my skin and the price is very attractive too. I am very happy to find this product from Amazon! Great deal!</li>
            <li> This is the only skin care product that left bumps on my face which are still there months later. I only applied it couple times on on one side of my face and it brought a line of bumps along that side of the hair line. I don&#x27;t know if they will ever go away. I have used many skin care products, some I am allergic to, but the symptoms always go away except for this one. I should have returned it.</li>
            <li> Been using for over a year. Loreal please keep making it just like this, my skin loves it and is a great duo/trio with the BB Cream Illuminator and under eye cream. Keeps me looking young!!! This all I use. Most don&#x27;t believe I am 50 until they see my kids.....</li>
            <li> I was looking for some face serum, and I&#x27;m on a pretty tight budget at the time. I love Clinique&#x27;s clinical dark-spot corrector, but again, I&#x27;m trying to be very frugal at the moment. I thought this would be a decent drugstore substitute, based on some other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed any big improvements from this, other than it helps to keep my skin soft. I&#x27;m not noticing any changes with my complexion or the fine lines that I&#x27;m starting to develop. I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product left my Skin feeling smooth and silky</li>
            <li> The second time in the amazon to buy this, use the effect is very good, and the price is cheap</li>
            <li> Deluxe serum.  Try it.  You will like it.</li>
            <li> i did not like this product as much as i like the loreal youth code spot correcting serum.</li>
            <li> I got this product hoping that it would work as well as all the reviews said it would unfortunately my skin did not agree too well with it. I have acne pron skin that is dry and this did not help with either. After the first couple of days I started breaking out and this is the only change I made to my skin routine. It did leave my skin feeling incredibly soft and it smells nice but I just couldn&#x27;t handle the pimples that came along. I will use occasionally at night to help fight wrinkles and to enjoy the softness I just can&#x27;t use daily.</li>
            <li> Absorption is very rapid, moist degree is also very good, I feel very good.</li>
            <li> No manual products, feeling bad, ask to return money.</li>
            <li> My first time using this fresh glow L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Regenarating Skincare and definetly it works perfect into my skin.It restore now the freshness glow of my face.It revive to boost to make my face alive.It helps also to prevent the rapid lines due to my face is dry.It&#x27;s smells so good and it&#x27;s gentle to my face.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this new booster and now I build again my confident.&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE:I got this product for testing in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Dries my skin out. Save your money so you can buy the Lancome: Genifique YAFES(Youth Activating Face and EyeSerum - a far better choice)!&lt;br /&gt;Same parent company!!??</li>
            <li> Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used at least 3-4 bottles of this product. I like the feeling when you apply to your face, it absorbs so quick.</li>
            <li> I must say the entire \\&quot;advertising\\&quot; got me into the product, and honestly I am very happy I did try it!! I have seen incredible---INCREDIBLE results!! It also helps clear up pimples, at age 30 one would figure I didn&#x27;t break out as much as I do, anyway, I&#x27;d definately would recommend this product!! I give it four stars because, though, i&#x27;ve seen results the \\&quot;main\\&quot; wrinkle i have along my forehead, has made but a slight change, I guess it&#x27;s a deep wrinkle :/&lt;br /&gt;And the bottle has lasted me a VERY long time, i&#x27;m just now running out (Aug) and I bought it back in March! good deal!</li>
            <li> Love this serum! I have been looking for a perfect daily serum and finally found one that works for my skin! I wear it daily and have seen amazing results in clearing some fine lines and light spots. I wear it under makeup and on clean face before bed for best results. Not oily and drys nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested every cream, lotion, serum, hybrids etc etc. You name it....I have tried it. La Mer, EMK Placental, and other high end products are my regular routine type products and I didn&#x27;t think this 15 dollar serum would make the cut but it does. I tried it when I got a coupon and have vowed to never stop using it. It does make my skin glow more, not majorly but if I stop using it, within a few days my skin &amp;#34;dulls.&amp;#34; Its hard to explain to people but my skin just lacks a bit of luster that I do notice and so did my mom. It is for this reason that I wont ever stop using this product. It does give my skin bit of a oomph. Its no miracle worker like some other products from the EMK Placental line I use but once you stop using this, and see nothing but dull skin staring back at you in the mirror, trust me, you&#x27;ll keep using it like me.</li>
            <li> While youth code cream is not bad, this serum is very light and fairly effective. I&#x27;ve been using both for almost two months and I am definitely seeing tighter and more luminous skin. I still use the loreal wrinkle decrease pen on my fore-head. This is NOT as effective as de-crease serum but since Loreal happily discontinues all their most effective products each yaer,  I&#x27;m using what I can afford. When I have the spare cash I&#x27;ll by Lancome resolution and genefique serum.</li>
            <li> I am truly happy with the serum. It smells good, and feels delicate. It&#x27;s also very concentrated that a single drop contains enough moisture for me to apply all over my face and my neck (true, I don&#x27;t have a big face but still)  By the way, I was even more impressed by the speedy delivery, I ordered with the standard shipping and received the product within the same week.</li>
            <li> I was scheduled to spend about $1000 on collagen injections at my dermatologists this past week.  I cancelled my appointment.  I had bought this serum several weeks ago and have been very impressed with the look of my smile lines which were the most bothersome to me in recent times.  I&#x27;m encouraged to buy the other creams.  My only negative I&#x27;ve noticed is that I seem to be breaking out more and wonder if this is a trade-off for being youthful looking?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, together with the remainder of its twin product under the Lancôme label and an Oil of Olay serum. I don&#x27;t know which of the two products, this or Oil of Olay, has definitely improved (almost completely eliminating) the beginning of jowls, but one or both are doing the trick very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what really amazes me about this particular product is that it is definitely plumping my lips, not Olay. And it&#x27;s not the superficial lip plumpers on the market. I bring this up because I read one of the reviews that brought up this benefit. With age, my lips have thinned considerably, especially my upper lip, which was basically a thin, almost straight line. Not anymore. With continued use of this product, my upper and lower lips are very noticeably fuller. I was skeptical about the review I read, but not any longer. For me, at least, this product is worth it for 24/7 plump lips! And could be-- probably is-- firming my jawline. Money well spent! Give it 4-6 weeks. Hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face extremely moisturized so if you&#x27;re on the oiler side I would probably recommend against it. However, if you have dryer skin then this will certainly do the job. Just remember to follow up with a moisturizer afterwards for maximum results.</li>
            <li> Very light, smells nice.</li>
            <li> Goes on so smoothly under my make-up that you can barely tell you have it on and it protects my skin from irritation from cosmetics, as i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like the light silky feel and no perfumes. Glides on smoothly. I&#x27;ve only used it for about 2 weeks now and so far do not see any noticeable difference in my skin but do like the light feeling and not feeling like it&#x27;s plugging up the pores on my face.  Make up goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to absorb.</li>
            <li> Good price. But the smell is a little bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I really liked Lancome Genifique, so I thought I&#x27;d try this L&#x27;Oreal product which is supposed to be their version at half the price. I had really high hopes for this product. Comparatively, I found Genifique to be much richer to the point where it is almost moisturizing, whereas Youth Code is quickly absorbed and disappears on my skin totally. I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks now and my face is a mess. I have bright red, itchy, zit like bumps all over my face that are starting to come to a head. I have never had a reaction to any skin care product like this and I&#x27;m very disappointed. I will probably just pay for the Lancome products that I know work from now on instead of wasting money on unknown products.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I decided to try the Youth Code line of the L&#x27;Oreal products. The Youth Code Serum seems to be soaked into your skin to make it soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> I use this product with Loreal Revitalift and it works well for the damage to my face from my accident and helps with the aging process.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really explain exactly what I like about this.  I&#x27;ve used it for years in conjunction with Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair.  I can&#x27;t use it as a stand-alone product, but I definitely notice the difference if I don&#x27;t have it.  Not the most helpful review, but this does great things for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> bought this after getting one of these expensive test facials at a department stores, didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on a serum,&lt;br /&gt;now I&#x27;ve been using this for years, feels great, my skin is better than 10 years ago,...</li>
            <li> Seems to be very effective, just as the other reviews I had read. It absorbs almost instantly and seems to be a water based product. When you put it on, there is no slippery, oily feeling. It&#x27;s as if you just applied it and it immediately absorbs into your skin, so I always put my moisturizer on over this. It dries fast and leaves no residue behind. Smells nice and is very effective for wrinkles and texzture of skin has also improved. Been using it about a month now and I can honesly say, that I do see some difference, but I also use other products. This is so easy to use and apply, that I would definitely recommend and reorder this item.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin. I&#x27;m sorry I spent so much money on this.</li>
            <li> I got this product because it was on sale and the packaging seemed pretty enticing.&lt;br /&gt;Well, that&#x27;s where it all ends for me. I was pretty disappointed with the product. My face got bumpy after I started using it and I just didn&#x27;t see any wrinkle repair. When I discontinued using it the bumps on my face went away so I&#x27;m pretty sure it was a reaction to the product.</li>
            <li> I find that this stuff really works, I am on my third bottle of it, It actually has the same ingredients as the Lancome genifique.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have never posted a review of a skincare product before (though at 33, I have used several). I have been a little lax in my regimen lately and I finally have admitted that now that I am in my 30s, I can&#x27;t treat my skin the same way that I did in my teens and twenties. This stuff is genius. After a week, my husband (who probably wouldn&#x27;t notice if I changed the color of my hair) actually made a comment that my skin looked healthier. My skin texture is softer, there is a more even skin tone, and I definitely see a more youthful look. I&#x27;m sold. I might as well just buy my next bottle now. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I can&#x27;t wait to see how things progress. I went ahead and bought the eye cream too and I am just as happy with that product. If you are on the fence, go ahead a get it. There is a slight tingle when I first put it on, but otherwise, no irritation.</li>
            <li> I dont see any change</li>
            <li> I am mid-forties with very sensitive skin, so I have to pick carefully what I put on it. I have attempted to use Genifique repeatedly and it breaks me out every time. Recently I tried a brand called &#x27;&#x27;Nude&#x27;&#x27; (also made in France) which worked okay, didnt break me out, and i liked knowing there wasnt parabens and stuff in it but is just too expensive. Reading claims and reviews, i decided to try a bottle of L&#x27;Oreals Youth Code. I was very pleasantly surprised that the first three ingredients on L&#x27;Oreals Youth Code is identical to the first three on &#x27;&#x27;Nudes&amp;#34; serum. And so far no breakouts using it morning and night... and does it work!! I am a believer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> It definitely adds glow/softness to your face- I don&#x27;t see any real improvement of lines/wrinkles, but that is not really the purpose of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is refreshing it is not Lancôme Genifique, leaving more skin glow &amp; softness.&lt;br /&gt;Genifique is soooo expensive, this is a really good alternative &amp; I have been happy with the freshness in the morning.</li>
            <li> I see the change right away, but after you discontinued, appear again, I can said is just during you use it</li>
            <li> I am not seeing any result on this product and it doesn&#x27;t get absorbed too well on my dry skin and if I put too much on, it gets flaky and just sits on the surface of my skin.  I would not buy those drug store brand anymore. I thought I will save money on my cosmetic but oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll go back to department store brand.</li>
            <li> love it and 10 dollars cheaper than walgreens and Walmart</li>
            <li> I discovered L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Serum Intense Daily Treatment through Allure&#x27;s list of award winning products.  I hadn&#x27;t expected Youth Code to feel so smooth but I immediately felt that it moisturized and gave my skin radiance.  I&#x27;ve become a big fan - it&#x27;s one of those products that gives you department store quality for drugstore prices.</li>
            <li> I am not totally certain that this eliminates any wrinkles but it does give your skin a great base for your makeup!</li>
            <li> This product I have purchased many times in the Amazon, it is very suitable for my skin。I would recommend this product to my family and close friends.</li>
            <li> very good product - feels soft and smells good</li>
            <li> A sweet gift for my wife:)</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be similar to lancome visionairee and it is not. My skin showed no improvements and my blemishes did not fade... Therefore I decided to go back to using visionarre because this products gives me results that will not take months..</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me after I stopped using a serum made by Mary Kay(I stopped because I didnt want to deal with anymore MK sales people).  But this product literally did nothing for my skin.  I saw no change in the months I have been using it.  I bought an oil of olay serum instead and it works so much better</li>
            <li> After using this product makes me feel the skin becomes smooth, and I like this feeling. Second purchase a little problem, Amazon has been resolved. Awesome Seller, thank you very much. I think I will buy again, I hope there will be some discounts in the future.</li>
            <li> If the sole purpose of you buying L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s &amp;#34;Youth Code&amp;#34; is to remove dark spots from your face, RUN. I&#x27;m an African-American male and about ten years ago, I slightly burned parts of my face, leaving me with subtle dark spots that were very much noticeable from afar. I purchased the bottle with the idea that I would be taken care of, in a safe manner but that wasn&#x27;t the case with this. I completely finished the bottle only to find my face the way it was prior to my purchase. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use，Delicate texture</li>
            <li> The product is very good, next time also to buy, thank you very much for amazon.</li>
            <li> Just love it and am ordering a 3rd bottle. It works best with my Philosophy Vitamin C booster powder. Sticky, thick but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Light and smells great. Will be a daily part of facial upkeep</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes my makeup go on smoother.</li>
            <li> This stuff was so amazing that I bought the day lotion as well. Friends are telling me that I look younger, when I wake up I look fresh and my wrinkles get smoother every day.  I am shocked that I did not need to spend $$$$$ for such an amazing product. Another L&#x27;oreal product that I love!</li>
            <li> It does not feel as tight as the other products I have used. Im not sure if it works in a different way but I see no improvements. I would rather pay a little more for something useful</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my sister who loves it. I usually apply it right after washing my face and briefly towel drying. I used it for a couple weeks and didn&#x27;t see a difference, but then tried it at a different time of day when my skin wasn&#x27;t wet and could see a noticeable difference in my laugh lines. I prefer to do my skin treatment right after cleansing though, so I&#x27;m going back to my serum from Wexler.</li>
            <li> This little bottle really IS as good as Lancome&#x27;s Genifique and at a small fraction of the cost.  I purchased both products to compare. Can you guess which one I&#x27;ll be buying again in the future?</li>
            <li> I love skincare, have great skin and have tried many products. This is now one of my favorites. No matter what else I put on my skin, this is my step one AM &amp; PM. One pump glides all over my face easily. I originally ordered this after comparing it to Lancome&#x27;s Genefique which is a great product &amp; pricey at about $84/oz. Lancome is part of Loreal, &amp; I suspected Youth Code was the mass market version of Genefique. The ingredient deck is similar, and I actually thought the Youth Code has a couple extra key ingredients. I&#x27;ve used it for a year and a half, and my skin has this soft focus effect &amp; a glow. I&#x27;ve often said you find out how effective a product is when you run out. I used the last of my Youth Code serum before xmas, and didn&#x27;t buy a new bottle until 10 days ago. What a difference! My skin just wasn&#x27;t as even and didn&#x27;t have the glow when I wasn&#x27;t using the Youth Code serum. I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends and family after being asked what skin care do I use. My Mom was using Genefique, and is now trying Youth Code. Please bring back the subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> The parcel faster than expected. It smells good. Great!</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris youth code skincare serum is not only for the young and youthful looking women but also for those of us who are getting older. I am a young 78 and have been using this product for several months now and those wrinkles around my mouth have disappeared and I have no crows feet at the eyes, I even use it on my neck. Love this product</li>
            <li> I love this product very much. It really works on the crow feet area. My skin is not dry now, its used to looked like a dried piece of foundation cake. I been using this product for three years now. Not a single line. I am fifty three now.</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy,I like it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this product for smooth young-looking skin.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks like they used the cheapest perfume available. And it made my skin break out worse than it ever has in my life! I love Lancome skin serums &amp; everyone knows Loreal is just cheap Lancome but this junk is just awful. Shame on you Loreal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my mother&#x27;s gift,so i don&#x27;t see them by myself,i think it fits well for her</li>
            <li> obvious effect, and cheaper than lancome。i will use it for long time, i think i will buy the bigger one.</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results, but want to know will it actually fade the old acne scars and age spots.  So far I&#x27;ve had no irritation like with other products that have helped with the fine lines and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will follow up in 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I&#x27;m 44.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.  I have been using this product for some time now.</li>
            <li> I do not understand why there are so many rave reviews on here. I have gone through two bottles. Followed directions completely. I have tried to get rid of a dark spot on my nose. Did nothing. My face flaked and turned red. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after 24 hours in the lines around my eyes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the texture perfector but decided I wanted a little more anti aging. I&#x27;ve just passed 30 and have been doing chemo for 5 years so my skin is aged a little past my actual years.  I have some pigmintation issues and fine lines/dehydration creping to contend with along with loss of elasticity. I also have very combo skin with an oily t-zone. I did not like the way this made my skin feel. I felt like it didn&#x27;t really sink in but kind of formed small pills on my skin. It also felt very sticky and I didn&#x27;t since any extra hydration that I was expecting. I generally love L&#x27;Oreal products but this did not work for my skin type and concerns. I have since gone back to using the texture perfector that I love very much.</li>
            <li> feels like silk, goes on great, transparent yet covers - great stuff - it is a serum, feels like a moisturizer,  - great product</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist told me not to use Youth Code because it has alcohol in it, and he says it is bad for my face.  He diagnosed me with Rosacea which I never knew I had before I ordered the Youth Code Intense daily serum.  I just wasted my money.  Not Loreal&#x27;s fault at all.</li>
            <li> awesome product that lasts because you need to use very little.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me. My wrinkles have increased &amp; seem worse now. I have gone back to Lancome Genefique.</li>
            <li> Will not buy again...at least for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have great skin to begin with, but have gotten a few brown spots over the years and wanted to try this out to see if I notice anything different.  No noticeable change after a month.  I am assuming with all the great reviews, it just must be me...</li>
            <li> This Youth Code has a lovely scent, not strong but just enough when applying.  It seems to tighten the skin and l use it a couple of times a week.  Will have to use it for a few months to give a fairer assessment of the results.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these for a friend. She uses the product on a regular basis and has good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> I order 2 of this items. The packag was good, but when I start using it I found out one of the bottle was empty. I paid for two but only  one usable, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not impressed by this product, would not buy it again. I will buy a never-before used product from CVS, the return policy is much better, I could have returned it If I had purchased from CVS.</li>
            <li> Not too happy with the price, right after I purchased it, the price went down</li>
            <li> Well, as others have mentioned it does not take much product to cover your whole face, which is sort of nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, after using it nightly for a few weeks I can&#x27;t tell that it really does anything.&lt;br /&gt;I even looked it up on here again to verify what it was supposed to be doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 35 with just a couple of wrinkles, but my skin is normally dry, somewhat flaky, deep pores, etc.&lt;br /&gt;There is certainly plenty of room for improvement... however, I have not noticed ANY difference with this product.  Will not reorder.</li>
            <li> Many people seem to believe that because L&#x27;oreal and Lancome are under the same parent company, they believe that the Youth Code line is the same as the Genifique line. This is not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Lancome Genifique Youth Activator for a year. I do not normally spend obscene amounts of money on skin care products. I had actually received the Lancome Genifique bottle as a gift. As I am running out of the Genifique Youth Activator, I was looking to buy a new one, but for $100, I found the price hard to justify. So I read online and found that many people believe that the Youth Code (this product) is \\&quot;THE SAME THING, IF NOT BETTER\\&quot;. This is NOT to be taken seriously. Their reasoning is that because it shares the same parent company and uses all of the same ingredients except for TWO additional ingredients in the Lancome item, they must be the same. This is not true. My guess is they probably change the proportion of how much of each ingredient goes into the different products. And because the Lancome is the more expensive one, they probably put MORE of the expensive good healthy ingredients that will help our skin. You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Youth Code serum doesn&#x27;t seem to do much, it does not give me the rich texture, healthy, firm and hydrated skin I would like. It also has an awful cheap smell to it (which goes away after awhile). I think for a $20 serum (which I paid for at the local Walmart in Southern California), it is NOT a good deal. For a tiny bit more money you can get a really good serum from The Body Shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am disappointed, but it was worth a try for me I guess. But I have decided, it will be painful, but Genifique Youth Activator is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love what the serum does to your skin. It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> it is very good!!!!!!!!  Have been using</li>
