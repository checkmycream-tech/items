            <li>I cannot honestly say that wrinkles have disappeared, but I hope that will come with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product family was recommended to me by a skin specialty clinic, and unlike most drug store and cosmetic counter brands, it seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li>Beware though, it&#x27;s very strong.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>And  Amazon has the best price.it was ten dollars more at my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>this is a potent product.  </li>
            <li>I started out with the 0.5 to make sure that my skin wouldn&#x27;t become overly irritated.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great and soooo much cheaper than buying it at the dermatologist&#x27;s office</li>
            <li>I love skin medica products</li>
            <li>I was paying more than $100 for this product in my Dermatologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>love it...have been using it for years</li>
            <li>This product really works great.....</li>
            <li>make sure you start off with the .25 and work your way up to the stronger formulas.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a more even skin tone, wrinkle prevention and also helped with acne.  </li>
            <li>Works great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>For the time being, my 35 year old fair skin, has needed this boost!</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than expected- feels great on my skin and see a difference already!</li>
            <li>Dont buy anywhere but here its the best price and all other places charge A LOT.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any fine line improvement yet though.</li>
            <li>it is fabulous...</li>
            <li>working.i use it only at night and apply a good sun-screen moisturizer for the day.&lt;br /&gt;So many products show now results-</li>
            <li>so I gave it a 4, but so far I am pleased with the price and results!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as my night regimen, I had/have tried a lot of products and this one works best for me, I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 3/28/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love this product as much as I did a year ago.</li>
            <li>I think this is a very good product, at first I had some peeling because I was using too much, but by around the end of the second week the redness tapered off, and the peeling stopped.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, not too much peel, I was still mixing with .25 strength to allow my skin to adjust.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin adapted to this quite easily</li>
            <li>I might start out with the smaller strength and build up to this strength just to make sure it is right for your skin.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who has not tried this product, start with the 0.25 level first</li>
            <li>Exactly what I purchased at office of dermatologist.</li>
            <li>This is the first Retinol I&#x27;ve ever use</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted and needed for my skin at this time.</li>
            <li>so I went back to my Retinol prescription paying more for the product, however I can see the difference.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff and not too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>I usually but it from the spa, but this was a better price and easy to order.</li>
            <li>and lush&#x27;s full of grace every morning and night.</li>
            <li>I feel as if I could comfortable move to the stronger strength next time.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying through my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t really see a difference...</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a couple weeks and am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>and I did not feel any of the tingling nor did I have to get used to the product as was mentioned in many of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>I went from the .25 formula to the .5 and found my skin was quite sensitive to the higher formula.  </li>
            <li>More than $100 less than what I paid at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>This came as a highly recommended retinol product from another site that does reviews of beauty products and their ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I do not have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Just starting to use it has a nice consistency and not strong smelling.</li>
            <li>After a couple years on this, you then upgrade to the next higher dose of 1.0.</li>
            <li>be aware of the effects so you use it properly.  </li>
            <li>product was what expected and it shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, that was a highly concentrated amount of product, more than you would ever put on your face at one time or even in a few weeks, so it&#x27;s not going to dye your skin yellow.</li>
            <li>this cream worked within a few weeks to diminish fine lines , and even forehead &amp;#34;frown&amp;#34;lines.&lt;br /&gt;I started with the .25 and worked up to this .5.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive.</li>
            <li>Much easier on my skin than the regular retinol.</li>
            <li>Used as replacement on 200 year old oil lamp, looks like it came with the lamp.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I went with SkinMedica is the specific information about how much retinol is in the product and the fact that you can step up.</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>I am almost 50 and everyone thinks I am in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>So far nothing</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, pores are a little less noticeable, and skin looks much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I had to go out, so I didn&#x27;t clean up for a few hours.</li>
            <li>I paid double for the exact same bottle at the medspa  </li>
            <li>Now, I realize that genetics play a big role for me here as I have always looked younger than I really am, but I am convinced this product helps things along.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have highly sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve used it daily without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the same product I get from my aesthetic professional for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I have been surprised at how deeply the damage was.</li>
            <li>The thick, opaque glass bottle is important in preserving the retinol so that it doesn&#x27;t breakdown from sunlight exposure.</li>
            <li>Because it has less strength, it was naturally milder on my skin and not harsh.  </li>
            <li>This comes in a thick glass bottle, which I know because I dropped the first bottle before I even used it (yikes!).</li>
            <li>and I can actually say that my skin has improved...not tons, but enough to really make me appear a little younger.  </li>

            <li> The first time I purchased was from a skin specialist, the second Retinol Complex was from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The toilet lid and vinyl flooring are stained yellow, which speaks to the dyes.</li>
            <li> I initially ordered the 1.0 which really left me red and peeling, despite the fact I  wasn&#x27;t using it daily or even every other day</li>
            <li> I dropped the bottle on the toilet tank cover, breaking the bottle and wound up with product all over my toilet seat lid and vinyl flooring.</li>
            <li> (Yes, it took me that long to recover and deal with it.)</li>
            <li> Had to cut back from every other night to once a week with the .5.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a part of a beauty routine of several products, so nailing down whether this product works in and of itself  </li>
            <li> (Yes, I know they advise you up to start with the lowest strength and work up, but why let a little thing like good advice from manufacture influence your use of a product; or as my father used to say, if all else fails read the directions!!)  </li>
            <li> Same Retinol Complex, nothing different</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist and as can be expected, I got it cheaper than if I purchased it in his office.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of time in the sun and have a lot of sun damage and age spots.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used it as I am finishing up the .25 Retinal Complex.</li>
            <li> Just as expected!!  </li>
            <li> There is a bit of redness and slight irritation, but to me that means it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> When it comes out of the pump, it is almost white, but it is yellow if you unfortunately get a glimpse inside the bottle.tunately get a glimpse inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was a concern was that when I pumped the bottle a small amount of the product would come up around the neck of the bottle as well as out of the small dispenser.</li>
            <li> i have used other retinoid in the past, from the Dr.....</li>
            <li> I still experience a little dryness from the retinol...</li>
            <li> As explained by my dermatologist, when it burns a little and your skin begins to peel, it is doing its job!</li>
            <li> not sure if I will even try to do that.  </li>
            <li> Start slowly and build up.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of patience to use a product like this because it slowly removes the damage one layer of skin at a time.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this would work to help my complexion and aging issues.  </li>
            <li> Having just broken an expensive, never used bottle of face product, I had to walk away and recover.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and none of these products react bad to my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well.  I recommend buying this retinol.</li>
            <li> i have used other retinoid in the past, from the Dr..... this one is great.  I can see a real difference in just a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The first time I purchased was from a skin specialist, the second Retinol Complex was from Amazon.  Same Retinol Complex, nothing different and I can see visible results since I started using the product.</li>
            <li> I like it &amp; will order it again</li>
            <li> I might start out with the smaller strength and build up to this strength just to make sure it is right for your skin.  It caused some peeling on me and I do not have very sensitive skin.  Start slowly and build up.</li>
            <li> On time delivery. perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I paid double for the exact same bottle at the medspa  I go to.</li>
            <li> this cream worked within a few weeks to diminish fine lines , and even forehead &amp;#34;frown&amp;#34;lines.&lt;br /&gt;I started with the .25 and worked up to this .5. There is a bit of redness and slight irritation, but to me that means it&#x27;s working.i use it only at night and apply a good sun-screen moisturizer for the day.&lt;br /&gt;So many products show now results-while this is somewhat costly I can see a noticeable improvement. And  Amazon has the best price.it was ten dollars more at my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Just starting to use it has a nice consistency and not strong smelling.</li>
            <li> The only products I use!</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good product, at first I had some peeling because I was using too much, but by around the end of the second week the redness tapered off, and the peeling stopped.  I feel as if I could comfortable move to the stronger strength next time.</li>
            <li> Just as expected!!  Thx</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  I have not seen any drastic improvements and I did not feel any of the tingling nor did I have to get used to the product as was mentioned in many of the other reviews.  I wanted to try it because it was recommended by my dermatologist.  Maybe I need to go up on the potency - not sure if I will even try to do that.  I may move on in my search for something great for my skin care regimen.  I am giving 3 stars because it may be that it works for others but not me.</li>
            <li> Great price. More than $100 less than what I paid at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great. I received it on time. I usually but it from the spa, but this was a better price and easy to order.</li>
            <li> As explained by my dermatologist, when it burns a little and your skin begins to peel, it is doing its job! After a couple years on this, you then upgrade to the next higher dose of 1.0. For the time being, my 35 year old fair skin, has needed this boost! Wrinkles and lines are dimishing, and blemishes and bumps are coming to the outer layer of skin finally.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and appears to be as advertised. I haven&#x27;t actually used it as I am finishing up the .25 Retinal Complex. I initially ordered the 1.0 which really left me red and peeling, despite the fact I  wasn&#x27;t using it daily or even every other day (Yes, I know they advise you up to start with the lowest strength and work up, but why let a little thing like good advice from manufacture influence your use of a product; or as my father used to say, if all else fails read the directions!!)  Anyway, I will soon be starting this and will provide additional feedback later.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied. No results.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying through my dermatologist.  I will purchase this online again.  For anyone who has not tried this product, start with the 0.25 level first so your skin gets used to it before you jump up to 0.5.</li>
            <li> this is a potent product.  be aware of the effects so you use it properly.  great product</li>
            <li> Great medical grade product at an excellent price</li>
            <li> So far so good, not too much peel, I was still mixing with .25 strength to allow my skin to adjust. I am sensitive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - gives amazing results</li>
            <li> Great delivery system.  Much easier on my skin than the regular retinol.</li>
            <li> Used as replacement on 200 year old oil lamp, looks like it came with the lamp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week or so, and it can take up to 12 weeks for an over the counter retinol product to show any changes. This came as a highly recommended retinol product from another site that does reviews of beauty products and their ingredients. I use this as a part of a beauty routine of several products, so nailing down whether this product works in and of itself  will be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage...One of the reasons I went with SkinMedica is the specific information about how much retinol is in the product and the fact that you can step up. I started out with the 0.5 to make sure that my skin wouldn&#x27;t become overly irritated. I switch off daily applying this over my nighttime moisturizer one night, and under the next. I don&#x27;t have highly sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve used it daily without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the packaging and pump...This comes in a thick glass bottle, which I know because I dropped the first bottle before I even used it (yikes!). The thick, opaque glass bottle is important in preserving the retinol so that it doesn&#x27;t breakdown from sunlight exposure. The pump releases product easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerns about dyes...This is the reason for the 4 stars. If you are concerned about dyes in your products, you might want to reconsider SkinMedica. I dropped the bottle on the toilet tank cover, breaking the bottle and wound up with product all over my toilet seat lid and vinyl flooring. Having just broken an expensive, never used bottle of face product, I had to walk away and recover. I had to go out, so I didn&#x27;t clean up for a few hours. (Yes, it took me that long to recover and deal with it.) The toilet lid and vinyl flooring are stained yellow, which speaks to the dyes. However, that was a highly concentrated amount of product, more than you would ever put on your face at one time or even in a few weeks, so it&#x27;s not going to dye your skin yellow. When it comes out of the pump, it is almost white, but it is yellow if you unfortunately get a glimpse inside the bottle.tunately get a glimpse inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I purchased at office of dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected- feels great on my skin and see a difference already!</li>
            <li> this stuff is great and soooo much cheaper than buying it at the dermatologist&#x27;s office</li>
            <li> I love skin medica products but I have sensitive skin and this retinol product takes some getting used too (especially the peeling)</li>
            <li> This is the same product I get from my aesthetic professional for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great! My local spa has it for double the price. Dont buy anywhere but here its the best price and all other places charge A LOT. happy</li>
            <li> Great product that I keep using ober and over.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent produce.  Beware though, it&#x27;s very strong.  You&#x27;re going to peel.</li>
            <li> I was paying more than $100 for this product in my Dermatologist&#x27;s office.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I went from the .25 formula to the .5 and found my skin was quite sensitive to the higher formula.  Had to cut back from every other night to once a week with the .5.  Still like the results.</li>
            <li> It has improved my skin texture greatly.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff and not too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> product was what expected and it shipped quickly.  All good!</li>
            <li> ordered for my wife...just as beautiful as ever...what else can I say</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this would work to help my complexion and aging issues.  It was recommended by my dermatologist and as can be expected, I got it cheaper than if I purchased it in his office.  I have been using it for 12 weeks now and I can actually say that my skin has improved...not tons, but enough to really make me appear a little younger.  My skin tone is more even, pores are a little less noticeable, and skin looks much smoother.  I cannot honestly say that wrinkles have disappeared, but I hope that will come with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/28/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love this product as much as I did a year ago. I am almost 50 and everyone thinks I am in my early 30&#x27;s. Now, I realize that genetics play a big role for me here as I have always looked younger than I really am, but I am convinced this product helps things along. I use .5 strength in the winter, 1. Strength in the summer, sunscreen every day (one containing zinc oxide like solbar) and lush&#x27;s full of grace every morning and night. I have combination skin and none of these products react bad to my skin. I still experience a little dryness from the retinol...I just combat that with a sea salt scrub twice a week.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin adapted to this quite easily and I use it based on my esthetician&#x27;s recommendations.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Retinol Product from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon and am very pleased with it. I have spent a lot of time in the sun and have a lot of sun damage and age spots. It takes a lot of patience to use a product like this because it slowly removes the damage one layer of skin at a time.The only thing that was a concern was that when I pumped the bottle a small amount of the product would come up around the neck of the bottle as well as out of the small dispenser. I have been surprised at how deeply the damage was. The moral of this story is don&#x27;t go out without sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after second use!</li>
            <li> love it...have been using it for years</li>
            <li> This product really works great.....</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell. So far nothing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years...it is fabulous...make sure you start off with the .25 and work your way up to the stronger formulas.  I noticed a more even skin tone, wrinkle prevention and also helped with acne.  I will continue to use it as my night regimen, I had/have tried a lot of products and this one works best for me, I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working to refine my skin.  It is not as drying as some generic retinols I have used.  Too soon to tell about the deeper wrinkles so I gave it a 4, but so far I am pleased with the price and results!</li>
            <li> I have been using for 1 week. I can see a bit different on my skin. This is the first Retinol I&#x27;ve ever use and I think I will stick with it for a while. Works great and fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It arrived in excellent condition and on time.  Because it has less strength, it was naturally milder on my skin and not harsh.  This is exactly what I wanted and needed for my skin at this time.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  It&#x27;s a great product for a fair price.  I will absolutly purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I switched from the 2.5%.  This product family was recommended to me by a skin specialty clinic, and unlike most drug store and cosmetic counter brands, it seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a couple weeks and am pleased so far. No redness or irritation. I have not noticed any fine line improvement yet though.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT OBAJI&#x27;s .5. Couldn&#x27;t really see a difference...so I went back to my Retinol prescription paying more for the product, however I can see the difference.</li>
