            <li>This doesn&#x27;t help wrinkles but definitely makes skin look plumper and better.  </li>
            <li>It.s nice, but not worth it at $40.  </li>
            <li>This really seemed to help.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed that much of a difference on my skin yet.</li>

            <li>I like it so much.  </li>
            <li>Better than more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I was using my sunscreen and noticed it has ceramides and niacinamide in it, which it says helps the skin to produce more natural ceramides and fatty acids for the repair and restoration of the skin.</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to see long term effects, but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>My face still looks young</li>

            <li>For being a senior who is 70 years old, I didn&#x27;t see any results with this product.</li>
            <li>Not strong enough to be effective as a facial smoother and or change texture or rid splotches</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much EVERYTHING to get rid of those lines: super expensive wrinkle creams, inexpensive wrinkle creams, snail serum, eye cream, etc, etc.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I am 49 years old and have no wrinkles; my skin is good except for two lines:  one under each eye.  I have tried pretty much EVERYTHING to get rid of those lines: super expensive wrinkle creams, inexpensive wrinkle creams, snail serum, eye cream, etc, etc.  When I use this stuff underneath my moisturizer, those two lines almost go away.  Almost.  They are so faint you can barely see them.  I have used this and stopped, used this and stopped, over and over while trying different things.  I have come back to this to stay; I love the way my skin looks when using it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product because it is a great moisturizer, light, and clean (no greasy film). I have not used it long enough to see long term effects, but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it working or not. May have to give it more time. Nothing objectionable about it and goes on like other face cream products I like.</li>
            <li> Like all face creams, you think you notice a difference, and it does go on nice.  But the law of diminishing returns kicks in.  Unfortunately Dr. Oz showcased this product, so the price has gone steadily up.  It.s nice, but not worth it at $40.  It was a nice face cream at $15 and $20,  I&#x27;ll move on to the next good thing.</li>
            <li> Forget about ordering this!  What a gimmick!  I&#x27;d say use your regular facial lotion- this is no magic potion!&lt;br /&gt;Also smells peculiar- eww!  Too much trouble to return, will file it in the ROUND (trash) bin.  Save your money!</li>
            <li> I have AK&#x27;s that I need to have frozen off my face, twice a year.  We heard on the news that Niacinamide was effective in reducing the number of AK&#x27;s and subsequent skin cancer.  I searched the topic and found research that verified that Niacinamide was effective when taken orally.  I was using my sunscreen and noticed it has ceramides and niacinamide in it, which it says helps the skin to produce more natural ceramides and fatty acids for the repair and restoration of the skin. (CeraVe)  I searched for a niacinamide lotion, and this product looked to be the best.  It goes on easily and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  It get&#x27;s rid of fine lines around my eyes.  It was delivered in a couple of days.  This product is a great value and I&#x27;m hopeful that it will help reduce the number of AK&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks but I do feel this product is working.  It stays on but doen&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy just moist and firm on the face.  I think after some time it will produce some plumping and firming. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I just ordered another bottle.  My face likes the smooth feeling I get when applied.  Not sure yet if is working.  I usually give a product 3 months before I start something else.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in product .  Not strong enough to be effective as a facial smoother and or change texture or rid splotches</li>
            <li> While I was loosing weight 32 lbs so far it assisted in keeping my skin tight. My face still looks young</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one month and no changes in my skin at all. There were no instructions on the bottle except&amp;#34; apply a thin layer to clean skin and allow to dry&amp;#34;  Should you use 2 times a day 3 times a day, should you use it at nite or in the morning or both.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in this product. For some reason I thought I read you could return it for a full refund but now I can not see where it said that</li>
            <li> Look 10 years younger. Firmer, younger, more radiant skin. Great price. Great value. Better than more expensive products. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne. This really seemed to help. I have been cyst free. I like how light it feels- not like a heavy lotion.</li>
            <li> The serum feels good on my skin. I haven&#x27;t really noticed that much of a difference on my skin yet. It just may take a little longer to see results.</li>
            <li> Have used for 5 weeks now and have not seen any change in my wrinkles or crows feet.  My skin does feel better but i  dont see a change in it.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! This is the first time in 25 years that I do not have acne!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using 2 times a day for over a month and see  no difference in my litte wrinkles or bigger ones.</li>
            <li> The best serum I have found for daily wear under make up. Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I look forward to washing my face  and seeing the improvement each day. Price is right and glad I found it.</li>
            <li> My skin is losing the discolored areas;However, I&#x27;m also taking Vit B3 pills. So the question is which one is working?</li>
            <li> I use this product as an additive to one of my many successful health skin Creams.</li>
            <li> Wife states the product is Sticky, not smooth like previous Niacinamide  product.</li>
            <li> I got this product and it is wonderful.  I have sensitive skin and it was gentle and did not cause any reaction.  I have been using it after I wash my face in the AM and PM and just within a week or so I have seen a difference in my skin.  My pours are clear, less break outs and firmer.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with what the Niacinamide Serum along with Babyface is doing for my face, my skin is smooth with a glow.</li>
            <li> I love this product and keep reordering it. I struggle with adult inflammatory acne that leaves behind dark spots long after the acne has cleared. This product helps to fade the marks very quickly and evens out your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I bought this and used it for 2 wks seeing nothing different in my skin.I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this for two weeks.  I have not seen any improvement in my wrinkles so far.  I will continue to finish the bottle and hope to see a little improvement.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum before and am reordering today I like it so much.  I am 63 yrs young and tried many things.  This doesn&#x27;t help wrinkles but definitely makes skin look plumper and better.  Also helps with some blemishes.  I had a clogged oil gland for several yrs. (looked like a big, hard, oversized  zit)  My dermatologist said He could cut it out and stitch it.  I did not do that,  and I am very happy to give positive results from using this product.  I noticed a few days ago that it is flat with my skin and almost gone.  (It was really ugly.....I lanced  and would squeeze it time to time but only blood came out and it stayed the same.  This is a great product.  So happy to find it.</li>
            <li> This product is working great on this woman OF AGE,,  I&#x27;m seeing a lot of improvement in my one problem area. Working well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !!</li>
            <li> For being a senior who is 70 years old, I didn&#x27;t see any results with this product.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. Will buy again.</li>
