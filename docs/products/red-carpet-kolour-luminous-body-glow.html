            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Much better for arms and stomach area</li>

            <li>I love this tanning product.  </li>
            <li>I love RCK...</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>~ just saying!  :)</li>
            <li>Love this product because when I sweat, I don&#x27;t feel like I</li>
            <li>Nice coverage but full of glitter.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>It washes off your hands easily and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but i save it for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>This product creates the smooth, seamless, glowing skin - perfect for everyday use or a special occasion.</li>
            <li>I put this lotion on and instantly the spots were erased &amp; my skin had a warm radiant glow.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pale and love the medium!</li>
            <li>It also has a bit too much shimmer and does rub off on your clothes.</li>
            <li>Sun spots from too much sun are showing up on my chest, arms and even my legs</li>
            <li>I have worn it 5 times and it has gotten on my truck seats, work chair, and new furniture!</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply and once it dries it does not come off unless you get it wet.  </li>
            <li>I highly doubt it.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t even enough product in this bottle to make it worth the 50$.</li>
            <li>The shimmer shows a lot in the sun but looks matte and normal when Im inside.</li>
            <li>I live in NorCal</li>
            <li>It is very streaky and hard to rub in, its very sparkly and it does warm up your natural skin color, but you could buy any light reflecting  bronzing lotion that would do the very same thing ( for 10.99$ you can get Sublime Bronze Luminous Bronzer by Loreal) don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>The color goes on evenly and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>No other way to explain it than real-life photoshop!</li>
            <li>I think next time I&#x27;ll order directly from manufacturer.</li>

            <li> This was a very lack luster product, it did not live up to the hype and was definitely not worth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but worth the splurge for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> Only downside is I wish it cost a little less, but you totally get what you pay for and I haven&#x27;t found anything out there that comes in as a close second.</li>

            <li> m suffocating and slimy like normal body lotions.</li>
            <li> i just add a little lotion to it and put it on.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pricey, but I love this lotion!!</li>
            <li> I am so addicted to this stuff! I live in NorCal so it lasts a little longer in the winter since I use it only on my chest and arms. In the summer time I do a level 3 spray tan and then use RCK and I can&#x27;t tell you how insanely good it makes my legs look. Only downside is I wish it cost a little less, but you totally get what you pay for and I haven&#x27;t found anything out there that comes in as a close second.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and looks great. I love the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off onto my clothes and sheets because it dries extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of compliments whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> No other way to explain it than real-life photoshop! This product creates the smooth, seamless, glowing skin - perfect for everyday use or a special occasion. I even use it on my face... it actually moisturizes as well. Definitely recommend using RCK.</li>
            <li> very good but it makes my skin a little dry i just add a little lotion to it and put it on. Much better for arms and stomach area</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply and once it dries it does not come off unless you get it wet.  The color goes on evenly and looks natural.  The only caveat is that it is somewhat sparkly in the sun.</li>
            <li> Product was ok. The packaging of the product was opened and damaged. Wondered if the product had been used or what? Somewhat disappointed. Product is ok. I think next time I&#x27;ll order directly from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning product.  It goes on easily and dries quickly.  Its the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love RCK...i use it on all my celebrity clients and also brides. It adds an amazing glow to the body and hides imperfects and makes your skin look like a million bucks. LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was going to be this amazing lotion- the website for RCK said this is what the celebrities wear on the red carpet. I highly doubt it. This was a very lack luster product, it did not live up to the hype and was definitely not worth 50$. I regret my purchase of this lotion. It is very streaky and hard to rub in, its very sparkly and it does warm up your natural skin color, but you could buy any light reflecting  bronzing lotion that would do the very same thing ( for 10.99$ you can get Sublime Bronze Luminous Bronzer by Loreal) don&#x27;t waste your money. There isn&#x27;t even enough product in this bottle to make it worth the 50$.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but i save it for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;Just enough color and it dries almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m so pale I make vampires jealous and the medium color was not too dark on me.  It gives a nice, shimmery glow.  It washes off your hands easily and dries quickly.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, but worth the splurge for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> I dont think it covered any flaw(light spider veins),  it is just another lotion.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected. It does give you a bit of a glow, but not a tan look. It also has a bit too much shimmer and does rub off on your clothes. Red carpet-I would not!</li>
            <li> Wore this for my wedding and loved! Has a beautiful simmer. Don&#x27;t be alarmed that it comes out glittery it shows up on the skin beautiful. I also did a air brush tan 3 days prior.</li>
            <li> Sun spots from too much sun are showing up on my chest, arms and even my legs and I&#x27;ve been covering up w clothes. I put this lotion on and instantly the spots were erased &amp; my skin had a warm radiant glow. It boost my confidence to have the appearance of younger healthier looking skin and it stayed put...... I&#x27;ll be using this daily ~ just saying!  :)</li>
            <li> Nice coverage but full of glitter. Never buying it again.</li>
            <li> service and product both excellent! second time i ordered it and i&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
            <li> It rubs off. The reviews about it not transferring are false. I have worn it 5 times and it has gotten on my truck seats, work chair, and new furniture!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pale and love the medium! Definitely doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my designer dresses. The shimmer shows a lot in the sun but looks matte and normal when Im inside. Love this product because when I sweat, I don&#x27;t feel like Im suffocating and slimy like normal body lotions. Happy I can wear my dresses again. Great light weight formula!</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever found. Does not rub off on clothes. It is well worth the money.</li>
