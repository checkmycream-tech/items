            <li>They arrived packaged very well, so no damage during transit.</li>
            <li>They were good, but they were smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>They are tiny and very useful if you need space and want to stay organized.</li>
            <li>And they look much classier than the flip top containers that other consultants for my company have used.</li>
            <li>These are decently sized and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>, i was looking for something small &amp; cute to give a small sample of the lipstick for touch ups for brides , &amp; really love it!  </li>
            <li>Actually one container can hold about 5 days worth of cleanser or moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought it would be but its good to use for lip balms or store really small items like beads</li>
            <li>Love these, waayyyy smaller than I expected, but still can use them for lip balms!</li>
            <li>These jars definitely met my wants and needs!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for practicing DIY solid perfumes.</li>
            <li>The 3 gram jars however, I think because they have one less groove for the lid to fit, are NOT leakproof.  </li>
            <li>im a professional makeup artist</li>
            <li>These were much easier to carry than the bigger containers the items came in.  </li>

            <li> These little containers were exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 3 gram jars and they were way smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> One of the packages was open and when I counted all the jars I was missing some.</li>
            <li> Some of the lids don&#x27;t stay on well enough, which could end up having a messy situation if you put makeup powder in them like I do.</li>
            <li> I was missing 4 lil jars.</li>
            <li> Even a gel dried out in it in just a few days, so for liquid or gel cosmetics it did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I have already purchased this product twice in less than a month!</li>
            <li> Too small for lip balm which is what I wanted to use them for.</li>
            <li> However, if you put anything liquid or oily it slowly seeps out of it....</li>
            <li> The lids and jars busted when I put the microdermabrasion paste in them - disappointing purchase</li>

            <li> Exactly what I expected. Perfect condition &amp; they came a couple days before the expected date :) Will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> Purchased to provide samples of products to people for testing - plenty of spare jars left to use on future products!</li>
            <li> I love these. I received them yesterday. Fast delivery service and they are just what I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I purchased to take on my Israel trip.  Of the 20 I did use only had issues with 2 so am very pleased.  I used them for face moisturizer and cleanser, acne med, hormonal cream.  Worked out great when I needed to take some in my carryon as I had a long layover before heading out for a long flight so I cleaned my face in the bathroom at the airport.  Actually one container can hold about 5 days worth of cleanser or moisturizer.  These were much easier to carry than the bigger containers the items came in.  Of course, one can just throw them out, but since I&#x27;m a re-user of stuff till it can&#x27;t be used anymore I&#x27;m looking forward to my next trip where I can use them again.</li>
            <li> These work great for samples when I&#x27;m vending</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but with my observation they are perfect for what I need them for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, great delivery time, great quality.  Will continue to purchase in the future!</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE these containers for my Posh business. Hold enough for a good sample and my labels fit perfectly. FAST SHIPPING! Which I love! I&#x27;ve ordered these 3 times now and will continue to order them! :-)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE! I used for a sugar scrub sample! Only thing I had an issue with was leaking oils because I over tightened them. So be aware of that! Other than that they are amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought the 3 gram jars and they were way smaller than expected. But they are good for little sample sizes!</li>

My customers like them too because they are durable, reusable, and look professional. I will definitely buy this product again in the future! I have already purchased this product twice in less than a month! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> They were good, but they were smaller than I expected. I&#x27;ll probably get the bigger ones next time.</li>
            <li> Too small for lip balm which is what I wanted to use them for. Perfect size to use for samples of my body butter. They look like my regular jar but mini sized.</li>
            <li> I love my littlw jars. These were just the perfect size for my daughter and i summer project. The price was very reasonable and i was very suprised how quick the seller sent them to me. I was very pleased with this purchase. Description was self explanatory</li>
            <li> Great little jars. Working in cosmetics,  handing out samples is a daily thing. These are decently sized and reasonably priced. I just wish they came with labels.</li>
            <li> The lids and jars busted when I put the microdermabrasion paste in them - disappointing purchase</li>
            <li> I loved how many jars I got for the price and each one as a tight seal. I was able to transfer all of my pallet eyeshadows with ease.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for my needs. I give people a two part epoxy, but it has to be kept separate until they&#x27;re ready to use it. Very satisfied! Came quickly. Packaged very securely.</li>
            <li> These made perfect little sample jars for my products to give away at boutiques.</li>
            <li> Great for giving out samples, or as containers for making your own lip balm</li>
            <li> Great price and product. Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for several things. They are tiny and very useful if you need space and want to stay organized. I am currently using them to store my beads for my jewelry as well as powder for my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is:&lt;br /&gt;1. One of the packages was open and when I counted all the jars I was missing some. I was missing 4 lil jars. I&#x27;m not too worried about it though.&lt;br /&gt;2. Some of the lids don&#x27;t stay on well enough, which could end up having a messy situation if you put makeup powder in them like I do.</li>
            <li> Great deal and arrived really fast</li>
            <li> These containers were inexpensive and very convenient for use plus the are BPA free.</li>
            <li> Perfect for samples and lip-gloss</li>
            <li> Perfect for making Perfectly Posh samples!</li>
            <li> Love these! Smaller than I thought but will work fine for my lip balm products. Quick delivery too.</li>
            <li> Houseables jars in 5 gram are awesome and leakproof.  The 3 gram jars however, I think because they have one less groove for the lid to fit, are NOT leakproof.  Even a gel dried out in it in just a few days, so for liquid or gel cosmetics it did not work for me.  The 5 gram jars worked great, though.</li>
            <li> Wow! These are so cute and professional looking. Exactly what I needed for practicing DIY solid perfumes. Should be great for traveling and daily use.</li>
            <li> These jars are exactly what I expected. They arrived packaged very well, so no damage during transit. I&#x27;m using them to provide my bridal clients with a lip touch up kit, and I feel that they&#x27;re the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes a great presentation. I will be ordering more! Thanks Houesables for a great product, fast shipping and an easy transaction.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I use them for.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, perfect size for sampling.</li>
            <li> I thought they were really small at first. But realized they are perfect with samples will defiantly reorder</li>
            <li> Perfect size for giving samples. And they look much classier than the flip top containers that other consultants for my company have used. I&#x27;ve compared prices and the price of this container, which looks better in my opinion, is comparable to the flip tops. My only regret is not buying 100 instead of just 50!</li>
