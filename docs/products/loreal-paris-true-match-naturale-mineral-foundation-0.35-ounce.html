            <li>a good rating on EWG&#x27;s cosmetic database&lt;br /&gt;Protects</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to apply it before your clothes come on!</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a good shade in liquid makeup.  </li>
            <li>have tried many natural/safe make up products and this has been the best foundation I have found for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and the selection of colors is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Very light and &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure for a powder</li>
            <li>This foundation has soooo many shades.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my sister who is a bit more tan.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love mineral makeup.  </li>
            <li>This mineral makeup takes fifteen to twenty years off my face&#x27;s apparent age, makes me look gorgeous, and provides sunscreen too!</li>
            <li>This powder matches my skin great, and the brush it comes with is surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this mineral makeup primarily for its sunscreen capability, since I have never been able to wear liquid sunscreen on my face.</li>
            <li>The product is very light and clean on your face.</li>
            <li>I want smooth.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to say I have found my new foundation.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They usually offer the best in the availability of product and prices.</li>
            <li>I love using this product because it really does match my skin tone!</li>
            <li>I will say I think this is a hard one in which to get the color &amp;#34;right,&amp;#34; but if you are lucky, as i have been, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Most of these mineral powders are problematic to apply, even with your own brush there is a lot of waste.</li>
            <li>The price is right for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>I will do better next time when I order as I will order a darker color.  </li>
            <li>This product was not enough to hide these, but I bought this more to try it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I want in a makeup.</li>
            <li>The actual product is fine.</li>
            <li>and i really don&#x27;t want that.</li>
            <li>that worked really well, but I just wondered if there was anything out there that worked just as well but for cheaper.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s really dependent upon what you&#x27;re doing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to live with it because it is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I know the more expensive powders are probably better, but for the set income folks out there, I think you might like this.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal particularly as it is easier to find.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but I love how this powder just puts a little coating of smoothness and color blending across my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and like the coverage without being heavy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Powder (like any loose makeups) can get messy when traveling, so it is good to have a spare brush to get the powder that sticks on the bottom of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I actually feel like it goes on better than the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>Wow, just Wow!</li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>I usually buy light colors</li>
            <li>I have had bad luck with included brushes before, but this one is great.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first couple of weeks but have gone back to using the fancier brush I had from my previous makeup.</li>
            <li>Makes a pretty big mess, despite tapping the brush on the edge of the container.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but I love how this powder just puts a little coating of smoothness and color blending across my skin. Very light and &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34; but I definitely notice it when I get a look at myself when I&#x27;ve forgotten it.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal has a great product here. It is very easy to use and the selection of colors is outstanding. They usually offer the best in the availability of product and prices.</li>
            <li> This powder matches my skin great, and the brush it comes with is surprisingly soft. I have had bad luck with included brushes before, but this one is great.</li>
            <li> Love this make up!!! It doesn&#x27;t break my face out like some make up does.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Got a good rating on EWG&#x27;s cosmetic database&lt;br /&gt;Protects you from sun damage&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and matches skin tone well&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;Goes on well over moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Powder (like any loose makeups) can get messy when traveling, so it is good to have a spare brush to get the powder that sticks on the bottom of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many natural/safe make up products and this has been the best foundation I have found for a reasonable price and it has the added bonus of spf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure for a powder it&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s just not for me. I tried it on and it made my face look cakey and i really don&#x27;t want that. I want smooth.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed in the color.  I usually buy light colors but this gave me a white cast.  I had another mineral product and so I blend them together.  It is not the seller&#x27;s fault this didn&#x27;t work perfectly.  I will do better next time when I order as I will order a darker color.  Was very pleased with the service!!</li>
            <li> If you do not have a color chart to go by, it makes it hard to find the right the shade. This foundation has soooo many shades. I like the way it covers and my skin it&#x27;s not gooey from a liquid foundation. The price is right for me. I know the more expensive powders are probably better, but for the set income folks out there, I think you might like this. IFFFF you can find the shade. I also let Amazon send it to me every three months. You can change the color and time frame anytime you want it. P.S. I have had people ask me what foundation I use.</li>
            <li> The product is very light and clean on your face. It looks and wears well. The application leaves a lot to be desired. Most of these mineral powders are problematic to apply, even with your own brush there is a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> I have redness around my nose, and dark circles under my eyes. This product was not enough to hide these, but I bought this more to try it. It&#x27;s also a little dark for me, when I have used other L&#x27;Oreal products that have matched. It&#x27;s messy, but I didn&#x27;t take the time to learn how to properly use since I need to stick with liquid foundation. I gave it to my sister who is a bit more tan.</li>
            <li> I give it 3/5 because I&#x27;m not a makeup expert. Makes a pretty big mess, despite tapping the brush on the edge of the container. I&#x27;ve learned to live with it because it is gentle on my skin. Just make sure to apply it before your clothes come on!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Use over a BB creme basic base...done.</li>
            <li> This is the best match to my skin that I&#x27;ve ever found. Just be careful with the brush. Lay it against the lid and then shake the powder so none spills out. This stuff is great! It even controls the oil on my t-zone.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time. I love it. It works well for me, stays on all day.  Looks natural.</li>
            <li> I will say I think this is a hard one in which to get the color &amp;#34;right,&amp;#34; but if you are lucky, as i have been, it&#x27;s a wonderful product. I apply in the morning before work and have to wash off well at night because it&#x27;s stayed with me. Exactly what I want in a makeup. Plus matte finish that never looks oily or dry.</li>
            <li> Only thing that covers my post acne marks and doesn&#x27;t feel gross on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and like the coverage without being heavy.  Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I love using this product because it really does match my skin tone! I have very troubled combination skin and this foundation helps to not irritate it and also covers up a lot of redness.</li>
            <li> The only foundation my daughter will use. She often buys it in two shades and mixes them or wears the lighter in the winter and blends into a darker tone as she tans.</li>
            <li> Love mineral makeup.  L&#x27;Oreal particularly as it is easier to find.  Like ordering through Amazaon.com because I never have to go to the store and it&#x27;s delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was tired of paying almost $30 for a fancier makeup (we all know how I&#x27;m talking about) that worked really well, but I just wondered if there was anything out there that worked just as well but for cheaper. Well I found it. After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to give this a try. I am very pleased to say I have found my new foundation. I actually feel like it goes on better than the more expensive brand. The brush it comes with isn&#x27;t so great but it works. I used it for the first couple of weeks but have gone back to using the fancier brush I had from my previous makeup. It covers blemishes well and lasts awhile. I&#x27;d say all day but that&#x27;s really dependent upon what you&#x27;re doing and how often you tend to touch your face. My skin seems to like the product as well. I will say, I didn&#x27;t do a lot of research comparing the ingredients used, but the amount of blemishes I&#x27;ve got in the past month and a half that I&#x27;ve been using this product is a lot less than usual. But everyone&#x27;s skin is different and there could be other factors involved so don&#x27;t get your hopes up and expect this to cure your face.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: This works perfectly for my face and I will now be using this as my foundation from now on (or until my face decides it needs a change and explodes with blemishes).</li>
            <li> The actual product is fine. However, in my opinion, the design is poor. I make such a mess every time I use this because the bottom of the brush has the powder all over it. I would have preferred the two to have a divider so when I go to use the brush the mess is minimized.</li>
            <li> I bought this mineral makeup primarily for its sunscreen capability, since I have never been able to wear liquid sunscreen on my face. The liquid sunscreens vaporize and make my eyes tear to the point where I am incapable of doing anything. Liquid foundations have always been unsatisfactory for me, too. But surprise! This mineral makeup takes fifteen to twenty years off my face&#x27;s apparent age, makes me look gorgeous, and provides sunscreen too! Wow, just Wow! My skin looks smooth, dewy, flawless, and glowing, and the shade is perfect for me. I have never been able to find a good shade in liquid makeup.  And it&#x27;s quick and easy to apply. Will I continue to reorder this and use it daily? You guess!</li>
