            <li>It just didn&#x27;t smell good to me.</li>
            <li>A good buy and would recommend A+++</li>
            <li>Another thing that I look for in a perfume that is not too desagradale throughout the day, which I do not dislike the essence throughout the day, still enjoy the scent itself is very good.</li>
            <li>VERY PLEASED in my error</li>
            <li>My husband has been looking for this product at a variety of retail stores and I was very glad</li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own, it is a good fragrance with its own voice and character..</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff for this price.</li>
            <li>An amazing bargain for a top-shelf fragrance.</li>
            <li>Nice breeze.</li>
            <li>but the dry-down is really nice and</li>
            <li>Christmas gifts!!!They automatically liked it ....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 and couldn&#x27;t find anything about it I liked.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s some kind of sneaky, ephemeral Mr. Hyde note in there that pops up just every now and then.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the scent reads as a kind of flowery&gt;clean</li>
            <li>Kinda bummed out that I own 4.2 oz of this juice.</li>
            <li>This parfum version is very potent and 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this scent as it isn&#x27;t too sweet or too musky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Moschino starts with floral and spice notes and then settles into a powdery amber musk fragrance that is very easy on the nose.  </li>
            <li>Exotic and mild !!</li>
            <li>Love LA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sprayed at 6:25pm and started writing this review at 9:25pm after giving them one more sniff.</li>
            <li>so, so, delicious that it even beats out Blue Sugar in smell but</li>
            <li>I can see why many reviewers rave about it, and I can see why some do not like it.</li>
            <li>I lean more toward not liking it</li>
            <li>give you an idea of how opposites attract, my GF chose my #5, 6 and 8 as her top three best smelling scents respectively.</li>
            <li>I buy cologne because I love the way it smells on me.</li>
            <li>Will try it again in 10 or 15 year from now to see if it grows on me :)</li>
            <li>I got this cologne one week ago from Amazon.com and already I have gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Wonderful fragrance; I use many different premium men&#x27;s fragrances and this one gets the most comments along the lines of  &amp;#34;What fragrance is that?  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and you have yourself one heck of a sophisticated, sexy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s appropriate for anything from sportswear to Dockers and is more of an outdoor/active/casual cologne than it is an office cologne</li>
            <li>I love this cologne</li>
            <li>I purchased this solely from all the grand reviews.</li>
            <li>I had uomo a long time ago and can&#x27;t stop buy it smell real good</li>
            <li>but overall, the dry-down was also great but after such a magnificent opening</li>
            <li>I do enjoy this fragrance and am glad I have it to add to my collection.</li>
            <li>about a month ago to this product and loved it smells pretty rich</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited and pleased with the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Although it smells okay, not the original.</li>
            <li>To find it immediately available, at a very reasonable price was very satisfying.</li>
            <li>Go easy on the sprays in the heat tho.</li>
            <li>You get 6-8 hrs on the skin easily with this one and 24hrs on ur clothing.</li>
            <li>Easy on the sprayer.</li>
            <li>It was a clean, spicy smell with distinct (but nice) \\&quot;sweaty\\&quot; suggestive notes.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is as light and airy of a woody musky scent as you will find.  </li>
            <li>When it works right, it&#x27;s sexy.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this Blue Sugar is GREAT and a bargain bin special at just $17/1.7 oz .</li>
            <li>It has great longevity and the dry down is nice and Pleasant to smell.</li>
            <li>good value, too,  because the bottle is large and the price very reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this scent once and enjoyed it so much, I just had to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very good for everyday use</li>
            <li>Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc.</li>
            <li>I used Aqua Di Gio for years but it began to be too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>quick deleviry</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have strong feelings about it one way or another even though I get positive comments from men and women when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Must try if you like fresh, sweet summer scents.</li>
            <li>This Cologne is sweet musk, powdery and vanilla with spices, it is a mature fragrance for sure.</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled good and subversively sexy (like a dress shirt with cufflinks after a long day), so even though I couldn&#x27;t get a direct spray to test it out</li>
            <li>There was no sampler, but I could smell something a bit intriguing coming from the box.</li>
            <li>The fresh pineapple remains throughout  tho.</li>
            <li>scent wins the 4th spot by default because #5 has projection problems and it ticks me off because its a designer fragrance.</li>
            <li>Let me interject one possible disclaimer: The bottle was warm when it arrived.</li>
            <li>This is not a mass market, popular, or simple \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; fragrance you can rely on to \\&quot;smell good\\&quot; or get compliments.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a comparable substitute to my old favorite of years-gone-by (COSI), which is not on the market any longer.  </li>
            <li>This is really a good fragrance - especially, if you like the classic spicy musk scents from years</li>
            <li>stuff ranks right alongside Platinum Egoiste in my collection, and thats saying a lot.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed Kenneth Cole&#x27;s Black and will stick with it until I find something better.</li>
            <li>Great opening, dry down almost seems to project a bit more but fantastic,mysterious, vetiver and bourbon essence that is still banging after 3 hrs on a piece of paper.</li>
            <li>There are many other, better choices, for example,  Boucheron and a whole line of Guerlain products.</li>
            <li>Dont get me wrong, I love those two colognes as well, but this ones great too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you like old school spicy fragrances that are easy on the nose, this one is for you.  </li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li>I must say thanks to him for adding this one to my repertoire because it is fresh, clean and masculine and fun wrapped in one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this cologne since 2002 as my signature scent &amp; this was the first one off of Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I only hope Him by Hanae Mori will compare or be better than this?</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pissed off at D&amp;G for creating this masterpiece because it sure does fall short in the projection dept.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh smell and it lasts a long time on me.</li>
            <li>Sometimes buy this difernete is the aroma and flavor that has a buffet where you put on a piece of paper, leaving the scent on your skin, is much higher.</li>
            <li>The good news is you can spray it on your clothes instead of your body and 3-4 sprays WILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler</li>
            <li>and I see why my friend loves it so much.</li>
            <li>Very well done for a cheapy.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before.</li>
            <li>it projects very well.</li>
            <li>I dont know but this fragrance is like too much spicy for my taste .</li>
            <li>so much so, I purchased a mini bottle to take in my carry overnight bag.</li>
            <li>so much had to try it for</li>
            <li>Infuse light fruits, spice,(expertly blend it all) and inject some italian charm</li>
            <li>I have worn the fragrance twice now and enjoy the occasionally whiff from time to time.  </li>
            <li>It was VERY feminine and floral smelling out of the gate.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what it is</li>
            <li>That too had stella reviews but really was a flop.</li>
            <li>generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Looking for something more masculine but not overpowering I took a chance on this, going by the description and the reviews, because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  </li>
            <li>Over the next hour it evolved to reveal some clean musk and wood.</li>
            <li>then the dry-down smells more like a pineapple with a strong vanilla vibe behind it.</li>
            <li>first spray I put on surprised me.</li>
            <li>bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li>The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not that high</li>
            <li>packaging is above average - nice finishing touch - and the bottle is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>Underneath is lurking a musk that suggests licked, bare skin and some spices that recall hot sweat.</li>
            <li>If this projected more on the dry down it could really be a #1 signature scent</li>
            <li>Guys - UoMo Moschino is another one of my blind buys that has turned into a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Starting to question all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I am fond of clear bottles that allow seeing the clarity of the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It was very close but mysterious nostalgia pushed Encre Noire to the title.</li>
            <li>but it always reminds me of an old ladies perfume.</li>
            <li>&gt;spicy thing that&#x27;s equally masculine and feminine.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but still below average.  </li>
            <li>The dry down was ok, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still say try it out a store first before ordering, since colognes are such a personal thing.</li>
            <li>Given the classic and traditional notes, the fragrance can be worn for any occasion and during any season.  </li>
            <li>My only disappointment with Moschino, is the longevity - to me, the most important performance measure.  </li>
            <li>None of the perfume stores near where I live carry this fragrance, but I was lucky enough to come across it at a local Marshall&#x27;s the other day, and snatched one</li>
            <li>Not a bad fragrance, but it has some subtle notes that remind me a bit of my old hair-sheen products (which is not a fragrance I particularly like).  </li>
            <li>Fruity opening, even better fruity dry down with a musky undertone behind it while staying masculine, mysterious and potent.</li>
            <li>While I have not received any compliments, i.e. Wow Factor, I do believe it has potential.  </li>
            <li>Polo stinks so good if you like it</li>
            <li>Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.</li>
            <li>If you are the type of person who buys based on what women like, then you better try some blind tests with some women you know because you may be surprised to find out that they may like the scents you don&#x27;t and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I got a free sample of this scent once and enjoyed it so much, I just had to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very good for everyday use</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc.</li>
            <li> I used Aqua Di Gio for years but it began to be too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> quick deleviry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have strong feelings about it one way or another even though I get positive comments from men and women when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Must try if you like fresh, sweet summer scents.</li>
            <li> This Cologne is sweet musk, powdery and vanilla with spices, it is a mature fragrance for sure.</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled good and subversively sexy (like a dress shirt with cufflinks after a long day), so even though I couldn&#x27;t get a direct spray to test it out</li>
            <li> There was no sampler, but I could smell something a bit intriguing coming from the box.</li>
            <li> The fresh pineapple remains throughout  tho.</li>
            <li> scent wins the 4th spot by default because #5 has projection problems and it ticks me off because its a designer fragrance.</li>
            <li> Let me interject one possible disclaimer: The bottle was warm when it arrived.</li>
            <li> This is not a mass market, popular, or simple \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; fragrance you can rely on to \\&quot;smell good\\&quot; or get compliments.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a comparable substitute to my old favorite of years-gone-by (COSI), which is not on the market any longer.  </li>
            <li> This is really a good fragrance - especially, if you like the classic spicy musk scents from years</li>
            <li> stuff ranks right alongside Platinum Egoiste in my collection, and thats saying a lot.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Kenneth Cole&#x27;s Black and will stick with it until I find something better.</li>
            <li> Great opening, dry down almost seems to project a bit more but fantastic,mysterious, vetiver and bourbon essence that is still banging after 3 hrs on a piece of paper.</li>
            <li> There are many other, better choices, for example,  Boucheron and a whole line of Guerlain products.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, I love those two colognes as well, but this ones great too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you like old school spicy fragrances that are easy on the nose, this one is for you.  </li>
            <li> It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li> I must say thanks to him for adding this one to my repertoire because it is fresh, clean and masculine and fun wrapped in one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this cologne since 2002 as my signature scent &amp; this was the first one off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I only hope Him by Hanae Mori will compare or be better than this?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pissed off at D&amp;G for creating this masterpiece because it sure does fall short in the projection dept.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell and it lasts a long time on me.</li>
            <li> Sometimes buy this difernete is the aroma and flavor that has a buffet where you put on a piece of paper, leaving the scent on your skin, is much higher.</li>
            <li> The good news is you can spray it on your clothes instead of your body and 3-4 sprays WILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler</li>
            <li> and I see why my friend loves it so much.</li>
            <li> Very well done for a cheapy.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before.</li>
            <li> it projects very well.</li>
            <li> I dont know but this fragrance is like too much spicy for my taste .</li>
            <li> so much so, I purchased a mini bottle to take in my carry overnight bag.</li>
            <li> so much had to try it for</li>
            <li> Infuse light fruits, spice,(expertly blend it all) and inject some italian charm</li>
            <li> I have worn the fragrance twice now and enjoy the occasionally whiff from time to time.  </li>
            <li> It was VERY feminine and floral smelling out of the gate.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what it is</li>
            <li> That too had stella reviews but really was a flop.</li>
            <li> generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Looking for something more masculine but not overpowering I took a chance on this, going by the description and the reviews, because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  </li>
            <li> Over the next hour it evolved to reveal some clean musk and wood.</li>
            <li> then the dry-down smells more like a pineapple with a strong vanilla vibe behind it.</li>
            <li> first spray I put on surprised me.</li>
            <li> bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li> The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not that high</li>
            <li> packaging is above average - nice finishing touch - and the bottle is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> Underneath is lurking a musk that suggests licked, bare skin and some spices that recall hot sweat.</li>
            <li> If this projected more on the dry down it could really be a #1 signature scent</li>
            <li> Guys - UoMo Moschino is another one of my blind buys that has turned into a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Starting to question all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I am fond of clear bottles that allow seeing the clarity of the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It was very close but mysterious nostalgia pushed Encre Noire to the title.</li>
            <li> but it always reminds me of an old ladies perfume.</li>
            <li> &gt;spicy thing that&#x27;s equally masculine and feminine.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but still below average.  </li>
            <li> The dry down was ok, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still say try it out a store first before ordering, since colognes are such a personal thing.</li>
            <li> Given the classic and traditional notes, the fragrance can be worn for any occasion and during any season.  </li>
            <li> My only disappointment with Moschino, is the longevity - to me, the most important performance measure.  </li>
            <li> None of the perfume stores near where I live carry this fragrance, but I was lucky enough to come across it at a local Marshall&#x27;s the other day, and snatched one</li>
            <li> Not a bad fragrance, but it has some subtle notes that remind me a bit of my old hair-sheen products (which is not a fragrance I particularly like).  </li>
            <li> Fruity opening, even better fruity dry down with a musky undertone behind it while staying masculine, mysterious and potent.</li>
            <li> While I have not received any compliments, i.e. Wow Factor, I do believe it has potential.  </li>
            <li> Polo stinks so good if you like it</li>
            <li> Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.</li>
            <li> If you are the type of person who buys based on what women like, then you better try some blind tests with some women you know because you may be surprised to find out that they may like the scents you don&#x27;t and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me it is a sweet, thick, syrupy smell and it doesn&#x27;t last long (thank goodness).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, as I am not a fan of powder base fragrances but this one is done right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over it and so are the perfumers of the world because there are not many scents on the market like Polo&#x27;s green bottle original scent and noone is trying to mimic it anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Oddly, you can spray 4-5 sprays and not offend anyone because of the soft sweetness that remains throughout this scent.</li>
            <li> While the fragrance lasts a little longer on my shirtsleeve, it is barely detectable on the skin 3-4 hours following the initial application.  </li>
            <li> Personally, the dry down smells like you sprinkled salt n pepper on a grapefruit mixed with a WOOD undertone big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, I&#x27;m just sharing how it smelled to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry this was so long people.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED EVEN EARLIER THAN i EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange combination</li>
            <li> but about once a week for a minute at a time I get this kind of sour and dirty note.</li>
            <li> My review is based on the opening, dry down and projection within these last 3 hours only.</li>
            <li> Wrong one...sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> I live in the Los Angeles area and it was around 80 degrees for the past few days here in the city just to give you a visual of my surrounding temp.</li>
            <li> This one is a little different than your all time favorites like Issey Miyake and Aqua Di Gio etc</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> notes give me the mental image like I just rolled off of a dolled up thing.</li>
            <li> It opens like cotton candy or a slight bubble gum vibe but then drys down into a yellow cake batter or caramelized vanilla/sugar mixture.</li>
            <li> have a bias toward fragrances that I have smelled before that mimic other fragrance houses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will agree with some reviewers and say this is an acquired taste so-to-speak and you will either LOVE it or HATE it.</li>
            <li> OVERWHELM YOU OR OTHER PERSONS ON A TIGHTLY SEATED AIRPLANE.</li>
            <li> If D&amp;G 1 had the projection of Encre Noire, D&amp;G would be #1 HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li> What a let down To me the opening smells like lemon Pine Sol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#7 Silver by Jack Black</li>
            <li> I tried it a few days hoping I&#x27;d change my mind</li>
            <li> Then, after a few seconds I picked up on the spicy and \\&quot;man\\&quot; smell underneath.</li>
            <li> The other blind buy that I purchsed was Thallium Blue.</li>
            <li> The smell is reminiscent of Tim McGraw&#x27;s cologne but is a little less spicy and seems to have a faint baby oil smell to it.</li>
            <li> (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 Blue Sugar by Aqualina</li>
            <li> For now on I&#x27;ll stick to sniffing them local frag stores before I buy, no more blind buying for muah.</li>
            <li> Hope it was helpful at least.</li>
            <li> It smells weak / fake like it&#x27;s watered down.</li>
            <li> No, good idont like tha smell.</li>
            <li> For me, this was not a good substitute ...</li>
            <li> You may hate my favorite and I may hate yours.</li>
            <li> Poor projection after 4 hrs and semi floral on the dry-down.</li>
            <li> the dry down from D&amp;G for ($52) from a deisgner house is just pathetic.</li>
            <li> had my girlfriend blind test me.</li>
            <li> I will also recommend (blind buy) or (try 1st) for those who care about stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (You can blind buy this</li>
            <li> (You can blind buy this</li>

            <li> Blind buy and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t care for this cologne.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a blind buy</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this cologne, it&#x27;s just not for me</li>
            <li> When a cologne is layered and changing like that, it suggests to me that it is expensive and artfully crafted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it stinks so bad when you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Im not saying its a bad fragrance its just not what i was expecting(blind buy).</li>
            <li> When it goes bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this cologne since 2002 as my signature scent &amp; this was the first one off of Amazon. It smells weak / fake like it&#x27;s watered down. Probably going to return it.</li>
            <li> I live in the Los Angeles area and it was around 80 degrees for the past few days here in the city just to give you a visual of my surrounding temp. No humidity. Nice breeze. Love LA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the fragrances being reviewed and their ranking in comparison to Uomo Moschino by Moschino. I purchased #1-7 below within the last 2 months but I&#x27;ve had the same Polo bottle for over 10 year lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut up 8 pieces of paper and sprayed each with one scent then had my girlfriend blind test me. I sprayed at 6:25pm and started writing this review at 9:25pm after giving them one more sniff. My review is based on the opening, dry down and projection within these last 3 hours only. I will also recommend (blind buy) or (try 1st) for those who care about stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 Encre Noire by Lalique&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent reminds me of something or someone from my childhood. I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it but the smell made me happy and I wanted to keep smelling it over and over. Great opening, dry down almost seems to project a bit more but fantastic,mysterious, vetiver and bourbon essence that is still banging after 3 hrs on a piece of paper.Personally, the dry down smells like you sprinkled salt n pepper on a grapefruit mixed with a WOOD undertone big time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with some reviewers and say this is an acquired taste so-to-speak and you will either LOVE it or HATE it. It is somewhat aggressive but a wonderful scent in order to beat out Hanae Mori. It was very close but mysterious nostalgia pushed Encre Noire to the title. Simply divine smell. (Try a sampler of this 1st)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 Hanae Mori by Hanae Mori&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening to this scent is #1 on this list without a doubt but overall, the dry-down was also great but after such a magnificent opening, I felt cheated. DO NOT BE FOOLED. This parfum version is very potent and 100% authentic. The opening smelled to me like a caramelized pineapple dipped in chocolate with a hint of muskor pepper then the dry-down smells more like a pineapple with a strong vanilla vibe behind it. The fresh pineapple remains throughout  tho. I&#x27;m not a professional, I&#x27;m just sharing how it smelled to me. Ironicaly, I meant to buy Him by Hanae Mori but ordered this one by mistake. VERY PLEASED in my error but I only hope Him by Hanae Mori will compare or be better than this? It&#x27;s my next purchase. Great fragrance. Must buy. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 Uomo Maschino by Moschino&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A close friend recommended this one for me as he swore by it for the last 15 yrs. I must say thanks to him for adding this one to my repertoire because it is fresh, clean and masculine and fun wrapped in one. Fruity opening, even better fruity dry down with a musky undertone behind it while staying masculine, mysterious and potent. Good projection on this one too. Oddly, you can spray 4-5 sprays and not offend anyone because of the soft sweetness that remains throughout this scent. If this projected more on the dry down it could really be a #1 signature scent and I see why my friend loves it so much. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 Blue Sugar by Aqualina&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent wins the 4th spot by default because #5 has projection problems and it ticks me off because its a designer fragrance. Anyway, this Blue Sugar is GREAT and a bargain bin special at just $17/1.7 oz . It opens like cotton candy or a slight bubble gum vibe but then drys down into a yellow cake batter or caramelized vanilla/sugar mixture. Amazing stuff for this price. Very well done for a cheapy. Must try if you like fresh, sweet summer scents. Go easy on the sprays in the heat tho. Can&#x27;t lose. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5 The One by Dolce &amp; Gabbana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pissed off at D&amp;G for creating this masterpiece because it sure does fall short in the projection dept. It smells so, so, so, delicious that it even beats out Blue Sugar in smell but the dry down from D&amp;G for ($52) from a deisgner house is just pathetic. If you give someone a hug after 4 hrs, they might still smell it on you but you have to go 4-6 sprays on this just to make it through a an 8hr work day. The good news is you can spray it on your clothes instead of your body and 3-4 sprays WILL LAST for your entire 8hr work day. Damn good smell tho. If D&amp;G 1 had the projection of Encre Noire, D&amp;G would be #1 HANDS DOWN it smells that good. (You can blind buy this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#6 Angel Men Pure Malt by Thierry Mugler&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bias toward fragrances that I have smelled before that mimic other fragrance houses. For that reason, I didn&#x27;t really care for this opening here because I had smelled this scent before. It is slightly aggressive and interesting right off the top. It smells exactly like Dunhill Red by Dunhill that I used to own and didn&#x27;t really care for. Same exact juice, however, the dry down of Pure Malt is where this fragrance shines.This is another acquired taste. I can see why many reviewers rave about it, and I can see why some do not like it. I lean more toward not liking it but the dry-down is really nice and it projects very well. You get 6-8 hrs on the skin easily with this one and 24hrs on ur clothing. I can always smell it on my clothes the next day. Easy on the sprayer. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#7 Silver by Jack Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very generic summer scent that I bought because it has many natural ingredients. Nothing to write home about but good for a daily gym scent or after work run to the grocery store etc. Poor projection after 4 hrs and semi floral on the dry-down. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#8 Polo by Ralph Lauren&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this years and years ago because it is a timeless classic. The time for this classic has come and gone in my opinion. I&#x27;m over it and so are the perfumers of the world because there are not many scents on the market like Polo&#x27;s green bottle original scent and noone is trying to mimic it anytime soon. I can&#x27;t believe this thing is not a parfum. It projects like a BEAST. You know the deal guys...Polo stinks so good if you like it and it stinks so bad when you don&#x27;t. (Try a sample before buying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of how opposites attract, my GF chose my #5, 6 and 8 as her top three best smelling scents respectively. I buy cologne because I love the way it smells on me. I do not buy it to impress females. If you are the type of person who buys based on what women like, then you better try some blind tests with some women you know because you may be surprised to find out that they may like the scents you don&#x27;t and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this was so long people. Hope it was helpful at least.</li>
            <li> I dont know but this fragrance is like too much spicy for my taste . Im not saying its a bad fragrance its just not what i was expecting(blind buy). Its reminds me a lot to Guess Man by Guess. I&#x27;m 33 maybe that&#x27;s the reason I don&#x27;t like the smell of it . Will try it again in 10 or 15 year from now to see if it grows on me :)</li>
            <li> great scent at a great value</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I just shoved it in the kitchen drawing. Money gone to the drain</li>
            <li> I got this cologne one week ago from Amazon.com and already I have gotten many compliments. I love the fresh smell and it lasts a long time on me. Great fragrance from Moschino!</li>
            <li> I had uomo a long time ago and can&#x27;t stop buy it smell real good and it&#x27;s not that high</li>
            <li> This one is a little different than your all time favorites like Issey Miyake and Aqua Di Gio etc and thats the good part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its one of those colognes that can become your signature scent, unlike the ones mentioned above since almost every guy wears either one of those. Dont get me wrong, I love those two colognes as well, but this ones great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of the woody scents but this ones different. I&#x27;ve got only compliments for this so I wouldnt think twice before recommending it to others. I&#x27;d still say try it out a store first before ordering, since colognes are such a personal thing. You may hate my favorite and I may hate yours.</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for this product at a variety of retail stores and I was very glad I thought to check on Amazon.  To find it immediately available, at a very reasonable price was very satisfying.</li>
            <li> The scent is remarkable and it lasts for hours on end.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited and pleased with the fragrance. And I&#x27;m about to purchase a bottle for a friend!</li>
            <li> Good price. I love the smell and I&#x27;m using this colon for years and I don&#x27;t want to switch to anything else.</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance; I use many different premium men&#x27;s fragrances and this one gets the most comments along the lines of  &amp;#34;What fragrance is that?  I love the smell.  I want to get my boyfriend some.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Very good value, too,  because the bottle is large and the price very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bottle of this Uomo Moschino.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this scent once and enjoyed it so much, I just had to purchase it.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Alguna ocasion compre este aroma y es difernete al aroma que tiene en un aparador donde lo ponen en un pedazo de papel, al aroma que deja en tu piel, es muy superior. Tiene un muy buen fijador pues el aroma perdura por todo el dia y la esencia de un buen perfuma la tiene, es fresco sin dejar de ser muy cautivador y agradable. Otra de las cosas que busco yo en un perfume es que no sea muy ostigoso, que la esencia no me desagrade a lo largo del dia, el seguir disfrutando el aroma  propio es muy buieno.    Sometimes buy this difernete is the aroma and flavor that has a buffet where you put on a piece of paper, leaving the scent on your skin, is much higher. It has a very good fixative for the scent lasts throughout the day and the essence of a good perfume, you are cool while being very charming and pleasant. Another thing that I look for in a perfume that is not too desagradale throughout the day, which I do not dislike the essence throughout the day, still enjoy the scent itself is very good.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this scent as it isn&#x27;t too sweet or too musky.  The scent is clean and not too strong.  Very happy with this scent so much so, I purchased a mini bottle to take in my carry overnight bag.</li>
            <li> USE DAILY...HAS ONE OF THE BEST FRAGRANCES THAT WON&#x27;T OVERWHELM YOU OR OTHER PERSONS ON A TIGHTLY SEATED AIRPLANE. ARRIVED EVEN EARLIER THAN i EXPECTED. EVERYTHING WAS IN GREAT WORKING CONDITION.</li>
            <li> No, good idont like tha smell. I thing not originar...</li>
            <li> I love it. very nice Scent. quick deleviry I will recommend this product to any one who loves a good scent</li>
            <li> Phew! Wrong one...sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> A friend at work wears this and I loved it so much had to try it for Christmas gifts!!!They automatically liked it ....</li>
            <li> Sad to say, this cologne is more like an after-shave lotion. It has NO staying power. There are many other, better choices, for example,  Boucheron and a whole line of Guerlain products.</li>
            <li> This is not the same scent. Although it smells okay, not the original.</li>
            <li> This will forever remain my signature scent !! Exotic and mild !!</li>
            <li> None of the perfume stores near where I live carry this fragrance, but I was lucky enough to come across it at a local Marshall&#x27;s the other day, and snatched one up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is as light and airy of a woody musky scent as you will find.  Infuse light fruits, spice,(expertly blend it all) and inject some italian charm and you have yourself one heck of a sophisticated, sexy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff ranks right alongside Platinum Egoiste in my collection, and thats saying a lot.  I picked up a 4.2 oz of this stuff for 1/2 the price of a 1.7 oz. of Platinum.  An amazing bargain for a top-shelf fragrance.</li>
            <li> Guys - UoMo Moschino is another one of my blind buys that has turned into a pleasant surprise.  This is really a good fragrance - especially, if you like the classic spicy musk scents from years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moschino starts with floral and spice notes and then settles into a powdery amber musk fragrance that is very easy on the nose.  Very pleasant..!! I have worn the fragrance twice now and enjoy the occasionally whiff from time to time.  While I have not received any compliments, i.e. Wow Factor, I do believe it has potential.  Given the classic and traditional notes, the fragrance can be worn for any occasion and during any season.  It is that versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is above average - nice finishing touch - and the bottle is one of my favorites.  I am fond of clear bottles that allow seeing the clarity of the fragrance.  My only disappointment with Moschino, is the longevity - to me, the most important performance measure.  While the fragrance lasts a little longer on my shirtsleeve, it is barely detectable on the skin 3-4 hours following the initial application.  Not bad, but still below average.  Perhaps as an option, pack the bottle and reapply as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like old school spicy fragrances that are easy on the nose, this one is for you.  I am not a big fan of this type of cologne, but I definitely recommend buying Moschino.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered I will give Moschino 4.1 stars out of 5. It is truly a gem - and the bottle will be a great addition to your collection. Ride on Midnight Rider...</li>
            <li> Blind buy and this stuff went into the trash after one day.  Read the reviews and had a gift card so I gambled and lost.  I&#x27;m 35 and couldn&#x27;t find anything about it I liked.  It just didn&#x27;t smell good to me.</li>
            <li> I used Aqua Di Gio for years but it began to be too sweet for me. Looking for something more masculine but not overpowering I took a chance on this, going by the description and the reviews, because I couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t care for this cologne.  To me it is a sweet, thick, syrupy smell and it doesn&#x27;t last long (thank goodness).  I tried it a few days hoping I&#x27;d change my mind but it always reminds me of an old ladies perfume. I have enjoyed Kenneth Cole&#x27;s Black and will stick with it until I find something better. Let me interject one possible disclaimer: The bottle was warm when it arrived. It had been riding in a UPS truck all day and it was another 100 degree day. So maybe the heat ruined it and I should never order cologne in the summer! But a lot of products must experience this, whether delivered to the home or a merchant.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a blind buy and I am happy with this fragrance. It has great longevity and the dry down is nice and Pleasant to smell. This Cologne is sweet musk, powdery and vanilla with spices, it is a mature fragrance for sure. I would say this is a romantic dinner date fragrance. It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, as I am not a fan of powder base fragrances but this one is done right. I do enjoy this fragrance and am glad I have it to add to my collection. A good buy and would recommend A+++</li>
            <li> The smell is reminiscent of Tim McGraw&#x27;s cologne but is a little less spicy and seems to have a faint baby oil smell to it. It&#x27;s a strange combination but it works well if you want a toned-down spice scented cologne. I don&#x27;t have strong feelings about it one way or another even though I get positive comments from men and women when I wear it. There is nothing wrong with this cologne, it&#x27;s just not for me and it&#x27;s very good for everyday use so I won&#x27;t ding it. I give it five stars because others like the way it smells and it&#x27;s among the best in its price range performance wise.  It&#x27;s appropriate for anything from sportswear to Dockers and is more of an outdoor/active/casual cologne than it is an office cologne so if you need to dress-up or wear a suit, I would suggest something else.  It&#x27;s not offensive, just meh, to me.</li>
            <li> bought for my dad and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and I think it smells great! But I can make no assurances that you will like it. This is not a mass market, popular, or simple \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; fragrance you can rely on to \\&quot;smell good\\&quot; or get compliments. I think this concoction is an actual composition of art in the medium of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a gift set at a discount store. There was no sampler, but I could smell something a bit intriguing coming from the box. It was a clean, spicy smell with distinct (but nice) \\&quot;sweaty\\&quot; suggestive notes. I thought it smelled good and subversively sexy (like a dress shirt with cufflinks after a long day), so even though I couldn&#x27;t get a direct spray to test it out I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first spray I put on surprised me. I thought I might have gotten a completely different fragrance. It was VERY feminine and floral smelling out of the gate. Then, after a few seconds I picked up on the spicy and \\&quot;man\\&quot; smell underneath. Over the next hour it evolved to reveal some clean musk and wood. When a cologne is layered and changing like that, it suggests to me that it is expensive and artfully crafted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s some kind of sneaky, ephemeral Mr. Hyde note in there that pops up just every now and then. I really don&#x27;t know what it is but about once a week for a minute at a time I get this kind of sour and dirty note. When it works right, it&#x27;s sexy. When it goes bad it&#x27;s a bit scandalous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the scent reads as a kind of flowery&gt;clean&gt;spicy thing that&#x27;s equally masculine and feminine. Underneath is lurking a musk that suggests licked, bare skin and some spices that recall hot sweat. That with the feminine (what is that? Tommy Girl? Chanel No 5?) notes give me the mental image like I just rolled off of a dolled up thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this solely from all the grand reviews.I could not wait for it to arrive.What a let down To me the opening smells like lemon Pine Sol. The dry down was ok, nothing to write home about. Kinda bummed out that I own 4.2 oz of this juice. Maybe it will grow on me , but I have never worn a colone that I needed to get my nose accustomed to. The other blind buy that I purchsed was Thallium Blue. That too had stella reviews but really was a flop. Starting to question all the positive reviews. For now on I&#x27;ll stick to sniffing them local frag stores before I buy, no more blind buying for muah.</li>
            <li> Not a bad fragrance, but it has some subtle notes that remind me a bit of my old hair-sheen products (which is not a fragrance I particularly like).  I was looking for a comparable substitute to my old favorite of years-gone-by (COSI), which is not on the market any longer.  For me, this was not a good substitute ... but it probably never was meant to me.  On it&#x27;s own, it is a good fragrance with its own voice and character..</li>
            <li> about a month ago to this product and loved it smells pretty rich even my girlfriend says she loves me!</li>
