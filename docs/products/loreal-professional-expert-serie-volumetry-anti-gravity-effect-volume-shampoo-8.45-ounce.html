            <li>Whatever this shampoo does to plump up hair allows me to get great curls (with some frizz</li>

            <li>The fragrance is very nice.</li>
            <li>Great product for fine hair and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>As another review stated, I also like Pantene&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner for fine hair and always felt it was my best choice until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Volumetry based on an article in Allure magazine.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I have found for fine hair</li>
            <li>If you want a good line that will give your hair shine and bounce, go get the anti aging Nexus line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>volume I get from it is so amazing</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very happy with this much-touted shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have tons of volume even with my fine hair!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>The Loreal Volumetry Shampoo is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used for giving my hair extra body.</li>
            <li>&amp; I still shed more hair than I&#x27;d like,</li>
            <li>Good seller, too, with very fast shipping from overseas.</li>
            <li>(the masque is an excellent leave-in conditioner for my dry ends).  </li>
            <li>Best results for fine hair than with any other volumizing product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is okay, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>This product did not produce any volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I also got the volumetry root spray for fine hair.</li>
            <li>This gives me better results than a quick wash &amp; rinse.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and lathers really well.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Hairstyle Boost</li>
            <li>It High Lift Creation Spray to set my style (mostly focusing on bangs and top.)  </li>
            <li>My hair tends to grow in during summer &amp; shed a lot in autumn, so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if it was a seasonal coincidence when I started this product.</li>
            <li>Sounded too good to be true, so I didn&#x27;t really expect anything, but was willing to risk the money just to see for myself what it would do,</li>
            <li>Well, these products (and you must use everything in the product line to get good results) really do produce a real change in my hair&#x27;s texture and movement.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s better than other shampoos, sometimes not as good.</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo from the very first use &amp; want to continue using it regularly</li>
            <li>The best shampoo for volumizing fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think there is a product available that can actually increase the volume of hair, although I remain ever hopeful that science will come to my rescue!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey at $21, but totally worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it does anything in particular for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I do not find that this line dries my hair out like many lines for fine, flat hair do and it has totally changed my hair for the better (and my perception of myself, which is the most important thing.)  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, blonde hair that is color-treated.  </li>
            <li>That can only makes things better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different volumizing hair products throughout the years.</li>
            <li>The volume I get is amazing - it makes me feel like I have 25-year-old hair again - full, fluffy, voluminous.</li>
            <li>With the added texture, my hair is no longer &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34; {i.e. doesn&#x27;t lay flat against my scalp} which gives my hair the &amp;#34;appearance of more volume&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was surprised to actually get real volume in my hair, more volume than I ever got from any styling product, let alone from shampoo!</li>
            <li>This is the most fantastic shampoo for everyone in my family, everyone&#x27;s hair has been transformed from think and limp to being thicker and fuller every time we use it!</li>
            <li>In this decade, there is a lack of good hair products for a fine hair type---many I used to use were sadly discontinued.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>but it really works on my hair.</li>
            <li>Conditioners don&#x27;t seem to make my hair any softer or moisturized anymore, so they don&#x27;t really serve a purpose for me.</li>
            <li>and, although it does put volume in my hair, it&#x27;s also very drying.  </li>
            <li>was very prompt with answering my questions.</li>
            <li>As a final step, I use the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Hairstyle Boost</li>
            <li>It not only leaves my hair looking and feeling thinner, but my hair also looks clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does more volumizing than the conditioner, &amp; it&#x27;s my opinion that the conditioner slightly dampens the shampoo&#x27;s effect when used together than when the shampoo is used alone.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have definitely noticed a difference in my hair&#x27;s &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; and have discovered that I can use a lesser amount of styling product which in turn keeps my hair &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; with more movement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS, the conditioner is decent</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>As needed, I will use the Volumetry Refresher spray, especially on bangs, but I find that it helps anywhere without drying your hair out like many dry shampoos tend to.  </li>
            <li>tried this shampoo with skepticism &amp; curiosity after reading about it in Allure magazine as a revolutionary new product.</li>
            <li>I know that the average person will not understand this, but those of us with impossibly fine hair do.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t stopped yet &amp; I feel that I&#x27;ve lost a significant amount of density that took several years to grow in (previously used Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing shampoo, which really did its job...</li>
            <li>I was completely unimpressed with the Volumetry line.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t personally care for it too much</li>
            <li>I did not get good volume, it left my hair dull and flat.</li>
            <li>Before, I was making the mistake of believing that every product line that volumized was appropriate for fine, limp hair---that is not true at all---many are designed for very dry, coarser hair that is exhibiting signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>I can no longer wear long hairstyles because the longer my hair grows (super-slowly) the more stringy &amp; limp it looks.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, very limp hair and have tried just about every shampoo and conditioner on the market at all price levels.</li>
            <li>If I use the blowdrier, the volume is insane, very light, full &amp; fluffy (I&#x27;m caucasian w/a bob hairstyle &amp; it&#x27;s otherwise hardto get my hair to curl naturally unless the conditions are perfect, which most of the time is impossible).</li>
            <li>I always expected shampoo to basically just clean the hair &amp; scalp &amp; any other claims</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m getting older (41 &amp; counting), my hair has thinned out measurably in both density &amp; quantity, &amp; the texture has become very dry &amp; wiry</li>
            <li>There are not very good instructions for many of the products in this line---I use the shampoo and conditioner as you would any other shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>but over time left my hair dry &amp; lifeless, till I tried this new product).</li>

            <li> The best shampoo for volumizing fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo actually does boost the volume of your hair. I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo from the Professionnel Expert Series, but it does the job for me. I understand there is a conditioner and treatment too. That can only makes things better. The fragrance is very nice. Not medicinal. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different volumizing hair products throughout the years. My hair isn&#x27;t thin, but it&#x27;s straight and lacks oomph! The Loreal Volumetry Shampoo is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used for giving my hair extra body. It has a nice smell and lathers really well. It&#x27;s pricey at $21, but totally worth it to me. I plan to check out the rest of the product line. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, very limp hair and have tried just about every shampoo and conditioner on the market at all price levels. As another review stated, I also like Pantene&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner for fine hair and always felt it was my best choice until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Volumetry based on an article in Allure magazine. I&#x27;ve used it for little over 2 months and admit that I have not seen an increase in &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; . I honestly don&#x27;t think there is a product available that can actually increase the volume of hair, although I remain ever hopeful that science will come to my rescue! That being said, I have definitely noticed a difference in my hair&#x27;s &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; and have discovered that I can use a lesser amount of styling product which in turn keeps my hair &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; with more movement. With the added texture, my hair is no longer &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34; {i.e. doesn&#x27;t lay flat against my scalp} which gives my hair the &amp;#34;appearance of more volume&amp;#34; which I&#x27;ll take any day over the &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So until the scientist come up with the miracle I seek, I plan on sticking with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Volumetry shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have found for fine hair</li>
            <li> I was completely unimpressed with the Volumetry line. I bought it because Allure raved about it but it failed to deliver in every respect. I did not get good volume, it left my hair dull and flat. If you want a good line that will give your hair shine and bounce, go get the anti aging Nexus line. It really works.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is okay, nothing special.  I don&#x27;t feel it does anything in particular for fine hair.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Seems to make my hair poofier without making it frizzy.  It is not consistent, however.  Sometimes it&#x27;s better than other shampoos, sometimes not as good.</li>
            <li> Great product for fine hair and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have tons of volume even with my fine hair! Smells great and use it with the Anti-gravity conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the most fantastic shampoo for everyone in my family, everyone&#x27;s hair has been transformed from think and limp to being thicker and fuller every time we use it! It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It is just an expensive shampoo, nothing else,,</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very happy with this much-touted shampoo. Allure raved about it as a real game changer for people with thin hair. It not only leaves my hair looking and feeling thinner, but my hair also looks clean and shiny. I will definitely buy this again. Good seller, too, with very fast shipping from overseas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a sacylic acid shampoo that didn&#x27;t take away all the body from my hair forever. This is perfect!</li>
            <li> Best results for fine hair than with any other volumizing product I have ever used. Worth the price. I have used this long enough to recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo from elsewhere online, but I did get the matching conditioner from Amazon. As I&#x27;m getting older (41 &amp; counting), my hair has thinned out measurably in both density &amp; quantity, &amp; the texture has become very dry &amp; wiry (it used to be bouncy, shiny &amp; flexible). I can no longer wear long hairstyles because the longer my hair grows (super-slowly) the more stringy &amp; limp it looks. No bounce or fullness. My hair isn&#x27;t what it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this shampoo with skepticism &amp; curiosity after reading about it in Allure magazine as a revolutionary new product. Sounded too good to be true, so I didn&#x27;t really expect anything, but was willing to risk the money just to see for myself what it would do, if anything. The first time I used it I was surprised to actually get real volume in my hair, more volume than I ever got from any styling product, let alone from shampoo! I always expected shampoo to basically just clean the hair &amp; scalp &amp; any other claims are just marketing gimmicks. Other volumizing shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have either done nothing at all or, worse yet, further dried out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is always quite dry now, I lather just once &amp; I don&#x27;t repeat, but I leave this shampoo lather in my hair for a couple of minutes to ensure maximum volumizing effect. This gives me better results than a quick wash &amp; rinse. I don&#x27;t know what &#x27;Hydralight&#x27; is but it really works on my hair. The volume I get is amazing - it makes me feel like I have 25-year-old hair again - full, fluffy, voluminous. Very good at camouflaging the thinned areas of my scalp at the crown &amp; temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I loved this shampoo from the very first use &amp; want to continue using it regularly (I shampoo once a week in the winter &amp; have started using it in Nov 2013). I always air-dry my hair &amp; I get voluminous curls in my lazy wavy hair. If I use the blowdrier, the volume is insane, very light, full &amp; fluffy (I&#x27;m caucasian w/a bob hairstyle &amp; it&#x27;s otherwise hardto get my hair to curl naturally unless the conditions are perfect, which most of the time is impossible). Whatever this shampoo does to plump up hair allows me to get great curls (with some frizz also).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one big concern is that since starting this shampoo, my hair has started shedding at an accelerated rate. It hasn&#x27;t stopped yet &amp; I feel that I&#x27;ve lost a significant amount of density that took several years to grow in (previously used Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing shampoo, which really did its job...but over time left my hair dry &amp; lifeless, till I tried this new product). My hair tends to grow in during summer &amp; shed a lot in autumn, so I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if it was a seasonal coincidence when I started this product. It&#x27;s mid-winter now &amp; I still shed more hair than I&#x27;d like, so IDK what to think. I&#x27;m just reluctant to give up this shampoo, I hope it&#x27;s not an adverse reaction to the ingredients in it that I might be having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volume I get from it is so amazing, I thought this was finally the end of my search... hoping the hair loss isn&#x27;t the trade-off that&#x27;s going to burst my happy bubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, the conditioner is decent but I don&#x27;t personally care for it too much, I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on it again. The shampoo does all the volumizing work on its own, no need for the conditioner, except it works well for detangling, but there are less expensive conditioners that can do that too. Conditioners don&#x27;t seem to make my hair any softer or moisturized anymore, so they don&#x27;t really serve a purpose for me. If you have a conditioner you already like, no need to buy the Volumetry conditioner. The shampoo does more volumizing than the conditioner, &amp; it&#x27;s my opinion that the conditioner slightly dampens the shampoo&#x27;s effect when used together than when the shampoo is used alone.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because it&#x27;s advertised as volumizing.  I used it twice and, although it does put volume in my hair, it&#x27;s also very drying.  I gave it to my daughter, who has oily hair and she loves it; even ordered a second bottle.</li>
            <li> This product did not produce any volume to my fine hair. I would not recommend it for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Just received this product. Used once. Cant tell just yet what the outcome will be. I also got the volumetry root spray for fine hair. i think it helps. I recommend this product and the  seller was very prompt with answering my questions.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, blonde hair that is color-treated.  Before I recently tried this product line, I was ready to just get extensions, I hated my hair that much.  Well, these products (and you must use everything in the product line to get good results) really do produce a real change in my hair&#x27;s texture and movement.  Before, I was making the mistake of believing that every product line that volumized was appropriate for fine, limp hair---that is not true at all---many are designed for very dry, coarser hair that is exhibiting signs of aging.  In this decade, there is a lack of good hair products for a fine hair type---many I used to use were sadly discontinued.  There are not very good instructions for many of the products in this line---I use the shampoo and conditioner as you would any other shampoo and conditioner and then I use the spray and masque after blotting the moisture from my hair (the masque is an excellent leave-in conditioner for my dry ends).  I also use another volumizing mousse made by L&#x27;Oreal (L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Hairstyle Boost It Volume Inject Mousse) and a root-lifter as my roots tend to go flat.  I dry my hair upside down and scrunch.  As a final step, I use the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced Hairstyle Boost It High Lift Creation Spray to set my style (mostly focusing on bangs and top.)  As needed, I will use the Volumetry Refresher spray, especially on bangs, but I find that it helps anywhere without drying your hair out like many dry shampoos tend to.  The one aspect of the Volumetry line that I&#x27;m still going to explore is the Serum Booster In-Salon Treatment.  Overall, I do not find that this line dries my hair out like many lines for fine, flat hair do and it has totally changed my hair for the better (and my perception of myself, which is the most important thing.)  Now I can talk about my hair like a normal woman---instead of saying &amp;#34;I hate everything about my hair and the way it looks and feels&amp;#34;, I can say, &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t have time to wash or style my hair today and as soon as I do that, it will look just fine.&amp;#34;!  I know that the average person will not understand this, but those of us with impossibly fine hair do.</li>
