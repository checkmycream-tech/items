            <li>Wonderful company.</li>
            <li>Best toothpaste esp.</li>
            <li>GREAT STUFF!</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD STUFF!</li>
            <li>Quality product very good results</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT.</li>
            <li>It WAS a great product before they screwed it up.  </li>
            <li>and this works great.</li>
            <li>Delivery was great.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this toothpaste is great.</li>
            <li>Biotene Toothpaste USED to be a great product</li>
            <li>All mare great.</li>
            <li>There is no problem and I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>you have successfully ruined a good product, while kicking your customers in the groin.</li>
            <li>Works well and at a good price.  </li>
            <li>It always amazes me when a company decides to save a nickel and ruin a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is a good complement and seems to help as well.</li>
            <li>: if you want the good formula, look for the box WITHOUT &#x27;improved pH&#x27;--That&#x27;s the good one.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working good.</li>
            <li>Amazon has best consistent price.</li>
            <li>But whchever it is, it works great leaving my mouth clean and moist for a good hour.</li>
            <li>but maybe it is a conspiracy to remove an effective product from the marketplace.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent toothpaste and fast shipping</li>
            <li>and I used it happily for many years, maintaining excellent oral hygiene throughout this period despite a dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product for sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li>It was wonderful - gentle, nice mild taste and it worked wonders on making my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth.</li>
            <li>They have done more just to reduce their costs to gain more profit.  </li>
            <li>This tells me that they might be doing this to whatever products they can for a better profit.  </li>
            <li>I have erosive lichen planis and brushing teeth was torture until I. found biotene, now I brush three times a day or more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they ruined such an excellent product.    </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing product as well.</li>
            <li>used this product for years - it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my mouth - this is an excellent product for people with mouth or gum issues!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of mouth washes, toothpastes, lozenges and even Tic Tac&#x27;s (which work surprisingly well for me, in certain situations).  </li>
            <li>I think it works okay for me, but now it&#x27;s much more strongly minty and cloyingly sweet.  </li>
            <li>This product is now more like the original formulation from years ago.  </li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s a good toothpaste, free of dyes, leaves my mouth tasting good, and does help dry mouth for a while.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:  </li>
            <li>I have Sjogrens and this toothpaste works great for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I had fur on my teeth, that they just didn&#x27;t feel clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer low foaming and the taste is no longer pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It has a good taste and it seems to help with the drymouth situation better than any other of the things that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nightmare come true.</li>
            <li>If you have any kind of burning sensation in your gums or sensitive teeth, this is the toothpaste for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite what the Biotene rep told her, the zylitol plus enzymes that they removed were crucial to the continued good condition of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Who needs SLS to dry their mouth, when it can be done a lot more effectively with lye?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Biotene, it really helps treat my dry mouth and tastes good</li>
            <li>I started suffering from dry mouth when I had chemotherapy, and was delighted when I discovered the Biotene products.</li>
            <li>It was very mild yet refreshing and low foaming.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the previous formula was, but find this very effective.</li>
            <li>This is smooth and gentle and works.</li>
            <li>tastes really fresh.  </li>
            <li>Timely shipping with fresh stock.</li>
            <li>Would be good to take on a vacation or other trip.</li>
            <li>Inc. I was very happy with its quality, due to the lack of detergents (SLS, chiefly), while the enzymes contributed positively to maintaining a clean mouth feel long after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: For alternatives maybe try &#x27;Tom&#x27;s of Maine Clean and Gentle tooth paste&#x27; or &#x27;Burts Bees&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Used to be a great toothpaste, but the formula change has made it pretty much like any other brand, except for the price.  </li>
            <li>products works great for me with a sensitive and dry mouth</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste for dry mouth and sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>whether original formula or new.  </li>
            <li>When Laclede first brought Biotene to the market, it sported the words &amp;#34;Stops Bleeding Gums&amp;#34; on the package.</li>
            <li>My mom with cancer found this much better than regular toothpaste when she had sores from chemo.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted,.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it almost instantly.</li>
            <li>They really do work to keep my mouth from feeling like a piece of flannel just out of the dryer!</li>
            <li>I originally bought Biotene toothpaste on the suggestion of my dentist, because I have a dry mouth, and because it is free of dyes.  </li>
            <li>In fact makes my gums swell and ache pretty much immediately.</li>
            <li>it has a much milder flavor than most traditional toothpastes which I really like.  </li>
            <li>And worth the price, which the new formula isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Glad to see that I&#x27;m not the ONLY one who hates the new Biotene.  </li>
            <li>(most dry mouth products don&#x27;t!).</li>
            <li>Whoever is the product manager, thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I get the impression that the company really doesn&#x27;t care, whether it helps or not.</li>
            <li>Our whole family switched to Biotene a couple years ago after Dad brought it home from the dentist for himself.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Biotene is gentle on irritated mouth tissue caused by use of inhalers for COPD.  </li>
            <li>Thanks in advance.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>for me, it&#x27;s never kept my mouth wet more than an hour or two,</li>
            <li>I have one last tube of the original Biotene I have been rationing out for a month</li>
            <li>Due to medications that I must take and have been taking for many years, I now have &amp;#34;drymouth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;NEW Improved pH Balance&amp;#34; Biotene is an entirely different product from original Biotene.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Biotene products, but find this one one of the most helpful.  </li>
            <li>But why won&#x27;t the manufacturers go back to the original enzyme-active formula?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad I am not the only one who noticed that the new formula has completely destroyed Biotene.</li>
            <li>I did not use it yet because I am on vacation, but I can see the high quality.</li>
            <li>I have been in &amp; out of chemotherapy for the past eight years, and Biotene toothpaste minimizes the dry mouth side effects very nicely.  </li>
            <li>For years original Biotene helped my dry mouth issues, New Biotene does not.</li>
            <li>This stuff is better than regular toothpaste because there are no detergents like SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate), which is why I keep buying it, but it&#x27;s still pretty harsh on the mouth.</li>
            <li>I would rather brush my teeth with dog $#|+ than use this new formulation.  </li>
            <li>I think that the new formula takes the enamel off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought a new tube</li>
            <li>This is not the fault of the seller but of the company making the new improved product.</li>
            <li>Less fizz and &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34;.  Very mild.</li>
            <li>I have used this item for a couple of years and find it makes a tremendous difference with prevention of dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>New mouthwash was burning my tongue and after a week of using it, some of my teeth started to hurt and became very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Now the sores have returned and my teeth have become very sensitive.</li>
            <li>When it had enzymes it was worth the extra money, and a unique product, sadly Glaxo purchased the company and is really just selling the brand name filled with an inferior toothpaste</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Biotene toothpaste for many years, and have credited it (plus having my teeth cleaned 4 times a year) for having all of my teeth plus very few cavities at age</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen all the postings about the new and old formulas</li>
            <li>Glaxo Smith Kline bought the product from Laclede, and removed the ensyme system that Laclede developed and brought to this world.</li>
            <li>Nope, it isn&#x27;t the toothbrush: I use a Sonicare and change the brush head frequently.</li>
            <li>bought out the inventory of the old formula in our hometown grocery.</li>
            <li>For people with over sensitive skin around the mouth.</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li>The old formula get&#x27;s five star&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It is really just like a conventional sudsy toothpaste, only more (much more) expensive.  </li>
            <li>look at this as some new management that decided to save money by totally cheapening the formula then marketing it as new and improved.</li>
            <li>I like the Fresh Mint flavor and haven&#x27;t tried their other</li>
            <li>It taste mild, doesn&#x27;t burn, foams less.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it if you have the same issue as me.</li>
            <li>Really helps if you have dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this toothpaste for two weeks, but I find it to help very much with my dry mouth problems (which are severe).  </li>
            <li>I decided to send an email to Biotene which is owned by GlasoSmithKline to let them know, how shameful it is that the new formulation doesn&#x27;t help sensitive dry mouth.</li>
            <li>In typical misleading fashion the company slaps a ‘new and improved’ label on the front of an otherwise identical packaging to try and cover themselves legally.  </li>
            <li>Apparently they&#x27;ve reformulated it again.  </li>
            <li>The old Biotene actually contained healing enzymes.  </li>
            <li>No particular change in foods made a difference, although I noticed things high in citric acid aggravated it.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have said, the previous formula was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several years and noticed a MAJOR reduction in mouth ulcers, so I believe the SLS ingredient is what was causing my problem.  </li>
            <li>The New product is so completely different that it is unfair and deceptive for the manufacturer to market New Biotene in the same trade dress as the original product.</li>
            <li>Far from protecting a dry mouth, it is almost guaranteed to irritate it.  </li>
            <li>Now they have completely reformulated the product while trying to pass it off as a ‘dry mouth’ product, which it no longer is.  </li>
            <li>I thought, it was me rather the new formulation for awhile until I found that other users got the same issues when I checked the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new product is just another  toothpaste and therefore useless for its original intended purpose.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is better than regular toothpaste because there are no detergents like SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate), which is why I keep buying it, but it&#x27;s still pretty harsh on the mouth.</li>
            <li> I would rather brush my teeth with dog $#|+ than use this new formulation.  </li>
            <li> I think that the new formula takes the enamel off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought a new tube</li>
            <li> This is not the fault of the seller but of the company making the new improved product.</li>
            <li> Less fizz and &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34;.  Very mild.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for a couple of years and find it makes a tremendous difference with prevention of dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> New mouthwash was burning my tongue and after a week of using it, some of my teeth started to hurt and became very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Now the sores have returned and my teeth have become very sensitive.</li>
            <li> When it had enzymes it was worth the extra money, and a unique product, sadly Glaxo purchased the company and is really just selling the brand name filled with an inferior toothpaste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Biotene toothpaste for many years, and have credited it (plus having my teeth cleaned 4 times a year) for having all of my teeth plus very few cavities at age</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen all the postings about the new and old formulas</li>
            <li> Glaxo Smith Kline bought the product from Laclede, and removed the ensyme system that Laclede developed and brought to this world.</li>
            <li> Nope, it isn&#x27;t the toothbrush: I use a Sonicare and change the brush head frequently.</li>
            <li> bought out the inventory of the old formula in our hometown grocery.</li>
            <li> For people with over sensitive skin around the mouth.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li> The old formula get&#x27;s five star&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It is really just like a conventional sudsy toothpaste, only more (much more) expensive.  </li>
            <li> look at this as some new management that decided to save money by totally cheapening the formula then marketing it as new and improved.</li>
            <li> I like the Fresh Mint flavor and haven&#x27;t tried their other</li>
            <li> It taste mild, doesn&#x27;t burn, foams less.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it if you have the same issue as me.</li>
            <li> Really helps if you have dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this toothpaste for two weeks, but I find it to help very much with my dry mouth problems (which are severe).  </li>
            <li> I decided to send an email to Biotene which is owned by GlasoSmithKline to let them know, how shameful it is that the new formulation doesn&#x27;t help sensitive dry mouth.</li>
            <li> In typical misleading fashion the company slaps a ‘new and improved’ label on the front of an otherwise identical packaging to try and cover themselves legally.  </li>
            <li> Apparently they&#x27;ve reformulated it again.  </li>
            <li> The old Biotene actually contained healing enzymes.  </li>
            <li> No particular change in foods made a difference, although I noticed things high in citric acid aggravated it.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, the previous formula was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years and noticed a MAJOR reduction in mouth ulcers, so I believe the SLS ingredient is what was causing my problem.  </li>
            <li> The New product is so completely different that it is unfair and deceptive for the manufacturer to market New Biotene in the same trade dress as the original product.</li>
            <li> Far from protecting a dry mouth, it is almost guaranteed to irritate it.  </li>
            <li> Now they have completely reformulated the product while trying to pass it off as a ‘dry mouth’ product, which it no longer is.  </li>
            <li> I thought, it was me rather the new formulation for awhile until I found that other users got the same issues when I checked the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new product is just another  toothpaste and therefore useless for its original intended purpose.  </li>
            <li> Even the new &amp;#34;Gentle Mint&amp;#34; is harsh tasting and foamy.  </li>
            <li> This is it folks the only toothpaste that works for those of us on medications causing dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I do not suffer dry mouth or lose skin off my lips as with regular toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this daily and believe it does help to avoid dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I just went to open a new tube, read the label in detail, and discovered that there is no more claim that the toothpaste works to reduce dry mouth syndrome.</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars for New Formula Biotene by the money hungry Glaxo big pharma I would.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is less than 1/3 of same item locally.  </li>
            <li> I am not surprised that the store dropped this toothpaste, since users have undoubtedly counted on the dry mouth treatment in selecting this</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I can use that doesn&#x27;t make my mouth sting due to medicines.  </li>
            <li> Sjogrens causes extremely dry mouth and all the others burn.</li>
            <li> I have used  Biotene toothpaste for years as part of a treatment for dry mouth resulting from prescription medications which cause dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I suspect that the reason that they have dropped carrying Biotene toothpaste is that the Pharmacy realized that the product formula no longer treats dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have used the Biotene mouthwash for years because of my dry mouth problems.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference with my dry mouth though.</li>
            <li> My dry mouth is the result of an autoimmune disorder, Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, plus meds, chemo, and age.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth</li>
            <li> One does not start the day with a dry mouth just from brushing.</li>
            <li> I use to help with dry mouth  </li>
            <li> I was doing mints al day to counteract dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> this is for a dry mouth person.  </li>
            <li> This will not help you if you truly have dry mouth</li>
            <li> Brushing with this twice a day causes me to all but forget about dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I ordered A Biotene dry mouth toothpaste</li>
            <li> the new feel and texture is not nearly as nice as it used to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helping me with my dry mouth!</li>
            <li> my dental hygienist asked what I was doing different -- that the past two cleanings have been difficult because of a huge increase in the amount of tartar that was collecting on and below the gumline.  </li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste because I have a dry mouth due to the medication I am using.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> This product seems exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, not nearly as good as the old biotene with the enzymes.  </li>
            <li> other flavors of biotene don&#x27;t feel minty, this one is.</li>
            <li> A chronic dryness due to medication has now ended.</li>
            <li> through other reviews I now see that I was correct and they have been bought out by a company that has destroyed Biotene as we used to know it.</li>
            <li> That is what I found in reviews on other websites and I will try them both.</li>
            <li> I was talking about the new formulation which is US made and sold all over the world and customers are not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether the decision to remove the ensyme system was a callous or monumentally stupid decision, but whatever the case, BIOTENE now will do no more good for the dry mouth sufferer than Crest.</li>
            <li> They removed some beneficial ingredients and replaced them with way less quality.</li>
            <li> plan on calling the manufacturer tomorrow to complain about this implicit, hidden misrepresentation!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure which I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li> In order to comply with regulatory restrictions, we are unable to address inquiries from outside the boundaries of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> of this is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Plus I had trouble with toothpaste burning my tongue, this DOESN&#x27;T!</li>
            <li> Disappointed because the tube doesn&#x27;t contain much product.</li>
            <li> It leaves a horrible taste that lasts a LONG TIME, makes my gums bleed, and I avoid brushing my teeth as much as I used to...not to mention the foaming at the mouth and gagging every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are totally different and they have added that horrible saccharin which many people cannot tolerate and leaves a bad aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> At least it still doesn&#x27;t have that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they would at least give out coupons once in awhile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of their blatant lack of decency I will no longer buy this toothpaste nor any other product in the Biotene line.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??&lt;br /&gt;HINT</li>
            <li> Wish it was (a lot) less expensive.</li>
            <li> I also told her that the change to saccharine (from xylitol) as a sweetener left a bad taste in my mouth that rinsing with water won&#x27;t remove.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It sucks!  </li>
            <li> It tastes like caustic chemicals.  </li>
            <li> The enzymes are gone, replaced by lye (NaOH, caustic soda, sodium hydroxide) - because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than the crappiest toothpaste on the bottom shelves of grocery stores, at three times the price.</li>
            <li> down side is that it is very expensive considering the tube size.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, somewhere around the end of 2013 and start of 2014, GlaxoKlineSmith changed the formula, and new version is terrible.  </li>
            <li> but instead I got a regular Biotene Toothpaste, not what I wanted and needed, very disappointed</li>
            <li> but it is too expensive</li>
            <li> It is cruel and unethical to go on promoting this toothpaste as if nothing had changed and therefore deceiving consumers who have used it specifically for painful medical disorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite a disappointing response...</li>
            <li> Helps prevent cold sores.</li>
            <li> amount of menthol was increased, I suppose to numb the mouth from feeling the harshness of lye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :{ I know it sounds crazy</li>
            <li> Made my mouth sore and painful.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes that can really be annoying and even painful at times.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  </li>
            <li> they added Saccharin and Sucralose and it is just unacceptably awful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible for my problem.</li>
            <li> This formula is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They changed the flavor.  I think it works okay for me, but now it&#x27;s much more strongly minty and cloyingly sweet.  Couldn&#x27;t they have left well enough alone, damnit.</li>
            <li> I would rather brush my teeth with dog $#|+ than use this new formulation.  Screw you GSK!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth.</li>
            <li> At last. I have looked for ages for a toothpaste that does not damage and irritate my throat.</li>
            <li> Glaxo Smith Kline changed the Biotene ingredients...it not longer works they way it should.  They removed some beneficial ingredients and replaced them with way less quality. Would your believe they removed a desirable sweetener that also has oral benefits and replaced it with Saccharine ( yes the cancer in laboratory rats ingredient) They have done more just to reduce their costs to gain more profit.  I also noticed the played with the ingredients in Tums as well.  This tells me that they might be doing this to whatever products they can for a better profit.  I cannot believe a company that makes products to aid us with our health has the nerve to cheat us just for money.  I would boycott anything with the Glaxo Smith Kline affiliation....This is how I feel.  These people need to be hurt where it hurts most...financially. Replace the products you need with another brand.  I had to give them one star because that is the minimum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED THIS FOR YEARS. WORKS GREAT.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I can use that doesn&#x27;t make my mouth sting due to medicines.  I&#x27;ve seen all the postings about the new and old formulas and I&#x27;m not sure which I&#x27;m using.  But whchever it is, it works great leaving my mouth clean and moist for a good hour.</li>
            <li> Works well and at a good price.  Convenient getting it online, too!</li>
            <li> only toothpaste I can use.</li>
            <li> I have sjogrens, an autoinmune problem. It&#x27;s the only toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth. Sjogrens causes extremely dry mouth and all the others burn.</li>
            <li> tastes really fresh.  makes mouth feel clean/fresh.  other flavors of biotene don&#x27;t feel minty, this one is.</li>
            <li> this is the cheapest price I could find this toothpaste, what a buy!</li>
            <li> As others have stated, not nearly as good as the old biotene with the enzymes.  This stuff is better than regular toothpaste because there are no detergents like SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate), which is why I keep buying it, but it&#x27;s still pretty harsh on the mouth.</li>
            <li> When Laclede first brought Biotene to the market, it sported the words &amp;#34;Stops Bleeding Gums&amp;#34; on the package. It was a miraculous medical breakthrough. It changed life for me but I always feared the day it would no longer be available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That day has come. Glaxo Smith Kline bought the product from Laclede, and removed the ensyme system that Laclede developed and brought to this world. I&#x27;m not sure whether the decision to remove the ensyme system was a callous or monumentally stupid decision, but whatever the case, BIOTENE now will do no more good for the dry mouth sufferer than Crest. In fact it tastes just like Crest now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried their PBF mouthwash noting the ensymes were listed on the ingredients, but no, it doesn&#x27;t work either. In fact makes my gums swell and ache pretty much immediately. I have one last tube of the original Biotene I have been rationing out for a month (I bought every tube I could find once I noticed the change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums are starting to bleed again. It&#x27;s a nightmare come true. Whoever is the product manager, thanks a lot. I&#x27;m in constant pain now.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> A chronic dryness due to medication has now ended. I also use the Biotene mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> products works great for me with a sensitive and dry mouth</li>
            <li> Hand to order for dry-mouth problems.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogrens and this toothpaste works great for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> If you have any kind of burning sensation in your gums or sensitive teeth, this is the toothpaste for you.</li>
            <li> I have used  Biotene toothpaste for years as part of a treatment for dry mouth resulting from prescription medications which cause dry mouth. I just went to open a new tube, read the label in detail, and discovered that there is no more claim that the toothpaste works to reduce dry mouth syndrome. I went to a nearby pharmacy and discovered that they have discontinued carrying Biotene toothpaste I suspect that the reason that they have dropped carrying Biotene toothpaste is that the Pharmacy realized that the product formula no longer treats dry mouth. I am not surprised that the store dropped this toothpaste, since users have undoubtedly counted on the dry mouth treatment in selecting this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on calling the manufacturer tomorrow to complain about this implicit, hidden misrepresentation!</li>
            <li> Wonderful company. I have erosive lichen planis and brushing teeth was torture until I. found biotene, now I brush three times a day or more.</li>
            <li> Glad to see that I&#x27;m not the ONLY one who hates the new Biotene.  I&#x27;ve bought it twice this year and am giving up on it forever as of now, as I&#x27;m running out of my last tube of it.  It sucks!  It leaves a horrible taste that lasts a LONG TIME, makes my gums bleed, and I avoid brushing my teeth as much as I used to...not to mention the foaming at the mouth and gagging every time I use it.  It WAS a great product before they screwed it up.  Guess they don&#x27;t believe the saying that I&#x27;ve known for decades, &amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.&amp;#34;  They didn&#x27;t FIX it; all they did was ruin it!  Will NEVER buy it again.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I had problems with ulcers inside my mouth.  No particular change in foods made a difference, although I noticed things high in citric acid aggravated it.  My dentist recommended I try this because it does NOT have the foaming agent called Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS).  I have been using this for several years and noticed a MAJOR reduction in mouth ulcers, so I believe the SLS ingredient is what was causing my problem.  They recently reformulated it which I think improved it in my opinion.  I HIGHLY recommend it if you have the same issue as me.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it because it has no Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, which gives him canker sores.  At least it still doesn&#x27;t have that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they added Saccharin and Sucralose and it is just unacceptably awful.  How can they continue to advertise &amp;#34;mild flavor&amp;#34;?  Looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I left this same review (Below) on the Biotene website. It always amazes me when a company decides to save a nickel and ruin a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Formula &#x3D; The end of Biotene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I am not the only one who noticed that the new formula has completely destroyed Biotene. I used to use it to keep canker sores away. Now the sores have returned and my teeth have become very sensitive. I think that the new formula takes the enamel off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the new feel and texture is not nearly as nice as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIOTENE SUCKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look at this as some new management that decided to save money by totally cheapening the formula then marketing it as new and improved. Well congratulations! you have successfully ruined a good product, while kicking your customers in the groin. I used to recommend Biotene to friends but I can no longer do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Reading through other reviews I now see that I was correct and they have been bought out by a company that has destroyed Biotene as we used to know it. :{ I know it sounds crazy but maybe it is a conspiracy to remove an effective product from the marketplace.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: For alternatives maybe try &#x27;Tom&#x27;s of Maine Clean and Gentle tooth paste&#x27; or &#x27;Burts Bees&#x27;. That is what I found in reviews on other websites and I will try them both.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I will use.  My dental hygienist recommended it, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Australia and I&#x27;ve used Biotene products (imported from the US) for 12 years ever since I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve got Sjogren&#x27;s. Biotene products have helped until they changed the formula. I only found that they&#x27;ve changed the formula 2 weeks ago. New mouthwash was burning my tongue and after a week of using it, some of my teeth started to hurt and became very sensitive. I thought, it was me rather the new formulation for awhile until I found that other users got the same issues when I checked the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to send an email to Biotene which is owned by GlasoSmithKline to let them know, how shameful it is that the new formulation doesn&#x27;t help sensitive dry mouth. Here&#x27;s the reply I&#x27;ve got from the company;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear,&lt;br /&gt;We have received your e-mail on our Biotène® website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have reached the United States division of GlaxoSmithKline. In order to comply with regulatory restrictions, we are unable to address inquiries from outside the boundaries of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have marketing rights for our products only in the U.S. We would suggest that you speak to your physician.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara&lt;br /&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare&lt;br /&gt;Case # 4265840&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite a disappointing response...Obviously, they&#x27;re not getting it. I wasn&#x27;t talking about marketing or refunds. I was talking about the new formulation which is US made and sold all over the world and customers are not happy with it. I get the impression that the company really doesn&#x27;t care, whether it helps or not. Maybe all they care is cheaper manufacturing costs now. All we can do is that NOT buying their products. I&#x27;ve found that Oral Seven (in Australia) products have identical ingredients. So I&#x27;m switching. Bye bye Biotine...</li>
            <li> I have used the Biotene mouthwash for years because of my dry mouth problems.  The toothpaste is a good complement and seems to help as well.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  The product I received from Amazon is unusable.  It tastes like caustic chemicals.  I cannot bear to brush my teeth with it; it&#x27;s going in the garbage.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I have been in &amp; out of chemotherapy for the past eight years, and Biotene toothpaste minimizes the dry mouth side effects very nicely.  I like the texture &amp; taste well enough that I continue to use it between chemo sessions, as well.</li>
            <li> it has a much milder flavor than most traditional toothpastes which I really like.  I have not noticed any difference with my dry mouth though.</li>
            <li> My dry mouth is the result of an autoimmune disorder, Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, plus meds, chemo, and age.  I&#x27;ve used Biotene toothpaste for many years, and have credited it (plus having my teeth cleaned 4 times a year) for having all of my teeth plus very few cavities at age 75.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week when I went to have my teeth cleaned my dental hygienist asked what I was doing different -- that the past two cleanings have been difficult because of a huge increase in the amount of tartar that was collecting on and below the gumline.  I told her that I was now using the &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; Biotene which always left me with the feeling I had fur on my teeth, that they just didn&#x27;t feel clean after brushing.  I also told her that the change to saccharine (from xylitol) as a sweetener left a bad taste in my mouth that rinsing with water won&#x27;t remove.&lt;br /&gt;I came home and threw the rest of the &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; tube out and am searching for a replacement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite what the Biotene rep told her, the zylitol plus enzymes that they removed were crucial to the continued good condition of my mouth.  Nope, it isn&#x27;t the toothbrush: I use a Sonicare and change the brush head frequently.</li>
            <li> I use nothing but Biotene....personal preference...it works for me.</li>
            <li> Used to be a great toothpaste, but the formula change has made it pretty much like any other brand, except for the price.  When it had enzymes it was worth the extra money, and a unique product, sadly Glaxo purchased the company and is really just selling the brand name filled with an inferior toothpaste</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li> I search everywhere for this toothpaste and no one carries it. I suffer from dry mouth and this works great.</li>
            <li> My mom with cancer found this much better than regular toothpaste when she had sores from chemo.</li>
            <li> Our whole family switched to Biotene a couple years ago after Dad brought it home from the dentist for himself. Like other reviewers have said, the previous formula was fantastic. It was very mild yet refreshing and low foaming. Now, the flavor zings your mouth so you can&#x27;t taste anything for hours afterward, and you feel like a rabid dog while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve bought out the inventory of the old formula in our hometown grocery. Even the new &amp;#34;Gentle Mint&amp;#34; is harsh tasting and foamy.  Seriously, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??&lt;br /&gt;HINT: if you want the good formula, look for the box WITHOUT &#x27;improved pH&#x27;--That&#x27;s the good one.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste esp. For people with over sensitive skin around the mouth.</li>
            <li> If I were writing this 2 weeks ago, I would have given it 5 stars.  It was wonderful - gentle, nice mild taste and it worked wonders on making my gums healthy.  I&#x27;ve used it for almost five years and recommended it to all my friends.  I just bought a new tube and it says they improved the ph balance.  It&#x27;s no longer low foaming and the taste is no longer pleasant.  As a consumer, I think they&#x27;ve made a BIG MISTAKE.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for dry mouth and sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive mouth. Or inner lining to your mouth, tongue and gums, this is the toothpaste for you. Everything else is loaded with all sorts of chemicals. This is smooth and gentle and works.</li>
            <li> [...]     The negative reviews of the shocked formerly very happy customers are spot on the money.  Biotene was perfect and it now foams, burns, lingering horrid taste and worst of all it simply does not work like it used to.  I can&#x27;t believe they ruined such an excellent product.    If you want them to change it back, tell them! [...]</li>
            <li> Delivery was great. Good product. Exactly what I wanted,.</li>
            <li> Due to medications that I must take and have been taking for many years, I now have &amp;#34;drymouth&amp;#34;.  Sometimes that can really be annoying and even painful at times. I&#x27;ve tried a number of mouth washes, toothpastes, lozenges and even Tic Tac&#x27;s (which work surprisingly well for me, in certain situations).  Finally I came across Biotene and I fell in love with it almost instantly. It has a good taste and it seems to help with the drymouth situation better than any other of the things that I&#x27;ve tried.  I like the Fresh Mint flavor and haven&#x27;t tried their other flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper, for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste because I have a dry mouth due to the medication I am using.  It left my teeth feeling as if I hadn&#x27;t brushed them.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is less than 1/3 of same item locally.  I have used this item for a couple of years and find it makes a tremendous difference with prevention of dry mouth.  One does not start the day with a dry mouth just from brushing.</li>
            <li> Helps prevent cold sores. Wish it was (a lot) less expensive. And that I could buy it locally instead of having to order it.</li>
            <li> I love Biotene, it really helps treat my dry mouth and tastes good (most dry mouth products don&#x27;t!).</li>
            <li> Five stars for the product but it is too expensive so it gets a three. This is it folks the only toothpaste that works for those of us on medications causing dry mouth. I wish they would at least give out coupons once in awhile. Amazon has best consistent price.</li>
            <li> I use to help with dry mouth  Seems to help</li>
            <li> switched to this tooth paste and will never go back. thanks</li>
            <li> I wanted the gel type. Otherwise this toothpaste is great.</li>
            <li> Apparently they&#x27;ve reformulated it again.  This product is now more like the original formulation from years ago.  Less fizz and &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34;.  Very mild.</li>
            <li> Really helps if you have dry mouth.  Its not just a gimmick.  I was doing mints al day to counteract dry mouth.  Between this and  the mouth waste, its no longer much of an issue</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> I second the review by Cole K of 2/3/14. The &amp;#34;NEW Improved pH Balance&amp;#34; Biotene is an entirely different product from original Biotene. The New product is so completely different that it is unfair and deceptive for the manufacturer to market New Biotene in the same trade dress as the original product. Save your money, if you want a foaming fluoride toothpaste buy Crest or something similar. For years original Biotene helped my dry mouth issues, New Biotene does not.</li>
            <li> The product works as claimed.  I do not suffer dry mouth or lose skin off my lips as with regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side is that it is very expensive considering the tube size.</li>
            <li> this is for a dry mouth person.  It taste mild, doesn&#x27;t burn, foams less.</li>
            <li> I started suffering from dry mouth when I had chemotherapy, and was delighted when I discovered the Biotene products. They really do work to keep my mouth from feeling like a piece of flannel just out of the dryer!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and believe it does help to avoid dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  This will not help you if you truly have dry mouth/sjogren&#x27;s.  Made my mouth sore and painful.  Gums started bleeding and receding. The old formula get&#x27;s five star&#x27;s.  If I could give negative stars for New Formula Biotene by the money hungry Glaxo big pharma I would.</li>
            <li> I used Biotene toothpaste for over ten years. It was the only brand I could tolerate. It didn&#x27;t sting like all the others. Changed formula changed that. It&#x27;s terrible for my problem.</li>
            <li> This formula is awful. Can&#x27;t stand it in my mouth.  This is not the fault of the seller but of the company making the new improved product.</li>
            <li> changed product - don&#x27;t like taste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this toothpaste for two weeks, but I find it to help very much with my dry mouth problems (which are severe).  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.  I&#x27;ve used other Biotene products, but find this one one of the most helpful.  Brushing with this twice a day causes me to all but forget about dry mouth.  I don&#x27;t know what the previous formula was, but find this very effective.</li>
            <li> Biotene is gentle on irritated mouth tissue caused by use of inhalers for COPD.  It&#x27;s a refreshing product as well.</li>
            <li> Biotene Toothpaste USED to be a great product and I used it happily for many years, maintaining excellent oral hygiene throughout this period despite a dry mouth.  HOWEVER, somewhere around the end of 2013 and start of 2014, GlaxoKlineSmith changed the formula, and new version is terrible.  Far from protecting a dry mouth, it is almost guaranteed to irritate it.  It is really just like a conventional sudsy toothpaste, only more (much more) expensive.  If you have to use it, the only viable formula now is &amp;#34;Gentle Mint&amp;#34;.  But why won&#x27;t the manufacturers go back to the original enzyme-active formula?  It was terrific!  And worth the price, which the new formula isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I used Biotene for about five years, since it was still produced by Laclede, Inc. I was very happy with its quality, due to the lack of detergents (SLS, chiefly), while the enzymes contributed positively to maintaining a clean mouth feel long after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this is a thing of the past. The enzymes are gone, replaced by lye (NaOH, caustic soda, sodium hydroxide) - because it&#x27;s cheaper. Who needs SLS to dry their mouth, when it can be done a lot more effectively with lye?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of menthol was increased, I suppose to numb the mouth from feeling the harshness of lye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: avoid at all costs. It&#x27;s worse than the crappiest toothpaste on the bottom shelves of grocery stores, at three times the price.</li>
            <li> I had been using Biotene toothpaste for over ten years for dry/sensitive mouth issues and it worked wonders.  Now they have completely reformulated the product while trying to pass it off as a ‘dry mouth’ product, which it no longer is.  The old Biotene actually contained healing enzymes.  This new product is just another  toothpaste and therefore useless for its original intended purpose.  The ingredients are totally different and they have added that horrible saccharin which many people cannot tolerate and leaves a bad aftertaste.  It is cruel and unethical to go on promoting this toothpaste as if nothing had changed and therefore deceiving consumers who have used it specifically for painful medical disorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of their blatant lack of decency I will no longer buy this toothpaste nor any other product in the Biotene line.  Note:  In typical misleading fashion the company slaps a ‘new and improved’ label on the front of an otherwise identical packaging to try and cover themselves legally.  Be assured the toothpaste is not improved, it is not even the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows of an acceptable alternative please post their findings.  Thanks in advance.</li>
            <li> All mare great. Thank you for your timeliness in sending them to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste...what can you say about it?</li>
            <li> This product seems exactly as I expected. There is no problem and I am happy with this purchase. I did not use it yet because I am on vacation, but I can see the high quality.</li>
            <li> Timely shipping with fresh stock.</li>
            <li> gritty tasting ,, doesnt seem to work</li>
            <li> used this product for years - it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my mouth - this is an excellent product for people with mouth or gum issues!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Quality product very good results</li>
            <li> I ordered A Biotene dry mouth toothpaste but instead I got a regular Biotene Toothpaste, not what I wanted and needed, very disappointed</li>
            <li> Disappointed because the tube doesn&#x27;t contain much product. Would be good to take on a vacation or other trip.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was, this is the .7 oz. not the big tube.  Rip off and deceiving in description.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF! My medicine gives me &amp;#34;cotton mouth&amp;#34; and I thought I would give this a try! VERY GOOD STUFF! Plus I had trouble with toothpaste burning my tongue, this DOESN&#x27;T! I have bought 3 tubes on line already because I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. Seems to be working good. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought Biotene toothpaste on the suggestion of my dentist, because I have a dry mouth, and because it is free of dyes.  for me, it&#x27;s never kept my mouth wet more than an hour or two, whether original formula or new.  but I give it 4 * because it&#x27;s a good toothpaste, free of dyes, leaves my mouth tasting good, and does help dry mouth for a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they are talking about but I like the the paste and it&#x27;s helping me with my dry mouth! I hope they bring it back to amazon !</li>
