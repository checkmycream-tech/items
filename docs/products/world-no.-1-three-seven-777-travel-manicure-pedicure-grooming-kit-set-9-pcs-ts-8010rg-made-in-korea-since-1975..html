            <li>/&gt;This was a gift for my husband and he is very pleased with the quality of manufacture, the appearance, and the precision results he gets from using the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>wanted to give them a set that they could use for many years.&lt;br /&gt;The case and all of the implements are very nicely made.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I have!</li>
            <li>Out of desperation, I bought this product and I am beyond thrilled.  </li>
            <li>It is supper nice.</li>
            <li>He liked it so well</li>
            <li>The product is nice.</li>
            <li>I know a company would think that the items are self-explanatory but it would have been nice to have some explanation to go with the product.</li>
            <li>It is a nice set.  </li>
            <li>Nice case.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice set of manicure pedicure grooming kit, this is it.</li>
            <li>Would be nice to have a sheet that told you what they were for</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my new set.</li>
            <li>This set came quickly and was priced really great.</li>
            <li>Too good to be true set.</li>
            <li>the pieces are well built, very comfortable to hold and get the job done perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tools in this manicure kit feel very cheap.</li>
            <li>But its quality appear to be very high, it is beautiful and the case is very nice and smaller than it looks in the photo which is good IMO.</li>
            <li>then I discovered them here on Amazon and live is good again!</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and love it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The case is a nice touch and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all either.</li>
            <li>The gold is to over the top for my taste.  </li>
            <li>l love it</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SET OF MANICURE INSTRUMENTS.  </li>
            <li>Better than pictured.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I considered getting one of Seki&#x27;s $100+ sets, but glad I got this instead.</li>
            <li>to keep the product.&lt;br /&gt;I, for sure, will never use their product anymore.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say too much more.</li>
            <li>after many throw away sets we tried this one.</li>
            <li>Probably not the best for travelling, but goid or local mani/pedis.</li>
            <li>He uses it daily and says it is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>I bought it for my husband for Fathers day and we aren&#x27;t sure what some of the &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; are for&lt;br /&gt;Great case</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s much better quality out there</li>
            <li>The nailtrimmers and scissors are okay though.</li>
            <li>The tools are quality stainless steel stored in an attractive, sturdy metal case.  </li>
            <li>thought I was buying a better quality.</li>
            <li>Now I need to learn more (probably via YouTube or the like)</li>
            <li>The hard case is very nice and the number of tools is excellent.</li>
            <li>but the toe &amp; finger nail clippers come with a sliding metal sleeve that catches most (but not all) of your clipped nails for easy disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the nail clippers are fine, just need more polish.</li>
            <li>was a huge surprise.&lt;br /&gt;The case is sturdy and all the items are top notch</li>
            <li>we loved it so much that we bought a set for the inlaws</li>
            <li>No instructions, which would be handy to explain how to use some of the contents the right way.</li>
            <li>But other than that this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The uniformly strong reviews here at Amazon.com persuaded me to take a chance, though.</li>
            <li>Tools are very sharp and crafted with excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Cuts fine.</li>
            <li>Delivered on time and securely wrapped.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a cheap set.  </li>
            <li>This product is very useful.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed this time.</li>
            <li>Picture this, you are married or living with someone for many years (22 for me).</li>
            <li>Today is April 9, one day out of AMAZON&#x27;S returns and refunds policy for free returns and a full refund or replacement.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>After trying out several manicure kits that always seem to have cheap and flimsy tools, I was delighted to find this one.</li>
            <li>product is smaller than it appears in the pictures and is very sleek and attractive.</li>
            <li>Everything, including such things as the case latch and hinges, feels and looks solid and dense, but it&#x27;s marvelously compact.</li>
            <li>We both tried out most of the tools and I can say they are of high quality.</li>
            <li>, I bought this latest one for a high school graduate.  </li>
            <li>plan to upgrade the most used items, but really appreciate having a great small case to secure everything.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is the tweezers aren&#x27;t as nice as my Revlon ones, but they still work great!</li>
            <li>my very first attempt with these tools</li>
            <li>got it for my wife and she stopped talking to me; now she just does her nails - but seriously, the quality is great and the case really is quite nice -</li>
            <li>Maybe my set was newer and the materials quality has diminished significantly since the positive reviews were published.</li>
            <li>No expert in manicure sets because I am a male, but this set of grooming tools are amazing.</li>
            <li>Product is great but the carrying case is a bit heavy.  </li>
            <li>Useful and looks</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, no matter how many clippers or files, etc., I keep beside or near the bathtub, they dissappear.  </li>
            <li>worth every dime</li>
            <li>although I thought this set was going to be bigger from the pictures, I really like the sleek case and the pieces seem to be good quality.</li>
            <li>I bought these simply because I liked the carrying</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The nail clippers, for instance, have a clever and intuitive sliding cover along the sides to prevent fly-away nails and to instead collect them for easy disposal.</li>
            <li>so that I&#x27;ll have the skill with them to achieve genuinely professional results at home: When supplemented with some consumables (liquids &amp; non-steel products), I&#x27;m confident these implements can do everything I&#x27;ve seen the mani/pedi pros do, and this set will have paid for itself (in avoided fees &amp; tips paid to professionals) within eight weeks, max.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The case is better than most of the other cases out there.</li>
            <li>The scissors in this set does not cut very well, I found that the finger nail clippers did not cut so clean.</li>
            <li>but after one use they changed and they are not sharp any more.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very hard to buy for, this seemed to be a good choice because he works with his hands and was in need of tools to take better care of his nails.  </li>
            <li>Has all the needed tools for nail grooming.&lt;br /&gt;Was originally looking for a leather case, but chose the metal case because of the sleek, contemporary look.</li>
            <li>Would have got a 5 if the nail file was a little larger but its an excellent set.</li>
            <li>Solid little kit with an excellent assortment of quality tools.</li>
            <li>Also, the packing box looks professional and it&#x27;s easy to carry with you.</li>
            <li>The little case is cute, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing I have to say about this kit.</li>
            <li>and at first when I picked it up I thought it was sprained</li>
            <li>What more could possibly cause damage to it?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>which is a shame because otherwise the product would&#x27;ve been exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Do not know the actual better use.</li>
            <li>That was pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time I had this problem since I started to use nail clipper 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>I searched through many manicure/pedicure sets looking for a quality product that had all the necessary tools</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this manicure set to anyone looking for a quality product!</li>
            <li>&gt; the product was exactly the that I wanted</li>
            <li>:) I have a feeling that this kit is durable enough to last for many years.</li>
            <li>exactly what they are supposed to &#x27;groom&#x27;</li>
            <li>Thanks South Korea!</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised when this arrived as from the picture I feared the product might be kind of large and klunky, but no such thing at all.</li>
            <li>really high-level haha!</li>
            <li>Box is easy to open.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly buy a simpler set and one that is easier to use.</li>
            <li>The clippers are all super sharp and dont wear out easily.</li>
            <li>The tools do not slide around loose in the case as happens with most kits.</li>
            <li>It is very high quality in the instruments as well as the case.  </li>
            <li>Finding a good manicure set in a sturdy case was hard so finding Three Seven(777)</li>
            <li>The container looks like a mini, stainless steel suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Actually, they too enjoy finding everything they need for a manicure, pedicure conveniently located.  </li>
            <li>Very petite kit wit petitien scisssors &amp; toe clippers.  </li>
            <li>Very well made, including the case.  </li>
            <li>Very well constructed.</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>This is really a bang for your buck, because for kind of quality you would usually pay 3 times this price.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I couldn&#x27;t have clean cut and always have to pull the clipper away to finish the last bit of connection.</li>
            <li>Thought the solid case might be too big for the male shaving bag but is just right, and my husband loves it, even better than his previous one with the leather case, more gadgets to play with!</li>
            <li>The case has some heft to it and the grooming tools seem to be high quality.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it as a gift.</li>
            <li>All the pieces and the case are high quality.</li>
            <li>They actually are sharp and cut, not just another nice looking non-funtional manicure product.</li>
            <li>The clippers are sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great stuff - well made unfortunately</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now I&#x27;m fighting the urge to buy several of these while they are in stock as they would make terrific, unique, and well appreciated gifts.</li>
            <li>I bought it new</li>
            <li>They are held securely in place where they were left for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a complete manicure set.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my adult son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>File rather short and doesn&#x27;t work very well.just</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a nice manicure set for my husband and have purchased a lot of poor quality products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than the nail cutters, I have no idea what the other stuff is used for, but my wife does find it useful for her.</li>
            <li>The price of this commodity repeatedly, high and low.</li>
            <li>(And we all know it&#x27;s important to keep such clippings away from practitioners of black magic!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>case is very nice, although the latch is a little weak.</li>
            <li>I like the design and layout of the kit, I constantly have to steal it back from my wife because she likes it so much.</li>
            <li>The nose hair scissor was not sharp at all and was pulling my nose hair.  </li>
            <li>marked the item down one star however because I thought some of the implements should have been a bit more heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price for this little set.</li>
            <li>far I have managed to drop the entire case to the floor(concrete)</li>
            <li>I bought one earlier this year for a young man going away to college.  </li>
            <li>You really want to buy it, careful observation.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but it is dang nice.  </li>
            <li>Some of them were sharp enough  at first</li>
            <li>I bought this for my younger male cousin who is in his early 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>Case was heavier than expected till I saw what high quality clippers and instruments came inside.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The products inside the container are exceptional and well made.  </li>
            <li> The box also is awesome, not so big and perfect size.</li>
            <li> This kit has great quality, good price, love the case it is in, everything anyone would need to keep nails and toes in shape.</li>
            <li> Recipients of my &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; were very pleased.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a gift for my husband and he is very pleased with the quality of manufacture, the appearance, and the precision results he gets from using the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good quality and nice set, everything I need to keep my nails nice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> wanted to give them a set that they could use for many years.&lt;br /&gt;The case and all of the implements are very nicely made.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I have!</li>
            <li> Out of desperation, I bought this product and I am beyond thrilled.  </li>
            <li> It is supper nice.</li>
            <li> He liked it so well</li>
            <li> The product is nice.</li>
            <li> I know a company would think that the items are self-explanatory but it would have been nice to have some explanation to go with the product.</li>
            <li> It is a nice set.  </li>
            <li> Nice case.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice set of manicure pedicure grooming kit, this is it.</li>
            <li> Would be nice to have a sheet that told you what they were for</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new set.</li>
            <li> This set came quickly and was priced really great.</li>
            <li> Too good to be true set.</li>
            <li> the pieces are well built, very comfortable to hold and get the job done perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tools in this manicure kit feel very cheap.</li>
            <li> But its quality appear to be very high, it is beautiful and the case is very nice and smaller than it looks in the photo which is good IMO.</li>
            <li> then I discovered them here on Amazon and live is good again!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and love it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> The case is a nice touch and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all either.</li>
            <li> The gold is to over the top for my taste.  </li>
            <li> l love it</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SET OF MANICURE INSTRUMENTS.  </li>
            <li> Better than pictured.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I considered getting one of Seki&#x27;s $100+ sets, but glad I got this instead.</li>
            <li> to keep the product.&lt;br /&gt;I, for sure, will never use their product anymore.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say too much more.</li>
            <li> after many throw away sets we tried this one.</li>
            <li> Probably not the best for travelling, but goid or local mani/pedis.</li>
            <li> He uses it daily and says it is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband for Fathers day and we aren&#x27;t sure what some of the &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; are for&lt;br /&gt;Great case</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s much better quality out there</li>
            <li> The nailtrimmers and scissors are okay though.</li>
            <li> The tools are quality stainless steel stored in an attractive, sturdy metal case.  </li>
            <li> thought I was buying a better quality.</li>
            <li> Now I need to learn more (probably via YouTube or the like)</li>
            <li> The hard case is very nice and the number of tools is excellent.</li>
            <li> but the toe &amp; finger nail clippers come with a sliding metal sleeve that catches most (but not all) of your clipped nails for easy disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the nail clippers are fine, just need more polish.</li>
            <li> was a huge surprise.&lt;br /&gt;The case is sturdy and all the items are top notch</li>
            <li> we loved it so much that we bought a set for the inlaws</li>
            <li> No instructions, which would be handy to explain how to use some of the contents the right way.</li>
            <li> But other than that this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The uniformly strong reviews here at Amazon.com persuaded me to take a chance, though.</li>
            <li> Tools are very sharp and crafted with excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Cuts fine.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and securely wrapped.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a cheap set.  </li>
            <li> This product is very useful.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed this time.</li>
            <li> Picture this, you are married or living with someone for many years (22 for me).</li>
            <li> Today is April 9, one day out of AMAZON&#x27;S returns and refunds policy for free returns and a full refund or replacement.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> After trying out several manicure kits that always seem to have cheap and flimsy tools, I was delighted to find this one.</li>
            <li> product is smaller than it appears in the pictures and is very sleek and attractive.</li>
            <li> Everything, including such things as the case latch and hinges, feels and looks solid and dense, but it&#x27;s marvelously compact.</li>
            <li> We both tried out most of the tools and I can say they are of high quality.</li>
            <li> , I bought this latest one for a high school graduate.  </li>
            <li> plan to upgrade the most used items, but really appreciate having a great small case to secure everything.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the tweezers aren&#x27;t as nice as my Revlon ones, but they still work great!</li>
            <li> my very first attempt with these tools</li>
            <li> got it for my wife and she stopped talking to me; now she just does her nails - but seriously, the quality is great and the case really is quite nice -</li>
            <li> Maybe my set was newer and the materials quality has diminished significantly since the positive reviews were published.</li>
            <li> No expert in manicure sets because I am a male, but this set of grooming tools are amazing.</li>
            <li> Product is great but the carrying case is a bit heavy.  </li>
            <li> Useful and looks</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, no matter how many clippers or files, etc., I keep beside or near the bathtub, they dissappear.  </li>
            <li> worth every dime</li>
            <li> although I thought this set was going to be bigger from the pictures, I really like the sleek case and the pieces seem to be good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought these simply because I liked the carrying</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers, for instance, have a clever and intuitive sliding cover along the sides to prevent fly-away nails and to instead collect them for easy disposal.</li>
            <li> so that I&#x27;ll have the skill with them to achieve genuinely professional results at home: When supplemented with some consumables (liquids &amp; non-steel products), I&#x27;m confident these implements can do everything I&#x27;ve seen the mani/pedi pros do, and this set will have paid for itself (in avoided fees &amp; tips paid to professionals) within eight weeks, max.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The case is better than most of the other cases out there.</li>
            <li> The scissors in this set does not cut very well, I found that the finger nail clippers did not cut so clean.</li>
            <li> but after one use they changed and they are not sharp any more.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very hard to buy for, this seemed to be a good choice because he works with his hands and was in need of tools to take better care of his nails.  </li>
            <li> Has all the needed tools for nail grooming.&lt;br /&gt;Was originally looking for a leather case, but chose the metal case because of the sleek, contemporary look.</li>
            <li> Would have got a 5 if the nail file was a little larger but its an excellent set.</li>
            <li> Solid little kit with an excellent assortment of quality tools.</li>
            <li> Also, the packing box looks professional and it&#x27;s easy to carry with you.</li>
            <li> The little case is cute, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing I have to say about this kit.</li>
            <li> and at first when I picked it up I thought it was sprained</li>
            <li> What more could possibly cause damage to it?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> which is a shame because otherwise the product would&#x27;ve been exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Do not know the actual better use.</li>
            <li> That was pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first time I had this problem since I started to use nail clipper 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I searched through many manicure/pedicure sets looking for a quality product that had all the necessary tools</li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this manicure set to anyone looking for a quality product!</li>
            <li> &gt; the product was exactly the that I wanted</li>
            <li> :) I have a feeling that this kit is durable enough to last for many years.</li>
            <li> exactly what they are supposed to &#x27;groom&#x27;</li>
            <li> Thanks South Korea!</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised when this arrived as from the picture I feared the product might be kind of large and klunky, but no such thing at all.</li>
            <li> really high-level haha!</li>
            <li> Box is easy to open.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly buy a simpler set and one that is easier to use.</li>
            <li> The clippers are all super sharp and dont wear out easily.</li>
            <li> The tools do not slide around loose in the case as happens with most kits.</li>
            <li> It is very high quality in the instruments as well as the case.  </li>
            <li> Finding a good manicure set in a sturdy case was hard so finding Three Seven(777)</li>
            <li> The container looks like a mini, stainless steel suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Actually, they too enjoy finding everything they need for a manicure, pedicure conveniently located.  </li>
            <li> Very petite kit wit petitien scisssors &amp; toe clippers.  </li>
            <li> Very well made, including the case.  </li>
            <li> Very well constructed.</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> This is really a bang for your buck, because for kind of quality you would usually pay 3 times this price.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I couldn&#x27;t have clean cut and always have to pull the clipper away to finish the last bit of connection.</li>
            <li> Thought the solid case might be too big for the male shaving bag but is just right, and my husband loves it, even better than his previous one with the leather case, more gadgets to play with!</li>
            <li> The case has some heft to it and the grooming tools seem to be high quality.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it as a gift.</li>
            <li> All the pieces and the case are high quality.</li>
            <li> They actually are sharp and cut, not just another nice looking non-funtional manicure product.</li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - well made unfortunately</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m fighting the urge to buy several of these while they are in stock as they would make terrific, unique, and well appreciated gifts.</li>
            <li> I bought it new</li>
            <li> They are held securely in place where they were left for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a complete manicure set.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my adult son for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> File rather short and doesn&#x27;t work very well.just</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a nice manicure set for my husband and have purchased a lot of poor quality products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than the nail cutters, I have no idea what the other stuff is used for, but my wife does find it useful for her.</li>
            <li> The price of this commodity repeatedly, high and low.</li>
            <li> (And we all know it&#x27;s important to keep such clippings away from practitioners of black magic!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> case is very nice, although the latch is a little weak.</li>
            <li> I like the design and layout of the kit, I constantly have to steal it back from my wife because she likes it so much.</li>
            <li> The nose hair scissor was not sharp at all and was pulling my nose hair.  </li>
            <li> marked the item down one star however because I thought some of the implements should have been a bit more heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price for this little set.</li>
            <li> far I have managed to drop the entire case to the floor(concrete)</li>
            <li> I bought one earlier this year for a young man going away to college.  </li>
            <li> You really want to buy it, careful observation.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it is dang nice.  </li>
            <li> Some of them were sharp enough  at first</li>
            <li> I bought this for my younger male cousin who is in his early 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Case was heavier than expected till I saw what high quality clippers and instruments came inside.  </li>
            <li> These are very sharp and seem to be manufactured to a high standard.  </li>
            <li> thinking it must be a joke -- such a high price for such a mundane product!</li>
            <li> Soldiers do not earn that much and not many sellers will ship to an APO or deployed location.</li>
            <li> It appears that this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> He concluded that it would be harder for me to misplace an entire kit!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thing that I thought was strange is that I ordered the silver set (as pictured) but the gold plated set arrived instead.</li>
            <li> It was the correct color the 2nd time around, just didn&#x27;t stay closed</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t looked yet, but if they are still selling here, I&#x27;m buying at least one more for another hard to buy for person on my list!</li>
            <li> Originally received it in the wrong color.</li>
            <li> This manicure set is very heavy duty and complete.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this set has garnered such high ratings, given the poor quality of construction.</li>
            <li> I previously owned two manicure sets, a generic one made from China and a Kenneth Cole grooming kit.</li>
            <li> Check out the list of tools included as several typically must be purchased</li>
            <li> are thinking about getting a couple of these for extra little Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> I really could have just gotten one, because this set seems to be very sturdy and I will work on the wifes bad habits.</li>
            <li> , I recommend it widely, the shipment arrived on time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The items are heavy and made very solid.</li>
            <li> The only thing that annoys me is the clippers, they are sharp but for some reason when it clips there is a double click that is annoying because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it was a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t give myself a proper manicure with it because the cuticle pusher is too flat, the nippers are dull and oddly shaped.</li>
            <li> In other words, for items that will be used to varying degrees of high stress, they are of exceptionally poor construction quality.</li>
            <li> Did I mention sharp?</li>
            <li> Sturdy case, sharp clippers, variety.</li>
            <li> You take care of your signicant other as the do you with a pedicure or manicure.</li>
            <li> sharp.  </li>
            <li> Theclippers are sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li> the cuticle trimmers which are pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Sharp, well constructed, durable - everything you want from a grooming kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A couple of the finger nail cutters were not as sharp.  </li>
            <li> Also it is hard to use the clippers especially with the metal band on them.</li>
            <li> You can imagine that my nail is not smooth due to this.</li>
            <li> around, or hidden in, our home.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed, especially of the price - I try to be careful on ordering sets as such in avoiding such disappointments.</li>
            <li> Scissors are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Its glued together and squeaks a little.</li>
            <li> Everything to take care of your growing needs for your nails on both hands and feet are in this little compact case.</li>
            <li> This set may seems expensive if you compare with other low quality sets.</li>
            <li> The package was intact, but the cuticle scissors are already loose and poorly working.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the specifications but is much small</li>
            <li> In the past I had an expensive german set that lasted a lot of years.</li>
            <li> i have been using the nail care items in this set for the past 31 days since it was delivered on March 8.</li>
            <li> small, neat package puts me in mind of a master jeweler&#x27;s toolkit.</li>
            <li> It is so hard for a woman to buy for a man.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;d prefer the silver set, since I don&#x27;t care about feeling like royalty or some pretentious saudi prince, I didn&#x27;t care for going through the hassle of a return/exchange --</li>
            <li> but it is not good at all.</li>
            <li> I was a little unhappy about</li>
            <li> My husband bought this set for me after growing tired of me complaining I can never find my nail clip or file when I need them.</li>
            <li> Placed another order but the locking mechanism was broken on that one.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these kits in the past and have been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my husband threw away the packaging box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I am so disappointed when I tried the clipper.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the set.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome quality.&lt;br /&gt;This was a huge surprise.&lt;br /&gt;The case is sturdy and all the items are top notch quality.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was a little unhappy about was we received a gold colored kit and the one I ordered was silver and we wanted the silver one.&lt;br /&gt;But overall this item is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;We are thinking about getting a couple of these for extra little Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Great item.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this set for me after growing tired of me complaining I can never find my nail clip or file when I need them. He concluded that it would be harder for me to misplace an entire kit!&lt;br /&gt;I have to say- the pieces are well built, very comfortable to hold and get the job done perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to complain about anything I would say that I wish the nail file was sharper. But it does get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;I do believe it will last a lifetime indeed.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have managed to drop the entire case to the floor(concrete) and at first when I picked it up I thought it was sprained but it wasn&#x27;t! What more could possibly cause damage to it?&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that if you got this for yourself you&#x27;d be satisfied or if you gave it as a gift, the recipient would be impressed.</li>
            <li> great quality and organization!</li>
            <li> Useful and looks really high-level haha!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and love it. I the case is well made,  and the grooming tools are good quality.</li>
            <li> Between all of us in our family, we have zillions and zillions and zillions and zillions of clippers, files, etc. around, or hidden in, our home.  Nevertheless, no matter how many clippers or files, etc., I keep beside or near the bathtub, they dissappear.  Out of desperation, I bought this product and I am beyond thrilled.  The products inside the container are exceptional and well made.  The container looks like a mini, stainless steel suitcase.  I keep this \\&quot;suitcase\\&quot; by &#x27;my&#x27; tub.  I have to admit that I instructed my family to never take any of the &#x27;suitcase&#x27; contents outside the bath on penalty of death.  Actually, they too enjoy finding everything they need for a manicure, pedicure conveniently located.  I am pleased to recommend this product.  Cheers.</li>
            <li> Some of them were sharp enough  at first but after one use they changed and they are not sharp any more. Just after one use. Can you believe that?!?&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I thought it had good reviews but it is not good at all.</li>
            <li> Keep this in your purse for those emergencies! I am so glad that I have! Great quality of stuff. Only complaint is the tweezers aren&#x27;t as nice as my Revlon ones, but they still work great!</li>
            <li> I bought it new but it arrived with around twenty used nail clippings.  It was so gross.</li>
            <li> Finding a good manicure set in a sturdy case was hard so finding Three Seven(777) was was a delight.</li>
            <li> Better than expected! I just received this kit and discovered how well made they are. Impressive. The metal work, weight, and (ultra) sharpness of the tools are top-notch! Did I mention sharp? Oh man, I just tried the toe nail and finger nail clippers, and these snipped through my nails as if they weren&#x27;t there. I couldn&#x27;t tell from the pic or the description (unless I missed it somehow) but the toe &amp; finger nail clippers come with a sliding metal sleeve that catches most (but not all) of your clipped nails for easy disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that I thought was strange is that I ordered the silver set (as pictured) but the gold plated set arrived instead. Although I&#x27;d prefer the silver set, since I don&#x27;t care about feeling like royalty or some pretentious saudi prince, I didn&#x27;t care for going through the hassle of a return/exchange -- so gold it is my friends. Either which way, gold &amp; silver aside, this set is solid and well built. The case is a nice touch and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all either. Korean made is starting to make a name for itself in a lot of genres.</li>
            <li> Originally received it in the wrong color. Placed another order but the locking mechanism was broken on that one. It was the correct color the 2nd time around, just didn&#x27;t stay closed which is a shame because otherwise the product would&#x27;ve been exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Received gold, paid for chrome.  The gold is to over the top for my taste.  It looks good for women so gave it to my wife.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the gold color for my husband. We both tried out most of the tools and I can say they are of high quality. The clippers are all super sharp and dont wear out easily. This is really a bang for your buck, because for kind of quality you would usually pay 3 times this price.</li>
            <li> Sturdy case, sharp clippers, variety.</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my mother she loved it! that&#x27;s all I can say. all she wanted was emery boards.</li>
            <li> It is supper nice. l love it</li>
            <li> After I bought this I threw away all the extra implements that were floating around the house.  These are very sharp and seem to be manufactured to a high standard.  I think they were a great value.</li>
            <li> I bought one earlier this year for a young man going away to college.  He liked it so well, I bought this latest one for a high school graduate.  The hard case is very nice and the number of tools is excellent.</li>
            <li> The product is nice. I didn&#x27;t read the specifications but is much small then we see in the picture !!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the recipient loved it.  The case has some heft to it and the grooming tools seem to be high quality.  I would highly recommend it as a gift. It is a great value for the price.  I&#x27;m probably going to order one for myself!</li>
            <li> I know a company would think that the items are self-explanatory but it would have been nice to have some explanation to go with the product. Also it is hard to use the clippers especially with the metal band on them. I will certainly buy a simpler set and one that is easier to use.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these sets for my sons.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give them a set that they could use for many years.&lt;br /&gt;The case and all of the implements are very nicely made.&lt;br /&gt;I marked the item down one star however because I thought some of the implements should have been a bit more heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to upgrade the most used items, but really appreciate having a great small case to secure everything.</li>
            <li> impressed with this kit, all of the tools are good quality and sturdy metal. worth every dime and then some</li>
            <li> Very good quality set for the money. All instruments are well made.</li>
            <li> Has all the needed tools for nail grooming.&lt;br /&gt;Was originally looking for a leather case, but chose the metal case because of the sleek, contemporary look.Thought the solid case might be too big for the male shaving bag but is just right, and my husband loves it, even better than his previous one with the leather case, more gadgets to play with!</li>
            <li> the nail clippers are fine, just need more polish.</li>
            <li> Koreans make good nail cutters.</li>
            <li> This appeared to be well made, had good quality tools, a nice assortment of tools and a very nice case.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new set. Good quality and nice set, everything I need to keep my nails nice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> although I thought this set was going to be bigger from the pictures, I really like the sleek case and the pieces seem to be good quality.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SET OF MANICURE INSTRUMENTS.  This is the second set I&#x27;ve purchased. This one is s gift for my son. He also likes it.</li>
            <li> Have the return. Do not know the actual better use. So I can not give you advice. The price of this commodity repeatedly, high and low. You really want to buy it, careful observation.</li>
            <li> Case was heavier than expected till I saw what high quality clippers and instruments came inside.  Better than pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Best buy I have made for nail care.  Box is easy to open.  Delivered on time and securely wrapped.</li>
            <li> The scissors in this set does not cut very well, I found that the finger nail clippers did not cut so clean. Perhaps it&#x27;s not sharp enough. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed, especially of the price - I try to be careful on ordering sets as such in avoiding such disappointments. I&#x27;ll have to purchase the nail clippers and scissors separately - I was hoping I would not have to do this. Too good to be true set.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price for this little set. I considered getting one of Seki&#x27;s $100+ sets, but glad I got this instead. It may not be up to the quality of Seki or Solingen steel, but still very impressed for the money.</li>
            <li> Very petite kit wit petitien scisssors &amp; toe clippers.  Utensils feel like if made to cut&lt;br /&gt; a babies toenail and finguernails.&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning.</li>
            <li> I bought these simply because I liked the carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize that the nail clippers also came with this metal sleeve that seems to catch the shreds of nail as you cut them. That was pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the nail cutters, I have no idea what the other stuff is used for, but my wife does find it useful for her.</li>
            <li> Very well made, including the case.  I have purchased these kits in the past and have been disappointed.  I was not disappointed this time.</li>
            <li> My husband loved the manicure set. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great stuff - well made unfortunately I don&#x27;t know what some of the manicure tools are used for- no instructions</li>
            <li> Picture this, you are married or living with someone for many years (22 for me). You take care of your signicant other as the do you with a pedicure or manicure. Now, put yourself in the Army and Deployed. That one is not with you and you have to take care of everything Yourself. Soldiers do not earn that much and not many sellers will ship to an APO or deployed location. We, here I was taken care of both financially and time as well. This set came quickly and was priced really great. If my set gets lost, I will order it again.</li>
            <li> solid.  sharp.  works great.</li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp and easy to use. Functions are completed. Also, the packing box looks professional and it&#x27;s easy to carry with you.</li>
            <li> It is a nice set.  I purchased this to replace a cheap set.  Case is wonderful.  Scissors are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I like the assortment of clippers. All the pieces and the case are high quality. It appears that this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a nice manicure set for my husband and have purchased a lot of poor quality products. This manicure set is very heavy duty and complete.</li>
            <li> Would have got a 5 if the nail file was a little larger but its an excellent set. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks. Tools are very sharp and crafted with excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Cuts fine. No problem at all. Nice case. No instructions, which would be handy to explain how to use some of the contents the right way.</li>
            <li> The product arrived timely. The package and all the tools seemed very nice as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;However, I am so disappointed when I tried the clipper. For some reason, I couldn&#x27;t have clean cut and always have to pull the clipper away to finish the last bit of connection. You can imagine that my nail is not smooth due to this. This is the first time I had this problem since I started to use nail clipper 20 years ago. I almost returned the product. Unfortunately, my husband threw away the packaging box. So I have no choice but to keep the product.&lt;br /&gt;I, for sure, will never use their product anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my younger male cousin who is in his early 30&#x27;s.  It is so hard for a woman to buy for a man.  This seems to be the perfect gift.  It is very high quality in the instruments as well as the case.  Very Nice as a gift or for one&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li> After trying out several manicure kits that always seem to have cheap and flimsy tools, I was delighted to find this one. Solid little kit with an excellent assortment of quality tools.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a complete manicure set. In the past I had an expensive german set that lasted a lot of years. This time I wanted something similar but without the hefty price tag. This set may seems expensive if you compare with other low quality sets. But its quality appear to be very high, it is beautiful and the case is very nice and smaller than it looks in the photo which is good IMO. I  bought the set 2 months ago so I can&#x27;t say too much more. Just that I like it a lot and I&#x27;m buying another one. It worths every penny!</li>
            <li> No expert in manicure sets because I am a male, but this set of grooming tools are amazing. I previously owned two manicure sets, a generic one made from China and a Kenneth Cole grooming kit. Both are not up to par with this grooming kit, it has everything you need and is made of great quality. The box also is awesome, not so big and perfect size.</li>
            <li> The package was intact, but the cuticle scissors are already loose and poorly working.&lt;br /&gt;How can I exchange the product for good one?</li>
            <li> Finally a grooming set that is solid and sturdy. It comes with an extremely awesome carrying case, and I sometimes joke about just getting the case itself. Overall if you get this you WILL get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I like the design and layout of the kit, I constantly have to steal it back from my wife because she likes it so much. The only thing that annoys me is the clippers, they are sharp but for some reason when it clips there is a double click that is annoying because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it was a clean cut.</li>
            <li> after many throw away sets we tried this one. we loved it so much that we bought a set for the inlaws and they agreed that this is the best set they have seen also</li>
            <li> Product is great but the carrying case is a bit heavy.  Probably not the best for travelling, but goid or local mani/pedis. Recipients of my &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; were very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my adult son for Christmas.  He&#x27;s very hard to buy for, this seemed to be a good choice because he works with his hands and was in need of tools to take better care of his nails.  He raves about this kit.  He uses it daily and says it is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t looked yet, but if they are still selling here, I&#x27;m buying at least one more for another hard to buy for person on my list!</li>
            <li> Great tools, but overpriced.  Case does not allow for the addition of anything else you may want to add to your manicure/pedicure kit.  Does not include some tools you need and includes some you will never use.  I returned mine.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit. I wish that it would have come with the description of everything that is in it and what they are used for. I bought it for my husband for Fathers day and we aren&#x27;t sure what some of the &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; are for&lt;br /&gt;Great case</li>
            <li> This manicure kit has everything one needs and then some. The quality of the utensils are great. Theclippers are sharp and sturdy. The case is better than most of the other cases out there. The case is the only thing that makes this not a five star review. Its glued together and squeaks a little. Otherwise I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Everything was there and packaged well, . . . . . . . . . . . .  . .</li>
            <li> This product is very useful. I like to bring them when I am traveling. If you are looking for a nice set of manicure pedicure grooming kit, this is it.</li>
            <li> i have been using the nail care items in this set for the past 31 days since it was delivered on March 8. Today is April 9, one day out of AMAZON&#x27;S returns and refunds policy for free returns and a full refund or replacement. One day!! The nail clippers that broke this morning look like they are constructed out of some soft metal, certainly not stainless steel (even though it is not advertised as such).  In other words, for items that will be used to varying degrees of high stress, they are of exceptionally poor construction quality. I don&#x27;t understand how this set has garnered such high ratings, given the poor quality of construction. Maybe my set was newer and the materials quality has diminished significantly since the positive reviews were published. Whatever, I am as upset with AMAZON about their return/refunds policy as I am with the inferior quality of this set!</li>
            <li> Worth the price! All kinds of tools. Easy to use. Although not the best quality, but how can you demand more?</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s much better quality out there esp. the cuticle trimmers which are pretty useless. The nailtrimmers and scissors are okay though.</li>
            <li> I searched through many manicure/pedicure sets looking for a quality product that had all the necessary tools and I found it with Three Seven 777 Travel Manicure Pedicure Grooming Set.  The tools are quality stainless steel stored in an attractive, sturdy metal case.  The set was shipped within 2 days of placing the order and received in excellent condition.  It is well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this manicure set to anyone looking for a quality product!</li>
            <li> very good experience, I recommend it widely, the shipment arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt; the product was exactly the that I wanted</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these because my wife does not like to put things back in there proper place when she is done using them. I also didn&#x27;t know how sturdy it would be, so I bought an extra. I really could have just gotten one, because this set seems to be very sturdy and I will work on the wifes bad habits. :) I have a feeling that this kit is durable enough to last for many years.</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised when this arrived as from the picture I feared the product might be kind of large and klunky, but no such thing at all. In fact, quite the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is smaller than it appears in the pictures and is very sleek and attractive. Check out the list of tools included as several typically must be purchased separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so trim and non-intrusive that it can go anywhere or be placed anywhere in the house. The tools do not slide around loose in the case as happens with most kits. They are held securely in place where they were left for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift for my husband and he is very pleased with the quality of manufacture, the appearance, and the precision results he gets from using the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m fighting the urge to buy several of these while they are in stock as they would make terrific, unique, and well appreciated gifts.</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these so called kits over the last year and have returned them all. I was about to give up and thought I would try one last time then I would head to Walmart for some simple nail clippers. This kit was the best one I have ordered. The items are heavy and made very solid. They actually are sharp and cut, not just another nice looking non-funtional manicure product. These are functional and look nice!</li>
            <li> This is  a great product.  This is made well and just what I was wanting.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Everything to take care of your growing needs for your nails on both hands and feet are in this little compact case. Very well constructed. Real nice warrantee. The only problem I do have with this product is that it has an ear pick. And everybody knows that you don&#x27;t put metal in your years. But other than that this is an excellent product. And I would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> I like it, It is well made, materials are solid.&lt;br /&gt;It just didn&#x27;t come with any instructions.  Some of the &#x27;tools&#x27; inside I have no idea exactly what they are supposed to &#x27;groom&#x27; so I made up uses for them myself.  Would be nice to have a sheet that told you what they were for but otherwise it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;The case is very nice, although the latch is a little weak.</li>
            <li> This kit has great quality, good price, love the case it is in, everything anyone would need to keep nails and toes in shape.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the set. File rather short and doesn&#x27;t work very well.just thought I was buying a better quality.</li>
            <li> I was indeed shopping for a manicure set here on Amazon.com, but I actually took a closer look at this item thinking it must be a joke -- such a high price for such a mundane product! The uniformly strong reviews here at Amazon.com persuaded me to take a chance, though. Now, having used the set, I add this rave review to those:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This small, neat package puts me in mind of a master jeweler&#x27;s toolkit. Everything, including such things as the case latch and hinges, feels and looks solid and dense, but it&#x27;s marvelously compact. The implements themselves feel good at hand, and their designs are exquisitely functional. The nail clippers, for instance, have a clever and intuitive sliding cover along the sides to prevent fly-away nails and to instead collect them for easy disposal. (And we all know it&#x27;s important to keep such clippings away from practitioners of black magic!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my very first attempt with these tools, I&#x27;ve just given myself the best home manicure &amp; pedicure I&#x27;ve ever managed. Now I need to learn more (probably via YouTube or the like) so that I&#x27;ll have the skill with them to achieve genuinely professional results at home: When supplemented with some consumables (liquids &amp; non-steel products), I&#x27;m confident these implements can do everything I&#x27;ve seen the mani/pedi pros do, and this set will have paid for itself (in avoided fees &amp; tips paid to professionals) within eight weeks, max.</li>
            <li> I discovered this company from a girlfriend whose company gave them away as employee gifts. After we broke up, and I was relegated to my drugstore nail clippers I was heartbroken... then I discovered them here on Amazon and live is good again! Sharp, well constructed, durable - everything you want from a grooming kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can you say except you get what you pay for. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The tools in this manicure kit feel very cheap. I couldn&#x27;t give myself a proper manicure with it because the cuticle pusher is too flat, the nippers are dull and oddly shaped. The little case is cute, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing I have to say about this kit.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and worked well.</li>
            <li> Did not like it. It was returned.</li>
            <li> got it for my wife and she stopped talking to me; now she just does her nails - but seriously, the quality is great and the case really is quite nice - I was skeptical, but it is dang nice.  Thanks South Korea!</li>
            <li> The set has some highs and low.  A couple of the finger nail cutters were not as sharp.  The nose hair scissor was not sharp at all and was pulling my nose hair.  Overall, for the price, 2 stars.</li>
