            <li>its perfect glad I found it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start with the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>not so good stuff:&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wetting or washing hair every night isnt good for the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I love this shower cap!</li>
            <li>How cute is it on my son!  </li>
            <li>and it won&#x27;t get any better when you pop it on your head.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s OK she still enjoys it</li>
            <li>The bonus it looks so cute.</li>
            <li>do I even need to mention that it&#x27;s adorable?</li>
            <li>Because nothing says &amp;#34;I&#x27;m important&amp;#34; more than a frog shower cap on your melon.</li>
            <li>OMG I love this.  </li>
            <li>I would rather look at a cute frog than the granny cap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s made for a kid&#x27;s head</li>
            <li>I love this cap and the frog is super cute!</li>
            <li>importantly, SHE thinks its cute</li>
            <li>These caps fit us great - snug seal that keeps most water out, but not uncomfortably tight.  </li>
            <li>It worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I love these super durable shower caps.</li>
            <li>This little shower cap is perfect for her to wear around</li>
            <li>worth it!</li>
            <li>Super cute and functional - made showering more fun for my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;Solid construction, vibrant color.  </li>
            <li>Everyone who has seen it on had commented how cool it is.</li>
            <li>Gives me a smile every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Super cute and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Fits great and keeps my enormous head of hair dry!</li>
            <li>Very durable construction which means no worries when scrub time turns to horse play.</li>
            <li>The large eyes and friendly smile are enough to let you know this frog is ready for action.</li>
            <li>My 6 month old baby seems to find it absolutely hilarious, and tries rip it off her head.</li>
            <li>Extremely tight fitting.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>this is for an adult with a medium sized head or a large volume of hair, this may be quite snug but will probably work.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Great for kids, bad for dad&#x27;s who want to laugh at their wife.</li>
            <li>I purchased the item as a cute (adult) product, but it does not fit on my head.</li>
            <li>She has pretty long hair.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a Christmas present joke, but is absolutely functional.</li>
            <li>or so.&lt;br /&gt;She is three years old and this shower cap fits her with plenty of room to grow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought for the 6 year old and</li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter and</li>
            <li>the band is nice and tight which means less</li>
            <li>buy this for an adult who wears a large helmet / hat size - it won&#x27;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap itself is quite heavy duty; our kitten relocated mine from the bathroom counter to the middle of the bedroom (she loves dragging off her &amp;#34;prey&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>The material is very sturdy and durable and has kept my seat dry in the rain.</li>
            <li>According to my wife, this goofy shower cap works but it is a little tight.</li>
            <li>Bought it for a 5 years old girl with long hair.</li>

            <li> According to my wife, this goofy shower cap works but it is a little tight.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a 5 years old girl with long hair.</li>
            <li> My little girl has VERY curly hair that tends to get dry.</li>
            <li> I fits a little snug so it leaves a ring after the first few uses</li>
            <li> Cute product but disappointing.</li>
            <li> A little stiff at first but does the job</li>
            <li> He means business and your hair will stay as dry as the desert.</li>
            <li> However, I have quite a small head for an adult.  </li>
            <li> you are buying this for an child or an adult who wears a small bike helmet, it should work</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less likely to leak</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfy on my head, but I could see it being tight on others with larger heads.</li>
            <li> She has a huge head so it doesn&#x27;t quite stay on without cutting of her circulation...</li>
            <li> It does protect her hair and nothing gets wet.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving it less stars.</li>
            <li> the band is tight, so</li>
            <li> the cap itself is small, so if you have a lot of hair/if it&#x27;s thick you&#x27;ll need to find a way to get it all in there with a low profile.</li>
            <li> I recommend little clips or the spin pins</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t confine him to the shower though- show him off at work, the little league field, dance clubs and even church.</li>
            <li> My husband thought me crazy when I said I wanted this for our 6yr old son, but it makes his hair stay dry in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic is thick and has held up well over multiple uses - as I previously mentioned - we use this at least once a week</li>
            <li> Additionally, these caps are fairly shallow (not very tall compared to the width).  </li>
            <li> It runs really small.</li>
            <li> (he likes to joke that I look dowdy) and he can&#x27;t get enough of this cap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit small</li>
            <li> I hope you have at least 30 minutes to get the imprint off your forehead&lt;</li>
            <li> I have the Yellow Duck and Crazy Frog shower caps.  </li>
            <li> the plastic is thick so if you have nails or wear rings in the shower it won&#x27;t tear the material</li>
            <li> Her ugly white one.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gag gift for my wife since I HATE.</li>

            <li> Super cute and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> No you cannot and it won&#x27;t get any better when you pop it on your head.  Too cute!!!  And it works too.</li>
            <li> A little stiff at first but does the job</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Should have purchased this item years ago instead of battling with the disposable ones. Gives me a smile every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Extremely tight fitting.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a bike seat cover and it&#x27;s perfect.  The material is very sturdy and durable and has kept my seat dry in the rain. So cute!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife since I thought my son would get a kick out of seeing her in a frog hat.  It runs really small. Great for kids, bad for dad&#x27;s who want to laugh at their wife.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister and she loves. She has a huge head so it doesn&#x27;t quite stay on without cutting of her circulation... but it&#x27;s OK she still enjoys it</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this cap. It does protect her hair and nothing gets wet. She has pretty long hair. The bonus it looks so cute. Just a note, this cap is for a child.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;- the band is nice and tight which means less it&#x27;s less likely to leak&lt;br /&gt;- the plastic is thick so if you have nails or wear rings in the shower it won&#x27;t tear the material&lt;br /&gt;- do I even need to mention that it&#x27;s adorable? I got this cap with my husband in mind (he likes to joke that I look dowdy) and he can&#x27;t get enough of this cap. He giggles every time I wear it now, so I&#x27;ve gone from frumpy to fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so good stuff:&lt;br /&gt;- the band is tight, so I hope you have at least 30 minutes to get the imprint off your forehead&lt;br /&gt;- the cap itself is small, so if you have a lot of hair/if it&#x27;s thick you&#x27;ll need to find a way to get it all in there with a low profile. I recommend little clips or the spin pins</li>
            <li> I love this shower cap! It is a shower necessity. Very durable construction which means no worries when scrub time turns to horse play. The large eyes and friendly smile are enough to let you know this frog is ready for action. He means business and your hair will stay as dry as the desert. Don&#x27;t confine him to the shower though- show him off at work, the little league field, dance clubs and even church. Because nothing says &amp;#34;I&#x27;m important&amp;#34; more than a frog shower cap on your melon.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this.  How cute is it on my son!  He picked the froggy.  My husband thought me crazy when I said I wanted this for our 6yr old son, but it makes his hair stay dry in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wetting or washing hair every night isnt good for the scalp.  Women wear caps, why not guys?  I saw this and knew it was it.  Its perfect!  Everyone who has seen it on had commented how cool it is.</li>
            <li> I love this cap and the frog is super cute! It&#x27;s comfy on my head, but I could see it being tight on others with larger heads.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, this goofy shower cap works but it is a little tight. My 6 month old baby seems to find it absolutely hilarious, and tries rip it off her head. Bought it as a Christmas present joke, but is absolutely functional.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a 5 years old girl with long hair. It worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Super cute and functional - made showering more fun for my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;Solid construction, vibrant color.  Cutest shower cap I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I purchased the item as a cute (adult) product, but it does not fit on my head. I purchased 3 of these animal shower caps, but now have to wait to give them away to children. Cute product but disappointing. I wish that the product description listed a size.</li>
            <li> My little girl has VERY curly hair that tends to get dry. To combat the dryness, I like to put a moisture mask on her hair once a week. This little shower cap is perfect for her to wear around so she doesn&#x27;t get oil all over the couch, walls, chairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, SHE thinks its cute and so she&#x27;ll wear it for an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;She is three years old and this shower cap fits her with plenty of room to grow.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic is thick and has held up well over multiple uses - as I previously mentioned - we use this at least once a week and it has held up for over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I love these super durable shower caps. They last a year or longer! Highly recommend. Will never go back to regular caps again!</li>
            <li> Fits great and keeps my enormous head of hair dry! Although I do see my fam rolling their eyes... being the mommy and all.</li>
            <li> I fits a little snug so it leaves a ring after the first few uses</li>
            <li> bought for the 6 year old and its perfect glad I found it</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter and I have the Yellow Duck and Crazy Frog shower caps.  These caps fit us great - snug seal that keeps most water out, but not uncomfortably tight.  However, I have quite a small head for an adult.  Additionally, these caps are fairly shallow (not very tall compared to the width).  Consequently:&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying this for an child or an adult who wears a small bike helmet, it should work great.&lt;br /&gt;If this is for an adult with a medium sized head or a large volume of hair, this may be quite snug but will probably work.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this for an adult who wears a large helmet / hat size - it won&#x27;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap itself is quite heavy duty; our kitten relocated mine from the bathroom counter to the middle of the bedroom (she loves dragging off her &amp;#34;prey&amp;#34;) but I don&#x27;t see any evidence of bit marks or punctures.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gag gift for my wife since I HATE. Her ugly white one. I would rather look at a cute frog than the granny cap she wears.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit small, so she doesn&#x27;t use it since she can&#x27;t tuck all her hair in it. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s made for a kid&#x27;s head and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving it less stars.</li>
