            <li>Pleased.</li>

            <li>The length on both top and bottom are longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>It works ok,</li>
            <li>When I finish the bottle I can tell more</li>
            <li>so I thought I would check my favorite shopping place.</li>
            <li>i love this product...</li>
            <li>Even though I was using this product for more then two month, my eyelashes are not growing longer.</li>
            <li>I love this product&lt;</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it love it .</li>
            <li>It may have made my eyelashes a bit healthier, can&#x27;t tell for sure.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have time to apply more</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it seemed to make my lashes more brittle.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>More lashes?</li>
            <li>, I felt no burning or any irritation at all -- so far so good!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are strong and longer.</li>
            <li>I have never had such a beautiful eye lashes .</li>
            <li>so I need more time to see the full effects of the product.</li>
            <li>Brow and lashes got longer, not thicker, but that&#x27;s fine with me.  </li>
            <li>recently, really kind of accidentally (I had an itch!), pulled out a clump of eyelashes at the top inner eye.  </li>
            <li>It went on easy and smooth</li>
            <li>but so worth it!</li>
            <li>I plan to continue using the product, however, because even these minimal results are a welcome improvement.</li>
            <li>I have not seen the full effect yet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with Nutraluxe, still a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>-Worthy:  </li>
            <li>QUICK UPDATE:  </li>
            <li>So easy to see how much you are using and how quickly you would need to reorder.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer and fuller!!</li>
            <li>First month ditn notice anything, then viola!  </li>
            <li>, even though my photos aren&#x27;t as glamorous as I would have liked them to be (hard taking a photo of your own eye), I know the difference from day one</li>
            <li>very much worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First Day:  read the directions and put Proslash Serum on like eyeliner on a freshly washed face.  </li>
            <li>i ususally apply it at night, and sometimes in the daytime right over my makeup.</li>
            <li>And, I wasn&#x27;t consistent enough about application to honestly say that the product didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>but I definitely think it&#x27;s a good starting point for someone who is looking for full lashes.</li>
            <li>and this one was very gentle on the ol&#x27; eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I started to put it on every night before bed and my lashes went much longer!</li>
            <li>I love it, it works on eye lashes/ brows, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>And so far my eyes are still beautiful green.</li>
            <li>i try and use it consistently</li>
            <li>I rated - just ok - for now because I have only used this product for 1 week.  </li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>I used it on my eyebrows - really works!</li>
            <li>After 6 weeks, there are definitely more lashes on my upper lids, but they are not any longer than they were at the start.</li>
            <li>and I have to have the extensions filled a little more often than before</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects which is why I gave it two stars, but it really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I took a photo of the first day of using this product so you can see real before and after photos.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how fast it takes for eyelashes normally grow back, but I am pretty sure it takes well over 30 days.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am back to normal, eyelash-wise, I will still use, all over, both sides, top and bottom, and see if they get thicker.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many eye lash growth serums and have noticed a tingle when using every single product.  </li>
            <li>but I do have reactions to certain products sometimes</li>
            <li>I like that this is a large tube of the serum</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see what a few more weeks of usage with result in!</li>
            <li>she said she didn&#x27;t see much growth.</li>
            <li>Very.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe my lashes are much longer</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works really it does .</li>
            <li>Save your pennies and purchase a product that really works.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much difference at all</li>
            <li>so I had an opportunity to really see if it works.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for almost one month, but have not seen much improvement yet.  </li>
            <li>Just received this product so can&#x27;t see any effects but looks promising.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes grow almost too fast now</li>
            <li>I have used this products for 1 whole week now and every morning  </li>
            <li>i gotta say i love that they send you a 6oz tube instead of a 1 oz like all the other lash growth serums.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I am confident that this product does what is says it will do:  Grow thick and long eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad.</li>
            <li>Came quickly just been using short time so hopefully product works.</li>
            <li>I ONLY used it at the top of my inner eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A simply swipe along your lash line, let it dry, apply your make up and its as easy as that!</li>
            <li>It was kind of hard to find</li>
            <li>Kidding aside, worth the price if you will commit to regular use.</li>
            <li>I have pretty straight lashes so this is a big deal to me.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews but this definitely does Not work.  </li>
            <li>The outer portion of the plastic tube actually fell off, revealing that there is not as much product as there first appears to be.  </li>
            <li>but I have noticed I grew a few more lashes.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are long and full and I don&#x27;t seem to have any gaps.</li>
            <li>and I will update my review in a few more weeks to see if there are any changes.</li>
            <li>Since the brush picks up a lot of serum, it&#x27;s easy to apply a little too much on the lash line, causing serum to drip into your eyes.</li>
            <li>I had No eye lashes on the inner corner of my right eye..</li>
            <li>Also, my eyes are very sensitive</li>
            <li>My lashes are getting fuller and they are getting a natural curl!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better they look after a few months!</li>
            <li>I see that more lashes that were small grew to catch up with the rest but when will they start to grow longer?</li>
            <li>Not as professional as you would expect.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I apply it twice a day once in the morning and once before bed and have noticed a difference on my lower lids, not so much thicker but definitely longer</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive</li>
            <li>However, it is to early for me to give any feedback</li>
            <li>So far, I don&#x27;t see any results, but I will stay with it for a while.  </li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>so you can see much you have left.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to post results, but I am giving it a five star rating due to outstanding customer service  and the clear tube it comes in.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eyelash growth serums in the past 5 years and I keep having to go back to Nutralux Lash DM.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product mainly on my bottom lashes at the moment as I currently have lash extensions on my upper lid.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes, at this writing are completely grown back.  </li>
            <li>But other than having to be careful during application, I find the product absolutely worth using.</li>

            <li> My lashes are long and full and I don&#x27;t seem to have any gaps.</li>
            <li> and I will update my review in a few more weeks to see if there are any changes.</li>
            <li> Since the brush picks up a lot of serum, it&#x27;s easy to apply a little too much on the lash line, causing serum to drip into your eyes.</li>
            <li> I had No eye lashes on the inner corner of my right eye..</li>
            <li> Also, my eyes are very sensitive</li>
            <li> My lashes are getting fuller and they are getting a natural curl!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better they look after a few months!</li>
            <li> I see that more lashes that were small grew to catch up with the rest but when will they start to grow longer?</li>
            <li> Not as professional as you would expect.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I apply it twice a day once in the morning and once before bed and have noticed a difference on my lower lids, not so much thicker but definitely longer</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive</li>
            <li> However, it is to early for me to give any feedback</li>
            <li> So far, I don&#x27;t see any results, but I will stay with it for a while.  </li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> so you can see much you have left.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to post results, but I am giving it a five star rating due to outstanding customer service  and the clear tube it comes in.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eyelash growth serums in the past 5 years and I keep having to go back to Nutralux Lash DM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product mainly on my bottom lashes at the moment as I currently have lash extensions on my upper lid.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes, at this writing are completely grown back.  </li>
            <li> But other than having to be careful during application, I find the product absolutely worth using.</li>
            <li> I then gave her a bottle of Royal Lashes and she was really amazed to see results in less than 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I will only give this one 4 stars due to the fact that it is so early</li>
            <li> And, I should note that the directions say to use at least twice a day, maybe 3 at first</li>
            <li> I believe the results were minimal, but they were present.  </li>
            <li> Used daily until it was empty...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it that long</li>
            <li> The brush is a little thicker than other brushes I have used so I have to be careful that I don&#x27;t get too much.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can find a way later.and long eyelashes!    </li>
            <li> I have used other eyelash serums before and this is similar.</li>
            <li> I let it completely dry before putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li> I might have gotten a little tiny bit of length on my lashes and that&#x27;s why it got two stars.</li>
            <li> I see a little growth especially when I use my mascara.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the tube until empty and will update once completed.    </li>
            <li> Be careful with application as it stings when you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Thicker lashes not much noticeable length</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get into your eyes.</li>
            <li> After using it for what seems like forever I still apply it everyday and it totally has worked miracles.</li>
            <li> a few days later i got a wart like bump on my eye lid..</li>
            <li> I use this product because I have eyelash extensions and need my lashes to be strong and thick to hold the fake ones.</li>
            <li> Fullest is what I wanted after losing my lashes due to medication so I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> The brush is stiff and larger than brushes of other lash growth serums I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars only because I kept making a thick line on my lid as if I were applying eye liner and</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll trim it down</li>
            <li> I have been using the tube and almost down to emptying it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s odd</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used half the bottle and it hasn&#x27;t worked at all.</li>
            <li> This product does not leave a sticky or greasy feeling on your eye lids nor does it cause a mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted me a few months.</li>
            <li> I use on my eyelas and eyebrows for few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, although I haven&#x27;t noticed a godly amount of difference, I do notice that the length of my lashes as increased along with the thickness.</li>
            <li> Burns my eyes and quite a few lashes fell out after using for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Takes a few werks before you notice.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference after a few applications as the mascara flows on.</li>
            <li> You can tell a very slight difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try an eyelash growth product as I have a very slight case of trichotillomania (pulling out hair like eyelashes, eyebrows, etc) and</li>
            <li> HOWEVER in the past month i have started to notice my eyelashes are longer, and thicker a little bit?</li>
            <li> Itches my eyelids and makes them raw.</li>
            <li> if u r desperate to have ur lashes grow, u should try this..just be careful when you apply and very regular in applying</li>
            <li> After just a few days of use, I began to see a difference!</li>
            <li> Got this because my eyelashes were cut by a lazy technician when I was getting extensions.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully twice a day for the past 20 days.  </li>
            <li> Well not really sure growth,  guess keeping going tryout not given up.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few reviews I&#x27;ve written for a product.</li>
            <li> I saw results in about 10 days...much less expensive than other products</li>
            <li> I tried it often but did not really see any dramatic affects</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find reviews online on this product</li>
            <li> I was concentrating so hard on my \\&quot;bald\\&quot; spot that I forgot to use the serum on the rest of my eyelash lines.  </li>
            <li> I gave this to my girlfriend and she has been using it for at least a month now...</li>
            <li> Again, Prolash packaging sucks.</li>
            <li> Used at least once a day for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no irritation, redness, or anything bad even when I got some in my eye.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I tend to be somewhat whimsical and do not use as recommended...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was quite expensive and I decided to try Prolash.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I can&#x27;t find a place to add customer images (my \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos) to this product.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I can&#x27;t find a place to add customer images (my \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos) to this product.  </li>
            <li> It is useless!</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Sorry. Saw no difference</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 weeks and see no changes  in my lashes or brows at all. I don&#x27;t think this works. It&#x27;s just oils. I would Not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of use, I began to see a difference! I am so happy with it. I tend to be somewhat whimsical and do not use as recommended... i.e. I forget sometimes. However, it still is working! Great product!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my girlfriend and she has been using it for at least a month now... she said she didn&#x27;t see much growth. I then gave her a bottle of Royal Lashes and she was really amazed to see results in less than 2 weeks! It was kind of hard to find but I got mine from royallashclub.com.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference</li>
            <li> After using this product did see some growth.</li>
            <li> I liked it is wonderful. My eyelashes are strong and longer. Thank you for helping me with this product.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer and fuller!! AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> Works after several weeks of regular use. Notice longer, thicker lashes.  Occasionally even leave the house without mascara now.  Prolash has given me my freedom back! Kidding aside, worth the price if you will commit to regular use. Again, Prolash packaging sucks. Not as professional as you would expect. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried for 3 weeks. I still need more time to keep and trying...</li>
            <li> It thickened my lashes; would like to see lengthening as well</li>
            <li> Never thought this product would work but I started to put it on every night before bed and my lashes went much longer! Now I&#x27;m just using it a couple times a week but it still gives a good effect!</li>
            <li> I ust wish the brush was a bit thinner. I think I&#x27;ll trim it down</li>
            <li> Very. Pleased. Came quickly just been using short time so hopefully product works.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 4 weeks. I have seen some length growth on upper. But my bottom lashes seems to be longer. Volume wise - no change. I will continue to use the tube until empty and will update once completed.    Update: 1/14/2015 - I have been using the tube and almost down to emptying it. I have seen more lash growth and my lashes seem thicker. The length on both top and bottom are longer and fuller. Be careful with application as it stings when you get it in your eyes. I am planning to buy another tube. Cheers.</li>
            <li> Brush is bigger than I&#x27;m used to but I got used to it. It&#x27;s lasted me a few months. It works ok, I&#x27;ve had better results with Nutraluxe, still a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week and I am already noticing a difference. My lashes are getting fuller and they are getting a natural curl! I have pretty straight lashes so this is a big deal to me. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better they look after a few months!</li>
            <li> Amazing product but I needed something stronger so I decided to try Royal Lashes. It worked great for me, I got mine from RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
            <li> I see the thickness in the lashes. I see that more lashes that were small grew to catch up with the rest but when will they start to grow longer? When I finish the bottle I can tell more but I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks day and night.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the reviews.  Just like another I read, said it didn&#x27;t work.  I didn&#x27;t listen cause of the stars it received.  Do not waste your money. I rarely write reviews but this definitely does Not work.  I have tried many eyelash growth serums in the past 5 years and I keep having to go back to Nutralux Lash DM. (Found on Amazon) It is more expensive this is why I am always trying to find an alternative. Trying to help consumers.  Rule of thumb if you cant see a difference in three weeks it is not working.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at ALL - have used for 2 months now and NO difference...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do what it said it will do; grow eyelashes longer and thicker.  Nope... this didn&#x27;t happen.  I might have gotten a little tiny bit of length on my lashes and that&#x27;s why it got two stars.</li>
            <li> I was using another product so I thought I would check my favorite shopping place. Amazon. Prolash has been working and I bought one for my friend. So buy this great product.</li>
            <li> Saw no results at all.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this product for over one month. I don&#x27;t believe my lashes are much longer but they are definitely fuller and stronger. Fullest is what I wanted after losing my lashes due to medication so I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> i love this product...I use it only at night...does not itch...I saw results in about 10 days...much less expensive than other products</li>
            <li> I love it, it works on eye lashes/ brows, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Once my lashes started growing in I had to cut back to using it 2x/week.  I have been using it to help my eyebrows grow in too.  Its working ok for eyebrows, and works great on my lashes. And so far my eyes are still beautiful green.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product mainly on my bottom lashes at the moment as I currently have lash extensions on my upper lid. Once they fall out I will start use on my upper lid. I apply it twice a day once in the morning and once before bed and have noticed a difference on my lower lids, not so much thicker but definitely longer and it&#x27;s odd but even though they aren&#x27;t thicker they definitely look fuller. I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about two weeks and it seems to be working. It&#x27;s hard to find reviews online on this product but I definitely think it&#x27;s a good starting point for someone who is looking for full lashes.</li>
            <li> I have seen results since starting this product, but nothing life changing.  The outer portion of the plastic tube actually fell off, revealing that there is not as much product as there first appears to be.  Only stings if you get a lot in your eye.  Overall, I would repurchase for the price but I&#x27;m sure there are more effective products out there.</li>
            <li> This serum didn&#x27;t do anything to my lashes. Before I was using Grande lash and my lashes looked great. Unfortunately this product was quite expensive and I decided to try Prolash. The brush prolash comes with is way to big, and I always have this serum all over my eyelid. Even though I was using this product for more then two month, my eyelashes are not growing longer.</li>
            <li> not too happy with results</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Got this because my eyelashes were cut by a lazy technician when I was getting extensions. They were so short adn stubby! Used at least once a day for about 2 months. First month ditn notice anything, then viola!  I had longer, darker eyelashes. Noticeable difference. Keep using the serum--results wont happen in a short time but so worth it!</li>
            <li> You can tell a very slight difference.</li>
            <li> I should tell you that . I love this product&lt;br /&gt;It works really it does . I have never had such a beautiful eye lashes . I used it twice a day . And know after 3 weeks you should see the result I absolutely love it love it . Thank you prolash</li>
            <li> Thicker lashes not much noticeable length</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for more than a month now! i gotta say i love that they send you a 6oz tube instead of a 1 oz like all the other lash growth serums. i try and use it consistently but i have forgotten to apply it a couple times. HOWEVER in the past month i have started to notice my eyelashes are longer, and thicker a little bit? i ususally apply it at night, and sometimes in the daytime right over my makeup. will definitely purchase again. very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use on my eyelas and eyebrows for few months. Nothing happens. It is useless!</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get into your eyes.</li>
            <li> It may have made my eyelashes a bit healthier, can&#x27;t tell for sure. But longer? No. Used faithfully as instructed for 3 months with no visible changes. it was disappointing.&lt;br /&gt; The tube is a generous size, does seem to last forever. Save your pennies and purchase a product that really works. I&#x27;ll finish the tube and provide an update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for almost 3 weeks and did not see any difference with my eyelashes. I will invest in Latisse next time around.</li>
            <li> seems  to actually work . you have to be diligent ab out applying it .</li>
            <li> I have definitely seen results with daily use of Prolash+ serum. My lashes appear longer after 3 weeks of applying Prolash+ once a day (before bed). A word of caution...do not get product into your eyes because it will burn! The brush is stiff and larger than brushes of other lash growth serums I have used in the past. Since the brush picks up a lot of serum, it&#x27;s easy to apply a little too much on the lash line, causing serum to drip into your eyes. But other than having to be careful during application, I find the product absolutely worth using.</li>
            <li> This product worked for me.  Been using it for 2 1/2 months and just ordered a second tube.  Brow and lashes got longer, not thicker, but that&#x27;s fine with me.  I haven&#x27;t lost one eyelash in my lash curler since I started using this.  What I like best is if I accidentally get some in my eyes it doesn&#x27;t burn or sting.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I believe the results were minimal, but they were present.  And, I wasn&#x27;t consistent enough about application to honestly say that the product didn&#x27;t work.  Overall, not bad.</li>
            <li> it burns my eyes&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return it!</li>
            <li> Itches my eyelids and makes them raw. Cannot use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week now but I already have noticed that my lashes are feeling fuller and longer. Also, my eyes are very sensitive and I was worried that the serum might irritate them as a lot of eye products do, and actually I haven&#x27;t had any problems with irritation! I would definitely recommend this product. Great product and you can&#x27;t beat the price! Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is cause I&#x27;ve only been using it one week so I need more time to see the full effects of the product.</li>
            <li> Only used product for about for about 10 days and started to lose some eyelashes. Thought this product would help grow lashes, not lose lashes</li>
            <li> Used daily until it was empty...I would not buy it again  Didn&#x27;t notice much difference at all</li>
            <li> Did not grow my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all its already a month. Can someone take pic before and after and post them up pls.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, although I haven&#x27;t noticed a godly amount of difference, I do notice that the length of my lashes as increased along with the thickness. This product does not leave a sticky or greasy feeling on your eye lids nor does it cause a mess. A simply swipe along your lash line, let it dry, apply your make up and its as easy as that! I will continue to use this product since I am getting results from it. Can&#x27;t wait to see what a few more weeks of usage with result in!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say I  notica any difference</li>
            <li> I am seeing some growth but it is still too soon to call.  I have only used it for 1 week.  I see a little growth especially when I use my mascara.  Some of the reviews state that it burns when applied to the lids.  I notice that it does a bit but nothing to cause alarm.  I have tried many eye lash growth serums and have noticed a tingle when using every single product.  I will only give this one 4 stars due to the fact that it is so early but I am impressed.  The delivery of the product was amazing.  Got it within 24 hours.  I will update you with my progress</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try an eyelash growth product as I have a very slight case of trichotillomania (pulling out hair like eyelashes, eyebrows, etc) and recently, really kind of accidentally (I had an itch!), pulled out a clump of eyelashes at the top inner eye.  DANG!  I had just received my Prolash Serum in the mail so I had an opportunity to really see if it works.  I took a photo of the first day of using this product so you can see real before and after photos.  I was concentrating so hard on my \\&quot;bald\\&quot; spot that I forgot to use the serum on the rest of my eyelash lines.  I ONLY used it at the top of my inner eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Day:  read the directions and put Proslash Serum on like eyeliner on a freshly washed face.  It went on easy and smooth, I felt no burning or any irritation at all -- so far so good! I let it completely dry before putting on makeup.  And, I should note that the directions say to use at least twice a day, maybe 3 at first but I only used ONCE a day.  Didn&#x27;t have time to apply more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of this review (and \\&quot;after\\&quot; photo) it is 2 days into the 4th week of using Prolash.  I don&#x27;t know how fast it takes for eyelashes normally grow back, but I am pretty sure it takes well over 30 days.  My eyelashes, at this writing are completely grown back.  YAY!!  Now that I am back to normal, eyelash-wise, I will still use, all over, both sides, top and bottom, and see if they get thicker.  I will update my review with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note-Worthy:  I had absolutely no irritation, redness, or anything bad even when I got some in my eye.  My skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive but I do have reactions to certain products sometimes and this one was very gentle on the ol&#x27; eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, even though my photos aren&#x27;t as glamorous as I would have liked them to be (hard taking a photo of your own eye), I know the difference from day one and I am pleased with the results. I can honestly say I am confident that this product does what is says it will do:  Grow thick and long eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUICK UPDATE:  Sorry, I can&#x27;t find a place to add customer images (my \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos) to this product.  Maybe I can find a way later.and long eyelashes!    QUICK UPDATE:  Sorry, I can&#x27;t find a place to add customer images (my \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos) to this product.  Maybe I can find a way later.</li>
            <li> excellent product is very good helped me to make my eyelashes grow and are more abundant</li>
            <li> does not do anything... waist of money</li>
            <li> Have been using this for almost one month, but have not seen much improvement yet.  Will continue to use it and maybe it will work.</li>
            <li> I am using as per intruction. However, it is to early for me to give any feedback if the meds realy works or not. any changes that I have notice to my eyelashes and eye brow,  I will definitely give my rate and put my recomendation. thank you</li>
            <li> Good lash conditioner</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it that long but I have noticed I grew a few more lashes.  I&#x27;ll update my results!!</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Burns my eyes and quite a few lashes fell out after using for a few weeks.  I was using RapidLash before and was happy with the results.  Going back to that and throwing this in the trash.</li>
            <li> I rated - just ok - for now because I have only used this product for 1 week.  I haven&#x27;t seen any results as of yet.  I can comment that the product is very easy to use and does not irritate my skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully twice a day for the past 20 days.  So far, I don&#x27;t see any results, but I will stay with it for a while.  I am trying to be patient as I imagine this could take some time.</li>
            <li> I think it has made my eyelashes longer.  No one else has noticed though.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I gave this one star for ease of application and no eye irritation.  Otherwise, it seemed to make my lashes more brittle.  My hair and nails have been growing great, but not so the lashes.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me!</li>
            <li> It works great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This really works!  Takes a few werks before you notice.  I recommend it !</li>
            <li> Just received this product so can&#x27;t see any effects but looks promising.</li>
            <li> The pro lash did not work for me. I used it every day for about five weeks and could not tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I tried it often but did not really see any dramatic affects</li>
            <li> I have been using Prolash for about two weeks. So far it seems to be working.  My lashes are long and full and I don&#x27;t seem to have any gaps. I have used other eyelash serums before and this is similar. I like that this is a large tube of the serum and it is see-through so you can see much you have left. The brush is a little thicker than other brushes I have used so I have to be careful that I don&#x27;t get too much. I wear contacts and this does not seem to irritate my eyes. I only use this at night. I think this is a good buy  and I will update my review in a few more weeks to see if there are any changes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to post results, but I am giving it a five star rating due to outstanding customer service  and the clear tube it comes in. So easy to see how much you are using and how quickly you would need to reorder.</li>
            <li> I use this product because I have eyelash extensions and need my lashes to be strong and thick to hold the fake ones. My eyelashes grow almost too fast now and I have to have the extensions filled a little more often than before but that&#x27;s a fair trade with how strong my lashes hold now.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it. I&#x27;ve used half the bottle and it hasn&#x27;t worked at all. Waste of my money. If zero stars were acceptable, I would&#x27;ve stuck with that. I don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> Well not really sure growth,  guess keeping going tryout not given up.</li>
            <li> I used it on my eyebrows - really works!</li>
            <li> I reviewed this before but for some reason it is not there anymore. I love this product. After using it for what seems like forever I still apply it everyday and it totally has worked miracles.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few reviews I&#x27;ve written for a product. The only reason I&#x27;m writing is because I studied the reviews of this product in order to make my purchase and I hope my opinion helps someone else decide. I&#x27;ve been using this every night since I got it and there&#x27;s been no change. I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects which is why I gave it two stars, but it really didn&#x27;t work for me. I will finish the bottle ... if my opinion changes, I&#x27;ll update here.</li>
            <li> I have used this products for 1 whole week now and every morning  I see some lashes fall off. I have not seen the full effect yet.&lt;br /&gt;I will come back after 4 weeks and post another review.</li>
            <li> More lashes? YES!  Longer lashes? NO!  After 6 weeks, there are definitely more lashes on my upper lids, but they are not any longer than they were at the start. There has been no improvement at all for my very short and sparse lower lashes. I plan to continue using the product, however, because even these minimal results are a welcome improvement.</li>
            <li> This arrived in a timely manner and works well. I can see the difference after a few applications as the mascara flows on. A great product for the money. :)</li>
            <li> Been using if for two months. Have not seen a difference. disappointed.</li>
            <li> I dint believe this could happen..but this stuff works..I had No eye lashes on the inner corner of my right eye..it has started growing now after using prolash..but it have to use it regularly for it to keep growing..it did get it in my eye by mistake..boy does it irritate ur eye for the rest of the day..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars only because I kept making a thick line on my lid as if I were applying eye liner and a few days later i got a wart like bump on my eye lid..&lt;br /&gt;but if u r desperate to have ur lashes grow, u should try this..just be careful when you apply and very regular in applying</li>
