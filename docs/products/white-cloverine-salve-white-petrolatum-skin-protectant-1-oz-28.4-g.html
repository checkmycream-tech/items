            <li>He has used a number of products including Bag Balm (a very good product which he has used for years when in the dairy business), Working Hands, Vaseline and Carbolated Vaseline, Krazy glue on the cracks, and a number of types of  hand creams/lotions.</li>

            <li>She ordered it through a catalog and paid more for 2 containers of it than I did for 6.  </li>
            <li>so glad it&#x27;s still available!</li>
            <li>Cloverine has made all the difference in healing his hands and keeping them healthy.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>but I am sure glad I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product and ordered 6 of them.</li>
            <li>This salve is one of my mother&#x27;s favorites for many years, and she is pleased that&lt;br /&gt;she has been able to find it available once more.  </li>
            <li>It is the greatest for chapped, dry lips in winter or to help heal/protect cuts, etc.</li>
            <li>we use this product for chapped skin, dry cracked lips, its wonderful.</li>
            <li>My mother used this product for many years and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>thanks for a good job well done.</li>
            <li>Happy to say, it is still the same salve I remember,</li>
            <li>Cloverine Salve has been available since the 1800s for a reason.  </li>
            <li>I am now turning a new generation onto it as my daughter and all her friends love it!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t available locally anymore, so I was delighted to find it online.</li>
            <li>It is the absolute best for chapped lips and rough areas.  </li>
            <li>We have used this item for many 40 years in our family for chapped lips, fingernails bitten to the quick, etc..  Even the newest generation is using it on the first sign of eczema.</li>
            <li>Great for rough feet, chapped hands and lips too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does feel much thicker than the Blistex, more of a reminder that you have petroleum jelly on your lips.</li>
            <li>and we love it, it really protects and nourishes the skin.</li>
            <li>It is a salve that is good for everything from scrapes to dry skin .</li>
            <li>I found out about this salve from my grandmother - it is the best for dry, cracked or rough skin issues.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>First tin I bought was 50 cents</li>
            <li>This old family cure all arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I know I would never take it anywhere because it&#x27;s too big to comfortably carry around in my pocket.</li>
            <li>I have known this product my whole life.  </li>
            <li>If you have scrapes, rough skin, etc.; this will help protect &amp; heal for sure.</li>
            <li>It is good to know I can get it through you because it is not available in any stores near me.</li>
            <li>The older ones were thrills because they remembered the \\&quot;healing\\&quot; that it provided when we were children.  </li>
            <li>You can try new and fancy if that&#x27;s your thing, but Cloverine Salve will ALWAYS be tops in its field.  </li>
            <li>I used this product when very young.</li>
            <li>This product is hard to find elsewhere and I am glad to get it here.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day to keep my psoriasis under control on my ears and it keeps my ear moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>My mom had an old tin of this stuff from years ago</li>
            <li>Stuff from the Old U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is an old standby.  </li>
            <li>I have used this salve since I was a young child.</li>
            <li>Beats a major share of these new products that are out.  </li>
            <li>Other products feel soothing at first, but often leave my lips feeling drier than ever after a short time.  </li>

            <li> It is not heavy and greasy like some other products.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing to use on scraps and small cuts and also for chapped skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing (out of many) that I have tried that protect and soothe my lips during the cold winters months in the north.</li>
            <li> Chapped lips, facial blemishes, cracked or dry skin</li>
            <li> Its been a long time since Ive had any Cloverine</li>
            <li> This Salve also  helps with dry and rough skin on hands and fingers, and chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my husband for his rough chapped hands and he said it is miracle salve.</li>
            <li> I remember that this is what my mother used when I was growing up, and found an almost empty tin that I had as a keepsake.  </li>
            <li> I also rub into my cuticles and rough fingertips in the winter.  </li>
            <li> It is a product that our family had used for years and it is not easy to find in local retail stores or pharmacies.  </li>
            <li> Have tried tons of other products to no avail.</li>
            <li> I typically use Blistex, because it&#x27;s not overly thick and the medicated nature of it has a slight cooling</li>
            <li> The jelly becomes a bit stiff and it feels like your lips are made from wax</li>
            <li> Just a little bit every night and my lips &amp; nose don&#x27;t crack and bleed from using a tissue (allergies!)</li>
            <li> Cloverine does not contain artificial antibiotics but naturally controls infection while promoting healing.</li>
            <li> My grandmother introduced me to Cloverine salve when I was a small child with a skinned knee.  </li>
            <li> Both I and my teen aged son get painful cracks in our feet in Winter.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for the past 50+ years and hardly miss a night without applying it to my lips.</li>
            <li> I recommended to a potter whose fingers were painfully  cracked and infected regularly.</li>
            <li> He is recommending it to anyone who complains about the chapping/cracking issue due to cold weather.</li>
            <li> I recently underwent radiation treatment and had horrible radiation burns.  </li>
            <li> Had to buy 5 tins but for the price, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Without using it, my ears are crusty, dry and awful looking.  </li>
            <li> My wife suffers from cracked skin on her feet, and we&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive ointments to doctors to pedicures.</li>
            <li> And taking a sip of something cold?</li>
            <li> Having to work in the cold outdoors all winter, his hands will crack at the edges of the fingernails and be so painful.</li>
            <li> a child it was used for everything, cuts, chapped hands, cold sores, you name it and Mom would put Cloverine Salve on it!&lt;br /&gt;A wonder cure for everything!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But as I am very bad at mis-placing stuff, I have this can sitting at my desk.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a miracle ointment - and, in my opinion, is a good sleep aid besides! I&#x27;ve used it for years, and this seller is fantastic, too!</li>
            <li> It was exactly as I had before and worked very good.  Thanks!  It is good to know I can get it through you because it is not available in any stores near me.</li>
            <li> I have used Cloverine Salve for many, many years and it is the greatest product.  I use it every day to keep my psoriasis under control on my ears and it keeps my ear moist and soft.  Without using it, my ears are crusty, dry and awful looking.  This Salve also  helps with dry and rough skin on hands and fingers, and chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I use Cloverine on my lips and nose (allergies!) every night, and have done so for most of my 56 years.  My father used it before me; in fact, he taught me about it.  Just a little bit every night and my lips &amp; nose don&#x27;t crack and bleed from using a tissue (allergies!) all the time.  Best of all, it smells good without being perfumy!</li>
            <li> This suff is the best.My mom had an old tin of this stuff from years ago and I tried if and it is wonderful. I gave it to my husband for his rough chapped hands and he said it is miracle salve. He asked me to order him a supply of his own. He now uses it nightly and loves it.</li>
            <li> I use this product because my mother and my grandmother swore by it!  It is the best for chapped lips!  I am now turning a new generation onto it as my daughter and all her friends love it!</li>
            <li> Both I and my teen aged son get painful cracks in our feet in Winter.  This salve is the only thing that helps.  Have tried tons of other products to no avail. Don&#x27;t know why this works and others don&#x27;t as all are mostly petrolatum based, but there you go. Now I just order us both a six pack and are happy to be able to get it   JC</li>
            <li> Been Looking for this for years. Found it here.&lt;br /&gt;Good Stuff from the Old U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;BuBu&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G60IC2 White Cloverine Salve, White Petrolatum Skin Protectant, 1 oz (28.4 g) (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> My Grandmother sold this product when I was a child.  We put it on everything.  It is the absolute best for chapped lips and rough areas.  I bought several and gave them to family members.  The older ones were thrills because they remembered the \\&quot;healing\\&quot; that it provided when we were children.  I was very pleased to find it!</li>
            <li> Have used this for the past 50+ years and hardly miss a night without applying it to my lips. Not side effects and no staining of the bed linens. First tin I bought was 50 cents but as everything else, the price has gone up.</li>
            <li> This product has been around for over 70 years.  It is an old standby.  Beats a major share of these new products that are out.  Farmers even used this salve on the utters of their milking cows to keep them from cracking.  Call that an all around product?</li>
            <li> I typically use Blistex, because it&#x27;s not overly thick and the medicated nature of it has a slight cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I am very bad at mis-placing stuff, I have this can sitting at my desk. I know I would never take it anywhere because it&#x27;s too big to comfortably carry around in my pocket. So for the times when I cant find my Blistex, this works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel much thicker than the Blistex, more of a reminder that you have petroleum jelly on your lips. And taking a sip of something cold? The jelly becomes a bit stiff and it feels like your lips are made from wax paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, a good product and recommended.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product many times and was always satisfied. Great product.</li>
            <li> I found out about this salve from my grandmother - it is the best for dry, cracked or rough skin issues.</li>
            <li> Just the same as when my grandmother put it on me as a child.</li>
            <li> I have used this salve since I was a young child. It is very soothing to use on scraps and small cuts and also for chapped skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;A friend gave my husband a can to try. Having to work in the cold outdoors all winter, his hands will crack at the edges of the fingernails and be so painful. He has used a number of products including Bag Balm (a very good product which he has used for years when in the dairy business), Working Hands, Vaseline and Carbolated Vaseline, Krazy glue on the cracks, and a number of types of  hand creams/lotions. All of these help but none of these products prevented the cracking issue until Cloverine.&lt;br /&gt;Using it since October, he has not had any cracking take place.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased 6 tins from Amazon and he keeps tins in several places so he can use it often. It is not heavy and greasy like some other products. He is recommending it to anyone who complains about the chapping/cracking issue due to cold weather. In fact, he has given tins to others so they can try it, too.</li>
            <li> I grew up using Cloverine salve. It is the greatest for chapped, dry lips in winter or to help heal/protect cuts, etc. It isn&#x27;t available locally anymore, so I was delighted to find it online. I ordered the six pack. Feel that the price was totally in line. I&#x27;m so glad to have found it again and I will be ordering more. All my family want a tin now !</li>
            <li> We have used this item for many 40 years in our family for chapped lips, fingernails bitten to the quick, etc..  Even the newest generation is using it on the first sign of eczema.</li>
            <li> we use this product for chapped skin, dry cracked lips, its wonderful. my grandparents used to use this product for us when we were little/certainly hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> We have lots of uses for this salve at our house, from chapped lips to cuts on a foot.  I guess you could say it&#x27;s good from head to toe.</li>
            <li> I am 68, and was so glad I found Cloverine Salve.I remember that this is what my mother used when I was growing up, and found an almost empty tin that I had as a keepsake.  I recently underwent radiation treatment and had horrible radiation burns.  Nothing was healing the burns until I got the Cloverine.  Within a day the pain was relived, and within two days the burns showed healing.&lt;br /&gt;As a child it was used for everything, cuts, chapped hands, cold sores, you name it and Mom would put Cloverine Salve on it!&lt;br /&gt;A wonder cure for everything!  I bought 6 cans and gave a can to each of my four kids...kept two for me...love this product!</li>
            <li> I have used several tins of this over the years. No matter what else I try, I keep coming back to this product. It&#x27;s the only thing (out of many) that I have tried that protect and soothe my lips during the cold winters months in the north.</li>
            <li> This product has been around since I was a kid. Best cream or petroleum product you can use for cuts, scraps, burns especially.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from cracked skin on her feet, and we&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive ointments to doctors to pedicures. 2 weeks into using this, no cracked feet. Get it.</li>
            <li> As Always With Amazon.  Every thing is perfect.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom, she has used this product for many years.  She ordered it through a catalog and paid more for 2 containers of it than I did for 6.  I will order it again the next time she needs it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  This was my Grandma&#x27;s \\&quot;go to \\&quot; for everything from scraped knees to oven burns to chapped lips. Happy to say, it is still the same salve I remember, so glad it&#x27;s still available!</li>
            <li> Cloverine does not contain artificial antibiotics but naturally controls infection while promoting healing. I use it for scrapes, cuts, blisters, etc rather than a skin antibiotic.  I recommended to a potter whose fingers were painfully  cracked and infected regularly. Cloverine has made all the difference in healing his hands and keeping them healthy.</li>
            <li> I have known this product my whole life.  My mother always used it and her mother before her.  It is great for summer chafing and I keep it around all the time.  DOes not have that greasy feel and can be used for chapped hands or feet; sweat chafing; softening.  This product is hard to find elsewhere and I am glad to get it here.  I always buy the six pack and give away a couple to friends and then keep the rest for myself.</li>
            <li> I used to ride around on my bicyle and sell this product door to door some 60 years ago and it is just as good today as then. It is a salve that is good for everything from scrapes to dry skin .</li>
            <li> My mom loves this salve and this was a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! If you have scrapes, rough skin, etc.; this will help protect &amp; heal for sure. Best used if you apply before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Cloverine Salve has been available since the 1800s for a reason.  It works.  Chapped lips, facial blemishes, cracked or dry skin…you name it.  You can try new and fancy if that&#x27;s your thing, but Cloverine Salve will ALWAYS be tops in its field.  Try it.</li>
            <li> I used this product when very young. I have used the six cans and have not had any cause for regret in obtaining them. I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> The Cloverine Salve has been used for years in our family and we love it, it really protects and nourishes the skin. Thank you for many years of great service. Sherrie Taylor and Mittie Russell</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Other products feel soothing at first, but often leave my lips feeling drier than ever after a short time.  Cloverine Salve actually heals and softens skin long-term.  I also rub into my cuticles and rough fingertips in the winter.  I&#x27;m so glad to find Cloverine salve on-line!</li>
            <li> FINALLY! The salve I remember from my childhood. Its been a long time since Ive had any Cloverine but I am sure glad I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is great for chapped lips, cheeks and hands.  I have used this for over 55 yes.</li>
            <li> My mother used this product for many years and liked it very much. I bought 6 cans and I am still useing it.</li>
            <li> My grandmother introduced me to Cloverine salve when I was a small child with a skinned knee.  It always worked wonders for me. Great for rough feet, chapped hands and lips too.  Can&#x27;t seem to find it in any drug stores. Had to buy 5 tins but for the price, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Salve it&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li> This old family cure all arrived quickly.  It is a product that our family had used for years and it is not easy to find in local retail stores or pharmacies.  Thank you for making our family happy.</li>
            <li> aLL OF IT WAS MELTED AND COULDN&#x27;T GET CANS OPEN</li>
            <li> I have purchased Cloverine Salve for awhile now and am very satisfied with the product that is received, as well as the speed of the delivery.  This salve is one of my mother&#x27;s favorites for many years, and she is pleased that&lt;br /&gt;she has been able to find it available once more.  Carol C.</li>
            <li> MY MOM USED THIS IN THE 50S&lt;br /&gt;. I love this product and ordered 6 of them. keep up the good work</li>
