            <li>I found the best way to get non greasy hair after is to thoroughly scrub the shampoo on all roots (avoiding hair ends).</li>

            <li>Very nice shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for all the good reviews it had and it is really great for the keratin treatments.</li>
            <li>Nice product!  </li>
            <li>It smells great, leaves my hair with great volume, and makes my hair perfect smooth.</li>
            <li>These were good shampoos and were what would use when I straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>I chose this one because it had some good reviews.</li>
            <li>Was leary about buying online but works just as good as the ones from the salon where I got my Keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>If this product didn&#x27;t work so good to lengthen the benefits of my Keratin treatment</li>
            <li>Good shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product and when it arrived I thought I had gotten a good deal because the bottle looked like my salon product.  </li>
            <li>I trusted that this was a good product because it was shipped through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It has been good for my hair by reducing the frizzy effect.  </li>
            <li>I heard a lot of good things about this shampoo, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It truly helps maintain your treatment; your hair feels great and it has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo did not lather good whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>The original formula is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>Is great love</li>
            <li>These smell so good and feel amazing on your hair.</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>it arrived, i was glad it arrived on time!</li>
            <li>and I cant ask for a better Shampoo and Conditioner!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and the best price I could find.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner combo is a way better deal on amazon than at Ulta where each bottle is $20!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Smells great, leaves hair smooth &amp; protects highlights.</li>
            <li>and it was amazing...</li>
            <li>not so amazing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner are absolutely amazing...</li>
            <li>but it is amazing if you can&#x27;t afford salon treatments.</li>
            <li>kind of like something burnt..</li>
            <li>My color does stay nice, but I also have ellumin in my hair which doesn&#x27;t come out unless you cut it off.</li>
            <li>Coppola is now separated and has his own line.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.  </li>
            <li>thanks  for the product, excellent</li>
            <li>When received, both bottles were wrapped in plastic wrap which was a nice touch to prevent any leakage-- none</li>
            <li>I love this product, I get regular Keratin treatments and this is the best shampoo and hair conditioner to use, it is very gentle on your hair and keeps it in great condition!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended it and it is simply wonderful for dyed hair, as it respects the color and keeps your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo and conditoner I bought so far I had a keratin hair treatment</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have hair that tends to frizz in damp weather, and this keeps it very smooth and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>, it feels very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Having used this product many times, I figured I would try Amazon ..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Either way, my hair feels better</li>
            <li>It just keeps getting better and better after every use.</li>
            <li>I liked the cheap Suave keratin system over this.</li>
            <li>I got these from my hair stylist and they keep my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>received them in a timely manner with safe wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Suggested this product to a co-worker recently who had also suffered a coloring disaster, and she was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I might consider another product, as the scent is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, just not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product especially when shampoo and conditioner is used.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>maybe not being authentic</li>
            <li>I used most of it but could not finish it because I did not like the consistency.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner has played a role in restoring a healthy shine to my hair again.  </li>
            <li>(color safe) free&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is FANTASTIC&lt;br /&gt;Has not affected my hair color</li>
            <li>Many years ago Coppola went into partnership to make this product, but has since parted ways.</li>
            <li>, Amazon is not an authorized seller of Coppola products so there is no guarantee that they are even authentic.</li>
            <li>even when I decided not to retreat with the keratin, I was able to use up these products on my relaxed hair without problems.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>it love it</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of month, my hair became healthy again.</li>
            <li>It feels great and is so much easier to straighten.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair, and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>I recently had the keratin smoothing treatment done and this works great!!!  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money for this at the Salon.</li>
            <li>My stylist gave me this after coloring my hair and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered from amazon many times and never a problem</li>
            <li>Same great product as the one you would find at a salon!</li>
            <li>so its better for hair,less drying</li>
            <li>sure how these products would feel without the Keratin Smoothing Treatment.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I felt like cheaper drug store brands would be better than this..</li>
            <li>I was washing my hair, I noticed it had a nice clean neutral scent.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous now to be able to enjoy even rainy days without wondering if my hair has \\&quot;grown\\&quot;!:-)</li>
            <li>Thinking there was a mistake that could be easily fixed, I contacted Larkin thinking they would be more than happy to help - not the case.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair smooth and the best thing i can actually skip a day of washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>This item is great for the following reason: Great price, great product that leaves my hair silky smooth and not dry and quick shipping!  </li>
            <li>I noticed that Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner works much better for my color treated hair fine hair.</li>
            <li>and thus it breaks and dries out easily.</li>
            <li>If you leave it in your hair for two minutes I found I got a much better clean out of it.</li>
            <li>my hair tangles easily.</li>
            <li>It works just fine</li>
            <li>The conditioner was fine.</li>
            <li>The less lather from hair products I have learned is best for my hair type.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was fine.</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference with the very first use!</li>
            <li>Silky smooth</li>
            <li>I honestly think my hair is much healthier.</li>
            <li>So, to be cheap, I tried another &amp;#34;keratin&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is, as stated, free of sodium chloride and sulfate.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>so protecting my hair is really important.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel incredibly smooth -</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky smooth without an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Pretty good products, looks different than the picture but overall great!</li>
            <li>While the lack of lather is the price that is paid for doing without these two ingredients, this product (unlike some others), distributes nicely throughout the hair even without the lather, and leaves my hair feeling clean and very manageable.</li>
            <li>but i compared it to my original shampoo and condition (kapola products).</li>
            <li>I continue to use this product on my hair and am never disappointed.  </li>
            <li>products came opened and spilling out with everything but the original shampoo and conditioner in them.</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist who uses this product and the product that Febstore sent me was NOT the original.</li>
            <li>I didnt see significant improvement, may be could be my hair type .</li>
            <li>Not too small, perfect.</li>
            <li>I do not have the original packing or receipt, but I do not plan on buying from GSM King again ...</li>
            <li>I got this combo from my stylist originally.</li>
            <li>I was very very excited to get this cheaper than salons and stores, but I was very very dissapointed after I got it.</li>
            <li>The products are nothing special and no miracle cure.</li>
            <li>The price is great, the size of the products are what I expected.</li>
            <li>The product works very well, and I will continue to use until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>Gentle on hair that even our guests love and ask about the product.</li>
            <li>Keratin complex color care shampoo and conditioner works perfect for me since I have the Keratin hair relaxer in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Actually, it is best to do without these with color-treated or delicate hair of any type, as they strip the hair.  </li>
            <li>It works and it works fast. :)</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very good quality shampoo and conditioner for very curly and/or dry hair</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling very clean and&lt;br /&gt;looking very shiney.</li>
            <li>Love the new hair line products!</li>
            <li>Great, after a lifetime, literally of bad hair days every day, I look great every day, and every one I meet, mentions my hair.</li>
            <li>Im very dissappointed that this product was misrepresented I will be returning this garbage, which by the way even smells cheap.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.</li>
            <li>I use another conditioner(Bed Head self absorbed) after I use this one.</li>
            <li>I also had to wash my hair more frequently.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase-</li>
            <li>I picked it up in a salon not long after a hair coloring disaster that damaged my hair, which is fragile and fine to begin with and becoming more so with age.  </li>
            <li>the actual Coppola brand is fabulous in keeping my hair strong, lustrous, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I paid $375 in December, for the whole thing--the full on Coppola Keratin straightening treatment.</li>
            <li>After a few different trial runs I have come to find this shampoo and conditioner to be great!</li>
            <li>They are very gentle.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li>But after 3 hours after my first wash, I felt the difference.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it out since it was my first time buying any hair products online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these products, hair looks healthy and shine.</li>
            <li>I bought it at Ulta and paid a higher price</li>
            <li>Also for the conditioner I only put it on my ends and tried not to leave it on for more than a minute.</li>
            <li>This is the exact opposite of what most hair products recommend.</li>
            <li>the keratin complex color care shampoo and conditioner did a great job preserving my color when I had keratin done to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Feels and looks much healthier!</li>
            <li>First of all, the products do not work.  </li>
            <li>The company&#x27;s only response -- they&#x27;d send me more products.</li>
            <li>my hair was coarse and I tried many things and Keratin</li>
            <li>Very affordable on Amazon - recommend it to all!</li>
            <li>(after I told him exactly what to order - again</li>
            <li>This is especially good after an expensive keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge savings but enough to make it worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i then tried the tresemme keratin infused shampoo; it was much cheaper and had better results actually..</li>
            <li>And to be fair helped with the keratin treatment but will try different brand next time.</li>
            <li>In the long run, I&#x27;m more upset with myself for being too trusting of an online product.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner smooths out the waves so that they flow better and do not get dry or frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair smelled nice, had 30% less frizz, and I could run my hands through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually used it a couple of times before the treatment and my hair definitely was better behaved!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any real change in my keratin treated hair with this versus regular sulfate free shampoo, either way my keratin starts to lose it&#x27;s smoothness after 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>When I used the conditioner, it was very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was questioning whether this shampoo and conditioner really made a difference--I still have to spend forever straightening my hair, so what&#x27;s the advantage?</li>
            <li>It did not work as they claimed it would by reducing friz and the shampoo was very watery.</li>
            <li>You could see how much difference it made in her hair condition.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I saw it being sold at a very upscale salon for 3 x</li>
            <li>These products keep my hair very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These two work very well with my hair type.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Price on amazon was much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this product so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month now and don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a scent...</li>
            <li>It seems to be gentle on colored hair like it states.  </li>
            <li>reduced frizz&lt;br /&gt;Works much like Matrix Sleeklooks, but is sulfate</li>
            <li>The bottom of the shower gets really, really slippery</li>
            <li>It is not the same Keratin Condition, is that why it was so cheap?</li>
            <li>did the job very well.</li>
            <li>I really recommend that</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this because I kept hearing so much about keratin.  </li>
            <li>It works with keeping my hair straight and keeps the color in tact.</li>
            <li>It really helps control the frizz.</li>
            <li>My hair is noticably smoother and much simpler to style--even just get up in a ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very well.</li>
            <li>I comb my hair easily and because i have thick long hair, being able to feel you hair is light on your head</li>
            <li>I live in hot and humid Florida and had the Keratin treatment at my salon.  </li>
            <li>I really like these products, because they have helped smooth my frizzy and curly hair with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>They work much better than other Keratin shampoo and conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li>This just didn&#x27;t really do it for me, bought it mainly to preserve the keratin which it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If only the conditiiner could clean as well as condition, then I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with the straw making shampoo.</li>
            <li>The whole point of buying salon quality shampoo/conditioner is the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use more than a dime size amount to wash your hair with which leaves you with a bottle lasting at least 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>helps extend it to last ~5 months (pretty consistently as I have received it 3x over the past 2 years) which is awesome because it&#x27;s not a cheap treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and straight!</li>
            <li>Ok didn&#x27;t think much of it until I went to use it and the shampoo was severely watered down!</li>
            <li>With this product I have more good days than bad.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to smooth out my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>In the past I had bought this product from ULTA and was pretty confident of it.</li>
            <li>to some mistake or mishandling of this particular bottle, it is not representative of the product itself.  </li>
            <li>have never used it outside of the Keratin Smoothing treatment I received but it continues to keep my hair sleek, shiny, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottles of this shampoo and conditioner (exact same) from my salon -</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Then it was even more obvious after straightening it with my flat iron.</li>
            <li>Coppolla products are sulfates and sodium chloride free and not very sudsy.  </li>
            <li>I live in the South with major humidity and have spent so many dollars on products to straighten, defrizz, decurl, defuzz, etc.</li>
            <li>The other bottles that have Coppolla written down at the bottom and all the writing is horizontal os the good shampoo.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and live in Louisiana</li>
            <li>Recently I switched to a different sulfate free shampoo to see the difference.</li>
            <li>I found the conditioner is more effective if left on for an extended period (like over-night) and rinsed out with cold water.</li>
            <li>But I found it gave me the cleanest not oily hair while also leaving it soft and silky when I styled it!</li>
            <li>I have had to seek medical attention to deal with the situation at a significant expense for a steroid shampoo prescription needed to reduce the inflammation, multiple physician visits, etc.</li>
            <li>keep my keratin treatment in tact for as long as possible and not leave my hair greasy like a lot of sulfate free products do.</li>
            <li>With the Keratin Complex my hair turns out very smooth and the texture feels silky.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, new bottles, have yet to try, but product has different packaging, which kind of confused me.</li>
            <li>I get complements on it all the time (and I&#x27;m old)</li>
            <li>And Amazon is cheaper, by far, than anyone out there.</li>
            <li>, much!they give to me a health, soft and shine hair.</li>
            <li>This product simply works... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of products for my natural curly, dyed hair.  </li>
            <li>But this is not comparable to the professional products I bought at the saloon.</li>
            <li>Second, my hair became very oily and matted.  </li>
            <li>Finally, after multiple tries, I was able to speak with one representative who was curt and unsympathetic.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft...</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner leave my hair so soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and feeling nice,good smell also.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly or wavy hair, and this product helps out with the frizz and all.</li>
            <li>Seems thin as if diluted but leaves hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so it really cuts down my dry time in the morning.</li>
            <li>I like that both the shampoo and conditioner are pure white- not beige or yellow as most others, because I have snow white hair and other products</li>
            <li>other good keratin treatments, it is harder to get volume or brush-curl when blow-drying, so hair is a little flat, but it&#x27;s worth it to get longer-lasting color and frizz control.</li>
            <li>I was very careful to check that the brand was Coppola when the product actually arrived it was a cheap knock off version.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as what I used in the past and have no issues with it, not too sure what others received.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is reasonable and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The product is light enough, at least in my case, that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this again unless I find a stronger pure white Keratin conditioner for the same money.</li>
            <li>Came in new blue packaging.</li>
            <li>With the other stuff, it felt heavy and frizzy and it wasn&#x27;t very so smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought it and have no regrets!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Of note, the shampoo and conditioner pictured above is a different, possibly older, picture than the product shipped.</li>
            <li>After just 3 uses, my hair is much smoother, although I cannot tell whether it&#x27;s because all the rough ones have been smoothed out or fallen out.</li>
            <li>so I think I&#x27;ll try buying directly from the salon next time.</li>
            <li>really, just be careful when rinsing the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I was careful when buying a new hair product because my hair is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>It leaves my (normally dry from color treating)hair so soft and moisturized!!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t hang straight and flowing down my back, but my hair was very soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am sending it back and would like to find a reputable seller!</li>
            <li>this product and the product that Keratin Complex sent me was NOT the original.</li>
            <li>There are no other medical or product-based explanations for this situation.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, dark, fine, but frizzy hair (probably too much blow drying and flat ironing).  </li>
            <li>just your average store bought products because I didn&#x27;t think it really made a difference which products you used</li>
            <li>That alone benefits hair, but it also has keratin and other proteins which really make a difference to damaged or fragile hair.  </li>
            <li>and it is really watered down.</li>
            <li>but like I said the product was very watered down.  </li>
            <li>but this particular seller seemed to water it down.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice product!  </li>
            <li> It smells great, leaves my hair with great volume, and makes my hair perfect smooth.</li>
            <li> These were good shampoos and were what would use when I straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I chose this one because it had some good reviews.</li>
            <li> Was leary about buying online but works just as good as the ones from the salon where I got my Keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> If this product didn&#x27;t work so good to lengthen the benefits of my Keratin treatment</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product and when it arrived I thought I had gotten a good deal because the bottle looked like my salon product.  </li>
            <li> I trusted that this was a good product because it was shipped through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It has been good for my hair by reducing the frizzy effect.  </li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good things about this shampoo, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It truly helps maintain your treatment; your hair feels great and it has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo did not lather good whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> The original formula is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Is great love</li>
            <li> These smell so good and feel amazing on your hair.</li>
            <li> We are very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> it arrived, i was glad it arrived on time!</li>
            <li> and I cant ask for a better Shampoo and Conditioner!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner combo is a way better deal on amazon than at Ulta where each bottle is $20!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves hair smooth &amp; protects highlights.</li>
            <li> and it was amazing...</li>
            <li> not so amazing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are absolutely amazing...</li>
            <li> but it is amazing if you can&#x27;t afford salon treatments.</li>
            <li> kind of like something burnt..</li>
            <li> My color does stay nice, but I also have ellumin in my hair which doesn&#x27;t come out unless you cut it off.</li>
            <li> Coppola is now separated and has his own line.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too.  </li>
            <li> thanks  for the product, excellent</li>
            <li> When received, both bottles were wrapped in plastic wrap which was a nice touch to prevent any leakage-- none</li>
            <li> I love this product, I get regular Keratin treatments and this is the best shampoo and hair conditioner to use, it is very gentle on your hair and keeps it in great condition!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended it and it is simply wonderful for dyed hair, as it respects the color and keeps your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditoner I bought so far I had a keratin hair treatment</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I have hair that tends to frizz in damp weather, and this keeps it very smooth and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li> , it feels very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Having used this product many times, I figured I would try Amazon ..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Either way, my hair feels better</li>
            <li> It just keeps getting better and better after every use.</li>
            <li> I liked the cheap Suave keratin system over this.</li>
            <li> I got these from my hair stylist and they keep my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> received them in a timely manner with safe wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Suggested this product to a co-worker recently who had also suffered a coloring disaster, and she was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I might consider another product, as the scent is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, just not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product especially when shampoo and conditioner is used.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> maybe not being authentic</li>
            <li> I used most of it but could not finish it because I did not like the consistency.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner has played a role in restoring a healthy shine to my hair again.  </li>
            <li> (color safe) free&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is FANTASTIC&lt;br /&gt;Has not affected my hair color</li>
            <li> Many years ago Coppola went into partnership to make this product, but has since parted ways.</li>
            <li> , Amazon is not an authorized seller of Coppola products so there is no guarantee that they are even authentic.</li>
            <li> even when I decided not to retreat with the keratin, I was able to use up these products on my relaxed hair without problems.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> it love it</li>
            <li> love it love it</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of month, my hair became healthy again.</li>
            <li> It feels great and is so much easier to straighten.</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my hair, and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> I recently had the keratin smoothing treatment done and this works great!!!  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money for this at the Salon.</li>
            <li> My stylist gave me this after coloring my hair and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and love it.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered from amazon many times and never a problem</li>
            <li> Same great product as the one you would find at a salon!</li>
            <li> so its better for hair,less drying</li>
            <li> sure how these products would feel without the Keratin Smoothing Treatment.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I felt like cheaper drug store brands would be better than this..</li>
            <li> I was washing my hair, I noticed it had a nice clean neutral scent.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous now to be able to enjoy even rainy days without wondering if my hair has \\&quot;grown\\&quot;!:-)</li>
            <li> Thinking there was a mistake that could be easily fixed, I contacted Larkin thinking they would be more than happy to help - not the case.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair smooth and the best thing i can actually skip a day of washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> This item is great for the following reason: Great price, great product that leaves my hair silky smooth and not dry and quick shipping!  </li>
            <li> I noticed that Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner works much better for my color treated hair fine hair.</li>
            <li> and thus it breaks and dries out easily.</li>
            <li> If you leave it in your hair for two minutes I found I got a much better clean out of it.</li>
            <li> my hair tangles easily.</li>
            <li> It works just fine</li>
            <li> The conditioner was fine.</li>
            <li> The less lather from hair products I have learned is best for my hair type.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was fine.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference with the very first use!</li>
            <li> Silky smooth</li>
            <li> I honestly think my hair is much healthier.</li>
            <li> So, to be cheap, I tried another &amp;#34;keratin&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is, as stated, free of sodium chloride and sulfate.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> so protecting my hair is really important.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel incredibly smooth -</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky smooth without an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Pretty good products, looks different than the picture but overall great!</li>
            <li> While the lack of lather is the price that is paid for doing without these two ingredients, this product (unlike some others), distributes nicely throughout the hair even without the lather, and leaves my hair feeling clean and very manageable.</li>
            <li> but i compared it to my original shampoo and condition (kapola products).</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product on my hair and am never disappointed.  </li>
            <li> products came opened and spilling out with everything but the original shampoo and conditioner in them.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist who uses this product and the product that Febstore sent me was NOT the original.</li>
            <li> I didnt see significant improvement, may be could be my hair type .</li>
            <li> Not too small, perfect.</li>
            <li> I do not have the original packing or receipt, but I do not plan on buying from GSM King again ...</li>
            <li> I got this combo from my stylist originally.</li>
            <li> I was very very excited to get this cheaper than salons and stores, but I was very very dissapointed after I got it.</li>
            <li> The products are nothing special and no miracle cure.</li>
            <li> The price is great, the size of the products are what I expected.</li>
            <li> The product works very well, and I will continue to use until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Gentle on hair that even our guests love and ask about the product.</li>
            <li> Keratin complex color care shampoo and conditioner works perfect for me since I have the Keratin hair relaxer in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it is best to do without these with color-treated or delicate hair of any type, as they strip the hair.  </li>
            <li> It works and it works fast. :)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very good quality shampoo and conditioner for very curly and/or dry hair</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling very clean and&lt;br /&gt;looking very shiney.</li>
            <li> Love the new hair line products!</li>
            <li> Great, after a lifetime, literally of bad hair days every day, I look great every day, and every one I meet, mentions my hair.</li>
            <li> Im very dissappointed that this product was misrepresented I will be returning this garbage, which by the way even smells cheap.</li>
            <li> It is worth it.</li>
            <li> I use another conditioner(Bed Head self absorbed) after I use this one.</li>
            <li> I also had to wash my hair more frequently.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase-</li>
            <li> I picked it up in a salon not long after a hair coloring disaster that damaged my hair, which is fragile and fine to begin with and becoming more so with age.  </li>
            <li> the actual Coppola brand is fabulous in keeping my hair strong, lustrous, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I paid $375 in December, for the whole thing--the full on Coppola Keratin straightening treatment.</li>
            <li> After a few different trial runs I have come to find this shampoo and conditioner to be great!</li>
            <li> They are very gentle.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> But after 3 hours after my first wash, I felt the difference.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it out since it was my first time buying any hair products online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these products, hair looks healthy and shine.</li>
            <li> I bought it at Ulta and paid a higher price</li>
            <li> Also for the conditioner I only put it on my ends and tried not to leave it on for more than a minute.</li>
            <li> This is the exact opposite of what most hair products recommend.</li>
            <li> the keratin complex color care shampoo and conditioner did a great job preserving my color when I had keratin done to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Feels and looks much healthier!</li>
            <li> First of all, the products do not work.  </li>
            <li> The company&#x27;s only response -- they&#x27;d send me more products.</li>
            <li> my hair was coarse and I tried many things and Keratin</li>
            <li> Very affordable on Amazon - recommend it to all!</li>
            <li> (after I told him exactly what to order - again</li>
            <li> This is especially good after an expensive keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a huge savings but enough to make it worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i then tried the tresemme keratin infused shampoo; it was much cheaper and had better results actually..</li>
            <li> And to be fair helped with the keratin treatment but will try different brand next time.</li>
            <li> In the long run, I&#x27;m more upset with myself for being too trusting of an online product.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smooths out the waves so that they flow better and do not get dry or frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair smelled nice, had 30% less frizz, and I could run my hands through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually used it a couple of times before the treatment and my hair definitely was better behaved!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any real change in my keratin treated hair with this versus regular sulfate free shampoo, either way my keratin starts to lose it&#x27;s smoothness after 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> When I used the conditioner, it was very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was questioning whether this shampoo and conditioner really made a difference--I still have to spend forever straightening my hair, so what&#x27;s the advantage?</li>
            <li> It did not work as they claimed it would by reducing friz and the shampoo was very watery.</li>
            <li> You could see how much difference it made in her hair condition.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I saw it being sold at a very upscale salon for 3 x</li>
            <li> These products keep my hair very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These two work very well with my hair type.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Price on amazon was much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this product so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month now and don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much of a scent...</li>
            <li> It seems to be gentle on colored hair like it states.  </li>
            <li> reduced frizz&lt;br /&gt;Works much like Matrix Sleeklooks, but is sulfate</li>
            <li> The bottom of the shower gets really, really slippery</li>
            <li> It is not the same Keratin Condition, is that why it was so cheap?</li>
            <li> did the job very well.</li>
            <li> I really recommend that</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because I kept hearing so much about keratin.  </li>
            <li> It works with keeping my hair straight and keeps the color in tact.</li>
            <li> It really helps control the frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticably smoother and much simpler to style--even just get up in a ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very well.</li>
            <li> I comb my hair easily and because i have thick long hair, being able to feel you hair is light on your head</li>
            <li> I live in hot and humid Florida and had the Keratin treatment at my salon.  </li>
            <li> I really like these products, because they have helped smooth my frizzy and curly hair with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> They work much better than other Keratin shampoo and conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t really do it for me, bought it mainly to preserve the keratin which it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If only the conditiiner could clean as well as condition, then I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with the straw making shampoo.</li>
            <li> The whole point of buying salon quality shampoo/conditioner is the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use more than a dime size amount to wash your hair with which leaves you with a bottle lasting at least 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> helps extend it to last ~5 months (pretty consistently as I have received it 3x over the past 2 years) which is awesome because it&#x27;s not a cheap treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and straight!</li>
            <li> Ok didn&#x27;t think much of it until I went to use it and the shampoo was severely watered down!</li>
            <li> With this product I have more good days than bad.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to smooth out my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> In the past I had bought this product from ULTA and was pretty confident of it.</li>
            <li> to some mistake or mishandling of this particular bottle, it is not representative of the product itself.  </li>
            <li> have never used it outside of the Keratin Smoothing treatment I received but it continues to keep my hair sleek, shiny, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottles of this shampoo and conditioner (exact same) from my salon -</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Then it was even more obvious after straightening it with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Coppolla products are sulfates and sodium chloride free and not very sudsy.  </li>
            <li> I live in the South with major humidity and have spent so many dollars on products to straighten, defrizz, decurl, defuzz, etc.</li>
            <li> The other bottles that have Coppolla written down at the bottom and all the writing is horizontal os the good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and live in Louisiana</li>
            <li> Recently I switched to a different sulfate free shampoo to see the difference.</li>
            <li> I found the conditioner is more effective if left on for an extended period (like over-night) and rinsed out with cold water.</li>
            <li> But I found it gave me the cleanest not oily hair while also leaving it soft and silky when I styled it!</li>
            <li> I have had to seek medical attention to deal with the situation at a significant expense for a steroid shampoo prescription needed to reduce the inflammation, multiple physician visits, etc.</li>
            <li> keep my keratin treatment in tact for as long as possible and not leave my hair greasy like a lot of sulfate free products do.</li>
            <li> With the Keratin Complex my hair turns out very smooth and the texture feels silky.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, new bottles, have yet to try, but product has different packaging, which kind of confused me.</li>
            <li> I get complements on it all the time (and I&#x27;m old)</li>
            <li> And Amazon is cheaper, by far, than anyone out there.</li>
            <li> , much!they give to me a health, soft and shine hair.</li>
            <li> This product simply works... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of products for my natural curly, dyed hair.  </li>
            <li> But this is not comparable to the professional products I bought at the saloon.</li>
            <li> Second, my hair became very oily and matted.  </li>
            <li> Finally, after multiple tries, I was able to speak with one representative who was curt and unsympathetic.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft...</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leave my hair so soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and feeling nice,good smell also.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly or wavy hair, and this product helps out with the frizz and all.</li>
            <li> Seems thin as if diluted but leaves hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so it really cuts down my dry time in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like that both the shampoo and conditioner are pure white- not beige or yellow as most others, because I have snow white hair and other products</li>
            <li> other good keratin treatments, it is harder to get volume or brush-curl when blow-drying, so hair is a little flat, but it&#x27;s worth it to get longer-lasting color and frizz control.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to check that the brand was Coppola when the product actually arrived it was a cheap knock off version.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as what I used in the past and have no issues with it, not too sure what others received.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is reasonable and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The product is light enough, at least in my case, that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this again unless I find a stronger pure white Keratin conditioner for the same money.</li>
            <li> Came in new blue packaging.</li>
            <li> With the other stuff, it felt heavy and frizzy and it wasn&#x27;t very so smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought it and have no regrets!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Of note, the shampoo and conditioner pictured above is a different, possibly older, picture than the product shipped.</li>
            <li> After just 3 uses, my hair is much smoother, although I cannot tell whether it&#x27;s because all the rough ones have been smoothed out or fallen out.</li>
            <li> so I think I&#x27;ll try buying directly from the salon next time.</li>
            <li> really, just be careful when rinsing the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I was careful when buying a new hair product because my hair is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> It leaves my (normally dry from color treating)hair so soft and moisturized!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t hang straight and flowing down my back, but my hair was very soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am sending it back and would like to find a reputable seller!</li>
            <li> this product and the product that Keratin Complex sent me was NOT the original.</li>
            <li> There are no other medical or product-based explanations for this situation.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, dark, fine, but frizzy hair (probably too much blow drying and flat ironing).  </li>
            <li> just your average store bought products because I didn&#x27;t think it really made a difference which products you used</li>
            <li> That alone benefits hair, but it also has keratin and other proteins which really make a difference to damaged or fragile hair.  </li>
            <li> and it is really watered down.</li>
            <li> but like I said the product was very watered down.  </li>
            <li> but this particular seller seemed to water it down.  </li>
            <li> They said my only option is to HOPE my scalp/hair will eventually stabilize, and cut my hair short (spikey) to deal with the period wherein the lost hair (well over half the normal volume) starts to grow back.  </li>
            <li> Overall, for being sulfate free (which typically means not very good)</li>
            <li> would recommend it to all girls who have done the keratin treatment and need to restore it as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I will need to cut my long, waist-length hair short.  </li>
            <li> Not even as good shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> The shampoo has lots of lather and the conditioner leaves my hair really soft but not weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling dry like the shampoo stripped the hair and the conditioner didn&#x27;t add moisture.</li>
            <li> My salon recommended this shampoo and conditioner and said it would help stop my hair from being so \\&quot;straw like\\&quot; at the ends since I blow dry and straighten is on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Complete scam and waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Complete scam and waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Definitely watered down from the same stuff they sell at salons!!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> However, I have been using that conditioner for months with no effect other than detangling my hair daily.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the shampoo makes my hair a bit dry when applied but as soon as i use the conditioner</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair that was dry from getting colored.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done washing and conditioning my hair it does feel softer, but once I blow dry and straighten it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still dry on the ends</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair sooo silky and soft, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was definitely watered down.</li>
            <li> My recent purchase is not at all similar to past Keratin shampoo purchases I have made.  </li>
            <li> The Shampoo worked well and when compared with my previous bottle I knew it was the same product.  </li>
            <li> My hair became very dry after using it.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the package I noticed blue tape on the caps which to me seemed odd but assumed it was to keep them closed</li>
            <li> A little pricy, but serve up big!</li>
            <li> I do think they are little pricey since the conditioner only works</li>
            <li> Also, it only takes a little for each use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find a pair that will make my hair feel this insanely soft..</li>
            <li> Really tames my wild and crazy locks.</li>
            <li> Be careful-</li>
            <li> I spent a fortune on products to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; my problem, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> but I will be careful where I get it from.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo and conditioner, especially after having had a Keritan treatment, but slightly dissapointed that every time I order off of Amazon, the bottles are always expired by about one year-hence the slightly discounted price.</li>
            <li> I now have soft and manageable hair with very few tangles!</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not overall crazy about the shampoo, (it makes my hair feel like straw and very hard to get my hands through to wash out), I love the conditioner.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount, so even though the bottles are small they last a while.</li>
            <li> but I decided to because not many of the reviews were for people who did NOT have the actual salon keratin</li>
            <li> There are other people who also question the authenticity in the reviews below.</li>
            <li> Items were as expected and came in a timely manner!  </li>
            <li> and i just can&#x27;t use any other shampoo</li>
            <li> The hair still needs argan oil or other product to make it smoother and silkier.</li>
            <li> Not worth it if you spent a lot of money getting your hair straightened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some other reviews about this product</li>
            <li> I can tell immediately the difference between this and other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Some days it curls, other days, it behaves.</li>
            <li> I tried to return, but even after mentioning that I used the product only once and was not happy with it, the seller refused to take the product back.</li>
            <li> Product was watered down and not the same product that I usually purchase from CVS or Walmart...</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged by poor quality highlights and was extremely dried out, hard to brush and full of knots.</li>
            <li> With the other product, my hair felt extra thick and matted.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair but aggressive monthly coloring causes damage that makes it frizz out in weird ways.</li>
            <li> The Keratin Complex company was, initially, unresponsive.  </li>
            <li> I did the keratin straightening treatment for my hair from a salon and they recommended using this product to maintain the look - while it does help tone down frizz</li>
            <li> they have reformulated the shampoo and it is now almost watered down.</li>
            <li> I am so upset that my money has went down the drain for the treatment.  </li>
            <li> After I got it, the product was watered down...</li>
            <li> The shampoo is watered down.</li>
            <li> slightly concern about the authenticity or self life of this product.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner set, my hair feels smoother and is less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It takes three times the amount of shampoo to wash my hair than previously.  </li>
            <li> This duo seems to tame \\&quot;wild\\&quot; hair a bit due to the keratin, but I do have to use an additional product or two.  </li>
            <li> so why mess it up with a crummy shampoo?</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a normal shampoo and conditioner, nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair that I blow-dry, straighten, curl, and tease.</li>
            <li> i was a little skeptical of purchasing a high end shampoo.  </li>
            <li> was a little nervous</li>
            <li> the conditioner is a little on the runny, watery side</li>
            <li> I have been getting the keratin treatment for a little over a year and decided to try buying the shampoo and conditioner on amazon instead of at the salon.  </li>
            <li> and this helped to keep my treatment while I also I felt the shampoo cleaned my hair well unlike some other non-sulfate products I bought in the past.</li>
            <li> and I have very thick and processed hair (am a blonde)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $ on it...</li>
            <li> Had ordered this stuff online to save a few bucks</li>
            <li> Totally dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel not as fluffy</li>
            <li> I received this and for one the safety seal on the shampoo was missing and the conditioner it was halfway on.</li>
            <li> I use everyday.</li>
            <li> Afterward, you won&#x27;t waste your money on anything less!</li>
            <li> It still works though, the scent of the shampoo is just less noticeable!</li>
            <li> i used other shampoos, but will leave my hair extremely dull and greasy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the conditioner did not do the same job as my previous condition, so again I did a comparison</li>
            <li> So unfortunately in my case when I ordered from the link above, I ended up opening the product after 30 days.</li>
            <li> I noticed a small difference from what I was using but not alot.</li>
            <li> This is unbranded and not happy it was not.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sorry that my local salon doesn&#x27;t carry it any longer, and I must resort to buying it on line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a small fortune in my hair, trying leave-in conditioners, detangling sprays, and nothing over the years have worked as well as this product.</li>
            <li> anyone (man or woman) who has trouble controling their hair: because of frizz, tangels, chemical damage, I recomend giving this product a go!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with the Keratin Complex from now on.</li>
            <li> This product was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I had a Keratin Complex smoothing treatment at a salon and started using the shampoo and conditioner as was recommended.  </li>
            <li> at least for this product.</li>
            <li> Their is honestly no</li>
            <li> It does not come out of the bottle in a thick consistency, rather it &amp;#34;pours&amp;#34; out.</li>
            <li> I also use the keratin treatment every 2 months and no more split ends!</li>
            <li> Sorry Wen and all of the other</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were runny and thin not like its usual consistency.  </li>
            <li> I was seriously considering a Keratin treatment at the hair salon but have decided to hold-off at this time.</li>
            <li> I use this and Keratin Coppola Complex Infusion Keratin Replenisher and have seen a dramatic improvement.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and has lots of tangles.</li>
            <li> Hate when I order a product and the size is smaller than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> With the Keratin Complex, I can seriously go for 3 to 4 days between shampoos without my hair feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smelled SO OLD AND AWFUL!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> What looked like the product turned out to be fake.  </li>
            <li> BUT after randomly trying these after getting a hair cut, I had my eyes opened to the hair product industry.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 weeks ago because it is too expensive to buy from salons.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the &amp;#34;best</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fake as some others have said.</li>
            <li> Very thin, no texture and&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> it just smells too weird for me to like it!</li>
            <li> Worst service ever from Keratine Complex. should be kicked off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smell is bad.  </li>
            <li> but when it arrived I was disappointed to find a copy-cat ...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought these 2 together after a Brazilian treatment at the suggestion of my stylist and thought both products were watery and horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These were good shampoos and were what would use when I straighten my hair.  I no longer do this, so I no longer use this product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended it and it is simply wonderful for dyed hair, as it respects the color and keeps your hair soft and shiny. I also use the keratin treatment every 2 months and no more split ends! absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I did the keratin straightening treatment for my hair from a salon and they recommended using this product to maintain the look - while it does help tone down frizz it just smells too weird for me to like it! kind of like something burnt.. i then tried the tresemme keratin infused shampoo; it was much cheaper and had better results actually..</li>
            <li> Product maintains the duration of the straightening process. Also, the conditioner helps with shine, as well as what you expect from a good enrichment product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any real change in my keratin treated hair with this versus regular sulfate free shampoo, either way my keratin starts to lose it&#x27;s smoothness after 3-4 months. I have to use a ton of shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t spread well, and then use almost zero conditioner because it makes my hair greasy (and I apply from the ends up). My color does stay nice, but I also have ellumin in my hair which doesn&#x27;t come out unless you cut it off. This just didn&#x27;t really do it for me, bought it mainly to preserve the keratin which it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> We have curly hair in our family.  This shampoo and conditioner smooths out the waves so that they flow better and do not get dry or frizzy.</li>
            <li> I paid $375 in December, for the whole thing--the full on Coppola Keratin straightening treatment. It is worth it. I get complements on it all the time (and I&#x27;m old) so why mess it up with a crummy shampoo? This stuff makes your hair sooo silky and soft, it&#x27;s unbelievable. I can&#x27;t live without it. And Amazon is cheaper, by far, than anyone out there. You can&#x27;t go wrong. Don&#x27;t even bother with Ulta where it is now $20 PER BOTTLE. UGH. Use your Prime and get it here! And a little goes a long way with this product. I follow it with spray on It&#x27;s a 10 conditioner and comb out. Great, after a lifetime, literally of bad hair days every day, I look great every day, and every one I meet, mentions my hair. A lot of credit to my stylist who keeps me looking great.[[ASIN:B004K3D0FK It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Plus Keratin 4oz]]</li>
            <li> Having used this product many times, I figured I would try Amazon .. What looked like the product turned out to be fake.  It was a look-alike online but when it arrived I was disappointed to find a copy-cat ... Not even as good shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this conditioner/shampoo at all. Bought these 2 together after a Brazilian treatment at the suggestion of my stylist and thought both products were watery and horrible.</li>
            <li> yes, i like so, much!they give to me a health, soft and shine hair. I recomend to a friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves hair smooth &amp; protects highlights.</li>
            <li> I do Keratin smoothing at the salon, and use this shampoo and conditioner to make the results last longer.  I have hair that tends to frizz in damp weather, and this keeps it very smooth and frizz-free.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I used this product a friend had and it was amazing... then I order the same thing here... not so amazing. Different smell and feel... slightly concern about the authenticity or self life of this product.</li>
            <li> I was careful when buying a new hair product because my hair is so sensitive. I chose this one because it had some good reviews. Overall, it does make my hair feel smoother and keeps stray hairs from flying about. I have very fine hair and thus it breaks and dries out easily. After using this shampoo and conditioner set, my hair feels smoother and is less frizzy. However, it doesn&#x27;t help with the tangles. I use another conditioner(Bed Head self absorbed) after I use this one. However, I have been using that conditioner for months with no effect other than detangling my hair daily. After just 3 uses, my hair is much smoother, although I cannot tell whether it&#x27;s because all the rough ones have been smoothed out or fallen out. Either way, my hair feels better and I still have a ton left.</li>
            <li> It works!!! It just keeps getting better and better after every use. I&#x27;m reordering.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are absolutely amazing... I had always used just your average store bought products because I didn&#x27;t think it really made a difference which products you used BUT after randomly trying these after getting a hair cut, I had my eyes opened to the hair product industry. This product simply works... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like these at all. Left my hair feeling dry like the shampoo stripped the hair and the conditioner didn&#x27;t add moisture. I liked the cheap Suave keratin system over this.</li>
            <li> I had the Brazilian blowout on my hair done. I got these from my hair stylist and they keep my hair nice and smooth. You only have to use a small amount, so even though the bottles are small they last a while.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It is the same that you would find in a salon, but at a lower price.  I use it because I had the Keratin treatment performed by a salon and wanted to prevent the keratin treatment (as well as my color treatment) from being stripped from my hair too soon.  I would recommend this product and will continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li> Was leary about buying online but works just as good as the ones from the salon where I got my Keratin treatment.  Silky smooth</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review but I decided to because not many of the reviews were for people who did NOT have the actual salon keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not although I want and need one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received them in a timely manner with safe wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was washing my hair, I noticed it had a nice clean neutral scent. When I used the conditioner, it was very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little nervous (I didn&#x27;t give it a chance) because I brushed it and it was still knotty and frizzy. But after 3 hours after my first wash, I felt the difference. My hair smelled nice, had 30% less frizz, and I could run my hands through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by no means a miracle treatment but it is amazing if you can&#x27;t afford salon treatments. I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it is NOT the same as the one that ULTA carries. There are other people who also question the authenticity in the reviews below. In the past I had bought this product from ULTA and was pretty confident of it. So unfortunately in my case when I ordered from the link above, I ended up opening the product after 30 days. I tried to return, but even after mentioning that I used the product only once and was not happy with it, the seller refused to take the product back. The seller also mentioned that they do not take open product. Just wanted to share my experience.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for all the good reviews it had and it is really great for the keratin treatments. I gave it four stars because the shampoo makes my hair a bit dry when applied but as soon as i use the conditioner, it feels very smooth and silky. I comb my hair easily and because i have thick long hair, being able to feel you hair is light on your head is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to all girls who have done the keratin treatment and need to restore it as long as possible.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Really tames my wild and crazy locks. I honestly think my hair is much healthier.</li>
            <li> Items were as expected and came in a timely manner!  Would do buisness with this seller again!</li>
            <li> I noticed a small difference from what I was using but not alot. I don&#x27;t feel it made a big difference in the body of my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 weeks ago because it is too expensive to buy from salons. I decided to try it out since it was my first time buying any hair products online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, i was glad it arrived on time! However, it does make your hair non frizzy and all. It works just fine but i compared it to my original shampoo and condition (kapola products). The smell was completely different! I guess they dont add the same amount of ingredients? It still works though, the scent of the shampoo is just less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting Keratin Treatments for over a year now and I cant ask for a better Shampoo and Conditioner! It leaves my (normally dry from color treating)hair so soft and moisturized!! I love it. the conditioner is a little on the runny, watery side but it still does a great job. I would recommend whether or not you do Keratin treatments.</li>
            <li> Rather than buy this at my salon after my Keratin treatment I checked on Amazon and saved $$ and it was here in two days.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these products, hair looks healthy and shine. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and i just can&#x27;t use any other shampoo</li>
            <li> Not Coppola product, returned because I wanted to only buy Coppola product. This is unbranded and not happy it was not.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is with this. Bottles do not look the same as in stores and it is really watered down. I think it&#x27;s a fake. Use caution when buying.</li>
            <li> I was questioning whether this shampoo and conditioner really made a difference--I still have to spend forever straightening my hair, so what&#x27;s the advantage? So, to be cheap, I tried another &amp;#34;keratin&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner. OMG, the difference in the texture of my hair after rinsing out the conditioner was obvious. With the other product, my hair felt extra thick and matted. UGH! Then it was even more obvious after straightening it with my flat iron. With the Keratin Complex my hair turns out very smooth and the texture feels silky. With the other stuff, it felt heavy and frizzy and it wasn&#x27;t very so smooth. I also had to wash my hair more frequently. With the Keratin Complex, I can seriously go for 3 to 4 days between shampoos without my hair feeling dirty. I&#x27;m sticking with the Keratin Complex from now on.</li>
            <li> This product was a big disappointment. It did not work as they claimed it would by reducing friz and the shampoo was very watery.</li>
            <li> The best complement for the liquid keratin. They work in perfect armony with the treatment, making the hair unbeleivable great.</li>
            <li> Not Coppola. Came in new blue packaging. Coppola is now separated and has his own line.</li>
            <li> I live in hot and humid Florida and had the Keratin treatment at my salon.  My salon wanted me to purchase this product, but they retail cost was double of what I found here on Amazon.  The product makes my hair smoother and softer.  It smells nice too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now and swear by it.  I picked it up in a salon not long after a hair coloring disaster that damaged my hair, which is fragile and fine to begin with and becoming more so with age.  It is, as stated, free of sodium chloride and sulfate.  That alone benefits hair, but it also has keratin and other proteins which really make a difference to damaged or fragile hair.  Suggested this product to a co-worker recently who had also suffered a coloring disaster, and she was very happy with the results.  You could see how much difference it made in her hair condition.  The product is light enough, at least in my case, that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.  I&#x27;m just sorry that my local salon doesn&#x27;t carry it any longer, and I must resort to buying it on line.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Unfortunately the &amp;#34;best if used by date&amp;#34; had expired.</li>
            <li> Maintains the longevity of my keratin treatment....LOVE!</li>
            <li> Is great love this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so smooth and silky.  Will continue with it. Thank you</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Can&#x27;t beat the great price. I saw it being sold at a very upscale salon for 3 x the amount. Very good quality shampoo and conditioner for very curly and/or dry hair</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product on my hair and am never disappointed.  I have had Keratin treatments for the last 3 yrs so protecting my hair is really important.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Nice product!  It left my hair feeling wonderful.  I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. It smells great, leaves my hair with great volume, and makes my hair perfect smooth.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has lots of lather and the conditioner leaves my hair really soft but not weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> A great product combo. I have naturally straight hair but aggressive monthly coloring causes damage that makes it frizz out in weird ways. These products keep my hair very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other good keratin treatments, it is harder to get volume or brush-curl when blow-drying, so hair is a little flat, but it&#x27;s worth it to get longer-lasting color and frizz control.</li>
            <li> If this product didn&#x27;t work so good to lengthen the benefits of my Keratin treatment I might consider another product, as the scent is not my favorite. It&#x27;s not horrible, just not my favorite. The product works very well, and I will continue to use until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of products for my natural curly, dyed hair.  These two work very well with my hair type. A little pricy, but serve up big!</li>
            <li> Product was watered down and not the same product that I usually purchase from CVS or Walmart... Don&#x27;t waste your $ on it... Big rip off!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a normal shampoo and conditioner, nothing wrong with it. But this is not comparable to the professional products I bought at the saloon.</li>
            <li> My recent purchase is not at all similar to past Keratin shampoo purchases I have made.  The maker is the same, the brand is the same, the bottle is the same, that is all though.  It takes three times the amount of shampoo to wash my hair than previously.  My straightening treatments are not inexpensive and I now question the ingredients of this product.</li>
            <li> These smell so good and feel amazing on your hair. It makes my hair feel incredibly smooth - almost like I just had a Keratin treatment at the salon.</li>
            <li> The products are nothing special and no miracle cure. The hair still needs argan oil or other product to make it smoother and silkier.</li>
            <li> Worst service ever from Febstore. Febstore should be kicked off of Amazon. Shampoo Cond. products came opened and spilling out with everything but the original shampoo and conditioner in them. $36 shampoo and conditioner smelled and felt like Suave from Walmart. Such a hoax and I can&#x27;t believe Amazon would allow this type of a seller to be scamming people into thinking they are buying something they are not. I am a hairstylist who uses this product and the product that Febstore sent me was NOT the original. Complete scam and waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and conditioner.  Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been getting the keratin treatment for a little over a year and decided to try buying the shampoo and conditioner on amazon instead of at the salon.  I was very careful to check that the brand was Coppola when the product actually arrived it was a cheap knock off version.  I have invested a lot of time and money in growing out my hair the actual Coppola brand is fabulous in keeping my hair strong, lustrous, and manageable.  Im very dissappointed that this product was misrepresented I will be returning this garbage, which by the way even smells cheap.</li>
            <li> Beware! Definitely watered down from the same stuff they sell at salons!!&lt;br /&gt;Just got another Keratin Coppola straightening. Had ordered this stuff online to save a few bucks&lt;br /&gt;from the salon after my treatment.Not worth it if you spent a lot of money getting your hair straightened. Very thin, no texture and&lt;br /&gt;not that great feeling of lightness and smoothness when you wash the conditioner out. I am going to go back&lt;br /&gt;to the stuff at the salon.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using this product. I will recommend it to others. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Be careful- they have reformulated the shampoo and it is now almost watered down. If the bottle looks like the ones in this photo than DO NOT BUY!!! The other bottles that have Coppolla written down at the bottom and all the writing is horizontal os the good shampoo. The conditioner is still the same though! The original formula is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy hair that went through keratin treatment, My hair stylist  asked me to buy this one. Price on amazon was much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didnt see significant improvement, may be could be my hair type .</li>
            <li> My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product especially when shampoo and conditioner is used. I bought it at Ulta and paid a higher price but I will order online from now on. I have medium length hair and have used highlights for years which caused damage. My hair is very thick and has lots of tangles. The texture from years of highlights made it feel like straw. I spent a fortune on products to \\&quot;fix\\&quot; my problem, but to no avail. This shampoo and conditioner works! I now have soft and manageable hair with very few tangles! I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Gentle on hair that even our guests love and ask about the product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good products, looks different than the picture but overall great!</li>
            <li> This took care of my fuzzy hair.  Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair became very dry after using it.</li>
            <li> Already had a keratin treatment on my hair and this shampoo and conditioner ruined it. Totally dried out my hair. I will NEVER buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair that was dry from getting colored. oh well.  next try.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much. I had Keratin treatment 2 months ago and I was recommended to use this product ever since.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel not as fluffy but perhaps that&#x27;s what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> We are very satisfied.  I brought the shampoo &amp; conditioner along with the hair relaxer for my daughter and her hair came out beautiful.  Theses products755 work great!</li>
            <li> I have a Brazilian blowout keratin treatment so I was looking for a shampoo and condition that did two things: keep my keratin treatment in tact for as long as possible and not leave my hair greasy like a lot of sulfate free products do. After a few different trial runs I have come to find this shampoo and conditioner to be great! It leaves my hair soft and straight! I found the best way to get non greasy hair after is to thoroughly scrub the shampoo on all roots (avoiding hair ends). If you leave it in your hair for two minutes I found I got a much better clean out of it. Also for the conditioner I only put it on my ends and tried not to leave it on for more than a minute. This is the exact opposite of what most hair products recommend. But I found it gave me the cleanest not oily hair while also leaving it soft and silky when I styled it!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and live in Louisiana so frizziness is something I deal with every day. My salon recommended this shampoo and conditioner and said it would help stop my hair from being so \\&quot;straw like\\&quot; at the ends since I blow dry and straighten is on a daily basis.  I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month now and don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  When I&#x27;m done washing and conditioning my hair it does feel softer, but once I blow dry and straighten it it&#x27;s still dry on the ends and I still get frizziness.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again.  I&#x27;ve read some other reviews about this product maybe not being authentic so I think I&#x27;ll try buying directly from the salon next time.</li>
            <li> The photo for this item is deceptive, it shows both shampoo and conditioner.  I thought that I was ordering both.</li>
            <li> The quality of this shampoo and conditioner was watery.  Having used the same brand bought from a different source,&lt;br /&gt;it seemed diluted.  I used most of it but could not finish it because I did not like the consistency.  Although it was probably&lt;br /&gt;due to some mistake or mishandling of this particular bottle, it is not representative of the product itself.  However, I still would&lt;br /&gt;not use this product again because i found out it contains ingredients that  I do not want to use.</li>
            <li> This duo seems to tame \\&quot;wild\\&quot; hair a bit due to the keratin, but I do have to use an additional product or two.  There isn&#x27;t much of a scent... I&#x27;m okay with that.  It seems to be gentle on colored hair like it states.  I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner for almost 2 years when I began straightening my hair using the Brazilian Blow Out treatment. Recently I switched to a different sulfate free shampoo to see the difference. I noticed that Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner works much better for my color treated hair fine hair. Also, the price is reasonable and it lasts a long time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner combo is a way better deal on amazon than at Ulta where each bottle is $20! The consistency looks the same and the results seem comparable, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fake as some others have said. Overall, for being sulfate free (which typically means not very good) I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, new bottles, have yet to try, but product has different packaging, which kind of confused me.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark, fine, but frizzy hair (probably too much blow drying and flat ironing).  This shampoo and conditioner has played a role in restoring a healthy shine to my hair again.  I use this and Keratin Coppola Complex Infusion Keratin Replenisher and have seen a dramatic improvement.  Others have commented on this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greatly reduced frizz&lt;br /&gt;Works much like Matrix Sleeklooks, but is sulfate (color safe) free&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is FANTASTIC&lt;br /&gt;Has not affected my hair color&lt;br /&gt;Restored shine to hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None really, just be careful when rinsing the conditioner.  The bottom of the shower gets really, really slippery</li>
            <li> Great \\&quot;duo\\&quot; for me, and a must use product since I have Keratin Express treatment every 6 weeks. I live in the South with major humidity and have spent so many dollars on products to straighten, defrizz, decurl, defuzz, etc. Keratin was the way to go for me! Sorry Wen and all of the other \\&quot;no frizz\\&quot; products.... It is fabulous now to be able to enjoy even rainy days without wondering if my hair has \\&quot;grown\\&quot;!:-)</li>
            <li> I really like these products, because they have helped smooth my frizzy and curly hair with a flat iron.  These are the only products I have ever used that have helped manage my frizzy hair.  I was seriously considering a Keratin treatment at the hair salon but have decided to hold-off at this time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> I talked to Peter Coppola corporate after reading everyone&#x27;s comments about knock offs. Many years ago Coppola went into partnership to make this product, but has since parted ways. It cannot be guaranteed that this is the same formula that he helped develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUS, Amazon is not an authorized seller of Coppola products so there is no guarantee that they are even authentic.</li>
            <li> the shampoo and conditioner arrived promptly and were well packaged. They work much better than other Keratin shampoo and conditioners I have used. I like that both the shampoo and conditioner are pure white- not beige or yellow as most others, because I have snow white hair and other products leave a yellow residue on my hair. I do think they are little pricey since the conditioner only works well if you use about twice the amount directed. I found the conditioner is more effective if left on for an extended period (like over-night) and rinsed out with cold water. I will buy this again unless I find a stronger pure white Keratin conditioner for the same money.</li>
            <li> the keratin complex color care shampoo and conditioner did a great job preserving my color when I had keratin done to my hair.  even when I decided not to retreat with the keratin, I was able to use up these products on my relaxed hair without problems.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It helps prolong the keratin treatment. This is a great deal, the cheapest I have found these products!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I get regular Keratin treatments and this is the best shampoo and hair conditioner to use, it is very gentle on your hair and keeps it in great condition!</li>
            <li> awesome product at an awesome price! Love this stuff! Definitely worth the purchase- love it love it love it love it</li>
            <li> Smell is bad.  Couldn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis.  And to be fair helped with the keratin treatment but will try different brand next time.</li>
            <li> I Only received the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference with the very first use! I use one of the conditioners (bought the deep conditioning treatment also) every day but only wash my hair 3 or 4 times a week. My hair was shinier, smoother and softer. Feels and looks much healthier!</li>
            <li> thanks  for the product, excellent</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to smooth out my dry hair.  This was not the product.  My hair began to break</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time and when I saw the price I jumped to purchase.  The Shampoo worked well and when compared with my previous bottle I knew it was the same product.  Unfortunately, the conditioner did not do the same job as my previous condition, so again I did a comparison and I immediately noticed the difference.  It is not the same Keratin Condition, is that why it was so cheap?</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged by poor quality highlights and was extremely dried out, hard to brush and full of knots. After using this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of month, my hair became healthy again. It feels great and is so much easier to straighten. Great products!</li>
            <li> I received a keratin treatment in November. The treatment should&#x27;ve lasted 4-5 months. I ran out of shampoo and conditioner in January. I ordered this product and when it arrived I thought I had gotten a good deal because the bottle looked like my salon product.  This was not the same as my salon product. I massaged the product in my hair and immediately knew that it was not the same product as I received in the salon. The product didn&#x27;t feel, smell, or condition like Coppolla.  This product actually had suds! Coppolla products are sulfates and sodium chloride free and not very sudsy.  They are very gentle. My hair now feels like I&#x27;m in the 5th month of my treatment instead of the 2nd. I have requested a refund.  I am so upset that my money has went down the drain for the treatment.  I trusted that this was a good product because it was shipped through Amazon. This situation has caused me not to trust any Amazon products except for e-books. In the long run, I&#x27;m more upset with myself for being too trusting of an online product. I will never make this mistake again.</li>
            <li> We all quest for the perfect... whatever. The perfect pillow, the perfect shoe, the perfect chili recipe, etc. For me, the perfect shampoo and conditioner is this one. I love the way it leaves my hair, and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditoner I bought so far I had a keratin hair treatment and this helped to keep my treatment while I also I felt the shampoo cleaned my hair well unlike some other non-sulfate products I bought in the past. I would definatly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I had a Keratin Complex smoothing treatment at a salon and started using the shampoo and conditioner as was recommended.  First of all, the products do not work.  I did not see any appreciable change in my hair.  Second, my hair became very oily and matted.  Shortly thereafter, my scalp started itching and my hair started falling out at the follicle level.  I have had to seek medical attention to deal with the situation at a significant expense for a steroid shampoo prescription needed to reduce the inflammation, multiple physician visits, etc. There are no other medical or product-based explanations for this situation.  I will need to cut my long, waist-length hair short.  I&#x27;ve consulted with two master stylists who have had experience with the products and refuse to use this line.  They said my only option is to HOPE my scalp/hair will eventually stabilize, and cut my hair short (spikey) to deal with the period wherein the lost hair (well over half the normal volume) starts to grow back.  The Keratin Complex company was, initially, unresponsive.  They did not return emails or phone calls.  Finally, after multiple tries, I was able to speak with one representative who was curt and unsympathetic.  The company&#x27;s only response -- they&#x27;d send me more products.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended a shampoo with no sulfates and I ordered this on line instead of at the shop to reduce middleman.  It has been good for my hair by reducing the frizzy effect.  Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good things about this shampoo, so I decided to give it a try. Oh my God its one of the best shampoos I ever used. my hair was coarse and I tried many things and Keratin did the job very well.I really recommend that and by the way it helps maintain the color.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to spend the time and money to have a Keratin treatment - then it only make sense to preserve and maintain your investment with their shampoo and conditioner.  It truly helps maintain your treatment; your hair feels great and it has a nice fragrance.  Very affordable on Amazon - recommend it to all!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because I kept hearing so much about keratin.  Granted my somewhat curly hair didn&#x27;t hang straight and flowing down my back, but my hair was very soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I recently had the keratin smoothing treatment done and this works great!!!  It makes my hair feel so soft... I love it</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky smooth without an oily feeling. Also, it only takes a little for each use. I love it!</li>
            <li> This item is great for the following reason: Great price, great product that leaves my hair silky smooth and not dry and quick shipping!  Thanks so much!  Product is the best!</li>
            <li> I have purchased both the shampoo &amp; conditioner from my local salon, but decided to order from Amazon when I ran out. The shampoo was definitely watered down. It does not come out of the bottle in a thick consistency, rather it &amp;#34;pours&amp;#34; out. The conditioner was fine.</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money for this at the Salon. The price is great, the size of the products are what I expected. Not too small, perfect. Hate when I order a product and the size is smaller than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> There is a picture of Coppola Keratin shampoo and conditioner but that is not the product that arrived. It is a similar looking bottle but it is not coppola. Fraud.</li>
            <li> My stylist gave me this after coloring my hair and I absolutely love it. I am use to buying shampoo and conditions from the salon so when I tried this I was amazed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Had an express keratin treatment and using this to help extend the length of time the treatment will last.  This is a great product if you have had the treatment.  I actually used it a couple of times before the treatment and my hair definitely was better behaved!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leave my hair so soft and manageable and I have very thick and processed hair (am a blonde) so it&#x27;s hard to find a pair that will make my hair feel this insanely soft.. Have been using for quite some time and every time I use it my hair gets healthier somehow.. go figure.. a product that actually works!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and love it.  I have ordered from amazon many times and never a problem but this particular seller seemed to water it down.  The shampoo and conditioner were runny and thin not like its usual consistency.  When I recieved the package I noticed blue tape on the caps which to me seemed odd but assumed it was to keep them closed but like I said the product was very watered down.  I will continue to use this product but I will be careful where I get it from.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not overall crazy about the shampoo, (it makes my hair feel like straw and very hard to get my hands through to wash out), I love the conditioner. It restores the softness. If only the conditiiner could clean as well as condition, then I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with the straw making shampoo.</li>
            <li> I received this and for one the safety seal on the shampoo was missing and the conditioner it was halfway on. Ok didn&#x27;t think much of it until I went to use it and the shampoo was severely watered down! I could not believe it.  Needless to say I am sending it back and would like to find a reputable seller!</li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I did not receive my Keratin shampoo and conditioner. The tracking stated it was delivered to my home, but I never got a package. Thinking there was a mistake that could be easily fixed, I contacted Larkin thinking they would be more than happy to help - not the case. This was all that I got in an email:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;amazon shipped this one ..can you call or contact them so they can reship or figure it out... we have no control on this one..dh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I purchased these after I got a Keratin Smoothing treatment at the salon. Later when I ran out I purchased these from Amazon for the savings. It wasn&#x27;t a huge savings but enough to make it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used it outside of the Keratin Smoothing treatment I received but it continues to keep my hair sleek, shiny, smooth and soft. Love it!</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo and conditioner, especially after having had a Keritan treatment, but slightly dissapointed that every time I order off of Amazon, the bottles are always expired by about one year-hence the slightly discounted price.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after having a keratin treatment on my hair. It helps maintain the treatment and keeps my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I have had keratin treatments for my hair and this product is the perfect compliment for extending the life of those treatments. A little goes a long way with this product. If you are expecting this to lather up when you wash you hair it will not. The less lather from hair products I have learned is best for my hair type. This product smells wonderful also. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has trouble with their hair laying straight.</li>
            <li> Keratin complex color care shampoo and conditioner works perfect for me since I have the Keratin hair relaxer in my hair.  It works with keeping my hair straight and keeps the color in tact.</li>
            <li> will continue to use it forever!  I lost my frizz.....now when it rains, my hair looks as it did before the rain.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  Leaves hair shiny &amp; manageable</li>
            <li> i was a little skeptical of purchasing a high end shampoo.  but i caved in because i had the keratin treatment done.  i used other shampoos, but will leave my hair extremely dull and greasy.  this is great!  it leaves my hair smooth and the best thing i can actually skip a day of washing my hair.  this will definitely will leave my keratin treatment longer.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottles of this shampoo and conditioner (exact same) from my salon - all was well. My husband ordered me this (after I told him exactly what to order - again, this is the same product as salon). After I got it, the product was watered down... ALOT! The smell !!!!!!! - The shampoo smelled SO OLD AND AWFUL! The conditioner was fine. I do not have the original packing or receipt, but I do not plan on buying from GSM King again ... at least for this product. I want a refund, but can&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t have proper things to. I was very very excited to get this cheaper than salons and stores, but I was very very dissapointed after I got it. I HAVE TO HOLD MY BREATH USING THIS!</li>
            <li> Seems thin as if diluted but leaves hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair fell like heaven</li>
            <li> Same great product as the one you would find at a salon! I was unsure initially if it would be the same quality.  I bought it and have no regrets!</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo and conditioner. It can be used every day&lt;br /&gt;without drying out the hair. Leaves hair feeling very clean and&lt;br /&gt;looking very shiney.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are made without sodium chloride or sulfates, which are no-no&#x27;s with Keratin-treated hair.  Actually, it is best to do without these with color-treated or delicate hair of any type, as they strip the hair.  While the lack of lather is the price that is paid for doing without these two ingredients, this product (unlike some others), distributes nicely throughout the hair even without the lather, and leaves my hair feeling clean and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I got this combo from my stylist originally. It&#x27;s great! It really helps control the frizz. I have fine hair, so it really cuts down my dry time in the morning.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and feeling nice,good smell also.Has no sulfate and sulfides in it so its better for hair,less drying</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair that I blow-dry, straighten, curl, and tease. Not all in that order, and not every day, but often enough that my hair needs regular upkeep and repair. I&#x27;ve paid a small fortune in my hair, trying leave-in conditioners, detangling sprays, and nothing over the years have worked as well as this product. I can tell immediately the difference between this and other shampoos and conditioners. This cleans as well as detangles your hair as you put it in. Their is honestly no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s no secrect my hair tangles easily. Some days it curls, other days, it behaves. With this product I have more good days than bad. It defrizzes, detangles, gets rid of everything that would give you a headache in styling. My hair is noticably smoother and much simpler to style--even just get up in a ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To anyone (man or woman) who has trouble controling their hair: because of frizz, tangels, chemical damage, I recomend giving this product a go! Afterward, you won&#x27;t waste your money on anything less! It works and it works fast. :)</li>
            <li> Ive purchased this at stores and was happy to find it online.  It&#x27;s the same as what I used in the past and have no issues with it, not too sure what others received.</li>
            <li> Great products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received the Keratin Smoothing Treatment by my hairstylist and this shampoo/conditioner helps extend it to last ~5 months (pretty consistently as I have received it 3x over the past 2 years) which is awesome because it&#x27;s not a cheap treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, the shampoo and conditioner pictured above is a different, possibly older, picture than the product shipped. When received, both bottles were wrapped in plastic wrap which was a nice touch to prevent any leakage-- none noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how these products would feel without the Keratin Smoothing Treatment.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is watered down. Very disappointed in this purchase. I have used this shampoo, so I know it was tampered with by the seller. I will never again purchase this type of product online.</li>
            <li> Love the new hair line products!</li>
            <li> Worst service ever from Keratine Complex. should be kicked off of Amazon. I do not received the Shampoo and  Cond that I order. the Shampoo and  Cond products came opened and spilling out with everything  the  shampoo and conditioner that I received for  $36 smelled and felt like shampoo and Cond from Walmart that cost $1,00. Such a hoax and I can&#x27;t believe Amazon would allow this type of a seller to be scamming people into thinking they are buying something they are not. this product and the product that Keratin Complex sent me was NOT the original. Complete scam and waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I use everyday. Great product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and healthy.  This is especially good after an expensive keratin treatment.  I love this shampoo and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner.  Recommended by my hair stylist.  I have natural curly or wavy hair, and this product helps out with the frizz and all.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not lather good whatsoever.  I felt like cheaper drug store brands would be better than this.. The whole point of buying salon quality shampoo/conditioner is the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use more than a dime size amount to wash your hair with which leaves you with a bottle lasting at least 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairdresser when i had the keratin treatment, these products&lt;br /&gt;work very well. Cleans hair and conditions, preserving the effects of the keratin treatment and my haircolor.</li>
