            <li>I absolutely love this polish and specifically this color!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I very much liked the cnd system</li>
            <li>This polish really is the best alternative to a gel manicure.</li>
            <li>It really works on my nails, so that I have my seven days manicure, in a perfect way</li>
            <li>the colors are nice.</li>
            <li>they looked too much like vinyl; but the lighter colors are great!</li>
            <li>This nail-polish is shiny , strong , and lasts a good four days before the corners start to wear .</li>
            <li>Peels very easily.</li>
            <li>I even bought the top coat</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love this color.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my recent purchased of  CND Vinylux Romantique f Nail Polish Lacquer.  </li>
            <li>Love all the colors of CND Vinylux.</li>
            <li>I love the brand and the concept.</li>
            <li>This bottle I received was more whitish.</li>
            <li>I bought this to go with the weekly top coat.</li>
            <li>This color is so elegant and lasts longer with CND top coat.</li>
            <li>I love it and have ordered more colors.</li>
            <li>I bought the Weekly top coat</li>
            <li>this color required way too many coats to not be see through anymore</li>
            <li>I used the CND weekly top coat.</li>
            <li>I put two coats of the top coat on for added protection , and found that it extended the longevity of the polish .</li>
            <li>- can&#x27;t wait to order more colors .</li>
            <li>Fantastic nail polish!</li>
            <li>The best part is that the polish actually looks good for a whole week.</li>
            <li>This color does not give good coverage, when multiple applications are used to get good coverage</li>
            <li>I love this color because it makes my nails look clean, well-cared-for and classy!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>Finally, this color is a beautiful neutral and reminds me of Bubblebath by OPI.</li>
            <li>color which should be fine.</li>
            <li>I wish the color was just a little more opaque as you can see through it if you don&#x27;t use three coats but all in all a very good product.</li>
            <li>great basic color&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>Great for regular manicure....</li>
            <li>It was not as smooth as I had hoped going on</li>
            <li>Like many light polishes, this is streaky, but the top coat by CND really works.</li>
            <li>Love love this new nail polish, and the seller was very fast and nice.</li>
            <li>If you like light polishes, it&#x27;s true to color if you can get it on your nail without the streaks,</li>
            <li>I like bright sheer colors</li>
            <li>and i needed a couple of layers to get the true color.</li>
            <li>I love this color as a shellac polish- not so much in Vinylux.</li>
            <li>it really works well will buy more vinylux products</li>
            <li>I have washed dishes, worked in the garden and the polish lasted a full 6 days with no damage.  </li>
            <li>Seller was perfect with delivery &amp; product but the color of the polish is more of a white with a pink undertone.</li>
            <li>I loved the shellac however, after several months my finger nails started to peel.</li>
            <li>This polish last a good week.  </li>
            <li>This polish will last nicely for a full week!</li>
            <li>I loved the color, I love the brand that last for a week at least and the service was great</li>
            <li>Vinylux is the best -- love it because it is easily removed and not as harsh as using shellac because that requires long contact with acetone.  </li>
            <li>Chips too quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and really lasts a full week with no chips or rub off.  </li>
            <li>but I would like to see more of a soft beige instead of the taupes to come to the collection.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>I love that it comes off with regular acetone and stays on!</li>
            <li>Took the polish off and had ordered the color and top coat from you, and redid only the polish and my nails continued to grow!</li>
            <li>It is better than regular nail polish?</li>
            <li>By the end of the first week it does start to flake off.</li>
            <li>(I keep my nails pretty short).&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>a side note that you can use any nail polish with the weekly top coat and will probably get the same results.</li>
            <li>this color is really light, almost clear</li>
            <li>It takes too many coats to get a solid color rather than a streaky opaque.</li>
            <li>I did not receive the first order and when the company was made aware of this they did send another CND Vinylux # 142</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the product because it stays on longer than regular finger nail polish.</li>
            <li>and it certainly does.</li>
            <li>very streaky too...</li>
            <li>The colors are really saturated.</li>
            <li>I like baby pink to be more opaque so this color did not work for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The nail polish lacquer work very well</li>
            <li>I have received this Nail coat Manicure a time ago and it really don&#x27;t have scratches for a period of a 1 week.</li>
            <li>The polish did last about six days without chipping and the color is nice but way too sheer for my tast!</li>
            <li>Romantique is not as pink or as sheer as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Romantique  is a great pale pink neutral color.</li>
            <li>I want to give this polish 5 stars because it really does have staying power and makes my nails look like I got a professional gel manicure.</li>
            <li>I wanted a light opaque pink.</li>
            <li>It comes right off with regular nail polish removal</li>
            <li>This new polish requires no base coat, dries in 10 minutes, and is chip free for at least one week!</li>
            <li>Finally, a product that does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>My nails were damaged and weak and this product has a hardening agent which helps me have nice looking nails all week.  </li>
            <li>This is a little too light.</li>
            <li>My nails are very brittle from using regular gel polish so this may be a factor.</li>
            <li>Pretty sheer pink color, looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>It dries immediately, it lasts a whole week and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails.</li>
            <li>It really does last longer than regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a pale pink like Essie Mademoiselle.</li>
            <li>I cannot go more than 2 days without chipping in the medical field due to excessive hand washing.</li>

            <li> It really does last longer than regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a pale pink like Essie Mademoiselle.</li>
            <li> I cannot go more than 2 days without chipping in the medical field due to excessive hand washing.</li>
            <li> I think this color may have been sitting too long.</li>
            <li> Not as pink as my last order.</li>
            <li> and my nails were the longest I have worn in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Although I liked how long the polish stayed on, my nails became extremely weak and thin after using this product six times.</li>
            <li> The polish itself is fine, however you should also purchase the base coat to make the polish really pop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a month and it made my nails brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> It goes on streaky, and it chips within a few days similar to traditional polishes.</li>
            <li> The dark colors also last an equally long time without showing signs of wear.</li>
            <li> This product went on streaky and didn&#x27;t last any longer than conventional nail polish.</li>
            <li> not sure what the deal is with this one, maybe it&#x27;s old?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to keep my nails bare now for a few weeks so they can heal - they were chipping and peeling.</li>
            <li> I usually go for pale, natural looking colors but this goes on almost white and applied almost streaky.</li>
            <li> This was the sheerest pink and was like a matte.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The gold one doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on as well of the other colors.</li>
            <li> The product needs at least 3 codes to look smooth unfortunately</li>
            <li> and unfortunately it did not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> My nail technician recommended this polish to me and the pale pink I always wear.  </li>
            <li> it still doesn&#x27;t cover well and looks like a blob of a mess.</li>
            <li> My nails were getting so thin and fragile from all the gel manicures that I had to find an alternative.</li>
            <li> so you are going to need at least 3 coats.</li>
            <li> Came on thick and streaky.</li>
            <li> I have never had such bad results with any nail product as I did with CND.</li>
            <li> Did not shine, very dull.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is very streaky and looks horrible after applied.</li>
            <li> also was a little disappointed in the color.  </li>
            <li> The topcoat is useless to me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid to by another shade.</li>
            <li> Streaky, very difficult to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> disappointed in this &amp;#34;colorless&amp;#34; color...wish had read reviews.</li>
            <li> was nervous that not using a base coat would stain my nails</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on for 7 days like it says... I even bought the top coat</li>
            <li> great basic color&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> This is actually almost white.  Note to myself:  stop trying to buy nail polish online.</li>
            <li> disappointed in this &amp;#34;colorless&amp;#34; color...wish had read reviews. very streaky too...hope will like &amp;#34;married to the mauve&amp;#34; color which should be fine.</li>
            <li> I love it.  The gold one doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on as well of the other colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a month and it made my nails brittle and dry. They have whites spots all over them from being so dehydrated. I have never had such bad results with any nail product as I did with CND.</li>
            <li> Great for regular manicure.... CND Vinylux lasts and lasts....</li>
            <li> I want to give this polish 5 stars because it really does have staying power and makes my nails look like I got a professional gel manicure. The only issue I have is that it has damaged my nails a bit. I&#x27;ve had to keep my nails bare now for a few weeks so they can heal - they were chipping and peeling. Finally, this color is a beautiful neutral and reminds me of Bubblebath by OPI.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!! I only used two coats and it can out WITHOUT STREAKS!!! Must buy again!</li>
            <li> I like the color and durability of this polish.  I wish the color was just a little more opaque as you can see through it if you don&#x27;t use three coats but all in all a very good product.</li>
            <li> It really does last longer than regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous that not using a base coat would stain my nails but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I also was a little disappointed in the color.  Closer to white than the bottle color.&lt;br /&gt;That all said, I bought it so that my manicure would last and it certainly does.</li>
            <li> The wonderful girl who does my nails suggested this product to me.  My nails were damaged and weak and this product has a hardening agent which helps me have nice looking nails all week.  It comes right off with regular nail polish removal and you can apply yourself.  A great product and I love this color.</li>
            <li> I think this color may have been sitting too long. It was not as smooth as I had hoped going on and i needed a couple of layers to get the true color. I like bright sheer colors so I will try another one. I very much liked the cnd system</li>
            <li> This polish really is the best alternative to a gel manicure. My nails were getting so thin and fragile from all the gel manicures that I had to find an alternative. This is it!! I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product but came with defect of the brush!! The product needs at least 3 codes to look smooth unfortunately</li>
            <li> Gel will ruin your nails this will help you move forward and will last 6-7 days and simply remove with regular remover is seconds and start again- Waiting for the salons in my area to start using!</li>
            <li> Goes on nail with strikes.</li>
            <li> Love love this new nail polish, and the seller was very fast and nice. This new polish requires no base coat, dries in 10 minutes, and is chip free for at least one week!</li>
            <li> I love this color as a shellac polish- not so much in Vinylux. It goes on streaky, and it chips within a few days similar to traditional polishes.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that does exactly what it says. I love that it comes off with regular acetone and stays on!</li>
            <li> Like many light polishes, this is streaky, but the top coat by CND really works. If you like light polishes, it&#x27;s true to color if you can get it on your nail without the streaks,</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Bought after finding a salon that recommended it.  Have to put 3 coats on to get coverage desired.  Otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> Although I liked how long the polish stayed on, my nails became extremely weak and thin after using this product six times. I will stop using it.</li>
            <li> Even after three coats, the streaks were terrible.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I loved the color and it stays on did not chip for over a week it really works well will buy more vinylux products</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my recent purchased of  CND Vinylux Romantique f Nail Polish Lacquer.  It really works on my nails, so that I have my seven days manicure, in a perfect way</li>
            <li> Love! I cannot go more than 2 days without chipping in the medical field due to excessive hand washing. Great color and great product!</li>
            <li> Love all the colors of CND Vinylux. And it wears beautifully. The colors are really saturated.</li>
            <li> Love the color,,,Great seller!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Romantique&amp;#34; color is not a color. I used 2 coats and got nothing but shine. I wanted a light opaque pink. That&#x27;s not what this is. Don&#x27;t know which color to buy to get the look I want. I love the brand and the concept. If this color actually had color, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The polish did last about six days without chipping and the color is nice but way too sheer for my tast! I like baby pink to be more opaque so this color did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this color because it makes my nails look clean, well-cared-for and classy!&lt;br /&gt;The Vinylux is the best -- love it because it is easily removed and not as harsh as using shellac because that requires long contact with acetone.  This color also doesn&#x27;t show when you have a chip.</li>
            <li> Pretty sheer pink color, looks very natural.  The best part is that the polish actually looks good for a whole week. No chips!</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectations. The color hue was off. Not as pink as my last order. This bottle I received was more whitish.</li>
            <li> My nail technician recommended this polish to me and the pale pink I always wear.  I went 2+ weeks and my nails were the longest I have worn in a long time.  Took the polish off and had ordered the color and top coat from you, and redid only the polish and my nails continued to grow! I had polish remover without acetone and finally ended up having to peel off at the end, so bought some with acetone and it will be o.k.</li>
            <li> I loved the color, I love the brand that last for a week at least and the service was great</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the weekly top coat. It is better than regular nail polish? Yes. Will you get two weeks of perfect nails? No. By the end of the first week it does start to flake off. The tips have also started to wear off too. (I keep my nails pretty short).&lt;br /&gt;Just a side note that you can use any nail polish with the weekly top coat and will probably get the same results.</li>
            <li> Chips too quickly. I don&#x27;t recommend it. I would rather  go to the nail place and get gel nails. Thanks</li>
            <li> this color is really light, almost clear so you are going to need at least 3 coats. The polish itself is fine, however you should also purchase the base coat to make the polish really pop.</li>
            <li> This color is so elegant and lasts longer with CND top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a little too light. It takes too many coats to get a solid color rather than a streaky opaque.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and really lasts a full week with no chips or rub off.  I have washed dishes, worked in the garden and the polish lasted a full 6 days with no damage.  It comes off easily with nail polish remover.  I love it and have ordered more colors.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Love it!</li>
            <li> Romantique is not as pink or as sheer as I would have liked.  I had my manicurist apply the polish and unfortunately it did not stay on very well. My nails are very brittle from using regular gel polish so this may be a factor.</li>
            <li> Hated this polish. It streaked and looked crappy on my nails. Didn&#x27;t stay on for a week before it was peeling. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> This color does not give good coverage, when multiple applications are used to get good coverage it still doesn&#x27;t cover well and looks like a blob of a mess. I bought the Weekly top coat but now I&#x27;ve lost my money on the polish and I&#x27;m afraid to by another shade. I&#x27;m very disappointed. The topcoat is useless to me.</li>
            <li> Seller was perfect with delivery &amp; product but the color of the polish is more of a white with a pink undertone. I was hoping for more of a pale pink like Essie Mademoiselle. So for the color this was a bomb for me.  And it was not opaque when I tested it on my nail. Can not speak for longevity as the color didn&#x27;t work for me I didn&#x27;t try it for a mani</li>
            <li> this color required way too many coats to not be see through anymore</li>
            <li> I did not receive the first order and when the company was made aware of this they did send another CND Vinylux # 142 and I received this in about a week.  The nail polish lacquer work very well and I am pleased with the product because it stays on longer than regular finger nail polish.</li>
            <li> Came on thick and streaky. Did not shine, very dull. Would not buy Vinylux again. This was the sheerest pink and was like a matte. Inconsistent coverage.</li>
            <li> This product went on streaky and didn&#x27;t last any longer than conventional nail polish.</li>
            <li> Stays on 7-10 days. Applies and removes like regular nail polish. Doesn&#x27;t chip. Romantique  is a great pale pink neutral color.</li>
            <li> Lasts for more than a week!</li>
            <li> I loved the shellac however, after several months my finger nails started to peel. this is a good substitute and I can do this at home. it does last if you follow directions about 5 days. it&#x27;s easy to apply and remove. the colors are nice. but I would like to see more of a soft beige instead of the taupes to come to the collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several CND products and like them all but this color was terrible. I usually go for pale, natural looking colors but this goes on almost white and applied almost streaky. I haven&#x27;t used it again</li>
            <li> This nail polish is very streaky and looks horrible after applied. I have another nail polish by this brand and it looks awesome, so not sure what the deal is with this one, maybe it&#x27;s old?</li>
            <li> Even with 3 base coats you can still see my nails thru this polish.  Manicure lasts about 4 days tops.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this polish and specifically this color!  It stays on all week without chipping.</li>
            <li> I have received this Nail coat Manicure a time ago and it really don&#x27;t have scratches for a period of a 1 week.</li>
            <li> I was able to keep my nails looking great for 10 days. Would recommend this to anyone.  Comes in very nice colors.</li>
            <li> Peels very easily. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Has met all my expectation. I would recommend this to my family and friends. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It dries immediately, it lasts a whole week and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails. I wasn&#x27;t happy with the darker colors.....they looked too much like vinyl; but the lighter colors are great!</li>
            <li> Streaky, very difficult to apply evenly. Lasted only 4 days. I used the CND weekly top coat. The color is almost opaque white.</li>
            <li> Streaks.  Put on 2 coats but streaking showed through.</li>
            <li> This nail-polish is shiny , strong , and lasts a good four days before the corners start to wear . I put two coats of the top coat on for added protection , and found that it extended the longevity of the polish . The dark colors also last an equally long time without showing signs of wear. Well worth the money - can&#x27;t wait to order more colors .</li>
            <li> This polish last a good week.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Fantastic nail polish! This polish will last nicely for a full week!</li>
            <li> This is the nail polish to use that lasts!  Great all around color, Romantique!</li>
            <li> Color &amp;#34;way&amp;#34; off from picture.</li>
