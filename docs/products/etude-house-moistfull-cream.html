            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, it also makes applying makeup easier because it makes my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, has a nice scent and does a nice job as a pre moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This creme made my skin appear bright and moisturized right after I applied it!</li>

            <li>I can see a huge difference in my complexion!</li>
            <li>nice light smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had to try many many many brands(none of the natural/organic/ brand name in the USA worked for</li>
            <li>I wish it was more hydrating.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product feels and smells.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and this is way better.</li>
            <li>love them</li>
            <li>I even got a cute handwritten note.</li>
            <li>I am trying new moisturizers and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Every time I would go and get a facial the woman would always push on me the $70 or more moisturizer and refused because this is a much better product as well as cheaper!</li>
            <li>It is a great product to use if your skin ever feels dry or you like to put a moisturizer on before bed or before putting on make-up!</li>
            <li>I primarily use the ampoule on my 11s and smile lines.</li>
            <li>The Essence bottle is a sample, and I am ordering the full size because this has truly been what I have been looking for in skincare.</li>
            <li>I think it has helped so much with the fine line wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li>I find that my 20-something skin bounces back from damage/blemishes/lines so much more quickly!</li>
            <li>It works just fine as a normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I found that since starting this routine, my skin seemed to recover from my picking relapses much more quickly than before I used the products.</li>
            <li>and I am lookintg forward to being able to use it daily without clogging my skin.</li>
            <li>I use the ampoule first, wait for it to absorb, and then apply the cream.</li>
            <li>so I went to find it on Amazon and sure enough it was!</li>
            <li>I am most definitely ordering another cream as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using both the Essence and Cream for a week now and all I have to say is WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>Makes my face soft and smooth all day long :).</li>
            <li>and I think I am really going to like it.</li>
            <li>My skin has much increased in elasticity.</li>
            <li>This item helps me so much.</li>

            <li>parks are super oily and parts are super dry.</li>
            <li>I love the hydration, but it was a little much for the day.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and moisturized thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive that I don&#x27;t put anything on it or else it will burst out with pimples or red itchy spot.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 30 yrs old.</li>
            <li>face would always have some kind of break out and it worse than if I don&#x27;t put anything on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>Nothing significant or different than any other product.</li>

            <li> For my teenage girl. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Feels nice, not sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It&#x27;s light weight, has a nice scent and does a nice job as a pre moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It came today - I tried it out on the topof my hands and I think I am really going to like it. It softens, it isn&#x27;t heavy and I am lookintg forward to being able to use it daily without clogging my skin.</li>
            <li> I am loving this cream. Makes my face soft and smooth all day long :). My skin is super sensitive that I don&#x27;t put anything on it or else it will burst out with pimples or red itchy spot. nice light smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell the difference after a few days of use. Its probably not for everyone but I would give it a try.  Certain specific creams such as&lt;br /&gt; singapore-cellnique, japanese-Sana Hadanomy, korean-etude house cream/ wash will work I found over the years. Even with that, only one of their product would work and other would just itch like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to try many many many brands(none of the natural/organic/ brand name in the USA worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;My face would always have some kind of break out and it worse than if I don&#x27;t put anything on. My face is parks are super oily and parts are super dry. Skin is just thin and sensitive. I would give this brand a try at least their stuff seems a lot cheaper than other. Others are like $50+ for a tiny bottle</li>
            <li> It works just fine as a normal moisturizer. Nothing significant or different than any other product. I wish it was more hydrating.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels and smells. My husband even uses the cream to help moisturize his dry skin. I use the ampoule first, wait for it to absorb, and then apply the cream. It even came with a little spatula! A very important step in my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> These products are extremely hydrating- don&#x27;t let their small size fool you. I&#x27;ve chosen to use the cream as my night moisturizer because I accumulated a shine after wearing it all day. I love the hydration, but it was a little much for the day. It does take some time to soak into the skin and so there is the slightest sticky sensation until that happens- not goopy or unpleasant, just barely noticeable. This was another reason for me to use at night, so that I don&#x27;t have to wait so long to put on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ampoule has already made a difference in my skin after about a week of using these products together. I find that my 20-something skin bounces back from damage/blemishes/lines so much more quickly! I primarily use the ampoule on my 11s and smile lines. The lines used to sit on my face for several minutes after frowning/smiling and now the lines disappear almost immediately! My skin has much increased in elasticity. Additionally, I am bad about picking my face- actively trying to stop- and I found that since starting this routine, my skin seemed to recover from my picking relapses much more quickly than before I used the products.</li>
            <li> I have 7 items from the Etude House Moistfull line. I think it has helped so much with the fine line wrinkles on my face. I hope they never discontinue it!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, combination skin. This product not only keeps my skin moisturized, it does not break my skin out!! Love this product. I can see a huge difference in my complexion! Will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I am using this product at night. It makes my skin smooth and hydrated. It&#x27;s not sticky and a little goes a long way. Good product.</li>
            <li> This item helps me so much. My skin is soft and moisturized thanks to this stuff. People think I&#x27;m under 18 and I&#x27;m 30 yrs old. Wowwy!</li>
            <li> I use to order this product from another site but they have recently stopped selling it so I went to find it on Amazon and sure enough it was! It is a great product to use if your skin ever feels dry or you like to put a moisturizer on before bed or before putting on make-up! Every time I would go and get a facial the woman would always push on me the $70 or more moisturizer and refused because this is a much better product as well as cheaper!</li>
            <li> This creme made my skin appear bright and moisturized right after I applied it! It&#x27;s amazing, it also makes applying makeup easier because it makes my skin so smooth! I will be ordering more after I run out because this is the best cosmetic product I&#x27;ve ever used! ❤️</li>
            <li> Small tube of moisturizer was cracked and half full.</li>
            <li> I have been using both the Essence and Cream for a week now and all I have to say is WOW!!!! It is AMAZING!!! My skin is noticeably smoother and cleaner. It&#x27;s very light and a little goes a very long way. It has a nice smell to it, like baby powder, which is a plus. The Essence bottle is a sample, and I am ordering the full size because this has truly been what I have been looking for in skincare. I am most definitely ordering another cream as well.</li>
            <li> I am trying new moisturizers and this is the best one so far. I went from Aveeno Positvely Radiant to this and this is way better.</li>
            <li> The Ampoule Essence leeks out to only half of a bottle when I received it through the mail. :(</li>
            <li> I love these two!!! I use it every night and it leaves my face smooth!! love them</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Im very very pleased. I even got a cute handwritten note.</li>
