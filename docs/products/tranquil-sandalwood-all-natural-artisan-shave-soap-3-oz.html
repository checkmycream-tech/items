    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent for travel using a threaded aluminum container!!  </li>
            <li>However, the scent and quality is great</li>
            <li>Amazing company with wonderful products.</li>
            <li>Happy shaving...</li>
            <li>Performed great.</li>
            <li>Whips up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>My most important attribute for a shaving soap is to provide the best lubrication and comfort during a shave.</li>
            <li>The soap has a very mild scent which is great for me.</li>
            <li>This will soften it up so than you can get a nice creamy lather in about 15 rotations.</li>
            <li>Nice product.   </li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>It does however work very well for a cartridge razor shave providing excellent lubrication.</li>
            <li>The razor glides smoothly over my face as I shave; provides good lubrication but not too slippery, still effective in giving me a close shave.</li>
            <li>: put some warm water on top of the soap and leave it sit during your shower.  </li>
            <li>I did like the more aromatic smell of the Sandalwood cream, but found the lather of the soap much more to my liking.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>My husband says it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>They are home-made speciality face soaps providing phenomenal lubrication,minimal irritation and moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li>Smell is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent soap, gives a good lather, and seems to moisturize and reduce cuts.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Nice solid soap love the scent</li>
            <li>Have used one of their other scented shaving soaps before and it was great.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, almost not there, which is what I prefer.  </li>
            <li>It provides adequate lubrication for a DE razor shave.</li>
            <li>Nice, affordable shaving soap; not sure I&#x27;d define it as &#x27;Sandalwood&#x27; in fragrance - a bit &#x27;herby/medicinal&#x27;, but it lathers nicely using warm/hot water and provides a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much the product as it is me not liking for being too strong.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more artisanal soaps on the way, but so far Proraso &amp;#34;takes the cake.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Whips up easily with my badger brush and makes a nice, thick lather that easily makes three passes.</li>
            <li>The smell is so light and natural, not a harsh chemical smell, yet it gently lingers on my face, I love it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for smelly stuff first thing in the morning! :&amp;#62;)  </li>
            <li>In the Schon stainless bowl, it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I enjoy it as much a regular shaving cream, but it does smell nice &amp; works fine.</li>
            <li>Good shaving soap, I had just gotten back to double edge brush shaving and purchased both cream and soap.</li>
            <li>Continue rotating the brush into your face to really get the lather going.</li>
            <li>The smell is more subtle than I expected, but is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I believe and have experience other soaps that do much better on this attribute at a much lower cost than this soap.</li>
            <li>There are other brands in this price range that lather up better and easier.  </li>
            <li>Decent shaving soap with plenty of lather.</li>
            <li>The problem I have is that it isn&#x27;t the standard size for a disc of shaving soap; I had to shave off edges, soak it in warm water for a long time, and then jam it down into my shaving mug, where it fit so tightly that there wasnt room for water to run into the channels and into the reservoir beneath, which would have prevented pooling of excess water on top of the soap.</li>
            <li>I want the blade to glide smoothly over my face giving the closest shave with minimal skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Months later...tried the Proraso Green Tea and Oat and have to say that it&#x27;s a better product.</li>
            <li>But really, I recommend it over the higher priced stuffed I last bought.  </li>
            <li>so they will not fit in many shaving soap dishes.</li>
            <li>Applying a wet badger to the dry cake with only 5 rotations and building the lather with rotations on the face, I get a thicker and more protective lather.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality shaving soap hand created in historical Williamsburg.</li>
            <li>And it seems to be lasting pretty long.</li>

            <li> Got this for my dad and he loves it!  It smells great and lasts a long time!</li>

            <li> Nice solid soap love the scent</li>
            <li> This is a high quality shaving soap hand created in historical Williamsburg. They have different scents which I will try.</li>

The razor glides smoothly over my face as I shave; provides good lubrication but not too slippery, still effective in giving me a close shave. It&#x27;s aroma therapy in the morning. (Posted by Elizabeth&#x27;s husband.)</li>
            <li> Amazing company with wonderful products. Love them</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the bar they sent me. A lot off effort required to produce a sub par lather. There are other brands in this price range that lather up better and easier.  Smells nice, that&#x27;s what the one star is for.</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s ok. Doesn&#x27;t work as he expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I enjoy it as much a regular shaving cream, but it does smell nice &amp; works fine.</li>
            <li> Decent shaving soap with plenty of lather. It provides adequate lubrication for a DE razor shave. It does however work very well for a cartridge razor shave providing excellent lubrication. The soap has a very mild scent which is great for me. I don&#x27;t like heavily scented soaps - too stinky and irritates my skin. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give you my opinion on the longevity of the soap in terms of shaves per bar compared to others I&#x27;ve used in the past. My most important attribute for a shaving soap is to provide the best lubrication and comfort during a shave. I could care less about how it lathers. I want the blade to glide smoothly over my face giving the closest shave with minimal skin irritation. I believe and have experience other soaps that do much better on this attribute at a much lower cost than this soap. What are they, you ask? They are home-made speciality face soaps providing phenomenal lubrication,minimal irritation and moisturizes the skin. Not only that, there are dozens of choices in the type of scent and level of scent of the soap tailored to one&#x27;s likes. You can find these soaps locally or online for bars in the $4 to $7 per bar. The only disadvantage (isn&#x27;t a problem for me) is that they are rectangular in shape so they will not fit in many shaving soap dishes. Happy shaving...</li>
            <li> Very difficult to work up a lather.  Scent is very subtle and could work with any aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used TOBS, Proraso, WSP, and Col. Conk.  None have given such a light/loose lather.  My hand soap does about as well.</li>
            <li> Performed great. Arrived on time. Will purchase again.</li>
