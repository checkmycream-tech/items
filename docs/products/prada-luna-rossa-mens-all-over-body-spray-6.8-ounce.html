            <li>I have to say that I LOVE this fragrance</li>
            <li>but i love it</li>
            <li>I turned around real quick and went in for the attack.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Bought this for hubby as it is my all-time favorite men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Let me just say, I have never received so many compliments from women on a cologne before.</li>
            <li>Like the title says, it makes you feel sexy.</li>
            <li>I prefer a cologne to be more on the woodsy side</li>
            <li>this one is my favorite</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I could like a cologne better than this.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, love the packaging.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Love this Prada.  </li>
            <li>and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Reallly love this product.....</li>
            <li>It quickly mellows into a pleasant , perfectly smooth smell.  </li>
            <li>Great scent, great price, less hassle.</li>
            <li>Although a wonderful scent,  it doesn&#x27;t have a long &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>loved it from the first time i flipped the page in Mens Health magazine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice fresh scent and probably better suited for daytime and warmer seasons.</li>
            <li>Its good to have for certain events.</li>
            <li>He loved the scent ever since he sampled it once in a store, and said it really was Luna Rossa.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably the best smelling eau de toilette that a has unique scent, not overpowering but stays on for long.</li>
            <li>the bottle looks like a jail cell,but when this bottle opens you better watch out ladies!!!</li>
            <li>This is very mild.</li>
            <li>--- it is not too strong and stays with you all day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong yet it has an effect on the people around you.</li>
            <li>Not musky, not too strong or overbearing.</li>
            <li>but now I like it a lot I normally don&#x27;t buy unless I smell it in person good pick up</li>
            <li>and this is more on the sweet side.</li>
            <li>Amazing product and I recommend this highly to anyone looking for a great new smell</li>
            <li>So for any of you nervous to buy it because you&#x27;re scared it&#x27;s not authentic, it is authentic. :D</li>
            <li>The bottle looked fine, but when I removed the lid, the spray button was not attached and doesn&#x27;t stay on permanently.</li>
            <li>This cologne has such a beautiful smell that once you were it, you will feel so comfortable going out at night to dinners, bars, clubs etc.</li>
            <li>Recommended for mild cologne lovers!</li>
            <li>This has quickly become my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>Cologne has a refreshing, clean smell, somewhat intriguing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a genuine Prada product, gets complimented every time I wear it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kid&#x27;s Spongebob cologne-which smells fantastic btw.</li>
            <li>Light scent</li>
            <li>My husband smells really good, and it&#x27;s not a heavy smell.</li>
            <li>It has a very fresh smell to it</li>
            <li>I sampled it and it smelled so familiar.</li>
            <li>It says it has burst of orange/lavender freshness, which changes into a cool smooth spearmint smell, with hints of wood and sage to \\&quot;man\\&quot; it up if you will.</li>
            <li>;) whenever he wears it people ask him what the cologne is...smells so fresh and clean!!</li>
            <li>, what I can do from here, I think nothing, will sell it to someone who hsute the colony, instead of being the prada luna rossa, rossa was sent a moon special edition world cup</li>
            <li>This cologne right here baby!</li>
            <li>Good Scent, seems to last all day, and there is plenty of it.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my boyfriend and he loved it, and wore it the next day.</li>
            <li>A fast favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I really thought it would be more to my liking and it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry much about the reviews saying Macy&#x27;s had better pricing as it must have been during a sale time period.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping - love this</li>
            <li>Its not flowery or earthy, its just a good masculine scent that seems to have the right effect on the right people.</li>
            <li>extraordinary</li>
            <li>Have no problems with feeling like it wears off too quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite cologne along side with Armani Code Summer and Hollister SoCal.</li>
            <li>it makes me feel confident and a little sexy and DANG!</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must have for your man!!</li>
            <li>It is such a great scent that my four year old son insists on wearing it too!</li>
            <li>A fanatastic crisp and clean smell</li>
            <li>Has the smell of a fresh bath.</li>
            <li>I still would recommend this to a guy looking for a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>not as good as expected</li>
            <li>The aroma has a nice way of reminding you much later that you are wearing it.</li>
            <li>love the packaging and the fragrance...refreshing and masculine without any hint of foophness or femininity....</li>
            <li>but def worth it fellas</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>I ordered it based on a mens magazine&#x27;s suggestion and they were right on</li>
            <li>its a sweet cologne perfect for night out or any casual occasion</li>
            <li>this is a really nice scent, however it gets just a bit musty after a long day at work, but yummy right away...</li>
            <li>If you want something nice that lasts a long time without</li>
            <li>I love this sexy little smell.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with prada not only it smelled fresh but had a lot of complements from ladies.</li>
            <li>Too strong if you are a professional, going to business.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling and long lasting through the day!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked on Prada&#x27;s Luna Rossa and will order it here soon as I&#x27;ve used 3/4 of the bottle in 2 months...;-)</li>
            <li>When I opened my Amazon box, I first noticed the cellophane on the cologne was torn and unglued.</li>
            <li>however it doesn&#x27;t last all day like most people say...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the perfume personally, bought for grand son.</li>
            <li>First off...</li>
            <li>First off I got it cheaper at Macy&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many different colognes over the years.</li>
            <li>Slow to arrive, but a great cologne.</li>
            <li>I had a sample swatch from a magazine and instantly fell in love with this smell.  </li>
            <li>My wife hates most colognes, so I don&#x27;t usually wear any, but this she REALLY, REALLY likes, and as it turns out, so do most of the women in my office.</li>
            <li>I must admit when i think Prada, i think fussy and over the top however this fragrance has a rich and sexy smell good enough for a jazzy night out but also cool and fun enough to get crazy with.</li>
            <li>I love the smell but the scent literally lasts an hour for me, even if I spritz my whole body and next with up to 10 sprays.</li>
            <li>and then pretty much</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and a decent price.</li>
            <li>The huge bottle should last a year.</li>
            <li>Really  fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, a bit weary about how much cheaper it was, and nervous I was going to be ripped off.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a very mellow tone to it.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance has a very synthetic smell, and it gave me a raging</li>
            <li>The store shipped it out fast.</li>
            <li>and I lose my &#x27;secret weapon&#x27; lol.</li>
            <li>Dillards has it listed at $82 for the 3.4oz much like Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>, I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>This is a &#x27;tester&#x27; product and NOT the real thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Real.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering but gives just enough of a sexy, masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>Granted, those are very clean smells that are unlikely to offend anyone, but do you really want to spend this kind of money just to smell like shampoo and deodorizer?  </li>
            <li>It is so fresh and sexy and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Those spray tests last at least 6 hours and have a a more pleasant experience for what I was looking for from beginning, middle, and end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Been looking for something new for a whole now.</li>
            <li>I have been mainly a Nautica fan</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.  </li>
            <li>It has a citrus tone and is more masculine than just about all of the other colognes.</li>
            <li>It smells ok it&#x27;s a little feminine secant for me</li>
            <li>Save a few more dollars and buy this in the store.  </li>
            <li>When you think of what fresh smells like look no further.</li>
            <li>I went to Macys to buy a new cologne and after smelling 5 or 6 I could&#x60;nt distinguish the scents anymore.</li>
            <li>This is a very classy fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fragrance preferences are very personal, and even though I didn&#x27;t care for this, other people might love it.  </li>
            <li>this is by far the sexiest cologne for a man in decades!</li>
            <li>Such a turn on ;-)</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell but it seems to not last very long</li>
            <li>The bottle I received smells different at first than all the others I&#x27;ve tested at major department stores.  </li>
            <li>So far been using for two weeks.</li>
            <li>It is a lasting scent and very  pleasing.  </li>
            <li>She happened to be in Macys a few days later, tried it, fell in love with it and just bought it.</li>
            <li>The reviews about it not lasting as long are true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to spend an extra 20 then to waste 60.</li>
            <li>Word of caution though, this is the EXTREME version of Luna Rossa, different from the original.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it, but just remember, all colognes smell different on everyone, its just a chemistry thing...</li>
            <li>Not sure if the product is genuine.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny spent on it!!!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require any frequent application and the scent last throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>but this is much more complex and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>It has some citrus but other much more complex scents come through.  </li>
            <li>I guess the only real benefit to buying at a department store is that you&#x27;ll get the little Prada gift bag \\&quot;free\\&quot; with purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know cologne smells different on people due to their chemistry, but I swear if I had this cologne, with the same effect in high school, my high school days would have been a little different...</li>

            <li> but i love it</li>

            <li> Bought this for hubby as it is my all-time favorite men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Let me just say, I have never received so many compliments from women on a cologne before.</li>
            <li> Like the title says, it makes you feel sexy.</li>
            <li> I prefer a cologne to be more on the woodsy side</li>
            <li> this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I could like a cologne better than this.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, love the packaging.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Love this Prada.  </li>
            <li> and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Reallly love this product.....</li>
            <li> It quickly mellows into a pleasant , perfectly smooth smell.  </li>
            <li> Great scent, great price, less hassle.</li>
            <li> Although a wonderful scent,  it doesn&#x27;t have a long &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> loved it from the first time i flipped the page in Mens Health magazine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice fresh scent and probably better suited for daytime and warmer seasons.</li>
            <li> Its good to have for certain events.</li>
            <li> He loved the scent ever since he sampled it once in a store, and said it really was Luna Rossa.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably the best smelling eau de toilette that a has unique scent, not overpowering but stays on for long.</li>
            <li> the bottle looks like a jail cell,but when this bottle opens you better watch out ladies!!!</li>
            <li> This is very mild.</li>
            <li> --- it is not too strong and stays with you all day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong yet it has an effect on the people around you.</li>
            <li> Not musky, not too strong or overbearing.</li>
            <li> but now I like it a lot I normally don&#x27;t buy unless I smell it in person good pick up</li>
            <li> and this is more on the sweet side.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and I recommend this highly to anyone looking for a great new smell</li>
            <li> So for any of you nervous to buy it because you&#x27;re scared it&#x27;s not authentic, it is authentic. :D</li>
            <li> The bottle looked fine, but when I removed the lid, the spray button was not attached and doesn&#x27;t stay on permanently.</li>
            <li> This cologne has such a beautiful smell that once you were it, you will feel so comfortable going out at night to dinners, bars, clubs etc.</li>
            <li> Recommended for mild cologne lovers!</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> Cologne has a refreshing, clean smell, somewhat intriguing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a genuine Prada product, gets complimented every time I wear it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kid&#x27;s Spongebob cologne-which smells fantastic btw.</li>
            <li> Light scent</li>
            <li> My husband smells really good, and it&#x27;s not a heavy smell.</li>
            <li> It has a very fresh smell to it</li>
            <li> I sampled it and it smelled so familiar.</li>
            <li> It says it has burst of orange/lavender freshness, which changes into a cool smooth spearmint smell, with hints of wood and sage to \\&quot;man\\&quot; it up if you will.</li>
            <li> ;) whenever he wears it people ask him what the cologne is...smells so fresh and clean!!</li>
            <li> , what I can do from here, I think nothing, will sell it to someone who hsute the colony, instead of being the prada luna rossa, rossa was sent a moon special edition world cup</li>
            <li> This cologne right here baby!</li>
            <li> Good Scent, seems to last all day, and there is plenty of it.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my boyfriend and he loved it, and wore it the next day.</li>
            <li> A fast favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I really thought it would be more to my liking and it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry much about the reviews saying Macy&#x27;s had better pricing as it must have been during a sale time period.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping - love this</li>
            <li> Its not flowery or earthy, its just a good masculine scent that seems to have the right effect on the right people.</li>
            <li> extraordinary</li>
            <li> Have no problems with feeling like it wears off too quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite cologne along side with Armani Code Summer and Hollister SoCal.</li>
            <li> it makes me feel confident and a little sexy and DANG!</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have for your man!!</li>
            <li> It is such a great scent that my four year old son insists on wearing it too!</li>
            <li> A fanatastic crisp and clean smell</li>
            <li> Has the smell of a fresh bath.</li>
            <li> I still would recommend this to a guy looking for a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> not as good as expected</li>
            <li> The aroma has a nice way of reminding you much later that you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> love the packaging and the fragrance...refreshing and masculine without any hint of foophness or femininity....</li>
            <li> but def worth it fellas</li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> I ordered it based on a mens magazine&#x27;s suggestion and they were right on</li>
            <li> its a sweet cologne perfect for night out or any casual occasion</li>
            <li> this is a really nice scent, however it gets just a bit musty after a long day at work, but yummy right away...</li>
            <li> If you want something nice that lasts a long time without</li>
            <li> I love this sexy little smell.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with prada not only it smelled fresh but had a lot of complements from ladies.</li>
            <li> Too strong if you are a professional, going to business.  </li>
            <li> Great smelling and long lasting through the day!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Prada&#x27;s Luna Rossa and will order it here soon as I&#x27;ve used 3/4 of the bottle in 2 months...;-)</li>
            <li> When I opened my Amazon box, I first noticed the cellophane on the cologne was torn and unglued.</li>
            <li> however it doesn&#x27;t last all day like most people say...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the perfume personally, bought for grand son.</li>
            <li> First off...</li>
            <li> First off I got it cheaper at Macy&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many different colognes over the years.</li>
            <li> Slow to arrive, but a great cologne.</li>
            <li> I had a sample swatch from a magazine and instantly fell in love with this smell.  </li>
            <li> My wife hates most colognes, so I don&#x27;t usually wear any, but this she REALLY, REALLY likes, and as it turns out, so do most of the women in my office.</li>
            <li> I must admit when i think Prada, i think fussy and over the top however this fragrance has a rich and sexy smell good enough for a jazzy night out but also cool and fun enough to get crazy with.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but the scent literally lasts an hour for me, even if I spritz my whole body and next with up to 10 sprays.</li>
            <li> and then pretty much</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and a decent price.</li>
            <li> The huge bottle should last a year.</li>
            <li> Really  fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, a bit weary about how much cheaper it was, and nervous I was going to be ripped off.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very mellow tone to it.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance has a very synthetic smell, and it gave me a raging</li>
            <li> The store shipped it out fast.</li>
            <li> and I lose my &#x27;secret weapon&#x27; lol.</li>
            <li> Dillards has it listed at $82 for the 3.4oz much like Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> , I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> This is a &#x27;tester&#x27; product and NOT the real thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Real.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering but gives just enough of a sexy, masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> Granted, those are very clean smells that are unlikely to offend anyone, but do you really want to spend this kind of money just to smell like shampoo and deodorizer?  </li>
            <li> It is so fresh and sexy and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Those spray tests last at least 6 hours and have a a more pleasant experience for what I was looking for from beginning, middle, and end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Been looking for something new for a whole now.</li>
            <li> I have been mainly a Nautica fan</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.  </li>
            <li> It has a citrus tone and is more masculine than just about all of the other colognes.</li>
            <li> It smells ok it&#x27;s a little feminine secant for me</li>
            <li> Save a few more dollars and buy this in the store.  </li>
            <li> When you think of what fresh smells like look no further.</li>
            <li> I went to Macys to buy a new cologne and after smelling 5 or 6 I could&#x60;nt distinguish the scents anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a very classy fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fragrance preferences are very personal, and even though I didn&#x27;t care for this, other people might love it.  </li>
            <li> this is by far the sexiest cologne for a man in decades!</li>
            <li> Such a turn on ;-)</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell but it seems to not last very long</li>
            <li> The bottle I received smells different at first than all the others I&#x27;ve tested at major department stores.  </li>
            <li> So far been using for two weeks.</li>
            <li> It is a lasting scent and very  pleasing.  </li>
            <li> She happened to be in Macys a few days later, tried it, fell in love with it and just bought it.</li>
            <li> The reviews about it not lasting as long are true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to spend an extra 20 then to waste 60.</li>
            <li> Word of caution though, this is the EXTREME version of Luna Rossa, different from the original.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it, but just remember, all colognes smell different on everyone, its just a chemistry thing...</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product is genuine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny spent on it!!!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require any frequent application and the scent last throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> but this is much more complex and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It has some citrus but other much more complex scents come through.  </li>
            <li> I guess the only real benefit to buying at a department store is that you&#x27;ll get the little Prada gift bag \\&quot;free\\&quot; with purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know cologne smells different on people due to their chemistry, but I swear if I had this cologne, with the same effect in high school, my high school days would have been a little different...</li>
            <li> I rarely wear cologne, but this is subtle and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> However, it does not last as long as it should.  </li>
            <li> Others have posted that it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Also, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Lasts very long and can definitely be your date night cologne.</li>
            <li> I find that a single spray is enough to last all day and leaves just a hint of a linger in the air for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I have the small sample from macy&#x27;s and the scent is a tiny bit different and the duration of it on your skin is the biggest difference.</li>
            <li> The ordering process was carried out without a single glitch!</li>
            <li> Some of my other favorites include Leau d&#x27;Issey, Dolce &amp; Gabbana (dark blue), Carolina Herrera &amp; Chanel Egoiste Platinum.</li>
            <li> up a few extra dollars and get this at your nearest dept store.  </li>
            <li> everyone loves the sent on me even my wife and she is not much on load smells.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle, masculine scent to it.</li>
            <li> no really its that enticing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of aqua di gio and other sorts of \\&quot;ocean-y\\&quot; colognes.</li>
            <li> This is ocean with a slight little spice/very masculine/classy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not original product</li>
            <li> buy it at the department store, this is not original.</li>
            <li> This batch must be the weakened watered down version!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something special, but Prada disappointed me with this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I hate to give this a great review because I&#x27;m afraid everyone will buy it</li>
            <li> Gives you a little bit of pretentious \\&quot;I&#x27;m wearing Prada\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> the perfume I received was wrong and sent me another perfume entirely</li>
            <li> All the big name expensive ones too.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t as long as expected :-(</li>
            <li> I was dumb and fulled by the prize, and I did not check the reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this cologne faithfully for years to come because I could not imagine myself getting tired of smelling it</li>
            <li> But you won&#x27;t go wrong with either</li>
            <li> Do not buy this - it is a fake.</li>
            <li> Sad it is on here for sale.</li>
            <li> The item it&#x27;s fake smell bad</li>
            <li> lip\\&quot; crazy.</li>
            <li> Bad presentation if you ask me.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed, when I found the plastic wrap undone and the box looks like it was opened before</li>
            <li> im very disappointed</li>

            <li> a just love this fragrance, and is cheaper than going to the retail/mall. perfect for summer/winter</li>
            <li> Good Scent, seems to last all day, and there is plenty of it. I&#x27;m expecting it to last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Great price compared to in stores</li>
            <li> Very nice scent for a man. Not too over powering. Good for all seasons.</li>
            <li> Really  fast delivery.  I bought the Prada luna  Rossa cologne for my brother  birthday  . He loved  the cologne he said it smells really  good .</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne. I also get compliments when wearing this cologne. Has the smell of a fresh bath.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Amazing ! Wonderful! Genial!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift but I was very disappointed, when I found the plastic wrap undone and the box looks like it was opened before</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, a bit weary about how much cheaper it was, and nervous I was going to be ripped off. However, the package was delivered on time, in the authentic packaging (box and clearwrap). I gave it to my boyfriend and he loved it, and wore it the next day. He loved the scent ever since he sampled it once in a store, and said it really was Luna Rossa. So for any of you nervous to buy it because you&#x27;re scared it&#x27;s not authentic, it is authentic. :D</li>
            <li> My husband loves it thank Amazon</li>
            <li> I get stopped every time so people can smell me, love it.  Prada makes the best colognes for men! extraordinary</li>
            <li> Save a few more dollars and buy this in the store.  The bottle I received smells different at first than all the others I&#x27;ve tested at major department stores.  It smells similar shortly after but the duration....This stuff only last on me and my clothes for about an hour and then pretty much nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray tests I&#x27;ve done at the stores are a completely different experience. Those spray tests last at least 6 hours and have a a more pleasant experience for what I was looking for from beginning, middle, and end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save up a few extra dollars and get this at your nearest dept store.  This batch must be the weakened watered down version! I&#x27;ll be venturing out to my local store.  I&#x27;m out $60!  Hope you don&#x27;t do the same.</li>
            <li> I love this smell! My favorite!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself after getting one as a gift a year ago. It&#x27;s a genuine Prada product, gets complimented every time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best smelling eau de toilette that a has unique scent, not overpowering but stays on for long. You will love it as a man, and ladies will love it on their man.</li>
            <li> Good product,it smells great in my husband</li>
            <li> This one I didn&#x27;t like in the beginning but now I like it a lot I normally don&#x27;t buy unless I smell it in person good pick up</li>
            <li> My favorite men&#x27;s fragrance</li>
            <li> It has a subtle, masculine scent to it. I like it. One spray is enough to get me through the day and all my lady friends have complimented me. Word of caution though, this is the EXTREME version of Luna Rossa, different from the original. But you won&#x27;t go wrong with either</li>
            <li> Smells great! Just doesn&#x27;t as long as expected :-(</li>
            <li> Great cologne great price shipping was free and fast.</li>
            <li> great quality for the money</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell fory husband.  It&#x27;s not overpowering but gives just enough of a sexy, masculine scent.  He loves it as well!</li>
            <li> What a fragrance, one of the best i&#x27;ve had in a long time, really happy with this product, and the vendor who sold it to me was excellent</li>
            <li> bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift and he loved it and I love the smell. I smelled it in a magazine and loved i.</li>
            <li> Excellent scent for men</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this on my husband</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very mellow tone to it.  It doesn&#x27;t require any frequent application and the scent last throughout the day.  It works well for the spring and summer months.  It&#x27;s the kind of cologne that you could wear day or night.</li>
            <li> Although a wonderful scent,  it doesn&#x27;t have a long &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;. This is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. My husband smelled it in a magazine and wanted it for his birthday. It is such a great scent that my four year old son insists on wearing it too!</li>
            <li> The real deal, smells great.</li>
            <li> The item it&#x27;s fake smell bad it&#x27;s not original product im very disappointed I was very happy for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this since it came out and I haven&#x27;t change it to something else. I&#x27;m in love with it, and I&#x27;d give it 10 stars any given time!</li>
            <li> My husband smells really good, and it&#x27;s not a heavy smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells AWESOME!! My very favorite!</li>
            <li> It is very accurate. It was for a gift, and the person love it! He likes it a lot, good.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, I get lots of compliments.  However, it does not last as long as it should.  After about four hours, it is gone.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell but it seems to not last very long so you have to reapply at various points throughout the day.  Its good to have for certain events.</li>
            <li> its nice and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and I would recommend it to everyone! Packing could of been better but the bottle showed up in great condition which was a surprise looking at the way it was packed. Lol</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on the Prada cologne. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny spent on it!!!  Great smelling and long lasting through the day!! Prada did it again making a great scent!!</li>
            <li> the perfume I received was wrong and sent me another perfume entirely, what I can do from here, I think nothing, will sell it to someone who hsute the colony, instead of being the prada luna rossa, rossa was sent a moon special edition world cup</li>
            <li> I received this cologne for Christmas after having mentioned to my girfriend how great it smelled in the magazine foldout and how I wanted to sample it in the store before buying it. She happened to be in Macys a few days later, tried it, fell in love with it and just bought it. I have to say that I LOVE this fragrance, it has excellent balance and maturity, projection is great and the &#x27;linger&#x27; on my clothes drives my woman \\&quot;bite her lip\\&quot; crazy. Some of my other favorites include Leau d&#x27;Issey, Dolce &amp; Gabbana (dark blue), Carolina Herrera &amp; Chanel Egoiste Platinum. The compliments I&#x27;ve received on this paticular scent have been several and from both men and women. I&#x27;m hooked on Prada&#x27;s Luna Rossa and will order it here soon as I&#x27;ve used 3/4 of the bottle in 2 months...;-)</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product is genuine. Does not stay even 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this - it is a fake. When I opened my Amazon box, I first noticed the cellophane on the cologne was torn and unglued. The box is a flimsy low grade cardboard and coming apart at the seams. The bottle looked fine, but when I removed the lid, the spray button was not attached and doesn&#x27;t stay on permanently. Sad it is on here for sale.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne on my hubby!!!;) whenever he wears it people ask him what the cologne is...smells so fresh and clean!!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent and very elegant perfume for men</li>
            <li> didnt know what to expect --- but i love it --- it is not too strong and stays with you all day</li>
            <li> I sampled it and it smelled so familiar. Then it hit me. My kid&#x27;s Spongebob cologne-which smells fantastic btw. Check it out for yourself:S PONGEBOB 10TH ANNIVERSARY For Boys By NICKELODEON Eau De Toilette Spray.</li>
            <li> Always wanted to have this one. So far been using for two weeks. Lets see whether this one works as good as  Versace Man  Eau Fraiche...</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with prada not only it smelled fresh but had a lot of complements from ladies. I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> It smells ok it&#x27;s a little feminine secant for me but I still wear it .....</li>
            <li> When my husband wore this and walked by I turned around.....oh yes..... I turned around real quick and went in for the attack. It&#x27;s a nice fresh scent and probably better suited for daytime and warmer seasons.</li>
            <li> get complements on this one a lot</li>
            <li> I was expecting something special, but Prada disappointed me with this fragrance.  It smells like a combination of VO5 shampoo and Febreeze.  Granted, those are very clean smells that are unlikely to offend anyone, but do you really want to spend this kind of money just to smell like shampoo and deodorizer?  The fragrance has a very synthetic smell, and it gave me a raging headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance preferences are very personal, and even though I didn&#x27;t care for this, other people might love it.  My recommendation would be to try it before you buy it.</li>
            <li> When you think of what fresh smells like look no further.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite scent!</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne I&#x27;ve purchased. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from numerous people. I will be buying it again as soon as I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with this purchase. The cologne smells really good! The store shipped it out fast. Im very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after smelling it in a magazine - it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product, smells great! Good price as well, what more could you ask for?!</li>
            <li> As i have stated before i collect colonge, i love to smell good it makes me feel confident and a little sexy and DANG! I love this sexy little smell. I get compliments on it everytime i wear it no joke. I must admit when i think Prada, i think fussy and over the top however this fragrance has a rich and sexy smell good enough for a jazzy night out but also cool and fun enough to get crazy with. It says it has burst of orange/lavender freshness, which changes into a cool smooth spearmint smell, with hints of wood and sage to \\&quot;man\\&quot; it up if you will. A fast favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmmmm! Bought this for hubby as it is my all-time favorite men&#x27;s fragrance. It is so fresh and sexy and long lasting. The huge bottle should last a year.</li>
            <li> Great smell for the price however it doesn&#x27;t last all day like most people say...It lasts for about 2 hours or so then it fades away I still would recommend this to a guy looking for a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This cologne has such a beautiful smell that once you were it, you will feel so comfortable going out at night to dinners, bars, clubs etc. It&#x27;s not too strong yet it has an effect on the people around you. Love it!</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine and liked it. Recruited the opinion of our female staff and it was two thumbs up all the way. Everyone compliments me on the scent and it is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
            <li> The cologne was not the same as a department store. The scent did not last.</li>
            <li> Definitely like the scent. Have no problems with feeling like it wears off too quickly. My husband sprayed it in the air in our bedroom, walked through it, and went out at about 6pm, and I could still smell it the next morning.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment! buy it at the department store, this is not original. Will last you about an hour.</li>
            <li> Let me just say, I have never received so many compliments from women on a cologne before. My wife hates most colognes, so I don&#x27;t usually wear any, but this she REALLY, REALLY likes, and as it turns out, so do most of the women in my office. I received it as a gift from a friend... And, she just could not stop admiring the way it smelled on me. I know cologne smells different on people due to their chemistry, but I swear if I had this cologne, with the same effect in high school, my high school days would have been a little different... I rarely wear cologne, but this is subtle and not overbearing. I find that a single spray is enough to last all day and leaves just a hint of a linger in the air for a few seconds. Its not flowery or earthy, its just a good masculine scent that seems to have the right effect on the right people. I HIGHLY recommend it, but just remember, all colognes smell different on everyone, its just a chemistry thing...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the perfume personally, bought for grand son. He requested it for Christmas so he must like it.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Been looking for something new for a whole now.</li>
            <li> First off... You can get this item $20 cheaper at macy&#x27;s, so don&#x27;t buy here. Like the title says, it makes you feel sexy. Smells good. Gives you a little bit of pretentious \\&quot;I&#x27;m wearing Prada\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;This is now the official scent of hisjoeness...</li>
            <li> not quite what I was expecting</li>
            <li> this is by far the sexiest cologne for a man in decades! OMG you smell it and want to hop in the sack! no really its that enticing!</li>
            <li> I really thought it would be more to my liking and it isn&#x27;t.  I prefer a cologne to be more on the woodsy side and this is more on the sweet side.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite cologne along side with Armani Code Summer and Hollister SoCal. It has a very fresh smell to it but unlike any I&#x27;ve ever smelt before. I will be buying this cologne faithfully for years to come because I could not imagine myself getting tired of smelling it and my girlfriend agrees. Amazing product and I recommend this highly to anyone looking for a great new smell</li>
            <li> Prada makes exhilarating fragrances, and this one is no exception. The ordering process was carried out without a single glitch!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li> First off I got it cheaper at Macy&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;With that being said I went on a spree and bought multiple colognes and out of all of them this one is my favorite its a sweet cologne perfect for night out or any casual occasion</li>
            <li> the fragrance was not the one I thought.  This is very mild.</li>
            <li> Light scent, I can&#x27;t keep my hands off of him..</li>
            <li> this is a really nice scent, however it gets just a bit musty after a long day at work, but yummy right away...</li>
            <li> Impeccable customer service,fast shipping, &amp; genuine product. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many different colognes over the years. All the big name expensive ones too. I hate to give this a great review because I&#x27;m afraid everyone will buy it and I lose my &#x27;secret weapon&#x27; lol. Really really great scent. You WILL be complimented on how great you smell with this stuff. Not musky, not too strong or overbearing. Don&#x27;t think I could like a cologne better than this. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry much about the reviews saying Macy&#x27;s had better pricing as it must have been during a sale time period. This priced at $60 for the 3.4oz is the best you&#x27;ll find right now. Dillards has it listed at $82 for the 3.4oz much like Macy&#x27;s. I guess the only real benefit to buying at a department store is that you&#x27;ll get the little Prada gift bag \\&quot;free\\&quot; with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, This cologne is a perfect mild cologne. I&#x27;m a fan of aqua di gio and other sorts of \\&quot;ocean-y\\&quot; colognes. This is ocean with a slight little spice/very masculine/classy. Recommended for mild cologne lovers!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great. Definitely a spring/summer cologne.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, love the packaging. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good!</li>
            <li> not as good as expected</li>
            <li> This is a very classy fragrance. It&#x27;s not overpowering like some others. If you want something nice that lasts a long time without&lt;br /&gt;people being offended, this one&#x27;s for you. Could be worn to work or on a night out.</li>
            <li> It is a lasting scent and very  pleasing.  The aroma has a nice way of reminding you much later that you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> A fanatastic crisp and clean smell, I would highly recommend this product!  I ordered it based on a mens magazine&#x27;s suggestion and they were right on</li>
            <li> Slow to arrive, but a great cologne. Exactly what I wanted and a decent price.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Once again never had this never smelled it, but smells great, and as always with Amazon prime, it was at my door step before I knew it</li>
            <li> Love this Prada.  real good sent..  Ladies love it!!!!  Highly Recommend.  Will Purchase again!!!!!!!  My Wife loves it and all over me when i use it!!!!</li>
            <li> love the packaging and the fragrance...refreshing and masculine without any hint of foophness or femininity....silver packaging reminds me of the boat</li>
            <li> Great buy! Excellent price!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!  Ordered this as a gift for my husband.  I had a sample swatch from a magazine and instantly fell in love with this smell.  Took the chance and ordered an entire bottle and so glad I did.  Cologne has a refreshing, clean smell, somewhat intriguing!</li>
            <li> This smells so amazing!!! I bought it for my boyfriend...it smells very sexy!! Omg!!! Such a turn on ;-)</li>
            <li> I wear this cologne all of the time and I get no comments on it. Someone might say that it smells different on different people but I am just giving my opinion. Also, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This cologne right here baby! yes indeed a panty dropper! the bottle looks like a jail cell,but when this bottle opens you better watch out ladies!!! This is an absolute must have for your man!!</li>
            <li> Great scent, great price, less hassle. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite cologne.  I have been mainly a Nautica fan but this is much more complex and long lasting.  Others have posted that it doesn&#x27;t last long but it seems to be my longest lasting cologne.  Initally goes on very strong but don&#x27;t be alarmed.  It quickly mellows into a pleasant , perfectly smooth smell.  It has some citrus but other much more complex scents come through.  I get compliments virtually every time I wear it.Lasts very long and can definitely be your date night cologne. I believe it could be your permanent go to cologne that you will always want on hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best perfume I ever had</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I wear this my all time favorite now kind of pricey but def worth it fellas want to smell like you somebody get this while its hot lol</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and people like how it smells</li>
            <li> Too strong if you are a professional, going to business.  I guess it would be great for parties with strong aroma.</li>
            <li> This is a &#x27;tester&#x27; product and NOT the real thing. It doesn&#x27;t even come with packaging, it&#x27;s just wrapped up in newspaper and regular shipping package. Does not have a cap. Bad presentation if you ask me. Should&#x27;ve bought it from the department store. Will NOT be buying again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Real. Some reviews were saying it didn&#x27;t come in a box, my order did. Just like from a retail shop but over 20 dollars cheaper. Highly recommend! Smells so good!</li>
            <li> Reallly love this product.....</li>
            <li> I love the smell but the scent literally lasts an hour for me, even if I spritz my whole body and next with up to 10 sprays.</li>
            <li> You are really too good, I like it very much, I want to introduce to everybody, this is really a very good product.</li>
            <li> The reviews about it not lasting as long are true. I was dumb and fulled by the prize, and I did not check the reviews before purchasing. I have the small sample from macy&#x27;s and the scent is a tiny bit different and the duration of it on your skin is the biggest difference. The sample with two sprays on the neck would last me all day. I wore this and didn&#x27;t even last me the hour. Don&#x27;t get fulled by this spend the extra money and go to a department store to get it. It&#x27;s better to spend an extra 20 then to waste 60.</li>
            <li> loved it from the first time i flipped the page in Mens Health magazine. Great product. everyone loves the sent on me even my wife and she is not much on load smells.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping - love this</li>
            <li> Prada knocks one out of the park, with Luna Rossa.&lt;br /&gt;It has a sweet smell and is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I went to Macys to buy a new cologne and after smelling 5 or 6 I could&#x60;nt distinguish the scents anymore. They gave me a jar with coffee beans to throw off the scents and when I picked this one up I knew that would be the one I was leaving with. It has a citrus tone and is more masculine than just about all of the other colognes. I will be wearing this from now on.</li>
