    <ol>
            <li> My hair and skin loves this stuff.  Light weight oil.</li>
            <li> Nice product, exactly as expected.  Wil purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells like canola oil.</li>
            <li> not as rasberry smelling as I was hoping for</li>
            <li> Tiny bottle but worked for making sunscreen with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I will use this for Sun Block But have not been able to say how good</li>
            <li> I like that the fragrance is negligible. Nice feel. Going to use it daily all summer as I am outside most of the day.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer. And definitely has some sun protection: I think about 30-40. I (a light blond) spent a day on Jones Beach, which was very sunny and breezy and did not get any burns: only slight redness, that disappeared on the next day. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and will take it to the next Caribbean trip. Thank you very much.  P.S. One month later...   I just came back from Caribbean. I applied the oil on my face before sun exposure, but soon I stopped to use it. Why?  The smell !!!   Light, but unpleasant fishy smell. It appeared in 1-2 hours after application. Maybe the influence of ocean water?</li>
            <li> Got this to use in my homemade sunscreen.  Raspberry seed oil adds to the SPF factor naturally.  This product is sold at a very reasonable price, I think.  Along with beeswax, almond and jojoba oils, zinc oxide, carrot oil, and a few other things, making your own sunscreen isn&#x27;t hard.  They have recipes for it on several sites--just look under homemade sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Very nice and light on the skin. Can also be used as a carrier oil, or used alone. Absorbs well. No fragrance.</li>
            <li> Worth the price! Nice size jar as well!</li>
            <li> I love this product by far is the best oil &amp; ever tried, and I have tried most of the oils. It leaves the skin so soft and its just great it has a light rasberry sent but it bother me at hall.</li>
            <li> This product is great. They ship it very quickly, and the oil itself is wonderful and absorbs easily and completely into the skin.</li>

There is a slight scent, but your carrier oil (even if its just processed olive oil) should mask it. No one willl ever know why you have awesome skin ;) I plan to use this everyday for the rest of my life and see how well my skin ages</li>
            <li> perfect for sunscreen</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it to wash my face. It smells good too!</li>
            <li> Purchased to make homemade sunscreen due to sensitivity to chemicals in commercial products.  Combined it with other natural ingredients and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Love this product. OMG</li>
            <li> In the last few years, I have studied heavily on health and causes of aging. In most cases, antioxidants, normally produced by the body, are reduced as we age. This is the cause of aging, dementia, and other health problems. This red raspberry seed oil is to be used externally only, but provides antioxidants to the skin that will be absorbed. I add this oil to the facial moisturizer that I use daily. I have also used it straight on my face. The bottle is very small, but it only take a drop to cover your face. Once applied, your face does not feel oily because it is almost immediately absorbed. This is one more way that you can help your body to avoid the aging process.</li>
            <li> I use this in my handmade lip butters I sell on Etsy and I really think it makes a positive contribution to the product.  No complaints here. My order arrived quickly and I started using it immediately.  I was somehow hoping it would have a fruity smell to it but realize that is a little bit silly.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to say how much I like this since I have only used it for DIY sunscreen. I had no serious reaction so I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Very light smell, not strong at all which is great-look forward to trying it in some homemade sunscreen!!</li>
            <li> this has not broken out my sensitive skin, it has essential fatty acids, and can be blended into diy sunscreen</li>
