            <li>These came in handy.</li>
            <li>So nice to have something that can  be reused.  </li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for with mixing my own oils.</li>
            <li>These bottles are nice to keep almond oil in to put on my lips.</li>
            <li>I have looked all over for these as I make my own Patchouli perfume and the bottles I used</li>
            <li>Very easy to refill.</li>
            <li>It leaks very easily.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these and would recommend to anyone who makes their own cosmetic products.</li>

            <li>These items arrived quickly, and were in good condition.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect, easy to fill, and they look pretty cool, too.</li>
            <li>I bought this package of 2 and used one right away, that one was fine and worked great.</li>
            <li>However, I ordered some more and this set had both roller balls fall out, causing the contents to spill all over the user.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li>I use these for my essential oils and they work great!</li>
            <li>I bought these for my cologne, so I can apply it more selectively.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this out before I packed them in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for travel perfume and also for my essential oils that I use to roll on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li>I suppose they are &amp;#34;refillable&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a bit more work than one would imagine.</li>
            <li>Glad I got a pack of (2).</li>
            <li>I like to put leftover perfume or perfume samples into these so that they&#x27;re easier to apply and certainly better for travel.</li>
            <li>Maybe they work ok with oils, but they don&#x27;t work for my intended purpose.</li>
            <li>The actual product works perfectly.</li>
            <li>and they are stylish.</li>
            <li>I filled one bottle with perfume, and so far, it seems to do the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with my $3 purchase.</li>
            <li>If you are blending oils, make sure you either know chemistry or have a recipe from someone who does, or you will have a severe allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for my essential oil mixtures.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, though, as they do the job</li>
            <li>I use them to put essential oils in and they work great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues with leaking or getting the top off.  </li>
            <li>Love that there is one of each.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>carry my oil perfumes on them and I love them!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could take my favorite scents with me when I travel.</li>
            <li>and then it moves okay for a while.</li>
            <li>I would by these again if I needed more rollers.</li>
            <li>I would order more for my family and friends.</li>
            <li>Three more words required.  </li>
            <li>Really happy with these items, I&#x27;m able to put my own scents in them easily, so far there is no leaking around the cap</li>
            <li>The snug top prevents leakage.  </li>

            <li>I just sprayed my favorite perfume into one of the bottles and put on the roller ball</li>
            <li>on trip as well, thanks a million!!!!</li>
            <li>First of all, I am impressed with the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is so easy, and lets you roll on your favorite perfumes with out overpowering your clothing with your favorite scent.</li>
            <li>They are pretty and of good quality.</li>
            <li>These worked perfectly for my trip and to just stick in my purse if I have a long day.</li>
            <li>These are supposed to help make perfume more portable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it is super handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work fine with perfume or oils though.</li>
            <li>Both arrived perfectly fine, the shipping was okay, and they work so nicely!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great gift for the frequent traveler.</li>
            <li>So far I have had great results with this Roll-on refillable glass perfume bottle.  </li>
            <li>They arrived in perfect condition and work as expected.  </li>
            <li>I filled them both with my favorite scents and was spared the expense of having to purchase a rollerball from the perfume companies (that can run upwards of $20 each).  </li>
            <li>Great price and super fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Now I have a super portable, delicious smelling bottle of custom facial oil.</li>
            <li>I was even able to peel off the label from the original bottle and put it on the roller.</li>
            <li>Other than that its great!</li>
            <li>They do not leak and are easy to refill.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The roller ball makes it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pop the ball in and out for cleaning and/or refilling.</li>
            <li>I found the rollers easy to remove and replace.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill and refill with no problems.  </li>
            <li>so I can easily just grab the one I want without labeling and know which one I picked.</li>
            <li>easy to fill up...</li>
            <li>Also easy to pack in purse and carry on plane.</li>
            <li>I bought these to mix a perfume oil into a milder form because it was too strong.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good product, really worthy, glass feels good and high qualitied.</li>
            <li>(I still have to research/figure out the best home made lip gloss recipe as my combination of oils tend to dry up quickly on the lips).</li>
            <li>I ordered these before and they were fine.</li>
            <li>but I know they will work just fine.</li>
            <li>I did find a pet water bottle with a metal roller and that works fine on an airplane.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>I can use it anywhere quickly!</li>
            <li>One of the bottles was chipped upon arrival and the seller was quick to offer two acceptable options for me!</li>
            <li>I found these very useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>For one bottle it fit fine</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how secure the roller tops are on these and how tight the cap screws on.</li>
            <li>These little bottles worked perfectly and never leak!</li>
            <li>Perfect little portable containers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY happy with these little roller bottles.  </li>
            <li>This item leaks a little bit but for the price it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Also, the roller ball didn&#x27;t move smoothly.</li>
            <li>Great size for my essential oils plus the added carrier oil.</li>
            <li>These are great, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>Overall... happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>This size is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not rocket science, but more like elementary school science or engineering 101.</li>
            <li>it holds the oils and rolls smoothly.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want to do that since it is plastic and probably has BPA since it does not specify being BPA free.</li>
            <li>Bought these to hold essential oil and was happy with them.</li>
            <li>They work great and even after dropping several times on tile they didnt break.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very practical an have a nice shape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used paper and tape to label their contents (on bottle for smooth ones, on cap for swirl bottles) and they serve my needs.</li>
            <li>These rollers are great for a number of different things - depends on what your needs are!</li>
            <li>I also have to ones that have a smooth surface...</li>
            <li>For the price, these were a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap, efficient - just what I needed.</li>
            <li>I am happy with these, except that I had to open them with my teeth.</li>
            <li>Used for applying essential oils, they work great</li>
            <li>So far, so good with these bottles.</li>
            <li>Good quality, easy to refill and no leak though cap or major gap around the roller.</li>
            <li>Very useful stuff.</li>
            <li>Items were as advertised and they are very useful items for carrying cologne perfume during travel,  </li>
            <li>The roller ball is plastic and comes off easily for quick and effortless refilling.  </li>
            <li>The shipping took a while, but they are worth the wait!</li>
            <li>So Excited.</li>
            <li>You first have to roll the top a bit in order to make it work</li>
            <li>It comes with a plastic slim extractor to retrieve you fragrance from he original bottle</li>
            <li>Love that I can take my own essential oils and use them with ease now.</li>
            <li>super cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li>These pretty little glass bottles are perfect.</li>
            <li>I loved these for blending my essential oils.</li>
            <li>A whole bunch of the oil spilled out before he was able to turn it right-side-up.</li>
            <li>The lids don&#x27;t fit right, so I can&#x27;t take them with me</li>
            <li>Easy to use and pretty.</li>
            <li>Bottles were very clean with no residual odors and very well packages.</li>
            <li>Love that you get two different styles to be able to tell them apart.</li>
            <li>Super value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were Shipped quickly and I received them fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>I love to carry perfume and re-apply with the roller bottle because if you have a mini-atomizer, spraying a mist into the air in a public space is sometimes more attention than I want.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and wish I would have thought of it sooner :)</li>
            <li>The fit is pretty snug.</li>
            <li>Unlike many of the other reviews, mine did not arrive chipped and the roller ball was very easy to pop in and out.</li>
            <li>The swirl design on one of them is so pretty as well!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>A good size for mixing oils, but one of the bottles I received has a loose ball</li>
            <li>The bottles are great, but the rollers are too tight and do not roll the oils out.  </li>
            <li>These little bottles are great.</li>
            <li>Thise little Roll On Atomozers are Great.  </li>
            <li>The roller-ball top came off easily with a using a flat head screw driver to lift it off.</li>
            <li>I use them for  own stress relief essential oils.</li>
            <li>I figured applying it more directly with a roller as opposed to walking through a spray would help.</li>
            <li>These took a while to ship, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>So instead of spending a jillion dollars to buy the Clarins facial oil, I went online and found a group of people just making their own.</li>
            <li>Bought to mix my own blend of essential oils so can keep in my purse when the dreaded migraine or tension headache starts.</li>
            <li>I make my own perfume using essential oils, Jojoba Oil, etc.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I gifted these to young ladies in my family.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Make your own scented oils and up them into these roll on bottles......use some fractionated coconut oil and essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to make my own roll on essential oil blends.</li>
            <li>Very nice little roller bottles.  </li>
            <li>Most things this basic are pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>The roller ball is easy to remove initially and the bottle is easy to fill.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size for the purse and are</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bottles leaking and they dispense just the right amount of perfume.</li>
            <li>These are great little bottles, and I&#x27;m actually back to buy 2 more.  </li>
            <li>top barely fits the bottle</li>
            <li>The different designs are great for differentiating between different scents!</li>
            <li>These roll on, refillable bottles are great, especially when using essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was also quick and I was VERY thankful that the seller threw in a couple of plastic droppers.</li>
            <li>I mix my own fragrance oils and this makes it so easy to make small batches.  </li>
            <li>I really like it! -Vicki</li>
            <li>The roll-on perfume bottles are exactly what you see in the pictures.  </li>
            <li>Obviously this works better with the smooth bottle, but the label on the swirly bottle is staying put so far.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Ordered this before I knew most essential oils need to be protected from sun/light exposure.  </li>
            <li>I ordered more to have on hand for next time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and tiny!</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li>The look of the bottle is exactly like the pictures.</li>
            <li>I love mixing my essential oils in these roll ons and have it with me on the go.</li>
            <li>There is no waste and my hands stay oil free.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>In fact I am ordering several more.  </li>
            <li>Love that there are two different types of bottles</li>
            <li>were pretty beat up.  </li>
            <li>Would not purchase this item again though unless it is a different and better made brand.</li>
            <li>The glass and top are of good quality, but the top roller ball keeps falling out now. :-(</li>
            <li>Last year I decided to decrease my toxin exposure by making my own cleaning, beauty, and self care supplies with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Only good for low viscosity liquids.</li>
            <li>You will need pliers to take the cap off for filling but its not difficult and pops back on easily.</li>
            <li>Once you put it on, it&#x27;s pretty much stuck.</li>
            <li>Great roll on bottles to add perfume, essential oils, or any other liquids.</li>
            <li>I bought these little rollers to fill with castor oil to easily apply as lip treatment and it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>I made my own mint &amp; lavender oil (for headaches) and these little bottles were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>These bottles are easy to fill and fit tight with no leaks.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t leaked in my purse, It&#x27;s easy to fill once you get it open.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to take the roller ball off yet, but it appears to be easy to pry back off in order to refill the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I put my essential oils in these for an easy application.</li>
            <li>My two favorite fragrances aren&#x27;t available in a small bottle or purse size.  </li>
            <li>Quality of bottles was good, glass was thick enough to feel sturdy and trust not too break easily if baggage or purse that was tossed about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also easy to clean when changing scents, all you need is a little rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>I use them instead of the original bottle&#x27;s spray, as I can use less while applying more economically over larger areas.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that I can&#x27;t seem to fit the roller on one of the bottles.</li>
            <li>The roll on works very well.</li>
            <li>These work very well.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to hold perfume in it since I have to pry the ball free enough which will let perfume evaporate.</li>
            <li>I bought these before I really explored the competitors.</li>
            <li>These are way too much.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>They are very skinny, but do the trick.</li>
            <li>They work well and don&#x27;t dispense too much at a time.</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>Shipper sent them fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>These with the removable roller make it so much easier.</li>
            <li>Securing it back on after I filled the bottle was even easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but on the straight tube, the ball keeps falling out.</li>
            <li>The part that secures the roller ball on is way too intense.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the product seems to be holding up.</li>
            <li>However if it&#x27;s in your purse and not standing straight up they will leak.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I use these with essential oils mixed in vodka to make my own perfumes.</li>
            <li>I use these roll-on bottles for my various essential oil mixtures and these work nicely.</li>
            <li>I would like to see if they are willing to ship new roller caps for these bottles.....</li>
            <li>The right amount comes out so there is no waste.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for using my oils with these handy little bottles, until I went to put the lids on.  </li>
            <li>leaks, no cracks, lids stay on nice and tight!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leak like most other roll-on bottles either.</li>
            <li>They are very reasonable and work very well - no waste of product when using the roll-on bottles.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are careful when ready to screw in the plastic &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34; top, it can be a little tricky to screw on.</li>
            <li>Nothing special... just two tiny bottles</li>
            <li>Wish I would have gotten the blue or amber ones to protect my essential oils, but I use them up so fast that it&#x27;s probably OK.  </li>
            <li>and it was okay for about a week, then the oil started dripping down the edges of the bottle when I tried to roll it</li>
            <li>, you have to be sure the plastic roller is all the way on the glass tube opening, and tight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommeded.</li>
            <li>Other than that the balls do roll around my essential oils nicely.</li>
            <li>so I can easily tell one scent from the other just by looking at the bottle.</li>
            <li>After a few months, the ball in the top attachment fell out.</li>
            <li>I have reordered a few times :)</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and the seller was more than accommodating when an item was missing from an order.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say anything negative about them.</li>
            <li>Balls roll well, nice thick glass.</li>
            <li>Personally, i put essential oil in them for an easy application any time i need it.</li>
            <li>also use these for making my own little perfumes using essential oils.</li>
            <li>so when I bought new perfume I looked for roll-on bottles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging was adequate and the bottles arrived intact with 2 plastic squeeze droppers (5ml)with very long stems that were about 6 inches (estimate)</li>
            <li>Having one smooth and one textured helps me quickly visually recognize two different fragrances.</li>
            <li>I WILL say that in the picture the bottles look the same size, but when I received them the swirly bottle was slightly bigger than the smooth bottle.</li>
            <li>Winter means super dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li>This exactly what I need it for my peppermint essential oil and my blending of analgesic oils too.</li>
            <li>I put drops of coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil and avocado oil in the bottle and it works pretty well in the application of these on my lips</li>
            <li>Both of these bottles work pretty well for our essential oil application.</li>
            <li>They were easy to fill, not too messy, and the caps fit right back on with a firm push.  </li>
            <li>The black lids don&#x27;t fit on the bottles, completely unusable!</li>
            <li>Nice and small for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>They snapped together fairly easily, but then I don&#x27;t know how difficult it&#x27;ll be to pull the top back off when it&#x27;s time to change out the contents.</li>
            <li>but I wish they weren&#x27;t clear.  </li>
            <li>I tested these with water and placed them in a clear ziplock bag before I added my perfume.  </li>
            <li>Fits well in your purse and so far no leaking.</li>
            <li>should think that if you want to carry it in a purse, to wrap it in a soft cloth and place it upright in a pocket, just to be on the safest side.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really did get a larger volume of oil all over the place!</li>
            <li>We ended up just spraying from the manufacturer&#x27;s bottle directly into this bottle.</li>
            <li>You can only really use perfumes that don&#x27;t have a permanently attached pump anyway</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s a rollerball, you&#x27;re likely to get a lot more perfume dispensed than maybe you want, especially if the bottle is stored upside down.</li>
            <li>Then the little ball, just fell right out!  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if I wil be able to open up the bottle again to refill.</li>
            <li>Unless it&#x27;s possible for you to keep it standing upright in your bag throughout the day, I&#x27;d highly advise against buying this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make a mess free essential oil perfume and needed something to keep it in.</li>
            <li>The roller ball lids stay on nice and tight, but I can get them off when I need to without any trouble.  </li>
            <li>I used a hammer - gently - to get the roller part fully on top.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the little inverted circle on the inside top of the black cap will, when screwed on firmly, prevent the ball from leaking fluid into the cap, and then whatever the glass container is in should stay safe and dry from &amp;</li>
            <li>I received two extra large samples of perfume, but only in a bottle with no spray or roller.  </li>
            <li>I am able to take my expensive perfumes without having the large bottles with me.</li>
            <li>The rollerballs range from somewhat hard to roll to easier, but none are as easy as the ones that come with perfume rollerballs.</li>
            <li>Aside from the chip that&#x27;s on one, albeit a small one that&#x27;s not such a big deal that I&#x27;m willing to deal with the exchange process, these are quite cool.</li>
            <li>Took a little longer than I hoped for them to arrive, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Not a single drop leaked!!</li>
            <li>Generally o.k.  </li>
            <li>I had a leaky bottle of VS perfume that I couldn&#x27;t bare to part with.</li>
            <li>I use them to mix my Young Living essential oils</li>
            <li>I had a broken nozzle on an old perfume bottle so that pretty much prevented me from using the perfume within it for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Disappointing as the quality of one I received was great, but apparently they are not consistent.</li>
            <li>I was worried that they&#x27;d let out too much product and drip all over the place (it&#x27;s happened with other roll-ons), but these definitely don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>Easy to use And Quality solid thick glass!</li>
            <li>Nice and small, but not too small!</li>
            <li>I really like these little bottles.</li>

            <li> Just what I was looking for with mixing my own oils.</li>
            <li> These bottles are nice to keep almond oil in to put on my lips.</li>
            <li> I have looked all over for these as I make my own Patchouli perfume and the bottles I used</li>
            <li> Very easy to refill.</li>
            <li> It leaks very easily.</li>

            <li> I bought this package of 2 and used one right away, that one was fine and worked great.</li>
            <li> However, I ordered some more and this set had both roller balls fall out, causing the contents to spill all over the user.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li> I use these for my essential oils and they work great!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my cologne, so I can apply it more selectively.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this out before I packed them in my purse.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for travel perfume and also for my essential oils that I use to roll on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> I suppose they are &amp;#34;refillable&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a bit more work than one would imagine.</li>
            <li> Glad I got a pack of (2).</li>
            <li> I like to put leftover perfume or perfume samples into these so that they&#x27;re easier to apply and certainly better for travel.</li>
            <li> Maybe they work ok with oils, but they don&#x27;t work for my intended purpose.</li>
            <li> The actual product works perfectly.</li>
            <li> and they are stylish.</li>
            <li> I filled one bottle with perfume, and so far, it seems to do the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with my $3 purchase.</li>
            <li> If you are blending oils, make sure you either know chemistry or have a recipe from someone who does, or you will have a severe allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my essential oil mixtures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, though, as they do the job</li>
            <li> I use them to put essential oils in and they work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with leaking or getting the top off.  </li>

            <li> carry my oil perfumes on them and I love them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could take my favorite scents with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> and then it moves okay for a while.</li>
            <li> I would by these again if I needed more rollers.</li>
            <li> I would order more for my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Three more words required.  </li>
            <li> Really happy with these items, I&#x27;m able to put my own scents in them easily, so far there is no leaking around the cap</li>
            <li> The snug top prevents leakage.  </li>
            <li> Love these for MANY uses.  </li>
            <li> They arrived in a timely manner, are economical, and good quality.</li>

            <li> I wanted to be able to bring it to the gym and apply before jumping in the steam room after working out.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research, I stumbled across these lovely travel bottles.</li>
            <li> I just fill them with my favorite scents and now can  have them with me anytime.</li>

            <li> &amp; I feel these bottles are of better quality.</li>
            <li> Plus, these bottles were a much better price.</li>
            <li> I just sprayed my favorite perfume into one of the bottles and put on the roller ball</li>
            <li> on trip as well, thanks a million!!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I am impressed with the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is so easy, and lets you roll on your favorite perfumes with out overpowering your clothing with your favorite scent.</li>
            <li> They are pretty and of good quality.</li>
            <li> These worked perfectly for my trip and to just stick in my purse if I have a long day.</li>
            <li> These are supposed to help make perfume more portable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it is super handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work fine with perfume or oils though.</li>
            <li> Both arrived perfectly fine, the shipping was okay, and they work so nicely!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great gift for the frequent traveler.</li>
            <li> So far I have had great results with this Roll-on refillable glass perfume bottle.  </li>
            <li> They arrived in perfect condition and work as expected.  </li>
            <li> I filled them both with my favorite scents and was spared the expense of having to purchase a rollerball from the perfume companies (that can run upwards of $20 each).  </li>
            <li> Great price and super fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Now I have a super portable, delicious smelling bottle of custom facial oil.</li>
            <li> I was even able to peel off the label from the original bottle and put it on the roller.</li>
            <li> Other than that its great!</li>
            <li> They do not leak and are easy to refill.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The roller ball makes it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pop the ball in and out for cleaning and/or refilling.</li>
            <li> I found the rollers easy to remove and replace.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fill and refill with no problems.  </li>
            <li> so I can easily just grab the one I want without labeling and know which one I picked.</li>
            <li> easy to fill up...</li>
            <li> Also easy to pack in purse and carry on plane.</li>
            <li> I bought these to mix a perfume oil into a milder form because it was too strong.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good product, really worthy, glass feels good and high qualitied.</li>
            <li> (I still have to research/figure out the best home made lip gloss recipe as my combination of oils tend to dry up quickly on the lips).</li>
            <li> I ordered these before and they were fine.</li>
            <li> but I know they will work just fine.</li>
            <li> I did find a pet water bottle with a metal roller and that works fine on an airplane.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> I can use it anywhere quickly!</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was chipped upon arrival and the seller was quick to offer two acceptable options for me!</li>
            <li> I found these very useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> For one bottle it fit fine</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how secure the roller tops are on these and how tight the cap screws on.</li>
            <li> These little bottles worked perfectly and never leak!</li>
            <li> Perfect little portable containers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY happy with these little roller bottles.  </li>
            <li> This item leaks a little bit but for the price it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Also, the roller ball didn&#x27;t move smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great size for my essential oils plus the added carrier oil.</li>
            <li> These are great, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> Overall... happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> This size is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not rocket science, but more like elementary school science or engineering 101.</li>
            <li> it holds the oils and rolls smoothly.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to do that since it is plastic and probably has BPA since it does not specify being BPA free.</li>
            <li> Bought these to hold essential oil and was happy with them.</li>
            <li> They work great and even after dropping several times on tile they didnt break.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very practical an have a nice shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used paper and tape to label their contents (on bottle for smooth ones, on cap for swirl bottles) and they serve my needs.</li>
            <li> These rollers are great for a number of different things - depends on what your needs are!</li>
            <li> I also have to ones that have a smooth surface...</li>
            <li> For the price, these were a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap, efficient - just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I am happy with these, except that I had to open them with my teeth.</li>
            <li> Used for applying essential oils, they work great</li>
            <li> So far, so good with these bottles.</li>
            <li> Good quality, easy to refill and no leak though cap or major gap around the roller.</li>
            <li> Very useful stuff.</li>
            <li> Items were as advertised and they are very useful items for carrying cologne perfume during travel,  </li>
            <li> The roller ball is plastic and comes off easily for quick and effortless refilling.  </li>
            <li> The shipping took a while, but they are worth the wait!</li>
            <li> So Excited.</li>
            <li> You first have to roll the top a bit in order to make it work</li>
            <li> It comes with a plastic slim extractor to retrieve you fragrance from he original bottle</li>
            <li> Love that I can take my own essential oils and use them with ease now.</li>
            <li> super cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li> These pretty little glass bottles are perfect.</li>
            <li> I loved these for blending my essential oils.</li>
            <li> A whole bunch of the oil spilled out before he was able to turn it right-side-up.</li>
            <li> The lids don&#x27;t fit right, so I can&#x27;t take them with me</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pretty.</li>
            <li> Bottles were very clean with no residual odors and very well packages.</li>
            <li> Love that you get two different styles to be able to tell them apart.</li>
            <li> Super value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were Shipped quickly and I received them fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love to carry perfume and re-apply with the roller bottle because if you have a mini-atomizer, spraying a mist into the air in a public space is sometimes more attention than I want.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and wish I would have thought of it sooner :)</li>
            <li> The fit is pretty snug.</li>
            <li> Unlike many of the other reviews, mine did not arrive chipped and the roller ball was very easy to pop in and out.</li>
            <li> The swirl design on one of them is so pretty as well!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> A good size for mixing oils, but one of the bottles I received has a loose ball</li>
            <li> The bottles are great, but the rollers are too tight and do not roll the oils out.  </li>
            <li> These little bottles are great.</li>
            <li> Thise little Roll On Atomozers are Great.  </li>
            <li> The roller-ball top came off easily with a using a flat head screw driver to lift it off.</li>
            <li> I use them for  own stress relief essential oils.</li>
            <li> I figured applying it more directly with a roller as opposed to walking through a spray would help.</li>
            <li> These took a while to ship, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> So instead of spending a jillion dollars to buy the Clarins facial oil, I went online and found a group of people just making their own.</li>
            <li> Bought to mix my own blend of essential oils so can keep in my purse when the dreaded migraine or tension headache starts.</li>
            <li> I make my own perfume using essential oils, Jojoba Oil, etc.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I gifted these to young ladies in my family.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Make your own scented oils and up them into these roll on bottles......use some fractionated coconut oil and essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to make my own roll on essential oil blends.</li>
            <li> Very nice little roller bottles.  </li>
            <li> Most things this basic are pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> The roller ball is easy to remove initially and the bottle is easy to fill.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size for the purse and are</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bottles leaking and they dispense just the right amount of perfume.</li>
            <li> These are great little bottles, and I&#x27;m actually back to buy 2 more.  </li>
            <li> top barely fits the bottle</li>
            <li> The different designs are great for differentiating between different scents!</li>
            <li> These roll on, refillable bottles are great, especially when using essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was also quick and I was VERY thankful that the seller threw in a couple of plastic droppers.</li>
            <li> I mix my own fragrance oils and this makes it so easy to make small batches.  </li>
            <li> I really like it! -Vicki</li>
            <li> The roll-on perfume bottles are exactly what you see in the pictures.  </li>
            <li> Obviously this works better with the smooth bottle, but the label on the swirly bottle is staying put so far.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Ordered this before I knew most essential oils need to be protected from sun/light exposure.  </li>
            <li> I ordered more to have on hand for next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and tiny!</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> The look of the bottle is exactly like the pictures.</li>
            <li> I love mixing my essential oils in these roll ons and have it with me on the go.</li>
            <li> There is no waste and my hands stay oil free.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> In fact I am ordering several more.  </li>
            <li> Love that there are two different types of bottles</li>
            <li> were pretty beat up.  </li>
            <li> Would not purchase this item again though unless it is a different and better made brand.</li>
            <li> The glass and top are of good quality, but the top roller ball keeps falling out now. :-(</li>
            <li> Last year I decided to decrease my toxin exposure by making my own cleaning, beauty, and self care supplies with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Only good for low viscosity liquids.</li>
            <li> You will need pliers to take the cap off for filling but its not difficult and pops back on easily.</li>
            <li> Once you put it on, it&#x27;s pretty much stuck.</li>
            <li> Great roll on bottles to add perfume, essential oils, or any other liquids.</li>
            <li> I bought these little rollers to fill with castor oil to easily apply as lip treatment and it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> I made my own mint &amp; lavender oil (for headaches) and these little bottles were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These bottles are easy to fill and fit tight with no leaks.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t leaked in my purse, It&#x27;s easy to fill once you get it open.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to take the roller ball off yet, but it appears to be easy to pry back off in order to refill the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I put my essential oils in these for an easy application.</li>
            <li> My two favorite fragrances aren&#x27;t available in a small bottle or purse size.  </li>
            <li> Quality of bottles was good, glass was thick enough to feel sturdy and trust not too break easily if baggage or purse that was tossed about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also easy to clean when changing scents, all you need is a little rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I use them instead of the original bottle&#x27;s spray, as I can use less while applying more economically over larger areas.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that I can&#x27;t seem to fit the roller on one of the bottles.</li>
            <li> The roll on works very well.</li>
            <li> These work very well.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to hold perfume in it since I have to pry the ball free enough which will let perfume evaporate.</li>
            <li> I bought these before I really explored the competitors.</li>
            <li> These are way too much.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> They are very skinny, but do the trick.</li>
            <li> They work well and don&#x27;t dispense too much at a time.</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> Shipper sent them fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> These with the removable roller make it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Securing it back on after I filled the bottle was even easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but on the straight tube, the ball keeps falling out.</li>
            <li> The part that secures the roller ball on is way too intense.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the product seems to be holding up.</li>
            <li> However if it&#x27;s in your purse and not standing straight up they will leak.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use these with essential oils mixed in vodka to make my own perfumes.</li>
            <li> I use these roll-on bottles for my various essential oil mixtures and these work nicely.</li>
            <li> I would like to see if they are willing to ship new roller caps for these bottles.....</li>
            <li> The right amount comes out so there is no waste.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for using my oils with these handy little bottles, until I went to put the lids on.  </li>
            <li> leaks, no cracks, lids stay on nice and tight!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leak like most other roll-on bottles either.</li>
            <li> They are very reasonable and work very well - no waste of product when using the roll-on bottles.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are careful when ready to screw in the plastic &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34; top, it can be a little tricky to screw on.</li>
            <li> Nothing special... just two tiny bottles</li>
            <li> Wish I would have gotten the blue or amber ones to protect my essential oils, but I use them up so fast that it&#x27;s probably OK.  </li>
            <li> and it was okay for about a week, then the oil started dripping down the edges of the bottle when I tried to roll it</li>
            <li> , you have to be sure the plastic roller is all the way on the glass tube opening, and tight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommeded.</li>
            <li> Other than that the balls do roll around my essential oils nicely.</li>
            <li> so I can easily tell one scent from the other just by looking at the bottle.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the ball in the top attachment fell out.</li>
            <li> I have reordered a few times :)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and the seller was more than accommodating when an item was missing from an order.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say anything negative about them.</li>
            <li> Balls roll well, nice thick glass.</li>
            <li> Personally, i put essential oil in them for an easy application any time i need it.</li>
            <li> also use these for making my own little perfumes using essential oils.</li>
            <li> so when I bought new perfume I looked for roll-on bottles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging was adequate and the bottles arrived intact with 2 plastic squeeze droppers (5ml)with very long stems that were about 6 inches (estimate)</li>
            <li> Having one smooth and one textured helps me quickly visually recognize two different fragrances.</li>
            <li> I WILL say that in the picture the bottles look the same size, but when I received them the swirly bottle was slightly bigger than the smooth bottle.</li>
            <li> Winter means super dry, chapped lips.</li>
            <li> This exactly what I need it for my peppermint essential oil and my blending of analgesic oils too.</li>
            <li> I put drops of coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil and avocado oil in the bottle and it works pretty well in the application of these on my lips</li>
            <li> Both of these bottles work pretty well for our essential oil application.</li>
            <li> They were easy to fill, not too messy, and the caps fit right back on with a firm push.  </li>
            <li> The black lids don&#x27;t fit on the bottles, completely unusable!</li>
            <li> Nice and small for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> They snapped together fairly easily, but then I don&#x27;t know how difficult it&#x27;ll be to pull the top back off when it&#x27;s time to change out the contents.</li>
            <li> but I wish they weren&#x27;t clear.  </li>
            <li> I tested these with water and placed them in a clear ziplock bag before I added my perfume.  </li>
            <li> Fits well in your purse and so far no leaking.</li>
            <li> should think that if you want to carry it in a purse, to wrap it in a soft cloth and place it upright in a pocket, just to be on the safest side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really did get a larger volume of oil all over the place!</li>
            <li> We ended up just spraying from the manufacturer&#x27;s bottle directly into this bottle.</li>
            <li> You can only really use perfumes that don&#x27;t have a permanently attached pump anyway</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s a rollerball, you&#x27;re likely to get a lot more perfume dispensed than maybe you want, especially if the bottle is stored upside down.</li>
            <li> Then the little ball, just fell right out!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I wil be able to open up the bottle again to refill.</li>
            <li> Unless it&#x27;s possible for you to keep it standing upright in your bag throughout the day, I&#x27;d highly advise against buying this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make a mess free essential oil perfume and needed something to keep it in.</li>
            <li> The roller ball lids stay on nice and tight, but I can get them off when I need to without any trouble.  </li>
            <li> I used a hammer - gently - to get the roller part fully on top.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the little inverted circle on the inside top of the black cap will, when screwed on firmly, prevent the ball from leaking fluid into the cap, and then whatever the glass container is in should stay safe and dry from &amp;</li>
            <li> I received two extra large samples of perfume, but only in a bottle with no spray or roller.  </li>
            <li> I am able to take my expensive perfumes without having the large bottles with me.</li>
            <li> The rollerballs range from somewhat hard to roll to easier, but none are as easy as the ones that come with perfume rollerballs.</li>
            <li> Aside from the chip that&#x27;s on one, albeit a small one that&#x27;s not such a big deal that I&#x27;m willing to deal with the exchange process, these are quite cool.</li>
            <li> Took a little longer than I hoped for them to arrive, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Not a single drop leaked!!</li>
            <li> Generally o.k.  </li>
            <li> I had a leaky bottle of VS perfume that I couldn&#x27;t bare to part with.</li>
            <li> I use them to mix my Young Living essential oils</li>
            <li> I had a broken nozzle on an old perfume bottle so that pretty much prevented me from using the perfume within it for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Disappointing as the quality of one I received was great, but apparently they are not consistent.</li>
            <li> I was worried that they&#x27;d let out too much product and drip all over the place (it&#x27;s happened with other roll-ons), but these definitely don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Easy to use And Quality solid thick glass!</li>
            <li> Nice and small, but not too small!</li>
            <li> I really like these little bottles.</li>
            <li> After running them under hot water for a several seconds they went into place with a hard push.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get the roller cap on, not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to get it off once I have to refill it.</li>
            <li> I have an under the eye serum that I was tired of using my fingers to rub under my eyes, and these little rollers apply it perfectly without wasting any of my expensive serum on my hands.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to whether they leak or not as I don&#x27;t carry them in my purse, but my general impression is that they seem tightly closed and the screw-on cap gives you additional protection.  </li>
            <li> it was a good idea, but it leaks :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that they took a while to come, almost two weeks, but I don&#x27;t really care</li>
            <li> The caps don&#x27;t fit the bottle and make it extremely difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> It came a little later than the estimated time but only by a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one other type of roller ball bottle prior to this</li>
            <li> At first it was hard to get the plastic pressed down all the way.</li>
            <li> The roller ball stays almost dry.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I was not happy about was at least two of the 12 or so bottles, the lids did not go on easily.</li>
            <li> But with these, I finally wore that perfume again after gently distributing it from the broken nozzle bottle into these roll-on ones.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t loose potency.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> cap screws on tight enough to prevent leaks, but</li>
            <li> I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> so be careful where u store them</li>
            <li> Just as expected, roller balls work like a charm.</li>
            <li> The bottles came carefully shipped, no damages.</li>
            <li> it prevents slipping.  </li>
            <li> These are empty glass bottles to fill your perfume.</li>
            <li> The fact that they are different styles will help me differentiate which is which (plain for peppermint oil for headaches, swirl with eucalyptus for allergies...).  </li>
            <li> I had to drag my fingernail across it to reveal the other side with the oil.</li>
            <li> I use one for perfume and the other for my Rx antiperspirant, which is a liquid.  </li>
            <li> As other users have said, it dispenses quite a bit of liquid, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> I had no issues with setting the roller ball in the the bottle,  an issue I have had with other bottles.</li>
            <li> I leave one at home on my dresser and take the other in my purse.</li>
            <li> I just keep this one on my dresser and take the other ones in my purse now.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well when rolling on oils, you don&#x27;t want to running all over your body.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these to decant some of my other perfumes into for ease of transport for my purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other atomizers and roller ball bottles</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now I can travel with my homemade lip conditioner -- a mix of oils that would be a mess to travel with using anything other than this type of container.</li>
            <li> I received an expensive perfume from a friend and the spray portion broke, so I couldn&#x27;t really use it.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leak even when side ways or upside down in my purse.</li>
            <li> These do leak quite a bit if they&#x27;re sideways or upside down for a while.</li>
            <li> Extremely well priced!</li>
            <li> Just little annoying and unsanitary, plus can make you lose all of your precious liquids.</li>
            <li> Waste of good or even horrible</li>
            <li> So I started using one without the black cap secured</li>
            <li> They feel like they are stripping the threads and will not screw down tightly.  </li>
            <li> The rolling part is made of plastic and the part that holds the ball holds it too tight</li>
            <li> No issue with spilling and the tops stay on tight.</li>
            <li> just a little bit tight when pushing the head into the mouth of bottle</li>
            <li> My little ball came out and had oil all over my purse.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit hesistant in ordering this product as some reviews said it tends to spill its contents and</li>
            <li> was disappointed that one of the roller&#x27;s balls came out when my husband was applying essential oil for back pain to my back.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> waste your 2 cents</li>
            <li> after a few days they break if you carry them in your jeans..</li>
            <li> I received within a matter of a few days.</li>
            <li> The Avon bottle never leaked (had it for quite few years)</li>
            <li> What a waste.  </li>
            <li> Been used a few months for about 40 uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only complaint, which is not related to the product itself, is that pouring perfume into the bottle can be difficult because commercial perfume bottles are VERY difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I like the designs (plain and swirled)</li>
            <li> A little hard to snap in place,</li>
            <li> I received these in the mail today and was not pleased immediately.</li>
            <li> I then decanted a very expensive oil into the second one, and it ended up leaking out and wasting my oil as well as making a mess in my bag.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer about the roller being hard to remove.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to press that hard to get the product out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the roller ball has a hard time rolling, when that happens I use my finger to move it</li>
            <li> I was a little annoyed that the dropper the product promised wasn&#x27;t sent with the bottles, but whatever.</li>
            <li> I had an oily perfume that its not in spray, I already had one bottle like this one that I got from Avon (with Avon perfume) few years ago and tough</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small bottles, and the roll-on heads are compression fittings.. not ideal for heavy reuse..</li>
            <li> so I could not use it for thick perfumes or oud to keep it in my handbag</li>
            <li> They seem well made and the glass is thick.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made of a thick glass to prevent breaking.</li>
            <li> These would be difficult to fill w/o a little funnel, so I suggest picking one up.</li>
            <li> Bottles are no good for carrying with you in your bag or purse because they leak.</li>
            <li> Wasted a lot of really expensive cologne.</li>
            <li> However, the cap is quite difficult to remove as it is very tight.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say!</li>
            <li> They were inexpensive so only slightly disappointed in the bottles.</li>
            <li> they are very hard to close.</li>
            <li> Put oil in it and is very slowly leaks</li>
            <li> Very annoying and a waste of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Poorly made product.</li>
            <li> I was tired of leaky perfume bottles in my travel gear and decided to give these a shot.</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;ll break the bottles if you try to screw off the pump mechanism, which is especially not worth it if your perfume is expensive), which means you can just pour them into the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy with these bottles the cap don&#x27;t turn onto the bottles</li>
            <li> at least they weren&#x27;t very expensive, but I didn&#x27;t think they were &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; either.  </li>
            <li> They must have sent me the completely wrong lids for these bottles.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this leaked all over the inside of my purse which led to me needing to replace the purse.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Both bottles leaked my expensive perfume all in my purse, i had the ball in correctly,i threw them away.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to get the plastic ball roller on, but it is holding my perfume</li>
            <li> However, the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; piece is very difficult to push on.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle on a very expensive bottle of perfume got clogged, so I was looking for an atomizer to place the remaining perfume in before I spotted this.  </li>
            <li> It could have been a bad batch but unimpressed regardless.</li>
            <li> but they still leak, bad.</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a bad batch, neither bottle allows me to screw the cap on with the roll-on insertion inserted.  </li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this....  </li>
            <li> It took so much grief to get that off.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Both bottles leak terribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered these before and they were fine. However, I ordered some more and this set had both roller balls fall out, causing the contents to spill all over the user. I contacted seller but never heard back. It could have been a bad batch but unimpressed regardless.</li>
            <li> Got to me quickly and in great shape! Came with a dropper which was awesome as I was worried about transferring my perfume to them.</li>
            <li> They work great for applying oils</li>
            <li> Met or exceeded my expectation, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I needed it for my mother in law that has arthritis in her hands, and can&#x27;t use a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> These pretty little glass bottles are perfect. Just the right size for the purse and are I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> They leak when the temperature changes. Very annoying and a waste of essential oils. I&#x27;ve added FCO to thicken my blends but they still leak, bad.</li>
            <li> Great bottles. Great price. Total plus</li>
            <li> I have two sets now, and they are AMAZING!!!  I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.  The roller ball is plastic and comes off easily for quick and effortless refilling.  Each bottle measures about 3 1/4\\&quot; tall with the cap on.  The shipping took a while, but they are worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Generally o.k.  However, the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; piece is very difficult to push on.  After a few months, the ball in the top attachment fell out.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. My little ball came out and had oil all over my purse.</li>
            <li> Not for essential oils. The ball drops out of it and it leaks a bit. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I use these for my essential oils and they work great!</li>
            <li> The swirl bottles are beautiful!</li>
            <li> One of the lids was cracked when I received it so it didn&#x27;t screw on and close properly. Also, the roller ball didn&#x27;t move smoothly. I had to drag my fingernail across it to reveal the other side with the oil. Would not buy again, threw them both away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like the description. It&#x27;s very nice! It holds things well and nothing leaks.. I really like it! -Vicki</li>
            <li> I wanted to make a mess free essential oil perfume and needed something to keep it in. These little bottles worked perfectly and never leak! You will need pliers to take the cap off for filling but its not difficult and pops back on easily.</li>
            <li> It rolls great I can use it anywhere quickly! I poured deep blue oil &amp; added vitamin e oil to creat a massage oil</li>
            <li> Awesome! I use it for essential oil applications</li>
            <li> The roll-on perfume bottles are exactly what you see in the pictures.  I have not used them yet, but I know they will work just fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a pouch. Just fill and use.</li>
            <li> My husband is allergic to the sprays I spray on in the bathroom.  The roll on doesn&#x27;t bother him at all.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my cologne, so I can apply it more selectively. Each time I left it on its side in a drawer, I would come back and find the level lower and lower, and I would open the cap, and a bunch would come out. I think the removable roller ball does not seat well enough.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the even smaller size, and those don&#x27;t seem to have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this out before I packed them in my purse.  Waste of good or even horrible money.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your 2 cents</li>
            <li> I purchased these to give my cat water on an airplane. The plastic rollers didn&#x27;t work well with water though so it didn&#x27;t work for my intended use.  I&#x27;m sure it would work fine with perfume or oils though. I did find a pet water bottle with a metal roller and that works fine on an airplane.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel perfume and also for my essential oils that I use to roll on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> Very nice little roller bottles.  Great size for my essential oils plus the added carrier oil.</li>
            <li> perfect for mixing oils</li>
            <li> These are great, especially for the price!  I bought these to store coconut oil, since I use it as a moisturizer, but it isn&#x27;t convenient for travel.  These bottles have never leaked.  It didn&#x27;t come with the dropper, as described, which is why I only gave them 4 stars.  Otherwise, these are perfect for what I needed and I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> The rollers won&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> Actually I thought it smaller but its tall so I could not use it for thick perfumes or oud to keep it in my handbag</li>
            <li> I really like these little bottles. SO great for making your own oil-based perfume or lip gloss! Extremely well priced! Also, bottles are made of glass and are bigger than they look on pictures. I absolutely love these and would recommend to anyone who makes their own cosmetic products. The roll on works very well.</li>
            <li> Bottles are no good for carrying with you in your bag or purse because they leak. Kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this package of 2 and used one right away, that one was fine and worked great. I then decanted a very expensive oil into the second one, and it ended up leaking out and wasting my oil as well as making a mess in my bag. Disappointing as the quality of one I received was great, but apparently they are not consistent.</li>
            <li> These little bottles are great. Put essential oil in them. They&#x27;re compact enough to take anywhere. Read some reviews about how they leak. Haven&#x27;t had a problem because I tend to keep them upright as much as possible. I agree with another reviewer about the roller being hard to remove. Once you put it on, it&#x27;s pretty much stuck. I suppose they are &amp;#34;refillable&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a bit more work than one would imagine. Glad I got a pack of (2). Overall... happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pretty.</li>
            <li> Quite possible one of my smartest purchases. I had a leaky bottle of VS perfume that I couldn&#x27;t bare to part with. These came in handy. Solid- no leaks. Easy to use And Quality solid thick glass!</li>
            <li> Having one smooth and one textured helps me quickly visually recognize two different fragrances. Aside from the chip that&#x27;s on one, albeit a small one that&#x27;s not such a big deal that I&#x27;m willing to deal with the exchange process, these are quite cool. They snapped together fairly easily, but then I don&#x27;t know how difficult it&#x27;ll be to pull the top back off when it&#x27;s time to change out the contents. I like to put leftover perfume or perfume samples into these so that they&#x27;re easier to apply and certainly better for travel. Of course, if traveling and moving about, I&#x27;d be a bit concerned with the glass breaking, especially considering one of my arrived already chipped.</li>
            <li> after a few days they break if you carry them in your jeans.. otherwise i guess they last. so be careful where u store them</li>
            <li> I brewed up an essential oil blend and use these to apply.  So nice to have something that can  be reused.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Ordered several of the roller bottles. One performed as it should and the second one did not. The roller ball fell out, and continues to fall out, every time it is used.</li>
            <li> Roller ball kept falling out</li>
            <li> This size is perfect for everyday use. Fits well in your purse and so far no leaking. Very easy to refill.</li>
            <li> These are great little bottles, and I&#x27;m actually back to buy 2 more.  I use one for perfume and the other for my Rx antiperspirant, which is a liquid.  The rollers work great, and they are quite easy to pop off the lids to refill.</li>
            <li> I bought these for some sample size perfumes that I have and they&#x27;re perfect. I was worried that they&#x27;d let out too much product and drip all over the place (it&#x27;s happened with other roll-ons), but these definitely don&#x27;t do that. I was even able to peel off the label from the original bottle and put it on the roller. Obviously this works better with the smooth bottle, but the label on the swirly bottle is staying put so far. Great to throw in your purse for refreshers throughout the day. They&#x27;re also easy to clean when changing scents, all you need is a little rubbing alcohol. I WILL say that in the picture the bottles look the same size, but when I received them the swirly bottle was slightly bigger than the smooth bottle.</li>
            <li> These bottles are perfect for traveling or carrying around in my purse. I&#x27;ve been using them extensively and they haven&#x27;t leaked.</li>
            <li> I am using these for essential oils and I&#x27;ve had a problem with them leaking if they get tossed around (like in my purse!)  I&#x27;ve tried different ways of closing the roller ball and nothing has worked yet.</li>
            <li> These are Absolutely Perfect for perfume to travel with &amp; I use them for my roll on cosmetic lines...thin serums or liquids.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to put my essential oils in for work. Great price and super fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Put oil in it and is very slowly leaks so I have to keep it upright. Other than that its great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get witch hazel to dispense.  The roller ball stays almost dry.  Maybe they work ok with oils, but they don&#x27;t work for my intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Love these roll on bottles! I use them to mix my Young Living essential oils so I can take them in my purse. They do not leak and are easy to refill. Great quality and loved the price for two of them. The swirl design on one of them is so pretty as well!</li>
            <li> So I only have one thing to say to those people who think this leaks.&lt;br /&gt;First, you have to be sure the plastic roller is all the way on the glass tube opening, and tight. I used a hammer - gently - to get the roller part fully on top.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the little inverted circle on the inside top of the black cap will, when screwed on firmly, prevent the ball from leaking fluid into the cap, and then whatever the glass container is in should stay safe and dry from &amp;#34;accidents&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I should think that if you want to carry it in a purse, to wrap it in a soft cloth and place it upright in a pocket, just to be on the safest side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not rocket science, but more like elementary school science or engineering 101. Most things this basic are pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> Used this for my homemade eye cream but had to constantly shake the bottle and roll the roller to apply.  Tried a thinner cream but still same problem.</li>
            <li> Just like the description says, there are two roll-top bottles. Make sure you are careful when ready to screw in the plastic &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34; top, it can be a little tricky to screw on. This is a perfect way to use cologne and the perfect bottle to do so. I am very pleased that there is an outlet for them.</li>
            <li> The black lids don&#x27;t fit on the bottles, completely unusable! They must have sent me the completely wrong lids for these bottles. I&#x27;ve submitted a replacement. I&#x27;ll update the customer service experience when it happens.</li>
            <li> Standard shipping took a while but they made up for the slowness by including pipettes with the bottles, one for each bottle. It was hard to get the roller cap on, not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to get it off once I have to refill it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making &amp; carrying your own perfume blends with essential oils. Love that you get two different styles to be able to tell them apart.</li>
            <li> I use these to store essential oils in and take them in my purse when I leave the house. Absolutely perfect and they are a nice size!</li>
            <li> I found these very useful and easy to use. I made my own mint &amp; lavender oil (for headaches) and these little bottles were exactly what I was looking for. Took a little longer than I hoped for them to arrive, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> product is as described. there were no breaks or cracks in the product when it arrived. it holds the oils and rolls smoothly.</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a bad batch, neither bottle allows me to screw the cap on with the roll-on insertion inserted.  So I started using one without the black cap secured and it was okay for about a week, then the oil started dripping down the edges of the bottle when I tried to roll it on--- still I tried to keep using it, as the reason I wanted a roll-on was that I did want to use a larger volume of oil at each application (rather than tiny drips).  Then the little ball, just fell right out!  ….and I really did get a larger volume of oil all over the place! …lol…. at least they weren&#x27;t very expensive, but I didn&#x27;t think they were &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; either.  I haven&#x27;t tried to return them yet, but will.</li>
            <li> These work very well.  The roller ball lids stay on nice and tight, but I can get them off when I need to without any trouble.  I use them for  own stress relief essential oils.</li>
            <li> Very useful stuff. This exactly what I need it for my peppermint essential oil and my blending of analgesic oils too.</li>
            <li> This product is very good and serves its purpose. I was a little bit hesistant in ordering this product as some reviews said it tends to spill its contents and I intended carrying it around in my pocket. I have not had any problem with spillage. I  use this for the application of my home made lip gloss. I put drops of coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil and avocado oil in the bottle and it works pretty well in the application of these on my lips (I still have to research/figure out the best home made lip gloss recipe as my combination of oils tend to dry up quickly on the lips). I carry it around in my pocket and have not had any issues with it spilling and staining my clothes. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> The rolling part is made of plastic and the part that holds the ball holds it too tight so the ball doesn&#x27;t even roll. I had to pry something between that part and the ball to stretch out the plastic but I don&#x27;t want to do that since it is plastic and probably has BPA since it does not specify being BPA free. Still I don&#x27;t want micro bits of plastic getting into my products if I am going to use it for my face and I don&#x27;t want to hold perfume in it since I have to pry the ball free enough which will let perfume evaporate.</li>
            <li> Both bottles leak terribly. Wasted a lot of really expensive cologne.</li>
            <li> Came with a dropper! So Excited. As Described. Works well. I currently have a essential oil blend in one of them. Perfect</li>
            <li> Ordered this before I knew most essential oils need to be protected from sun/light exposure.  Recommend colored rollers.</li>
            <li> These are supposed to help make perfume more portable and easy to use. However, both of them leak profusely when not standing upright and the perfume leaked out and ruined my belongings. Do not buy these.</li>
            <li> The caps don&#x27;t fit the bottle and make it extremely difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> I received two extra large samples of perfume, but only in a bottle with no spray or roller.  Ugh.  These things are great.  A little hard to snap in place, but that&#x27;s a good thing I think because I know they&#x27;re not opening up for anything.  I ordered more to have on hand for next time.</li>
            <li> The ball falls out of the roller, and they leak.  I was not very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought these to hold essential oil and was happy with them. They didn&#x27;t leak and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, roller balls work like a charm.</li>
            <li> I bought these before I really explored the competitors. These are way too much. But they have worked well for me.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for my use.  Very good!</li>
            <li> The only thing I was not happy about was at least two of the 12 or so bottles, the lids did not go on easily.</li>
            <li> These work good but I wish they weren&#x27;t clear.  Need filtered glass for my essential oils so they don&#x27;t loose potency.</li>
            <li> Both of these bottles work pretty well for our essential oil application. Rollers seem to distribute the oils fairly well.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am impressed with the fast shipping. I received within a matter of a few days. The actual product works perfectly. They do not leak when carrying them around and they are stylish. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and tiny! It works fine. It came a little later than the estimated time but only by a day so I can&#x27;t really complain. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that I can&#x27;t seem to fit the roller on one of the bottles. For one bottle it fit fine but the second one wouldn&#x27;t connect all the way.</li>
            <li> The bottles are great, but the rollers are too tight and do not roll the oils out.  I am very unhappy with this....  I would like to see if they are willing to ship new roller caps for these bottles.....</li>
            <li> Just got these yesterday. They seem well made and the glass is thick.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> Cap does not fit bottles, therefore they aren&#x27;t really transportable.</li>
            <li> I filled one bottle with perfume, and so far, it seems to do the job wonderfully. As other users have said, it dispenses quite a bit of liquid, but it works for me. Overall, I am very happy with my $3 purchase.</li>
            <li> Great roll-on bottles. They are very skinny, but do the trick. If you are blending oils, make sure you either know chemistry or have a recipe from someone who does, or you will have a severe allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I looked at a million different refillable roller ball perfume containers but decided on these. Unlike many of the other reviews, mine did not arrive chipped and the roller ball was very easy to pop in and out. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> These work really well for applying essential oil mixes (diluted heavily with E oil).  Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Lemon balm, etc.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these bottles. One of the bottles was chipped upon arrival and the seller was quick to offer two acceptable options for me! I will be buying more from this seller when the need arises!</li>
            <li> I loved these for blending my essential oils. They work great and even after dropping several times on tile they didnt break. Great value and quality for my needs!</li>
            <li> The ball fell out after three uses and won&#x27;t stay in place. Poorly made product.</li>
            <li> Cheap. Don&#x27;t leak. Easy to fill.&lt;br /&gt;I have a perfume that doesn&#x27;t last. I figured applying it more directly with a roller as opposed to walking through a spray would help. It does a bit. The roller itself is great. It hasn&#x27;t leaked in my purse, It&#x27;s easy to fill once you get it open. The two styles help distinguish between different scents. Awesome price. Super value.</li>
            <li> Used these with a carrier oil and an essential oil to put onto my skin when needed. Both work great and have no issues with refilling or using them.</li>
            <li> They are very nice, but I recived one of them broken.&lt;br /&gt;They are very practical an have a nice shape.</li>
            <li> Worked great and easy to fill.  Didn&#x27;t leak even when side ways or upside down in my purse.</li>
            <li> Great roll on bottles to add perfume, essential oils, or any other liquids. I was really happy with the product. The bottles came carefully shipped, no damages. It is a good size for a roll on bottle. Works perfectly for my essential oil mixtures. You first have to roll the top a bit in order to make it work but it worked great no spillage of any kind. The look of the bottle is exactly like the pictures. I loved that one came in a swirly kinda look.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife to allow her to bring perfume when we are traveling. The bottle is sturdy and appears to be of excellent quality. Perfect size for travel. Roller ball works well. The only complaint, which is not related to the product itself, is that pouring perfume into the bottle can be difficult because commercial perfume bottles are VERY difficult to open. We ended up just spraying from the manufacturer&#x27;s bottle directly into this bottle.</li>
            <li> I can not beleive how perfect these were for my purpose and the price was unbelievably low - I plan on ordering a couple more - they were the perfect size and so easy to use -</li>
            <li> Perfect for blending oils for the road. Roller balls came in a separate bag - nice!</li>
            <li> These are great bottles to mix oils to make a personalized perfume.  The roller ball makes it easy to apply.  They come in a solid glass one, and a swirl pattern.  The roller is not attached until you make the perfume.  These took a while to ship, but it is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I bought these to keep oils in as I use the oil cleansing method for washing my face.  They work well and don&#x27;t dispense too much at a time.</li>
            <li> great containers.  Just what I was looking for with mixing my own oils.</li>
            <li> I love mixing my essential oils in these roll ons and have it with me on the go. Also it has not leaked yet! They are pretty and of good quality.</li>
            <li> So far, so good with these bottles. I&#x27;ve used paper and tape to label their contents (on bottle for smooth ones, on cap for swirl bottles) and they serve my needs. I wanted rollerballs for my Demeter perfume tester bottles. The rollerballs range from somewhat hard to roll to easier, but none are as easy as the ones that come with perfume rollerballs. It&#x27;s okay, though, as they do the job and I don&#x27;t have to press that hard to get the product out.</li>
            <li> I use these with essential oils mixed in vodka to make my own perfumes. Perfect little portable containers. I can drop it in my purse and it doesn&#x27;t leak. Great price.</li>
            <li> I have one of these at home and one at work.  They work great for applying perfume where I want it.  I use them instead of the original bottle&#x27;s spray, as I can use less while applying more economically over larger areas.  I can&#x27;t speak to whether they leak or not as I don&#x27;t carry them in my purse, but my general impression is that they seem tightly closed and the screw-on cap gives you additional protection.  For how I use them, they work great.</li>
            <li> I use a roll on bottle when applying my pre-shave oil.  There is no waste and my hands stay oil free.  Problem solved!</li>
            <li> This product is very nice quality, works well and the price you can not beat!!!! We keep liquids in them and they are very&lt;br /&gt;handy on trip as well, thanks a million!!!!</li>
            <li> Love these bottles! I use them to put essential oils in and they work great! Good price and good product. I have reordered a few times :)</li>
            <li> They leak like a sieve, unusable.</li>
            <li> Came  on time. Easy to fill and use. great product.</li>
            <li> These are PERFECT for mixing aroma therapy oils!</li>
            <li> Perfect for rolling on perfume in a controlled manner! It doesn&#x27;t leak like most other roll-on bottles either. However, the cap is quite difficult to remove as it is very tight. Guess that&#x27;s what you get if you want it to not leak...</li>
            <li> Items were as advertised and they are very useful items for carrying cologne perfume during travel,  Great gift for the frequent traveler.</li>
            <li> I had a broken nozzle on an old perfume bottle so that pretty much prevented me from using the perfume within it for quite some time. But with these, I finally wore that perfume again after gently distributing it from the broken nozzle bottle into these roll-on ones. Even though it is not oil based, I never had a problem with leaking.</li>
            <li> Last year I decided to decrease my toxin exposure by making my own cleaning, beauty, and self care supplies with natural ingredients.  These bottles are great for my homemade deodorant and are the perfect size for carrying around in my purse for when I need to ehem...reapply.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with leaking or getting the top off.  The different designs are great for differentiating between different scents!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY happy with these little roller bottles.  I was tired of leaky perfume bottles in my travel gear and decided to give these a shot. Perfect for taking perfume on a plane and not having to worry about leaking your costly fragrances.  I&#x27;ve ever carried one in my purse for touch ups with no leaking issues!  Highly recommend and wish I would have thought of it sooner :)</li>
            <li> Sadly, this leaked all over the inside of my purse which led to me needing to replace the purse. It&#x27;s a crapshoot with such inexpensive items, and this bet did not pay off.</li>
            <li> I bought these little rollers to fill with castor oil to easily apply as lip treatment and it does the job just fine. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great for tucking into my gym bag.  These would be difficult to fill w/o a little funnel, so I suggest picking one up.</li>
            <li> Love that I can take my own essential oils and use them with ease now. The roll on is perfect for purse or travel. Love that there is one of each.</li>
            <li> I really like these, they&#x27;re very elegant and durable. It&#x27;s easy to pop the ball in and out for cleaning and/or refilling. Now I can travel with my homemade lip conditioner -- a mix of oils that would be a mess to travel with using anything other than this type of container.</li>
            <li> The nozzle on a very expensive bottle of perfume got clogged, so I was looking for an atomizer to place the remaining perfume in before I spotted this.  This was a great price, plus its portable and I can carry it in my purse. It&#x27;s perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Well, I&#x27;m updating my review to advise you that the roller balls leak.  I didn&#x27;t realize it until one day I went to apply some parfum and it had all leaked out at the bottom of my purse.  Uh....</li>
            <li> So instead of spending a jillion dollars to buy the Clarins facial oil, I went online and found a group of people just making their own. I use jojoba oil, couple drops of peppermint essential oil, some vitamin e oil, a drop of tea tree oil, and dissolve a tablet of coenzyme Q10 into it. Shake. Now I have a super portable, delicious smelling bottle of custom facial oil. It&#x27;s been really great for my face and dissolves easily into my skin. I have very dry skin and this keeps me hydrated all day. I love the oil in a roller because I can&#x27;t spill it all over the place!</li>
            <li> these are perfect for personal perfumes, and oils. I&#x27;ve had no problems with any leakage either. perfect</li>
            <li> These items arrived quickly, and were in good condition.  I had no issues with setting the roller ball in the the bottle,  an issue I have had with other bottles.</li>
            <li> It leaks very easily. Unless it&#x27;s possible for you to keep it standing upright in your bag throughout the day, I&#x27;d highly advise against buying this product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small bottles, and the roll-on heads are compression fittings.. not ideal for heavy reuse.. but.. they do what I need them to.  Nothing special... just two tiny bottles</li>
            <li> I was looking to make some aromatherapy treatment for headaches and needed just these types of bottles.  The fact that they are different styles will help me differentiate which is which (plain for peppermint oil for headaches, swirl with eucalyptus for allergies...).  You can&#x27;t beat the price and the seller was more than accommodating when an item was missing from an order.  I would definitely do business with them again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for spray perfume bottles so when I bought new perfume I looked for roll-on bottles. These are the perfect size. I leave one at home on my dresser and take the other in my purse. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bottles leaking and they dispense just the right amount of perfume. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I filled these bottles with my spray perfume because the spray bottle I had was broken. I will forever use these roll on refillable perfumes bottles. It is so easy, and lets you roll on your favorite perfumes with out overpowering your clothing with your favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I carry one of these in my makeup bag. I was a little annoyed that the dropper the product promised wasn&#x27;t sent with the bottles, but whatever. You can only really use perfumes that don&#x27;t have a permanently attached pump anyway (you&#x27;ll break the bottles if you try to screw off the pump mechanism, which is especially not worth it if your perfume is expensive), which means you can just pour them into the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap screws on tight enough to prevent leaks, but because it&#x27;s a rollerball, you&#x27;re likely to get a lot more perfume dispensed than maybe you want, especially if the bottle is stored upside down.</li>
            <li> Winter means super dry, chapped lips. My solution? Fill these things up with olive oil to keep them from getting chapped! These are perfect, easy to fill, and they look pretty cool, too.</li>
            <li> The refillable glass bottle were perfect for using with my essential oils and the fractionated coconut oils.  I was grateful for the suggested combination below the fractionated coconut oil that I bought!</li>
            <li> Work well for putting on perfume but if you&#x27;re using these to take perfume with you on a vacation, in a purse, or anything along those lines, look elsewhere. These do leak quite a bit if they&#x27;re sideways or upside down for a while.</li>
            <li> So far I have had great results with this Roll-on refillable glass perfume bottle.  I bought these to put my doTerra Fractionated Coconut Oil in.  I have had no leaks whatsoever,  Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought to mix my own blend of essential oils so can keep in my purse when the dreaded migraine or tension headache starts. Perfect! No spills or leaks.</li>
            <li> I received an expensive perfume from a friend and the spray portion broke, so I couldn&#x27;t really use it.  I bought these and now I have it as a roll on.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Bottles were very clean with no residual odors and very well packages.</li>
            <li> Both arrived perfectly fine, the shipping was okay, and they work so nicely!&lt;br /&gt;I carry my oil perfumes on them and I love them!&lt;br /&gt;would totally buy these again!</li>
            <li> These rollers are great for a number of different things - depends on what your needs are! Personally, i put essential oil in them for an easy application any time i need it. Great buy!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these. She isn&#x27;t allowed to spray perfume at school so she uses the roll on bottle when she needs a scent touch up.</li>
            <li> Great price and work well.</li>
            <li> I make my own perfume using essential oils, Jojoba Oil, etc.  These roll on, refillable bottles are great, especially when using essential oils.  I highly recommend these.  They are very reasonable and work very well - no waste of product when using the roll-on bottles.</li>
            <li> I bought these so I could take my favorite scents with me when I travel. They&#x27;ve worked great! No issue with spilling and the tops stay on tight. I like the designs (plain and swirled) so I can easily tell one scent from the other just by looking at the bottle.</li>
            <li> Nice and small, but not too small! Great for throwing in my coin purse as I&#x27;m headed out.&lt;br /&gt;No leaks, no cracks, lids stay on nice and tight! Nothing negative to say! Shipper sent them fast and efficient. Very happy and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great bottles. Work very well.</li>
            <li> Thise little Roll On Atomozers are Great.  They fit in your purse or pocket and are Great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;They were Shipped quickly and I received them fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> A good size for mixing oils, but one of the bottles I received has a loose ball so it leaks! I didn&#x27;t know this until it leaked all over my leather utility belt. -.- I just keep this one on my dresser and take the other ones in my purse now.</li>
            <li> Great bottles.  I put essential oils in my bottles so I prefer the bottles with the ribbed surface...it prevents slipping.  I also have to ones that have a smooth surface...those are great as well.</li>
            <li> The quality of these bottles are great. They&#x27;re made of a thick glass to prevent breaking. I carry a pair in my purse -one for oils to moisturize my face and one for rubbing alcohol to santize my hands.</li>
            <li> This item leaks a little bit but for the price it is perfect. I use it for essential oils to roll them on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like that you an add your own perfume to these and carry them in your purse! what a great idea....they are pretty and they are an excellent price. Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> These bottles are nice to keep almond oil in to put on my lips. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them leaking like some people have. At first it was hard to get the plastic pressed down all the way. After running them under hot water for a several seconds they went into place with a hard push. When the plastic part needs taken off for cleaning I just use a spoon handle to pry it off. Sometimes the roller ball has a hard time rolling, when that happens I use my finger to move it and then it moves okay for a while. So far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought these to mix a perfume oil into a milder form because it was too strong.  They arrived in perfect condition and work as expected.  The roller ball is easy to remove initially and the bottle is easy to fill.  I haven&#x27;t tried to take the roller ball off yet, but it appears to be easy to pry back off in order to refill the bottle.  For the price, these were a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li> I had an oily perfume that its not in spray, I already had one bottle like this one that I got from Avon (with Avon perfume) few years ago and tough it was a good idea, but it leaks :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: The Avon bottle never leaked (had it for quite few years)</li>
            <li> I put my essential oils in these for an easy application. i also use them for perfumes. This way you can control the application and the spray doesn&#x27;t effect everyone.</li>
            <li> I was worried that these bottles wouldn&#x27;t be leak proof, but they definitely are. They are a bit bigger than i thought so that was a pleasant surprise</li>
            <li> I bought these roller bottles for my essential oil blends. They work great and the oils come out in just the right amount. I later ordered a bulk amount of roller bottles from another company and they were junk. I will be reordering these again.</li>
            <li> I could not figure out how to fill the bottles with perfume to take with me on a trip.</li>
            <li> Got these to put Essential Oils in.  Works extremely well when rolling on oils, you don&#x27;t want to running all over your body.  I found the rollers easy to remove and replace.  I would by these again if I needed more rollers.</li>
            <li> perfume forever leaking from the bottle even when ball is not pressed..top barely fits the bottle i want my money al money back.</li>
            <li> Love these, Amazon is awesome for having them at a great prize .</li>
            <li> I have been using these to decant some of my other perfumes into for ease of transport for my purse. The fact that once it&#x27;s in there, it&#x27;s spillproof is great!</li>
            <li> I gifted these to young ladies in my family. They were happy to have them and thought they were very cute and a good stocking stuffer idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to update after they tell me how well they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was adequate and the bottles arrived intact with 2 plastic squeeze droppers (5ml)with very long stems that were about 6 inches (estimate) long. Quality of bottles was good, glass was thick enough to feel sturdy and trust not too break easily if baggage or purse that was tossed about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again and probably will order a set for myself.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for stashing in my purse.  I filled them both with my favorite scents and was spared the expense of having to purchase a rollerball from the perfume companies (that can run upwards of $20 each).  They were easy to fill, not too messy, and the caps fit right back on with a firm push.  They work perfect and look cute on top of it all.  Well worth the money.  My only complaint would be that they took a while to come, almost two weeks, but I don&#x27;t really care so I&#x27;m not taking off a star for this.  In fact I am ordering several more.  I love them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted bottles like these. They are perfect for my handbags. I would order more for my family and friends.</li>
            <li> These are very good bottles but are not amber like I found out are best to be used with essential oils.</li>
            <li> These work great and are a good price.  Wish I would have gotten the blue or amber ones to protect my essential oils, but I use them up so fast that it&#x27;s probably OK.  I try not to leave them sitting in the sunlight.  I haven&#x27;t had one leak yet, but I try to keep them standing upright.  I paint the lids with different colors of nail polish so I can tell what it is: ex.  germ killer, breathe mix, relax mix for my son, etc.</li>
            <li> Cheap. Roller balls kept falling out</li>
            <li> Easy to fill and refill with no problems.  I put my oil perfumes in it and it works great.  Love that there are two different types of bottles so I can easily just grab the one I want without labeling and know which one I picked.</li>
            <li> Great.  I have looked all over for these as I make my own Patchouli perfume and the bottles I used were pretty beat up.  These with the removable roller make it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Compact and holds a good amount of oil for my use.  I would highly recommend this product.  Three more words required.  Here we go again!</li>
            <li> Got the bottles very quick and they are perfect!  Good size and came with 2 droppers to fill the bottle with if needed.</li>
            <li> some of them leaked out the oil with the roller in.</li>
            <li> quick shipment great product works as described will use again, try it will you!!</li>
            <li> I received these in the mail today and was not pleased immediately. The caps I received do not screw onto the bottles properly. There is no way I am going to put my perfume in these.</li>
            <li> Really happy with these items, I&#x27;m able to put my own scents in them easily, so far there is no leaking around the cap</li>
            <li> The roll-on refillable perfume bottles are perfect anytime, anywhere.  The right amount comes out so there is no waste.  The snug top prevents leakage.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for making some aromatherapy scents of my own. I wanted to have something without having to always use like a perfume or spray. So to have some scent with a carrier oil and just rub on for when you want to relax this is perfect</li>
            <li> Love these for MANY uses.  I fill them with oils, etc to apply to my face; works great for under-eye applications.  Great for perfume travel. They arrived in a timely manner, are economical, and good quality.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these bottles the cap don&#x27;t turn onto the bottles well at all they are very hard to close.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying these again. The rollerball fell out of both with no way to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> These bottles are easy to fill and fit tight with no leaks. I used them to hold home-made lip stain and they work great.</li>
            <li> Cheap, efficient - just what I needed. I love to carry perfume and re-apply with the roller bottle because if you have a mini-atomizer, spraying a mist into the air in a public space is sometimes more attention than I want. The roller bottles don&#x27;t leak and are easy to just touch up a scent mid-day!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for using my oils with these handy little bottles, until I went to put the lids on.  Did you even send me the correct lids???  These lids do not screw on correctly.  They feel like they are stripping the threads and will not screw down tightly.  Ya get what ya pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> I use these roll-on bottles for my various essential oil mixtures and these work nicely. The roller-ball top came off easily with a using a flat head screw driver to lift it off. Securing it back on after I filled the bottle was even easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with these and will buy them again if come up with anymore concoctions. :D</li>
            <li> Only good for low viscosity liquids. Does not work well for gels or anything thicker than water.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use for oils and they will leak out of the rolly all.</li>
            <li> OK product and does what intended, but on the straight tube, the ball keeps falling out. Just little annoying and unsanitary, plus can make you lose all of your precious liquids. Other than that the balls do roll around my essential oils nicely. Would not purchase this item again though unless it is a different and better made brand.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. The lids don&#x27;t fit right, so I can&#x27;t take them with me like I wanted to or they will leak.  What a waste.  &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> super cheap and does the job. I toss them in my purse with keys, a phone, wallet, makeup bag....tons of stuff and it never spills or cracks or anything. easy to fill up...disperses just a perfect amount of my favorite perfumes.  a must for when I forget to put perfume on at home.</li>
            <li> I mix my own fragrance oils and this makes it so easy to make small batches.  Also easy to pack in purse and carry on plane.</li>
            <li> Good quality, easy to refill and no leak though cap or major gap around the roller. Highly recommeded. Verstile item, can be use for a lot od different things aside for perfumes. lol. I guess you already knew that, didn&#x27;t ya?</li>
            <li> I am happy with these, except that I had to open them with my teeth. The part that secures the roller ball on is way too intense. It took so much grief to get that off. Balls roll well, nice thick glass. They&#x27;re too big for lip stuff though (to anyone wondering). Probably great for perfume!</li>
            <li> I ordered these to put an aromatherapy oil concoction that I made. I wanted to be able to bring it to the gym and apply before jumping in the steam room after working out. After a lot of research, I stumbled across these lovely travel bottles. I was very impressed with how secure the roller tops are on these and how tight the cap screws on. I was worried about the bottles leaking in my bag, so I tested these out by wrapping in a white paper towel and placing them in a plastic baggy, then throwing the bottles in my bag. Not a single drop leaked!! Shipping was also quick and I was VERY thankful that the seller threw in a couple of plastic droppers. Would highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Used for applying essential oils, they work great</li>
            <li> My two favorite fragrances aren&#x27;t available in a small bottle or purse size.  These nifty bottles are perfect to keep in my purse and gym locker. I just fill them with my favorite scents and now can  have them with me anytime. So glad I found these :)</li>
            <li> These worked perfectly for my trip and to just stick in my purse if I have a long day. would buy again.</li>
            <li> Both bottles leaked my expensive perfume all in my purse, i had the ball in correctly,i threw them away. Never again.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, really worthy, glass feels good and high qualitied. just a little bit tight when pushing the head into the mouth of bottle</li>
            <li> Been used a few months for about 40 uses.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that one of the roller&#x27;s balls came out when my husband was applying essential oil for back pain to my back. A whole bunch of the oil spilled out before he was able to turn it right-side-up. The glass and top are of good quality, but the top roller ball keeps falling out now. :-(</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the product seems to be holding up. I&#x27;ve used other atomizers and roller ball bottles but this one has no leaks, no spills.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for oils or homemade lip treatments or your favorite perfume. I have not had any problems with leakage in the 2 weeks since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Make your own scented oils and up them into these roll on bottles......use some fractionated coconut oil and essential oils.  Perfect for your purse!</li>
            <li> I bought these to make my own roll on essential oil blends. They seem to work just as they should.</li>
            <li> If you want to use this as a spare perfume in your desk at work this is great.  However if it&#x27;s in your purse and not standing straight up they will leak.  They were inexpensive so only slightly disappointed in the bottles.</li>
            <li> Nice and small for my essential oils. Took a while to deliver</li>
            <li> These are absolutely perfect for traveling with different perfumes. I don&#x27;t have to spend money buying separate travel sizes or worry about breaking my big bottle in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;I also use these for making my own little perfumes using essential oils. The price is unbeatable and they work perfectly. I&#x27;ve already bought these twice so I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I wil be able to open up the bottle again to refill. The fit is pretty snug.</li>
            <li> I have an under the eye serum that I was tired of using my fingers to rub under my eyes, and these little rollers apply it perfectly without wasting any of my expensive serum on my hands.</li>
            <li> Excellent item.  Just what I needed to carry my perfume in.</li>
            <li> I tested these with water and placed them in a clear ziplock bag before I added my perfume.  They did not leak.  Since then I placed perfume in one and put it in a ziplock bag for travel but have had no issues.  For the price this was a steal! I am able to take my expensive perfumes without having the large bottles with me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! I use essential oils &amp; was looking for a roll on bottle for oils that I have custom blended. These are perfect! I honestly can&#x27;t say anything negative about them. I&#x27;ve had one other type of roller ball bottle prior to this &amp; I feel these bottles are of better quality. Plus, these bottles were a much better price.</li>
            <li> Just a simple bottle that works. It comes with a plastic slim extractor to retrieve you fragrance from he original bottle</li>
            <li> I just sprayed my favorite perfume into one of the bottles and put on the roller ball and now I&#x27;m good to go for traveling.  Now I have a spare bottle for another fragrance or gift a bottle to my daughter.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my essential oils and very pretty, good quality glass bottles!</li>
            <li> I have PE and i have to use cologn and yea i like this and all but i would rather have the spray</li>
            <li> These are empty glass bottles to fill your perfume. This is perfect and came with two syringes. A bit difficult to get the plastic ball roller on, but it is holding my perfume well and it is super handy.</li>
