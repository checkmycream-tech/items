            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Bit smaller than the pictures on here but still perfect for my 9yr olds communion day.</li>
            <li>I wear my crown to remind everyone that women and girls deserve royal treatment, love, and respect.</li>
            <li>There are many more acts of kindness that my community has shown me.</li>

            <li>i love the style and how it look from many perspectives.</li>
            <li>The tiara was shipped and received fast great seller.</li>
            <li>gotta love amazon shipping!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then it was perfection. :-)</li>
            <li>Throughout the day more fell off.</li>
            <li>My daugher love this tiara.</li>
            <li>but I have seen many comments on how to fix this issue.</li>
            <li>Thank you. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this tiara.</li>
            <li>I can’t wait to be able to try it out for a very special occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is wonderful, it&#x27;s substantial enough that it won&#x27;t deform easily, and it&#x27;s got a lot of sparkle.</li>
            <li>Luckily I&#x27;m pretty good at making it work since I got it for my daughters birthday and didnt have time to return and get something else in time.</li>
            <li>This is wedding quality, very pretty, amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;-The Wife</li>
            <li>The man placed the bags in the trunk and went his way after I was safe and secure in my car.</li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t look like a cheap piece you&#x27;d get from a dollar store</li>
            <li>This one tied as favorite for beauty, fit, quality, and price.</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t going to easily break or bend.</li>
            <li>It could easily be used for kids pageants, for the prom queen, quincineara or debutante&#x27;s ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is elegant enough on its own, but will also be nice with a bridal veil.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>Hairpin work fine when securing the tiara to your hair.</li>
            <li>She is in absolute love with it!</li>
            <li>and we attached some elastic to keep it on her but believe it would stay on its own as it is really sturdy.</li>
            <li>You WILL need bobby pins to fit this in your hair.</li>
            <li>Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be bent to fit any size head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and didn&#x27;t bother me once it was on, but I didn&#x27;t forget about either.</li>
            <li>It needs to be bent into shape to fit someone&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>, it made me filled up with attraction</li>
            <li>This tiara is GORGEOUS - far exceeded our expectations.  </li>
            <li>This item is beautiful, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I selected this item to review thinking after reviewing I would give it to my niece, but after wearing it to a friend&#x27;s party and having so much fun wearing it, I think I will keep if for myself for a while!</li>
            <li>I had originally offered to review this thinking</li>
            <li>and she accidentally seen it and got so excited.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, has two small holes to quickly attach your veil if you go that way, and would make anyone look like a stunning princess on their wedding day.</li>
            <li>I am super excited about it, I just wasn&#x27;t expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thought it was a full tiara</li>
            <li>then her larg pageant size sweet sixteen crown.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1⃣ Full metal structure.</li>
            <li>My daughter wore this for her sweet sixteen party,  </li>
            <li>I actually wasn&#x27;t expecting something so good, because of the price.</li>
            <li>Very small details but perfect for she</li>
            <li>Got this package super quickly. ..</li>
            <li>With some gentle pressure, you can lightly shape it a bit tighter or a bit looser to fit your head.</li>
            <li>The initial appearance is nice and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>It was very pretty--</li>
            <li>She loves it very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, but no combs to hold it onto your head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so very pretty</li>
            <li>Product is made well and is very pretty</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>No, no princess complexes, they just like pretty things!</li>
            <li>The tiara is more of an adult size in my opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It says proms or weddings, but I wanted a tiara to wear for fun-</li>
            <li>and it was so much fun.</li>
            <li>The fun came in because I thought I was too grown up to want to play princess, but found out that it was still a lot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure-</li>
            <li>Although it was meant for my young daughter, many stones had already fallen out when it arrived.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of bling to make anyone feel like a queen.</li>
            <li>Very pretty but don&#x27;t really know how to keep it on her head.</li>
            <li>I tiara is very pretty and sparkly; it looks to be made very well.</li>
            <li>it came it very fast</li>
            <li>and they all ask my phone number, very useful and helpful, very grateful and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Pretty tiara.</li>
            <li>This model feels so real, with a sturdy metal construction and lots of shiny bling!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is quite pretty.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely lived it!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really not difficult to use a piece of elastic band.</li>
            <li>People were smiling, coming up to me and telling me it was a pretty tiara.</li>
            <li>so pretty used for a friends birthday party</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>I have purchased many tiaras for local agents and never had this problem before.</li>
            <li>It definitely works and doesn&#x27;t look cheap but takes work to make it functional!</li>
            <li>Easily obtainable from your local hobby shop, which is exactly where I&#x27;m going to get mine tomorrow!</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no good reason at all whatsoever to have a tiara except for the fact that I really honestly truly and completely believe that every woman, child, teenager should own a tiara.</li>
            <li>I love tiaras andvwhat woman young or old doesnt want to feel like royalty sometimes with this u</li>
            <li>wow very nice, heavy, circles on end for bobbypin etc.</li>
            <li>The crystals in it are so pretty and very sparkly.</li>
            <li>Much better than the usual plastic rubbish as metal and detailed.</li>
            <li>It has a little weight to it, which is nice-</li>
            <li>Very dissappointing</li>
            <li>Daughter loves it thinks she&#x27;s a real princess.</li>
            <li>Yes, absolutely.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Very well made, with weight to it.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my 9 year old daughter for play time fun.</li>
            <li>My wife put bobby pins at the very edge of the crown</li>
            <li>It is very sparkly and shinny.</li>
            <li>It is nice &amp; sparkly (as few stones fell out, but were in the bag).</li>
            <li>It is a nice heavy metal</li>
            <li>Great for a party or just feeling like a princess and sturdy enough to last a long time for reuse.</li>
            <li>Feels and looks high quality.</li>
            <li>This pretty little tiara is about 1/3 of a circle, and has loops on both ends that you can attach ribbons, elastic or hair pins to secure it into place-</li>
            <li>Very sparkly, but does not come with combs or complete headband</li>
            <li>Heavy (not plastic).&lt;br /&gt;2⃣ Jewels and stones can pop out (not noticeable because there are so many on the crown, but you may see some around on the ground).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely, was expecting a flimsy tiara for the price but quite heavy and not flimsy.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my granddaughter, who will be 4 right after Christmas, for a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the weight of this tiara.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was very surprised at the weight of it.</li>
            <li>It is very heavy and lovely.  </li>
            <li>my younger daughter wants one too</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality of the rhinestones for the price.  </li>
            <li>I could use it for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t flimsy light weight but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I knew from the pictures that this didn&#x27;t have the attachment, and because I didn&#x27;t see any type of cum in it, but I completely forgot</li>
            <li>It arrived in a soft mailing bag.</li>
            <li>I was surprised it didn’t have anything to attach in the hair</li>
            <li>It can be used for any special event, or for the little princess in your life to wear.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>and it was so much nicer than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Little bigger than I thought it was gonna be but very pretty</li>
            <li>No loose stones or anything.</li>
            <li>In February 2015, I started a social experiment wearing a &amp;#34;simpler&amp;#34; crown to see how my community would respond to me.</li>
            <li>It is pretty, but it was missing several rhinestones when we received it in the mail.</li>
            <li>A little teeny dab of super glue later, it&#x27;s back in without a single problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a little big for my head when I put it on just because I absolutely could not help myself.</li>
            <li>Generally there is a headband and sometimes combs attached, you will have to attach those yourself, as this is not a complete crown/tiara.</li>

            <li> but I have seen many comments on how to fix this issue.</li>
            <li> Thank you. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I love this tiara.</li>
            <li> I can’t wait to be able to try it out for a very special occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is wonderful, it&#x27;s substantial enough that it won&#x27;t deform easily, and it&#x27;s got a lot of sparkle.</li>
            <li> Luckily I&#x27;m pretty good at making it work since I got it for my daughters birthday and didnt have time to return and get something else in time.</li>
            <li> This is wedding quality, very pretty, amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;-The Wife</li>
            <li> The man placed the bags in the trunk and went his way after I was safe and secure in my car.</li>
            <li> I love it because it doesn&#x27;t look like a cheap piece you&#x27;d get from a dollar store</li>
            <li> This one tied as favorite for beauty, fit, quality, and price.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t going to easily break or bend.</li>
            <li> It could easily be used for kids pageants, for the prom queen, quincineara or debutante&#x27;s ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is elegant enough on its own, but will also be nice with a bridal veil.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Hairpin work fine when securing the tiara to your hair.</li>
            <li> She is in absolute love with it!</li>
            <li> and we attached some elastic to keep it on her but believe it would stay on its own as it is really sturdy.</li>
            <li> You WILL need bobby pins to fit this in your hair.</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be bent to fit any size head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and didn&#x27;t bother me once it was on, but I didn&#x27;t forget about either.</li>
            <li> It needs to be bent into shape to fit someone&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> , it made me filled up with attraction</li>
            <li> This tiara is GORGEOUS - far exceeded our expectations.  </li>
            <li> This item is beautiful, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I selected this item to review thinking after reviewing I would give it to my niece, but after wearing it to a friend&#x27;s party and having so much fun wearing it, I think I will keep if for myself for a while!</li>
            <li> I had originally offered to review this thinking</li>
            <li> and she accidentally seen it and got so excited.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, has two small holes to quickly attach your veil if you go that way, and would make anyone look like a stunning princess on their wedding day.</li>
            <li> I am super excited about it, I just wasn&#x27;t expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thought it was a full tiara</li>
            <li> then her larg pageant size sweet sixteen crown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1⃣ Full metal structure.</li>
            <li> My daughter wore this for her sweet sixteen party,  </li>
            <li> I actually wasn&#x27;t expecting something so good, because of the price.</li>
            <li> Very small details but perfect for she</li>
            <li> Got this package super quickly. ..</li>
            <li> With some gentle pressure, you can lightly shape it a bit tighter or a bit looser to fit your head.</li>
            <li> The initial appearance is nice and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> It was very pretty--</li>
            <li> She loves it very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but no combs to hold it onto your head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so very pretty</li>
            <li> Product is made well and is very pretty</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> No, no princess complexes, they just like pretty things!</li>
            <li> The tiara is more of an adult size in my opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It says proms or weddings, but I wanted a tiara to wear for fun-</li>
            <li> and it was so much fun.</li>
            <li> The fun came in because I thought I was too grown up to want to play princess, but found out that it was still a lot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure-</li>
            <li> Although it was meant for my young daughter, many stones had already fallen out when it arrived.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right amount of bling to make anyone feel like a queen.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but don&#x27;t really know how to keep it on her head.</li>
            <li> I tiara is very pretty and sparkly; it looks to be made very well.</li>
            <li> it came it very fast</li>
            <li> and they all ask my phone number, very useful and helpful, very grateful and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pretty tiara.</li>
            <li> This model feels so real, with a sturdy metal construction and lots of shiny bling!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is quite pretty.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely lived it!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really not difficult to use a piece of elastic band.</li>
            <li> People were smiling, coming up to me and telling me it was a pretty tiara.</li>
            <li> so pretty used for a friends birthday party</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> I have purchased many tiaras for local agents and never had this problem before.</li>
            <li> It definitely works and doesn&#x27;t look cheap but takes work to make it functional!</li>
            <li> Easily obtainable from your local hobby shop, which is exactly where I&#x27;m going to get mine tomorrow!</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no good reason at all whatsoever to have a tiara except for the fact that I really honestly truly and completely believe that every woman, child, teenager should own a tiara.</li>
            <li> I love tiaras andvwhat woman young or old doesnt want to feel like royalty sometimes with this u</li>
            <li> wow very nice, heavy, circles on end for bobbypin etc.</li>
            <li> The crystals in it are so pretty and very sparkly.</li>
            <li> Much better than the usual plastic rubbish as metal and detailed.</li>
            <li> It has a little weight to it, which is nice-</li>
            <li> Very dissappointing</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it thinks she&#x27;s a real princess.</li>
            <li> Yes, absolutely.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Very well made, with weight to it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 9 year old daughter for play time fun.</li>
            <li> My wife put bobby pins at the very edge of the crown</li>
            <li> It is very sparkly and shinny.</li>
            <li> It is nice &amp; sparkly (as few stones fell out, but were in the bag).</li>
            <li> It is a nice heavy metal</li>
            <li> Great for a party or just feeling like a princess and sturdy enough to last a long time for reuse.</li>
            <li> Feels and looks high quality.</li>
            <li> This pretty little tiara is about 1/3 of a circle, and has loops on both ends that you can attach ribbons, elastic or hair pins to secure it into place-</li>
            <li> Very sparkly, but does not come with combs or complete headband</li>
            <li> Heavy (not plastic).&lt;br /&gt;2⃣ Jewels and stones can pop out (not noticeable because there are so many on the crown, but you may see some around on the ground).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lovely, was expecting a flimsy tiara for the price but quite heavy and not flimsy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter, who will be 4 right after Christmas, for a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the weight of this tiara.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was very surprised at the weight of it.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and lovely.  </li>
            <li> my younger daughter wants one too</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality of the rhinestones for the price.  </li>
            <li> I could use it for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t flimsy light weight but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I knew from the pictures that this didn&#x27;t have the attachment, and because I didn&#x27;t see any type of cum in it, but I completely forgot</li>
            <li> It arrived in a soft mailing bag.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it didn’t have anything to attach in the hair</li>
            <li> It can be used for any special event, or for the little princess in your life to wear.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> and it was so much nicer than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Little bigger than I thought it was gonna be but very pretty</li>
            <li> No loose stones or anything.</li>
            <li> In February 2015, I started a social experiment wearing a &amp;#34;simpler&amp;#34; crown to see how my community would respond to me.</li>
            <li> It is pretty, but it was missing several rhinestones when we received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> A little teeny dab of super glue later, it&#x27;s back in without a single problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a little big for my head when I put it on just because I absolutely could not help myself.</li>
            <li> Generally there is a headband and sometimes combs attached, you will have to attach those yourself, as this is not a complete crown/tiara.</li>
            <li> It is made in a sturdy metal, not the cheap plastic you normally get and the &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; sparkle like crazy.</li>
            <li> This pretty tiara sparkles with dozens of rhinestone jewels in a delicate scrolling floral pattern.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big for my 9 year old, but that&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t know it was easily bendable to the point you cant break it if bent wrong on accident.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s TONS of crystals in this headband, and one very big one front and center.  </li>
            <li> tall overall and the center pear-shaped stone is about 9/16 in.</li>
            <li> Seriously, who doesn&#x27;t feel like a real princess with a tiara on?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems like it will be durably enough to last a few wearings.</li>
            <li> But, I bent it just a tiny little bit</li>
            <li> /&gt;The stones are glued in place, so the tiara should not be handled roughly or they may come</li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t stay on the head , no grip- too wide.</li>
            <li> I bought this crown because the combs don&#x27;t dig into my head like the other crown.</li>
            <li> this was too heavy and there was no way to pin it in hair -- especially not smooth, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Though sadly when ours arrived one of the little crystals had fallen out, it was thankfully right there in the packaging.</li>
            <li> The tiara can be adjusted by bending it slightly, but it&#x27;s certainly not a toy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very well made and not at all fake looking,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure how they expected it to stay &amp; upon arrival  few stones where out...</li>
            <li> Had seen a tiara very similar and 5 times more expensive!!!!</li>
            <li> all the way around a head) &amp; the high rating I mistakenly failed to do so.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my little sister to go with a princess dress.</li>
            <li> There are little eyelets on the end</li>
            <li> She looks like a little princes in it.</li>
            <li> I thought i was missing a piece when i got it because there is nothing to attach it to your head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the front part of a tiara, it&#x27;s missing the part that holds it on your head.</li>
            <li> While it may not look like a million dollar piece, it is not cheap looking either.</li>
            <li> Well made and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting something that would be this heavy for the price.</li>
            <li> Each end also has a little loop for securing to virtually any hairstyle!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to do????</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with this tiara.</li>
            <li> Silver Tone Alice Hair Band Headband Tiara Base 0.12&amp;#34; HOT]]  </li>
            <li> This is not a headband (at least not the one I got), it&#x27;s not a crown either.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too delicate.</li>
            <li> Does not come with hair peice to attach into hair and is very very heavy!</li>
            <li> The only thing I was disappointed with with</li>
            <li> I let him help me because I was about to drop the grocery bags which would be a problem because a hungry princess is an angry princess!</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed to see this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the quality was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very sparkly, but does not come with combs or complete headband so it doesn&#x27;t just slip off.  It should come with something or have a suggested fix.  I&#x27;m not sure what to do????</li>
            <li> I thought i was missing a piece when i got it because there is nothing to attach it to your head. That should definitely be in the product description. Luckily I&#x27;m pretty good at making it work since I got it for my daughters birthday and didnt have time to return and get something else in time.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  Kind of weighty.  Definitely worked for my queen outfit.</li>
            <li> It was very pretty-- but it broke before my daughter ever got to wear it.  Warning-- don&#x27;t bend it at all.  And it doesn&#x27;t come with any way to attach it to your head.  Not a headband.  No comb.  Very dissappointing</li>
            <li> This item is beautiful, but not what I expected. It does not attach to my head or even sit up by itself. I have to pin it on with bobby pins.</li>
            <li> thought it was a full tiara but it was not</li>
            <li> This is not a headband (at least not the one I got), it&#x27;s not a crown either. It&#x27;s just the front part of a tiara, it&#x27;s missing the part that holds it on your head. So if you buy this beware, you will need to alter it to add something to adhere it to your head. Generally there is a headband and sometimes combs attached, you will have to attach those yourself, as this is not a complete crown/tiara.</li>
            <li> This is exacly what my daughter wanted for her grad dance i could not find one this prwtty in my town it came it very fast and it was perfect upon arrival</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it.  She wore it to Prom and looked beautiful.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and perfect for the gag we have planned.</li>
            <li> Perfect and gorgeous, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice tiera, well made but lacking combs or ribbons, or any way to keep it on the head.  No big deal.</li>
            <li> This tiara is GORGEOUS - far exceeded our expectations.  It is a nice weight with quality workmanship and nicely set stones.  It looks like a much more expensive piece.  It is elegant enough on its own, but will also be nice with a bridal veil.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and well worth the price. Daughter loves it thinks she&#x27;s a real princess. So beautiful, great quality. Well worth the money! Arrived quicker than anticipated. Looks beautiful!! Great value for money. It was just what we needed and made my daughters day, thank you. I would thoroughly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This crown is even more beautiful in person. My daughter happen to love this one even mor then her larg pageant size sweet sixteen crown.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, very pleased with this item. Pretty tiara. I bought it for my little sister to go with a princess dress. She loves it very pretty. Lovely item. Very small details but perfect for she I bought them for who asked for a princess crown. Much better than the usual plastic rubbish as metal and detailed.</li>
            <li> wow very nice, heavy, circles on end for bobbypin etc. well made</li>
            <li> My Daughter is in Love with it. Good quality, shiny.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters birthday and looked at a LOT of tiaras before deciding on this one. I am so pleased with this. It is made in a sturdy metal, not the cheap plastic you normally get and the &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; sparkle like crazy. It has a loop on either end and we attached some elastic to keep it on her but believe it would stay on its own as it is really sturdy. Great for a party or just feeling like a princess and sturdy enough to last a long time for reuse.</li>
            <li> This was stunning when I saw it! It made a very happy 14th birthday for my niece. It is excellent quality, and the perfect price.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller</li>
            <li> Received this today and love it! It is not flimsy at all - very strong and solid with gorgeous detail!! It is a surprise for a friend and I cannot wait to give it to her!</li>
            <li> Seriously, who doesn&#x27;t feel like a real princess with a tiara on?  This model feels so real, with a sturdy metal construction and lots of shiny bling!  Each end also has a little loop for securing to virtually any hairstyle!  I selected this item to review thinking after reviewing I would give it to my niece, but after wearing it to a friend&#x27;s party and having so much fun wearing it, I think I will keep if for myself for a while! Come on ladies, you too can rock the tiara and release your inner princess!</li>
            <li> Much nicer than expected for the price.  Very nice weight and good sparkle.  Feels and looks high quality.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but don&#x27;t really know how to keep it on her head.</li>
            <li> tiara is so much more dazzling and sparklely in person. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is so cute! It&#x27;ll be perfect for my Disney trip in the fall!</li>
            <li> Does not include combs for attaching to hair.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:269a863d8340e6ad9d28c5e38fe5424f]] 🎬 Video Review 🎬&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✏️ Plus Bonus Top 5 Beau Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1⃣ Full metal structure. Heavy (not plastic).&lt;br /&gt;2⃣ Jewels and stones can pop out (not noticeable because there are so many on the crown, but you may see some around on the ground).&lt;br /&gt;3⃣ Sizing: Since it&#x27;s metal you can bend it to fit.&lt;br /&gt;4⃣ You WILL need bobby pins to fit this in your hair. There are little eyelets on the end that you thread bobby pins through or tie an elastic thread.&lt;br /&gt;5⃣ Excellent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful! Note the company sent me this product to demonstrate on video and offer my personal opinion. I don&#x27;t work for them, nor am I paid anything that might sway my personal opinion of this product&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?&lt;br /&gt;👍 Yes, absolutely.</li>
            <li> Great quality!!! Glad I didn&#x27;t spend $150 at a bridal store for the same thing!!</li>
            <li> My daughter wore this for her sweet sixteen party,  it&#x27;s very well made and not at all fake looking,  she loved it and it looked amazing,  my younger daughter wants one too so I will be purchasing a second one too.</li>
            <li> This crown is just beautiful.  It&#x27;s just the right amount of bling to make anyone feel like a queen.</li>
            <li> Lovely, was expecting a flimsy tiara for the price but quite heavy and not flimsy. Bit smaller than the pictures on here but still perfect for my 9yr olds communion day. The tiara is a really good quality one. I actually wasn&#x27;t expecting something so good, because of the price. Had seen a tiara very similar and 5 times more expensive!!!! I&#x27;ve received on time as well.</li>
            <li> I am a writer. I needed a crown because my pen name is Princess Dolly. I wear my crown to remind everyone that women and girls deserve royal treatment, love, and respect. In February 2015, I started a social experiment wearing a &amp;#34;simpler&amp;#34; crown to see how my community would respond to me. One lady let me go ahead in the checkout line. One man offered to bring my grocery bags to the car. I let him help me because I was about to drop the grocery bags which would be a problem because a hungry princess is an angry princess! The man placed the bags in the trunk and went his way after I was safe and secure in my car. There are many more acts of kindness that my community has shown me. I did not expect that I would change as a result of wearing the crown. I walk taller and have more confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This crown does not come with combs. I bought this crown because the combs don&#x27;t dig into my head like the other crown. I also don&#x27;t have to worry about hiding the combs. I love this crown. It is simple elegance. Thank you for this beautiful crown. It is perfect for a princess!</li>
            <li> This tiara is a great deal! It has a little weight to it, which is nice- it&#x27;s not too delicate. Another feature I personally LOVED, was that it doesn&#x27;t have those cheap tacky combs! This piece has a loop built into the ends. You can very easily stick bobby pins in and place the piece however you want! While it may not look like a million dollar piece, it is not cheap looking either.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister&#x27;s bachelorette party, and it was PERFECT. It stayed in with one bobby pin on each side, and she absolutely loved it. Excellent quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> It is nice &amp; sparkly (as few stones fell out, but were in the bag). The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is there is no way to attach it to your head &amp; it is about 1/3 of a circular item. I was quite disappointed to see this. And before someone challenges me on this - I would like to point out that the seller uses the words &amp;#34;tiara&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;crown&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;headband&amp;#34; in the item title AND in the longer description - &amp;#34;crown&amp;#34; being  used two ADDITIONAL times - four times altogether. Yes, I should have read the reviews - but with the use of those words (tiara &#x3D; 3/4 around head and crown &amp; headband &#x3D; all the way around a head) &amp; the high rating I mistakenly failed to do so.</li>
            <li> Great quality tiara. Weighty</li>
            <li> The tiara is gorgeous, however it doesn&#x27;t have any combs or band attached so I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s suppose to stay on my head. Was going to wear it for my wedding but I think I&#x27;ll return for one that wears like a headband.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but no combs to hold it onto your head. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is quite pretty.  I was surprised at the quality of the rhinestones for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t come on a headband though, so keep that in mind.  There are no combs either, so to wear it so that it fits, you&#x27;ll need to find a way to anchor it.  It could be attached to a bun by adding some elastic and using some pins, or you can put it on this sort of headband that is made for these.  [[ASIN:B00L31KDD4 SODIAL(R) 5 Silver Tone Alice Hair Band Headband Tiara Base 0.12&amp;#34; HOT]]  These can also be bought at a lot of big arts and crafts stores.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s TONS of crystals in this headband, and one very big one front and center.  It sparkles well.  It seems to be made of some lower quality metal, and it is painted silver.  The one that I received had all crystals intact and only one of them appeared to be offset a bit.  Overall it looks great, just wish it had come with the band.</li>
            <li> VERY nice quality and not junky.  The tiara can be adjusted by bending it slightly, but it&#x27;s certainly not a toy.  It can be used for any special event, or for the little princess in your life to wear.</li>
            <li> Little bigger than I thought it was gonna be but very pretty</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for a girlfriend of mine. She absolutely loves it. Very well made, with weight to it. She was queen for a weekend on her birthday.</li>
            <li> Absolutley loveee lovee this tiara. i love the style and how it look from many perspectives. the only thing i dont like is that is dont come with hair clips or anything that can help me support it from falling.</li>
            <li> Well made and heavy duty. This tiara has 2 circles to put pins in or attach an elastic head band to keep it on your head. I had originally offered to review this thinking I could use it for my 11 year old daughter. The tiara is more of an adult size in my opinion. Stunningly beautiful and full of sparkle.  The tiara was shipped and received fast great seller.</li>
            <li> This pretty tiara sparkles with dozens of rhinestone jewels in a delicate scrolling floral pattern.  The setting is made of metal with a bright silvery finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 2 in. tall overall and the center pear-shaped stone is about 9/16 in. tall.  It weighs 79 g or 2.8 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stones are glued in place, so the tiara should not be handled roughly or they may come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be bent to fit any size head.  There are loops on each end so that ribbons can be attached to help hold it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ubestsky provided a tiara for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Beautiful tiara, stunningly sparkly, but does not come with anything to attach it to your head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to seller-- you should probably state this fact in your item description!</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and lovely.  However it does not have the side combs to keep in place so I returned it.  However it was a very nice quality.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 9 year old daughter for play time fun. She is in absolute love with it! It isn&#x27;t flimsy light weight but not too heavy. The back on each side has eye holes to either tie string or possibly use with a vale.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! The only thing I was disappointed with with was that there was no comb to help keep it In place but it&#x27;s beautiful and the quality is excellent!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters birthday! She absolutely lived it! It does not come with comb so we used Bobbie pins and thy worked fine!  We are going to let my sister in law use it for her back g 15 the birthday!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful and exceeded my expectations!  Hairpin work fine when securing the tiara to your hair.</li>
            <li> Got this package super quickly. ..gotta love amazon shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Tiara looks just like the pictures.  Would be great if adding a veil.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using it for a tooth fairy costume,  so I&#x27;ll have to figure out how to get it to stay on,  add it had no combs or clips with.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like it will be durably enough to last a few wearings. No loose stones or anything.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the weight of this tiara. I was not expecting something that would be this heavy for the price. I am super excited about it, I just wasn&#x27;t expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detail that is in this tiara is amazing! It&#x27;s stunningly beautiful, and every crystal is in its perfect place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this does not come with anything to attach it to your head, and it&#x27;s not a home, it&#x27;s really not difficult to use a piece of elastic band. Easily obtainable from your local hobby shop, which is exactly where I&#x27;m going to get mine tomorrow! I knew from the pictures that this didn&#x27;t have the attachment, and because I didn&#x27;t see any type of cum in it, but I completely forgot and I definitely should have made a reminder in my phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little big for my head when I put it on just because I absolutely could not help myself. But, I bent it just a tiny little bit and then it was perfection. :-) I have absolutely no good reason at all whatsoever to have a tiara except for the fact that I really honestly truly and completely believe that every woman, child, teenager should own a tiara. How are we supposed to be treated like queens and princesses if we don&#x27;t dress like it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to any one who loves shiny, sparkly, and happy beautiful things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This pretty little tiara is about 1/3 of a circle, and has loops on both ends that you can attach ribbons, elastic or hair pins to secure it into place- but I didn&#x27;t find that necessary to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says proms or weddings, but I wanted a tiara to wear for fun- and this one is perfect. With some gentle pressure, you can lightly shape it a bit tighter or a bit looser to fit your head. It won&#x27;t take a drastic change of shape, but a couple millimeters isn&#x27;t a problem. The loops are soldered so they don&#x27;t snag hair, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with any of the rhinestone settings grabbing my hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is wonderful, it&#x27;s substantial enough that it won&#x27;t deform easily, and it&#x27;s got a lot of sparkle. The size is small enough to be a pretty accent- but people definitely know you&#x27;re wearing a tiara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore it out, just shopping and doing day to day life stuff and it was so much fun. It&#x27;s comfortable and didn&#x27;t bother me once it was on, but I didn&#x27;t forget about either. People were smiling, coming up to me and telling me it was a pretty tiara. The fun came in because I thought I was too grown up to want to play princess, but found out that it was still a lot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure- I got this at no cost for review purposes, wearing it to the grocery store was my choice and I&#x27;m glad I did and will again!</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with this tiara. It arrived in a soft mailing bag. The initial appearance is nice and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap. Unfortunately the quality was terrible. As soon as we opened it two rhinestones fell out of the bag. Throughout the day more fell off. It needs to be bent into shape to fit someone&#x27;s head. Before the end of the day part of it snapped and we threw it out. I bought this for a 10 year olds birthday. Do not risk the purchase if you are planning to use this for your wedding!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Although it was meant for my young daughter, many stones had already fallen out when it arrived.</li>
            <li> My daugher love this tiara. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t look like a cheap piece you&#x27;d get from a dollar store</li>
            <li> This tiara is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! Though sadly when ours arrived one of the little crystals had fallen out, it was thankfully right there in the packaging. A little teeny dab of super glue later, it&#x27;s back in without a single problem. Two of my daughters just like to wear tiara&#x27;s just because. No, no princess complexes, they just like pretty things! I was happy to be able to get this at a reduced price in order to give my thoughts on it. It&#x27;s a little big for my 9 year old, but that&#x27;s alright. It&#x27;ll last a while I can tell. If you want to actually get your kiddo something for dress up, ditch the plastic crowns and tiaras! Trust me, spend the extra money on something like this and you&#x27;ll have something that lasts a lot longer than crummy flimsy plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I not already had my wedding and used a different tiara 3 years ago, this one would have been my choice. It&#x27;s beautiful, has two small holes to quickly attach your veil if you go that way, and would make anyone look like a stunning princess on their wedding day.</li>
            <li> I love tiaras andvwhat woman young or old doesnt want to feel like royalty sometimes with this u will be thr head of the ball...</li>
            <li> this was too heavy and there was no way to pin it in hair -- especially not smooth, straight hair.</li>
            <li> so pretty used for a friends birthday party just wish It would of had combs on it</li>
            <li> Very Cute! I wore It for my wedding and everyone loved it! The downside is that it doesn&#x27;t come with anything to hold in place on your head so it kept falling off.</li>
            <li> Bought this crown for myself and I want to look more charming and special on the party, therefore I decided to buy it. It did do the things I hope, it made me filled up with attraction and they all ask my phone number, very useful and helpful, very grateful and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even  wear it. It does not  have combs or anything to put into hair... I&#x27;m unsure how they expected it to stay &amp; upon arrival  few stones where out... it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the combs to hold on head</li>
            <li> It looks as is just didn&#x27;t know it was easily bendable to the point you cant break it if bent wrong on accident.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and sturdy!</li>
            <li> It is pretty, but it was missing several rhinestones when we received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> This is adorable ! We bought it for our grand daughter , she loves princesses !</li>
            <li> I tiara is very pretty and sparkly; it looks to be made very well. I was surprised it didn’t have anything to attach in the hair but I have seen many comments on how to fix this issue. The only thing I would change or fix is maybe send something with the tiara to attach to the hair so customers don’t have to purchase something additional. I can’t wait to be able to try it out for a very special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; below. Thank you. :)&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I got this and it was so much nicer than I expected it to be. It is a nice heavy metal so it isn&#x27;t going to easily break or bend. The crystals in it are so pretty and very sparkly. There are holes on the back in case you want to add a string or bobby pins or whatever to hold it on. My daughter was absolutely thrilled with this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so very pretty but it won&#x27;t stay on the head , no grip- too wide. I have purchased many tiaras for local agents and never had this problem before. I may try to add combs on the side but in reality I&#x27;ll probably just get a different one.</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: I received a product discount for this review.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this crown for my daughter&#x27;s upcoming 25th birthday. It has become a tradition in our family to give a crown to everyone when they reach 25. I saw this and thought it was perfect. It looked great on me, and I know that she will love it.</li>
            <li> Very cheap. Received it on Friday, picked it up on Saturday &amp; it snapped in two pieces.</li>
            <li> Product is made well and is very pretty</li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch of different Tiaras for an upcoming birthday party. This one tied as favorite for beauty, fit, quality, and price. This is wedding quality, very pretty, amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;-The Wife</li>
            <li> Does not come with hair peice to attach into hair and is very very heavy! It definitely works and doesn&#x27;t look cheap but takes work to make it functional!</li>
            <li> A really, pretty tiara/crown that looks great on.  It sits at an angle that seems too tilted when you are putting it on, but once placed, it looks great.  My wife put bobby pins at the very edge of the crown so it stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;This has a good weight to it and sparkles a lot.  It could easily be used for kids pageants, for the prom queen, quincineara or debutante&#x27;s ball.&lt;br /&gt;A good buy for the price.&lt;br /&gt;-sample provided for unbias review</li>
            <li> I love this tiara. It is absolutely beautiful. I have to say that I was very surprised at the weight of it. It isn&#x27;t thin or made of cheap quality. I bought this for my granddaughter, who will be 4 right after Christmas, for a Christmas present. I had it on the counter and my son walked in with her without me knowing and she accidentally seen it and got so excited. I had to give it to her, and she was so beautiful in it. It is very sparkly and shinny. She looks like a little princes in it.</li>
