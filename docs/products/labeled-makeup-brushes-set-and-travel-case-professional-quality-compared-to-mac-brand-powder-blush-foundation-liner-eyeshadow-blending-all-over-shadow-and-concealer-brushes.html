            <li>But now I&#x27;m confident that I can follow along.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I have never been a huge make up brush person.</li>
            <li>Such great quality for the price</li>
            <li>I picked them back up this morning to test them with my makeup, I was impressed, The scent was gone, the brushes are soft, ferrules secure, and bristles lovely.</li>
            <li>These makeup brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re so great I have swapped out these for my daily brushes because they&#x27;re such great quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend anyone purchase these especially at this great price!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have found these brushes.</li>
            <li>After working at The Body Shop for years and loving their brushes, I&#x27;ve finally found brushes that I like better.</li>
            <li>Added bonus, i feel pretty cool using them:)</li>
            <li>They are just as good of quality as the brushes I have purchased individually at over $20 a piece.</li>
            <li>They come in a nice soft case.  </li>
            <li>The case is cute and the labeled brushes make it that much</li>
            <li>I have so much more control which i really noticed with the liner brush.</li>
            <li>The case makes storage and transportation easy and there is zero thinking involved in selecting the brush that you need because they are labeled for your convenience...which makes getting ready in the morning a breeze!  </li>
            <li>Love my new brushes!</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly as promised.  </li>
            <li>When I *very very first* opened this package</li>
            <li>They are so soft and I love that they are labled with what each of them is intended for.</li>
            <li>but I like to keep a more natural look and not have my make up</li>
            <li>I have a TON of makeup brushes and am very picky, I have brushes in my collection from crown to MAC and these fit right in.</li>
            <li>Very useful for people like me who don&#x27;t really know the difference between brushes, so each of them being labeled</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the feel and love that they individually labelled for proper use.  </li>
            <li>my make up bag looking for the right brush.</li>
            <li>Feel they are just right the size for my hand.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft, makeup application goes on smoothly, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding of bristles yet.  </li>
            <li>Super soft and fluffy, they apply my make beautifully.</li>
            <li>It makes applying make-up easy and convenient with each brush clearly displaying what each one is designed to do (see my video).  </li>
            <li>was so helpful and such a cute idea.  </li>
            <li>So glad I finally purchased a brush</li>
            <li>Not only are these the softest brushes that I&#x27;ve used, but my makeup goes on more evenly.</li>
            <li>The first hit of excitement came when I removed the plastic packaging from each brush and their was no shedding.</li>
            <li>so you know exactly what brush to use with your make up.</li>
            <li>To quote her texts upon receiving the gift: &amp;#34;Thank you for this fantastic and totally unexpected gift!&amp;#34; &amp;</li>
            <li>I experienced a little delay in delivery due to carrier issues but the brushes were absolutely worth the wait!!   </li>
            <li>the texture of the bristles feels so right.&amp;#34; Needless to say, I did good. :)</li>
            <li>First of all, my make up goes on so much smoother and it does not clump up.</li>
            <li>Super soft and my makeup goes on evenly.</li>
            <li>The brushes are all super soft and do not shed at all.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality with an affordable price tag.</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>For the quality, I would have expected to pay so much more</li>
            <li>and here I got a whole set of 7 brushes.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the case the brushes are stored in as well as the 7 different brushes clearly marked with what each one should be used for.</li>
            <li>They also come in an absolutely adorable little carrying case that folds up and snaps closed for super easy carrying in your purse or suitcase.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the right firmness, no bristles were lost and thankfully the handles are marked for use.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and encourage you other old dogs to try a new trick.</li>
            <li>Each brush has its own pocket, and if there is one thing I wished about this case, it is that it had larger or extra pockets so that I could fit some of my other brushes in it.</li>
            <li>After 30+ years of applying make up with the flimsy spongey applicator that comes with make up, i decided to try my first set of professional brushes.</li>
            <li>Love the sleek all black design.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like these brushes and they will go in my normal rotation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone looking for new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of these brushes and softness.</li>
            <li>I have paid more in the past for just one quality brush like these</li>
            <li>The brushes were so soft!</li>
            <li>I really love the small d rushes in this set.</li>
            <li>The best part is that each brush is labeled to its purpose,  so no more guessing game to what brush is for what use.</li>
            <li>Brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>After all, I have an extremely sensitive nose</li>
            <li>This is a complete set.</li>
            <li>I have spent tons of money on quality brushes over the years from Sephora, Ulta, MAC, and many other brands, and these equally compare for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>#34;I won&#x27;t even tell you that you didn&#x27;t have to do it because I will absolutely use every single brush.&amp;#34; &amp;</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:41a62d09f47513a3d04ac724dea1bb71]]As some other people have mentioned, this set has a &#x27;plastic&#x27; smell to then when you first open the package.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard the complaints about other brands of brushes but the NKE brushes are really well made.</li>
            <li>Needless to say it is nice to finally have uniformity with my brushes!</li>
            <li>The bristles are high quality, and have a variance of firm to soft for the different purpose of each brush.</li>
            <li>I absolutely can not stand the little powder pads that come with a powder compact.</li>
            <li>Very soft, and don&#x27;t shed like other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and they&#x27;re so great I have swapped out these for my daily brushes because they&#x27;re such great quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend anyone purchase these especially at this great price!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found these brushes.</li>
            <li> After working at The Body Shop for years and loving their brushes, I&#x27;ve finally found brushes that I like better.</li>
            <li> Added bonus, i feel pretty cool using them:)</li>
            <li> They are just as good of quality as the brushes I have purchased individually at over $20 a piece.</li>
            <li> They come in a nice soft case.  </li>
            <li> The case is cute and the labeled brushes make it that much</li>
            <li> I have so much more control which i really noticed with the liner brush.</li>
            <li> The case makes storage and transportation easy and there is zero thinking involved in selecting the brush that you need because they are labeled for your convenience...which makes getting ready in the morning a breeze!  </li>
            <li> Love my new brushes!</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly as promised.  </li>
            <li> When I *very very first* opened this package</li>
            <li> They are so soft and I love that they are labled with what each of them is intended for.</li>
            <li> but I like to keep a more natural look and not have my make up</li>
            <li> I have a TON of makeup brushes and am very picky, I have brushes in my collection from crown to MAC and these fit right in.</li>
            <li> Very useful for people like me who don&#x27;t really know the difference between brushes, so each of them being labeled</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the feel and love that they individually labelled for proper use.  </li>
            <li> my make up bag looking for the right brush.</li>
            <li> Feel they are just right the size for my hand.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft, makeup application goes on smoothly, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding of bristles yet.  </li>
            <li> Super soft and fluffy, they apply my make beautifully.</li>
            <li> It makes applying make-up easy and convenient with each brush clearly displaying what each one is designed to do (see my video).  </li>
            <li> was so helpful and such a cute idea.  </li>
            <li> So glad I finally purchased a brush</li>
            <li> Not only are these the softest brushes that I&#x27;ve used, but my makeup goes on more evenly.</li>
            <li> The first hit of excitement came when I removed the plastic packaging from each brush and their was no shedding.</li>
            <li> so you know exactly what brush to use with your make up.</li>
            <li> To quote her texts upon receiving the gift: &amp;#34;Thank you for this fantastic and totally unexpected gift!&amp;#34; &amp;</li>
            <li> I experienced a little delay in delivery due to carrier issues but the brushes were absolutely worth the wait!!   </li>
            <li> the texture of the bristles feels so right.&amp;#34; Needless to say, I did good. :)</li>
            <li> First of all, my make up goes on so much smoother and it does not clump up.</li>
            <li> Super soft and my makeup goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> The brushes are all super soft and do not shed at all.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality with an affordable price tag.</li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> For the quality, I would have expected to pay so much more</li>
            <li> and here I got a whole set of 7 brushes.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the case the brushes are stored in as well as the 7 different brushes clearly marked with what each one should be used for.</li>
            <li> They also come in an absolutely adorable little carrying case that folds up and snaps closed for super easy carrying in your purse or suitcase.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the right firmness, no bristles were lost and thankfully the handles are marked for use.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and encourage you other old dogs to try a new trick.</li>
            <li> Each brush has its own pocket, and if there is one thing I wished about this case, it is that it had larger or extra pockets so that I could fit some of my other brushes in it.</li>
            <li> After 30+ years of applying make up with the flimsy spongey applicator that comes with make up, i decided to try my first set of professional brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the sleek all black design.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like these brushes and they will go in my normal rotation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone looking for new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of these brushes and softness.</li>
            <li> I have paid more in the past for just one quality brush like these</li>
            <li> The brushes were so soft!</li>
            <li> I really love the small d rushes in this set.</li>
            <li> The best part is that each brush is labeled to its purpose,  so no more guessing game to what brush is for what use.</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> After all, I have an extremely sensitive nose</li>
            <li> This is a complete set.</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money on quality brushes over the years from Sephora, Ulta, MAC, and many other brands, and these equally compare for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> #34;I won&#x27;t even tell you that you didn&#x27;t have to do it because I will absolutely use every single brush.&amp;#34; &amp;</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:41a62d09f47513a3d04ac724dea1bb71]]As some other people have mentioned, this set has a &#x27;plastic&#x27; smell to then when you first open the package.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard the complaints about other brands of brushes but the NKE brushes are really well made.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it is nice to finally have uniformity with my brushes!</li>
            <li> The bristles are high quality, and have a variance of firm to soft for the different purpose of each brush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely can not stand the little powder pads that come with a powder compact.</li>
            <li> Very soft, and don&#x27;t shed like other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I never really realized what all of the different brushes were for!</li>
            <li> Not one single bristle was lost....</li>
            <li> Normally you pay approximately the same amount for one or two brushes elsewhere.</li>
            <li> gets rid of the smell though and leaves absolutely no residue.  </li>
            <li> They all have a black handle with black bristle that have white tips.</li>
            <li> I am a typical girl that only replaces brushes once the bristles begin to shed; and even then I will only replace the brushes as I go either with a one off purchase from Target or one really expensive brush</li>
            <li> I got these to have a travel set of brushes, as every girl knows it&#x27;s not good to transport your daily brushes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear enough make-up to use this product, so I bought these brushes as a gift to cheer up a friend who has been having a tough year.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of new brushes, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money at a cosmetics store.</li>
            <li> I have really expensive Mac brushes and these</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive, so I don&#x27;t feel bad taking them to a show or lending them out, and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do not shed which can be really annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate brushes that shed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love the case the brushes are stored in as well as the 7 different brushes clearly marked with what each one should be used for. Received within 2 days and cannot wait to start playing with all my makeup!!</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes are the NKE makeup brushes. They are so soft and I love that they are labled with what each of them is intended for. Very high quality with an affordable price tag. I can&#x27;t wait to order more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality and arrived in perfect condition. I got these to have a travel set of brushes, as every girl knows it&#x27;s not good to transport your daily brushes! They are just as good of quality as the brushes I have purchased individually at over $20 a piece. This is a great deal, and shipped very quickly! Very happy with this product and seller.</li>
            <li> Love my new brushes! Super soft and my makeup goes on evenly. So happy I found these, and such a great price. Thinking this will be a great gift idea for my friends and family this holiday season.</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly as promised.  The brushes are beautiful and the quality is great!  They come in a nice soft case.  I bought for a gift but may just keep for myself and rethink that gift.  Nice product!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!  Such great quality for the price and I received them in 2 days.  The brushes are all super soft and do not shed at all.  Very useful for people like me who don&#x27;t really know the difference between brushes, so each of them being labeled was so helpful and such a cute idea.  I&#x27;d highly recommend anyone purchase these especially at this great price!</li>
            <li> So glad I finally purchased a brush set!&lt;br /&gt; I am a typical girl that only replaces brushes once the bristles begin to shed; and even then I will only replace the brushes as I go either with a one off purchase from Target or one really expensive brush I was talked into from Benefit sales associate.  Needless to say it is nice to finally have uniformity with my brushes! With the purchase of this set I have brushes I would have never thought of buying before, like the blending eye shadow brush (love!)! The bristles are high quality, and have a variance of firm to soft for the different purpose of each brush. Best yet, they come with a fashionable bag to organize and protect for travel or storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great gift for teenager all the way to adult!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dior brushes. Purchased these beautiful brushes and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Thanks so much for making great brushes at amazing prices.</li>
            <li> Great brush set!! The quality of them is very impressive for the price.  Can&#x27;t wait to give the others I purchased as gifts!</li>
            <li> Very soft, and don&#x27;t shed like other brushes I&#x27;ve used. Love them.</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft. Comes in a nice case. For someone who doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup it&#x27;s nice that the brushes are labeled</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:41a62d09f47513a3d04ac724dea1bb71]]As some other people have mentioned, this set has a &#x27;plastic&#x27; smell to then when you first open the package.  Airing it out for a day (just leave open on a counter) gets rid of the smell though and leaves absolutely no residue.  The smell does not come from the brushes themselves, but rather from the case and plastic wrapping.  The brushes are absolutely wonderful and pick up product well.  It makes applying make-up easy and convenient with each brush clearly displaying what each one is designed to do (see my video).  I love the travel case as it makes taking my brushes with me in my purse hassle free and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make up brushes received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, arrived, and as described.  A great addition to any woman&#x27;s makeup bag!</li>
            <li> These are the softest brushes I have ever used! After working at The Body Shop for years and loving their brushes, I&#x27;ve finally found brushes that I like better. The travel case that they come with make them very practical and the perfect gift!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and I received them quickly in two days!  I have spent tons of money on quality brushes over the years from Sephora, Ulta, MAC, and many other brands, and these equally compare for a fraction of the cost.  You literally receive an entire set for what you would pay for just one brush with another brand.  These brushes are super soft, makeup application goes on smoothly, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding of bristles yet.  I also love how each brush is labeled for what they should be used for and the case is super handy to throw in your purse or bag when traveling.</li>
            <li> When I *very very first* opened this package I was hit with uncertainty. After all, I have an extremely sensitive nose and I was hit by a plasticy smell. But, I reminded myself that these were synthetic brushes, still in their wrapping, and unwrapped the package and set them aside to air out for a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I picked them back up this morning to test them with my makeup, I was impressed, The scent was gone, the brushes are soft, ferrules secure, and bristles lovely. The case is exactly perfect to roll up the brushes in and snaps securely. It has a light pearly sheen of a finish to it, and is absolutely lovely. These brushes pick up product perfectly, and don&#x27;t shed, which is a huge plus. I have a TON of makeup brushes and am very picky, I have brushes in my collection from crown to MAC and these fit right in. They are inexpensive, so I don&#x27;t feel bad taking them to a show or lending them out, and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are four eye brushes and 3 face brushes in this set, and the face brushes come with protectors, which is wonderful, so that the bristles don&#x27;t get bent in any way with cleansing. Each brush has its own pocket, and if there is one thing I wished about this case, it is that it had larger or extra pockets so that I could fit some of my other brushes in it. I like these brushes and they will go in my normal rotation.&lt;br /&gt;I got this set at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> AMAZING BRUSHES !!!!  Love Love Love them!  Very soft &amp; the case they come in is very handy.  The labeled brushes sure come in handy so I don&#x27;t have to think. haha  Will be buying more for Christmas gifts for my friends &amp; family.  Thank you for a GREAT  product , worth every penny !!</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are fantastic. I&#x27;ve been needing a new brush for quite some time now, and when I saw the great value for 7 brushes I ordered them immediately - and received them within 1 day! Not only are these the softest brushes that I&#x27;ve used, but my makeup goes on more evenly. The fact that each brush is labeled, that helps me determine the appropriate brush to use since I&#x27;m not as makeup savvy. These are the best, they make perfect gifts too because they come in a very cute case. I would recommend these to anyone looking for new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes!  Couldnt be more pleased with the quality and price point!  They are soft and have the perfect amount of even coverage when applying your makeup!  The case is cute and the labeled brushes make it that much easier!&lt;br /&gt;So happy to have found them and will be buying more for gifts!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!!!  For the quality, I would have expected to pay so much more and I can&#x27;t stop telling all of my make-up loving friends about this must have in their vanity!!!  The case makes storage and transportation easy and there is zero thinking involved in selecting the brush that you need because they are labeled for your convenience...which makes getting ready in the morning a breeze!  I can&#x27;t wait for more products from this line!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no brush expert but as soon as I opened the case I could tell these were some really nice brushes. The first hit of excitement came when I removed the plastic packaging from each brush and their was no shedding. Not one single bristle was lost....amazing!!! The brushes come in a set 7.  You get 3 eye brushes (brow/liner, all over shadow and blending shadow) and 3 face brushes (foundation, concealer, powder and blusher). Each brush is labeled on their handle so you know exactly what brush to use with your make up. They all have a black handle with black bristle that have white tips. The brushes come nicely packed in their own carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;Because the brushes are labeled they&#x27;re great for make-up newbies like me. I watch make-up tutorials and I feel so lost when they talk about brushes. But now I&#x27;m confident that I can follow along.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this MKE product and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product during a promotional offer at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have never been a huge make up brush person. I never really realized what all of the different brushes were for! I love that this set has labeled brushes! Thats not something that you see often. Its a great first set of brushes for me! I love to wear makeup but I like to keep a more natural look and not have my make up look &#x27;caked on&#x27;. I would say that my favorite brushes that I use the most are the powder brush and the all over shadow brush. I absolutely can not stand the little powder pads that come with a powder compact. They do not hold powder like this awesome set of brushes does! I am so excited to have found these brushes. They also come in an absolutely adorable little carrying case that folds up and snaps closed for super easy carrying in your purse or suitcase. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of these brushes and softness. I have paid more in the past for just one quality brush like these and here I got a whole set of 7 brushes. It comes in a beautiful beige soft case that can be folded and fits in a purse.  The best part is that each brush is labeled to its purpose,  so no more guessing game to what brush is for what use. I love it!</li>
            <li> After 30+ years of applying make up with the flimsy spongey applicator that comes with make up, i decided to try my first set of professional brushes. Whoa... I cannot believe what a difference it makes. First of all, my make up goes on so much smoother and it does not clump up. I have so much more control which i really noticed with the liner brush. I&#x27;ve heard the complaints about other brands of brushes but the NKE brushes are really well made. They&#x27;re the right firmness, no bristles were lost and thankfully the handles are marked for use.  They come in a nice organizer so i do not have to fumble around my make up bag looking for the right brush. Added bonus, i feel pretty cool using them:) I am very pleased with my purchase and encourage you other old dogs to try a new trick.</li>
            <li> Great value for quality brushes!!! Normally you pay approximately the same amount for one or two brushes elsewhere. This is a complete set. Very well made. I am planning on buying this set for my mom, sister and nieces this year for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;  **They had a scent a bit like glue or paint when I opened them but it disappeared in a day or so.</li>
            <li> The brushes were so soft! I have really expensive Mac brushes and these are much more affordable and even work better. They do not shed which can be really annoying. They also come in a super cute kit that can be easily stored for travel. I would recommend NKE brushes to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great makeup brush set! They are great quality. No shedding, no stray bristles. Super soft and fluffy, they apply my make beautifully. Love the sleek all black design. And the supole white case. This set is great for beginners and expert makeup artist. I really love the small d rushes in this set. The bristles are firm which really let&#x27;s you pack the makeup on. Very nice! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> These brushes have exceeded my expectations! I am a makeup snob and I bought these as a travel set and they&#x27;re so great I have swapped out these for my daily brushes because they&#x27;re such great quality. I hate brushes that shed so I was happy to see on the reviews that these don&#x27;t shed. I will probably order a second set to use for travel. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of new brushes, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money at a cosmetics store. I purchased these brushes and love them! They are super soft and have great, even coverage. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out when using them and are perfectly labeled for application. The case is perfect for travel and keeps them nice and organized. They are great quality and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear enough make-up to use this product, so I bought these brushes as a gift to cheer up a friend who has been having a tough year. To quote her texts upon receiving the gift: &amp;#34;Thank you for this fantastic and totally unexpected gift!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;I won&#x27;t even tell you that you didn&#x27;t have to do it because I will absolutely use every single brush.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;It is PERFECT! &amp;#34; &amp;#34;...the texture of the bristles feels so right.&amp;#34; Needless to say, I did good. :)</li>
            <li> I experienced a little delay in delivery due to carrier issues but the brushes were absolutely worth the wait!!   I am very pleased with the feel and love that they individually labelled for proper use.  I also like the size of the brush handle.  Feel they are just right the size for my hand. care .  Would definitely recommend!</li>
