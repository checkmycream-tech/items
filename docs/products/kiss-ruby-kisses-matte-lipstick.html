            <li>But I love this brand.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous - it&#x27;s exactly the shade I was looking for, but...</li>
            <li>The ruby kisses is just as good and gives off more color and has a better variety of colors than some of those high end brands.</li>
            <li>Its a bit drying and can come off easy</li>
            <li>and it is greasy and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>its midnight black best matte I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Not only did my lipstick arrive early, but it was flawless.</li>
            <li>VERY purple, Smooth to go on, etc.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and stays on for the whole day:))</li>
            <li>But worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>Good quality and highly pigmented especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Pretty, opaque color.  </li>
            <li>and I love it only had to apply twice and</li>
            <li>This is the exact shade I&#x27;ve been looking for</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color, no strong smell and will suit any skin tone.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and will definitely buy another one as they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>fast shipping too</li>
            <li>I got blackism and its really matte</li>
            <li>The purple really pops when your my complexion.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>truly shade as shown with great coverage..has taken a few tries..</li>
            <li>Long lasting and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Will dry your lips, but that&#x27;s expec and its worth it.</li>
            <li>Id definitely buy this again once it runs out and in many other colors!</li>
            <li>I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be a true matte bc</li>
            <li>I had to reapply several times during the night so I could maintain the rich dark color.</li>
            <li>The only way to keep it on and get the deep rich purple it depicts is the add a blue chapstick base coat and add a sealant on top.</li>

            <li> looks great on my lips</li>
            <li> I like it I got lavender, no pic but got compliments. Its a bit drying and can come off easy but that&#x27;s mostlipsticks. Plan to get more</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick, but it is not matte, it is opaque finish, that and it is greasy and comes off easily. The only way to keep it on and get the deep rich purple it depicts is the add a blue chapstick base coat and add a sealant on top.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Very pigmented and stays on for the whole day:))</li>
            <li> Pretty, opaque color.  Just wish it stayed on better. Got a ton of women asking where I got this shade.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s none like ruby kiss...fast shipping too</li>
            <li> I have paid up to $30 for lime crime and other products. The ruby kisses is just as good and gives off more color and has a better variety of colors than some of those high end brands. And on ebay you can find them even cheaper than here on Amazon.  Either way it&#x27;s a great product and it makes for a BEAUTIFUL ombre lip when you use multiple colors.</li>

            <li> Not only did my lipstick arrive early, but it was flawless. I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be a true matte bc i&#x27;ve had my share of let downs when it came down to matte colors. But I love this brand. If ur hesistant about purchasing, don&#x27;t be.</li>
