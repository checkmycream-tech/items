            <li>Definitely a great product.</li>
            <li>but I got it for a great price from this seller.  </li>

            <li>I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray!</li>
            <li>The best part is the UV protection, it&#x27;s worth the price for that alone as most hairsprays don&#x27;t offer it.</li>
            <li>Good for fine hair as it&#x27;s lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and feel of this product</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>

            <li>and I love the scent it puts out.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite hairsprays ever.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this through birch box and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but still keeps hair in place and if you need to brush it out to restyle, you can!</li>
            <li>I truly love the Serge Normant Meta Luxe Hair Spray.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Best hair spray ever, my hair is short and it pikes</li>
            <li>love this hair spray, always part of my routine and washes out easy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a light hold, so don&#x27;t expect miracles if you have an architectural &#x27;do.</li>
            <li>It smells great and has strong hold while maintaining natural flow and body without looking shiny.</li>
            <li>It costs a little more, but an absolutely wonderful hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I first received it in my Birch Box and had to reorder some soon after as I ditched my full sized hair spray for the mini travel version.</li>
            <li>it right up.</li>
            <li>The very fine spray is better than any hair spray I&#x27;ve found because it doesn&#x27;t make my blond/grey hair look stiff.</li>
            <li>This spray smells great, and holds styles in place without making your hair feel sticky or hard.</li>
            <li>While it is true that it doesn&#x27;t have the strongest hold, it keeps your hair looking natural and is never crunchy.</li>
            <li>Leaves no residue; brushes out easily; holds hair securely yet hair never looks stiff.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair spray.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff, the hold is more natural.</li>
            <li>Little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>The spray is very fine and doesn&#x27;t go on your hair in a thick, wet coat.  </li>

            <li> I love this hairspray.  I love how it feels when it goes on and I love the scent it puts out.  When this can is out I will def be buying another!

            <li> I received a sample of this through birch box and fell in love with it. It holds hair piece by piece instead of a clump. It&#x27;s light, but still keeps hair in place and if you need to brush it out to restyle, you can!</li>

            <li> This hairspray is usually very expensive but I got it for a great price from this seller.  It smells amazing!!  The hold is....alright.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff, the hold is more natural.</li>
