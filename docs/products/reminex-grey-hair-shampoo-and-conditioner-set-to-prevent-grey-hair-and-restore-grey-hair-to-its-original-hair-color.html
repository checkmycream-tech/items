            <li>Very good products you see the results in days.</li>
            <li>but I was very impressed with this product and have ordered more.</li>
            <li>This product being natural is the perfect compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went back to using shampoos and conditioners that helped my silvering hair look beautiful the way it is...</li>
            <li>It smells great and is simple to use.</li>
            <li>I still have a full bottle as my hair is fine ,and one shampoo is all i used.</li>
            <li>I believe it takes awhile and each of our body reacts on each product differently it might be effective to some</li>
            <li>I was skepitcal at first</li>
            <li>Will finish 3rd bottle n hope for better result</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product steadily since first starting on it several years ago, and it works great at maintaining color, as well.</li>
            <li>but it seems that is really working</li>
            <li>It is not a drastic change but definately not as much gray.</li>
            <li>Lets see in the next few months if there are good results</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a cure all, it won&#x27;t turn Ed Asner into Bradley Cooper; but it works decent.</li>
            <li>I used this product and it returned my hair to its normal color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any new gray hair coming out.  </li>

            <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband who is suffering from gray hair at early age. I don&#x27;t see any big results but I noticed since he started using this shampoo I don&#x27;t see any new gray hair coming out.  I believe it takes awhile and each of our body reacts on each product differently it might be effective to some but to others is not. Lets see in the next few months if there are good results and I will give an update on that. I am reordering soon.</li>
            <li> Used this for one month and don&#x27;t see any noticeable results.  Ended up coloring my hair instead with one of those shampoo-in color.</li>
            <li> Very good products you see the results in days. I was skepitcal at first but it seems that is really working</li>
            <li> Did not see any difference.</li>
            <li> after 2 mths, i  washed my hair evry day i did not see any change in my gray hair at all.</li>
            <li> Big waste of money.  It doesn&#x27;t do what it proposes to do.  I saw no change whatsoever.  It&#x27;s a ripoff.</li>
            <li> I had solid graying over my temples (silver white), really my only gray hair area. I used this product and it returned my hair to its normal color. It doesn&#x27;t work instantly, but over the course of several weeks. I can only speak for myself, my experience. I&#x27;ve used this product steadily since first starting on it several years ago, and it works great at maintaining color, as well. Does exactly what it purports to do, which is almost too hard to believe (I was originally skeptical).</li>
            <li> One star so far.&lt;br /&gt;Starting my 3rd bottle but no results noted not even 5%. Noticed also hair loss. Will finish 3rd bottle n hope for better result</li>
            <li> I suspect the 5-star reviewer is a plant.  I didn&#x27;t expect this product to work, and it didn&#x27;t.  I saw no change in the amount of grey hair I have after using an entire bottle everyday until it ran out.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS JUNK UNLESS YOU WANT TO TROW MONEY AWAY .  I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW THESE COMPANYS STAY IN BIZ  IT SCHOULD BE A CRIME TO SELL THIS SHAMPOO AND CLAIM IT WORKS  . KEEP YOUR MONEY  AND DONT AND I MEAN DONT BUY THIS SCAM POO  OH I MEAN SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> I used  tow bottle of this shampo but it&#x27; did not cover my gray hair is look like same the last time</li>
            <li> Everyone wants to hold onto their youth as long as they can. When I got a gray hair, I started looking for answers. This isn&#x27;t a cure all, it won&#x27;t turn Ed Asner into Bradley Cooper; but it works decent. My mom went gray early and I am proud to say I have not seen any new gray hair, thick and dark as ever. Lets hope it stays this way.</li>
            <li> I tried the shampoo daily as directed for 2+ months now.  All I can say is It does not work.</li>
            <li> fantastic&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hair the color I want it to be</li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t help even 0% to restore my hair color. I tried for 3 weeks, once every day, but it didn&#x27;t  do for what it advertised.</li>
            <li> This shampoo just didn&#x27;t do the trick in eradicating gray hair for me. I went back to using shampoos and conditioners that helped my silvering hair look beautiful the way it is...</li>
            <li> I have been using for almost three months and have noticed a change. I took before and after photos so I could check if it did anything. My wife also commented that it appears to be not as gray. I also stopped using a hair dryer. I leave the shampoo in for at least two or three minutes then rinse. It is not a drastic change but definately not as much gray. I will continue to use as I do not want to be using any type of hair dye.</li>
            <li> I too was skeptical about this product, but at the age of 31 with my hair rapidly graying I had to do something. I did not want use the conventional over the counter hair coloring due to the chemicals. This product being natural is the perfect compromise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has given me my swagger back, yes I said it, my swagger is back! My graying hair had me feeling very insecure all time, especially when getting my hair cut at the barbershop. You do have to keep using it though, or the grays will start to rear their ugly heads again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be forewarned that this product can get a bit messy in the sink if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> had no effect at all !</li>
            <li> made my hair sticky,and gommy ,and my hair felt unclean. Will not buy the product again. I still have a full bottle as my hair is fine ,and one shampoo is all i used.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical at first but I was very impressed with this product and have ordered more. It changed my gray roots back to black my original hair color! It smells great and is simple to use. This time I&#x27;m ordering both the shampoo and conditioner. And YES I&#x27;m an actual, non-paid customer! MRS. T..</li>
