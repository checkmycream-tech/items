            <li>It is effective and safe.  </li>
            <li>I loved the original blade.</li>
            <li>the feet.&lt;br /&gt;they leave your feet very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and does a great job.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;r cary it any more</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>But for those that DO use the emery pads, you&#x27;ll want to know that you won&#x27;t get as many as promised in the product description.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try the platinum blade refills, and hope that they are better.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it more than I do.</li>
            <li>I love my ped egg.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and nothing works better.</li>
            <li>This product is the best one around for getting rid of those rough bottoms of your feet,  they are so nice and smooth after you finish with it</li>
            <li>That said, this works better and faster on my calluses than my genuine Ped Egg</li>
            <li>You should not sell these as Ped Egg refills if they do not even fit the original product!</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit as well, and fall out of the holder.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, to enjoy your at home pedicure.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Not so much any more.  </li>
            <li>Sooner or later Improving Lifestyles Inc. will start do a better job of picking their suppliers!</li>
            <li>I have ordered refills several times as I have tried several foot care products and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Get it at walgreens those are sharp and effective</li>
            <li>We finally needed to order more refills and what a difference it makes to have new blades!</li>
            <li>I would buy them again,women aren&#x27;t the only one&#x27;s who should want smooth feet.</li>
            <li>Really upset.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the whole blade section is included, so I didn&#x27;t have to handle the blade or worry about it falling out.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to buy the whole thing again.</li>
            <li>They cost the same as we paid for the original Ped Egg with one blade and 2 emery pads.  </li>
            <li>, if it works better, why did I mark it down a star?  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t normally review a &#x27;skin&#x27; product because,</li>
            <li>The one I threw out that I used for a few years worked better than the replacement blade.</li>
            <li>They seem reasonably sharp, and fit the Ped Egg.  </li>
            <li>The blades dulled after one use whereas the original Ped Egg product used to last for multiple pedicures.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, because I *never* used the emery pads that came with my real Ped Egg.  </li>
            <li>I compared them to an old blade</li>
            <li>emery pads are very helpful also for smoothing feet and rough heels.</li>
            <li>I love the Ped Egg and the original blade that came with it, but was disappointed with the refills.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades are sooo dull, they are duller than the worn out original blades I was trying to replace.</li>
            <li>Blades are not sharp enough and I get regular pedicures professionally.</li>

            <li> Blades are not sharp enough and I get regular pedicures professionally.</li>
            <li> They last a long time, but getting 3 for the price of one, works for me.  </li>
            <li> I really like using the Ped Egg but the blades get dull.  </li>
            <li> Not clear if these are OEM or aftermarket.</li>
            <li> Complete Waste of Money !</li>
            <li> Would have preferred the blades to be white like our Ped Egg instead of black, but we bought them to use and not to look at.</li>

            <li> Nothing like I expected.  </li>
            <li> and they were so sharp that I had to empty the Ped Egg after just a couple of minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several Ped Eggs usually for about $10 each.  </li>
            <li> I would return them but not worth the gas.</li>
            <li> The refills where black in color not white and as dull as could be.</li>
            <li> They are black, not as shown on the website.  </li>
            <li> but this is still odd topic to discuss.</li>
            <li> ODDLY enough, the blade that came with the Ped Egg IN THE PACKAGING was dull as could be!  </li>
            <li> waste your money on these blades they are duller than the ones you&#x27;d probably be replacing</li>
            <li> I bought a ped egg for my wife a few years ago with some refills.</li>
            <li> I bought that few years ago from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> These do not fit my ped egg.  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t believe all the dead skin that comes off.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money .</li>
            <li> If you have dead skin with separation anxiety, kiss it goodbye with just a few strokes of the portable cheese-grater.  </li>
            <li> never fit well</li>
            <li> These Refills 1 did not fit the ped egg.</li>
            <li> Clearly other buyers have had issues with receiving dull blades in their order.</li>
            <li> .....stay away from at least the black blades.</li>
            <li> 2 were dull and would not scrape the dead skin.</li>
            <li> In past just  got my refills at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> IN middle of snow storm roads are bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the black refills that are horrible or just the refills in general but the blades are incredibly dull</li>
            <li> Very dull.  </li>
            <li> have very hard time finding replacements - have to order them online - very inconvenient for a product I expect to find at my local Walmart or Walgreens</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure who is at fault for the fake blades, but don&#x27;t let that stop you from ordering!  </li>
            <li> so here are the gory details.  </li>
            <li> Crazy.  </li>
            <li> If you get a fake blade (and you&#x27;ll know it immediately because you could rub it on your foot for hours and get nothing but a sore wrist), just file a claim with Amazon!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used the Ped egg for years now and these refills are the worst.</li>
            <li> I have awful calluses on my heels and on the balls of my feet.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I buy these every 3-4 months. Very sturdy and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I ordered replacement pedi egg blades for my pedi egg and even though the ad shows the blades as wnite in a white and blue cardboard case covered in plastic, what I got was something called Pedi Egg for men and they came in a cardboard box. The refills where black in color not white and as dull as could be. These were completely useless and you will have better results using the emery pads than the refills.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money on these blades they are duller than the ones you&#x27;d probably be replacing</li>
            <li> I bought a ped egg for my wife a few years ago with some refills. We finally needed to order more refills and what a difference it makes to have new blades! Change blades often and it works wonderfully. Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> great,I love them,helps keep my feet smooth!! I would buy them again,women aren&#x27;t the only one&#x27;s who should want smooth feet.</li>
            <li> I bought that few years ago from Walgreens. They don&#x27;r cary it any more and i love it. SO i was happy to find it here even cheaper.</li>
            <li> YOU MAY RETHINK YOUR PRODUCT,I NOW HAVE 9 BLADES THAT I DON&#x27;T NEED . Just THE SANDPAPER.Last time I buy.</li>
            <li> These do not fit my ped egg.  Are the refills a knock off??? Really upset. You should not sell these as Ped Egg refills if they do not even fit the original product!</li>
            <li> This item didn&#x27;t come in Ped Egg packaging. It came in a generic-looking package and appears to be a knockoff. The blades dulled after one use whereas the original Ped Egg product used to last for multiple pedicures. There is definitely a difference in quality between this item and the ones we purchase in a retail store.</li>
            <li> Complete Waste of Money !&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sooo dull, they are duller than the worn out original blades I was trying to replace.</li>
            <li> Pet eggs are perfect for when you can&#x27;t make it to the solon.</li>
            <li> This product is the best one around for getting rid of those rough bottoms of your feet,  they are so nice and smooth after you finish with it and you can&#x27;t believe all the dead skin that comes off.</li>
            <li> We had been looking for refills for our Ped Egg for a while.  Finally found them here online with 3 blades and 3 replacement emery pads.  They cost the same as we paid for the original Ped Egg with one blade and 2 emery pads.  Good deal.  Would have preferred the blades to be white like our Ped Egg instead of black, but we bought them to use and not to look at.</li>
            <li> unfortuantely the bog was labeled Ped Egg Refills, but did not contain them.  Inside was a workout DVD set, not the refills I needed and had ordered.</li>
            <li> While this is billed as Ped Egg Platinum Refills, it&#x27;s TeleBrand.  That said, this works better and faster on my calluses than my genuine Ped Egg ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if it works better, why did I mark it down a star?  Because there were supposed to be 3 emery pads, but there were only 2.  This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, because I *never* used the emery pads that came with my real Ped Egg.  But for those that DO use the emery pads, you&#x27;ll want to know that you won&#x27;t get as many as promised in the product description.</li>
            <li> In past just  got my refills at Walgreens. IN middle of snow storm roads are bad so thought I would order on line . Prompt delivery here with in two days . I used it already this uAM . Disappointed. Blades are not sharp enough and I get regular pedicures professionally. Did not shave skin off heel well at all . Waste of my money . I get them next time at Walgreens No where on box did it say Ped Egg Brand name product . Get it at walgreens those are sharp and effective</li>
            <li> I have used the Ped egg for years now and these refills are the worst. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the black refills that are horrible or just the refills in general but the blades are incredibly dull.....stay away from at least the black blades. They are a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several Ped Eggs usually for about $10 each.  They last a long time, but getting 3 for the price of one, works for me.  It&#x27;s the whole blade section is included, so I didn&#x27;t have to handle the blade or worry about it falling out.</li>
            <li> These are sold as Ped Egg platinum refills.  They are black, not as shown on the website.  They seem reasonably sharp, and fit the Ped Egg.  Not clear if these are OEM or aftermarket.</li>
            <li> Clearly other buyers have had issues with receiving dull blades in their order. I ordered the Ped Egg on Amazon and the order was completed by Improving Lifestyles Inc..  ODDLY enough, the blade that came with the Ped Egg IN THE PACKAGING was dull as could be!  But I also ordered the replacement platinum blades, which came unpackaged (in just a box) and they were so sharp that I had to empty the Ped Egg after just a couple of minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure who is at fault for the fake blades, but don&#x27;t let that stop you from ordering!  If you get a fake blade (and you&#x27;ll know it immediately because you could rub it on your foot for hours and get nothing but a sore wrist), just file a claim with Amazon!  Sooner or later Improving Lifestyles Inc. will start do a better job of picking their suppliers!</li>
            <li> have very hard time finding replacements - have to order them online - very inconvenient for a product I expect to find at my local Walmart or Walgreens (hint)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t normally review a &#x27;skin&#x27; product because, well it&#x27;s gross.  But hey, I like to help out so here are the gory details.  These blades and this product is amazing at what it does.  If you have dead skin with separation anxiety, kiss it goodbye with just a few strokes of the portable cheese-grater.  I have wide feet and shoes never fit well so I have callouses that are, well, they bug me.  Not so much any more.  There, I did it - great product but this is still odd topic to discuss.</li>
            <li> I ordered replacement blades, and the ones I got looked absolutely perfect, but there was one problem.  They didn&#x27;t fit.  They didn&#x27;t latch onto the handle.  I compared them to an old blade and I could not see a difference in size or shape, but they just didn&#x27;t work.  Crazy.  I&#x27;ll try the platinum blade refills, and hope that they are better.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I have used the ped egg for years. It makes the job easier. My wife uses it more than I do.</li>
            <li> I love the Ped Egg and the original blade that came with it, but was disappointed with the refills.  They don&#x27;t fit as well, and fall out of the holder.</li>
            <li> Very dull.  Nothing like I expected.  I loved the original blade. The one I threw out that I used for a few years worked better than the replacement blade.</li>
            <li> ped egg is great for callouses on feet. emery pads are very helpful also for smoothing feet and rough heels.</li>
            <li> These are great for the feet.&lt;br /&gt;they leave your feet very smooth feeling. I would recommend them to anyone that needs to work on the bottoms of their feet on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I find this to be one of the best foot care products on the market.  It is effective and safe.  I have ordered refills several times as I have tried several foot care products and this is by far the best.  I would recommend this product, to enjoy your at home pedicure.</li>
            <li> I really like using the Ped Egg but the blades get dull.  Blade refills are great so you don&#x27;t have to buy the whole thing again.</li>
            <li> Platinum refills ? Used maybe. These Refills 1 did not fit the ped egg. 2 were dull and would not scrape the dead skin. I would return them but not worth the gas.</li>
            <li> I love my ped egg. I use it all the time and nothing works better. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have awful calluses on my heels and on the balls of my feet.  The Ped Egg does effectively remove them.  You do have to change the blades from time to time.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these every week.  The product arrived on time and in good condition with a &#x27;lemon&#x27; warranty in case one was defective.  So far, so good.</li>
