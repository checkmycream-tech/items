    <ol>
            <li>Unilever has discontinued this wonderful product and I cannot find out why.  </li>
            <li>Best product ever for removing makeup and even eye makeup without irritation!  </li>
            <li>Great service!</li>
            <li>Used for 10 years and the best!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly like that.  </li>
            <li>The best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Very nice!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It takes the mascara off really good.</li>
            <li>It does smell good though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have loved St. Ives products for years.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Purchased 3 tubes and am so glad that I have a supply until I can find a substitute product!  </li>
            <li>I use a lot of St Ives products because the quality never disappoints and I love this one too!</li>
            <li>You need to rub it on and use a warm washcloth or cotton pad to rub away the makeup.  </li>
            <li>It also works nicely on my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>The formula is gentle with lots of plant extracts, so it is wonderful for my picky skin.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good buy and works fine.</li>
            <li>A very good product and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve ordered this before and gotten three tubes.  </li>
            <li>I love the product (which has been discontinued), but not at that price.  </li>
            <li>I love the formula and the fact it is not abrasive to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li>So thrilled it is available through amazon:).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what much more I can say that hasn&#x27;t been said already.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Now I wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of makeup remover, and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>It is gental on the face and easily removes dirt, face and eye makeup WITHOUT any irratation.</li>
            <li>Very mild.</li>
            <li>This is the best, most gentle facial cleanser that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is light, non-greasy and removes even waterproof mascara as well as make-up.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, it is very gentle and very mild.</li>
            <li>This is a very creamy face cleanser and it feel very good in the facial skin.  </li>
            <li>but I can say it does clean to rest of the face</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t clean heavier, longer wear make up like Revlon, L&#x27;Oreal, Cover Girl, Maybelline, etc etc.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and washes off well leaving your face feeling clean without dryness.</li>
            <li>This particular cleanser is a light cream, fragrance free, easily washing off makeup, oil, and dirt.  </li>
            <li>Very rich and smooth and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for at lease 20 years and its mild on my skin and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed having this Swiss formula makeup remover which I could not find it anymore where I live.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin, leaves it soft and moisturized and has a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My skin does not dry out using this, in fact, it&#x27;s more \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and does not burn the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped very fast also.</li>
            <li>First of al, on the website, it appeared to get 3 in a pkg  </li>
            <li>I really like this creamy makeup remover!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>However, other than it&#x27;s misleading name and description, this is a nice gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not just any certain brand that this stuff doesn&#x27;t agree with.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper to buy this in the store.</li>
            <li>, I really don&#x27;t need a moisturizer after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin ready for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have searched and tried many other products and none have worked as well as this St Ives.</li>
            <li>Since this has happened, the photo has been changed and there is a special note telling you that it&#x27;s only one tube.  </li>
            <li>I have used more expensive products but just wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if it has been discontinued by St. Ives.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>Sorry when heard it was discontinued.. was happy to find it on Amazon....</li>
            <li>I just use their green tea gel cleanser which works a lot better.</li>
            <li>will be buying a new facewash today.</li>
            <li>St. Ives dropped this product and instead, instituted a new cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The new cleanser burns the eyes, it is too foamy and never quite rinses completely off.  </li>
            <li>Many other eye makeup removers have burned my eyes but this one is gentle and does the job for way less money than others</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft as it washes.&lt;br /&gt;Never leaves my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>When I found the St. Ives makeup remover on Amazon at a reasonable price I was eager to order it and got six tubes to last me until the end of the year.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of its all natural claims and the word \\&quot;effortless\\&quot; in its description.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and have oily skin and have been using this make-up remover for many years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, as most places only carry the scrub, so order plenty here!</li>
            <li>It cleans the face gently, leaves no residue and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and my skin is never dry</li>
            <li>I have very dry mature skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I tried some a friend has and even she complained of the same failure of this product to clean and it&#x27;s not like her make up was set with cement, so please!!</li>
            <li> It seems no matter how much I wash my hands after using other brands, I always get one of those sharp pieces under my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> and this is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> and this product cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> Now we just use extra virgin olive oil on cotton and swipe off our faces, then wash with the St. Ives green tea acne facial wash.</li>
            <li> I am going to try other St. Ives products.</li>
            <li> I like this facial cleanser because it does not contain any of those small sharp pieces of of peach shell like other brands do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much useless on all counts.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave a residue like other brands with the creamy texture, like Ponds.  </li>
            <li> Of course I don&#x27;t pretend that this is due to St Ives</li>
            <li> My eyes just look smeary black after washing.  </li>
            <li> Just slightly smudged.</li>
            <li> Tried other products but was not pleased with them.</li>
            <li> have to be a little suspicious of reviews that claim this product works at all.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find in local drug stores now</li>
            <li> I like the thickness of this face wash, I have been using it 2x a day for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> wrong - you only get one.  </li>
            <li> and I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> Last year I started to see that it was difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not remove my eye makeup as the previous did.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years for removing eye makeup and was so disappointed when all my local pharmacies stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> What a rip-off at $9.75 (I believe)</li>
            <li> and I have tried dozens of expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> To bad that I can&#x27;t get it anymore.</li>
            <li> It is too bad it got discontinued.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed -</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Do not buy this product. Dries up my skin and doesn&#x27;t remove ANY makeup..at all! horrible. will be buying a new facewash today.</li>
            <li> I have searched and tried many other products and none have worked as well as this St Ives. I continue being a fan.</li>
            <li> Even though the picture shows 3, this is only ONE bottle in this order. It is much cheaper to buy this in the store. Otherwise, this is a great product. I have super sensitive skin and this is the only cleanser I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, it is very gentle and very mild. I remove my eye make up with eye make up remover so I cannot tell if this would do the trick but I can say it does clean to rest of the face well. I like the thickness of this face wash, I have been using it 2x a day for the past 3 years. Not tested on animals and contains no animal ingredients as well.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, the photo that accompanied it was of three tubes.  Ok, I&#x27;ve ordered this before and gotten three tubes.  This time ... wrong - you only get one.  I plan on returning the item.  Since this has happened, the photo has been changed and there is a special note telling you that it&#x27;s only one tube.  I love the product (which has been discontinued), but not at that price.  Very disappointed - I felt like I was had.</li>
            <li> I have been using a liquid eye makeup remover.  This is not a substitute for that since it is for the face.  It is messier as well and requires rinsing. Still, it works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the 1990s. I love the formula and the fact it is not abrasive to my skin.  I was horrified when they&lt;br /&gt;took it off the market.  I use it every night and my skin is never dry, I really don&#x27;t need a moisturizer after washing my face.  However, I do use a St Ives product to moisturize.  I am glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li> Sorry when heard it was discontinued.. was happy to find it on Amazon.... i will buy again.... would recommend to others... have used for years...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and can no longer purchase it through our local stores.  So thrilled it is available through amazon:). Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the four St Ives product I&#x27;ve reviewed. Don&#x27;t know what much more I can say that hasn&#x27;t been said already. I recommend all St Ives products for the face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  To bad that I can&#x27;t get it anymore.</li>
            <li> First of al, on the website, it appeared to get 3 in a pkg  but that was not what I got  So I ordered 4 thinking I wood receive thinking I would receive 12 tubes instead I only got 4.  What a rip-off at $9.75 (I believe) each  when I find them in store for only $2.75 each</li>
            <li> Unilever has discontinued this wonderful product and I cannot find out why.  I never could find it on the shelf and when I did, I always purchased all that I could.  Best product ever for removing makeup and even eye makeup without irritation!  Purchased 3 tubes and am so glad that I have a supply until I can find a substitute product!  Great service!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Very rich and smooth and leaves my skin feeling very soft. I am going to try other St. Ives products.</li>
            <li> Where can you buy? Used for 10 years and the best!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product but I think the mfg has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of makeup remover, and this one is the best. I have been using it for at lease 20 years and its mild on my skin and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It takes the mascara off really good. Luv it!</li>
            <li> It removes eye makeup without irritation but it&#x27;s a bit greasy for my liking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product! It cleans the face gently, leaves no residue and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. Leaves your skin ready for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is a very creamy face cleanser and it feel very good in the facial skin.  I highly recommend it if it has been discontinued by St. Ives.</li>
            <li> I like this facial cleanser because it does not contain any of those small sharp pieces of of peach shell like other brands do.  It seems no matter how much I wash my hands after using other brands, I always get one of those sharp pieces under my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> If your definition of \\&quot;make up\\&quot; is some lip gloss and talc powder on your face, yeah, you can give 5 stars. It just doesn&#x27;t clean heavier, longer wear make up like Revlon, L&#x27;Oreal, Cover Girl, Maybelline, etc etc. I tried some a friend has and even she complained of the same failure of this product to clean and it&#x27;s not like her make up was set with cement, so please!! Can people just tell the truth??? Now we just use extra virgin olive oil on cotton and swipe off our faces, then wash with the St. Ives green tea acne facial wash.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years for removing eye makeup and was so disappointed when all my local pharmacies stopped carrying it.  I&#x27;ve come to learn it has been discontinued so when I found this online, I stocked up!!  Many other eye makeup removers have burned my eyes but this one is gentle and does the job for way less money than others and I have tried dozens of expensive brands.  The reviews that say it does not work at all are because you can&#x27;t just rub it on and try and rinse with water, that will not work!  You need to rub it on and use a warm washcloth or cotton pad to rub away the makeup.  Works perfectly like that.  Does not dry out your skin, leaves it soft and moisturized and has a pleasant fragrance.  Very gentle and does not burn the eyes.  Highly recommend this product.  Just a shame that St. Ives felt the need to discontinue it and they have not come out with a comparable product in its place.</li>
            <li> Does not remove my make-up whatsoever. It&#x27;s pretty much useless. I do not recommend purchasing it. I just use their green tea gel cleanser which works a lot better.</li>
            <li> This product is awsome. It is gental on the face and easily removes dirt, face and eye makeup WITHOUT any irratation. I can not find another product out there even close to this quality. It is very hard to find in local drug stores now and I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> It takes my make-up off. Makes my skin soft as it washes.&lt;br /&gt;Never leaves my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;Well buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this makeup remover for 20 plus years. It takes off mascara and everything else and doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes. Very mild. I used to get it at Walmart, but they stopped carrying it.  I was very disappointed. Tried other products but was not pleased with them. When I found the St. Ives makeup remover on Amazon at a reasonable price I was eager to order it and got six tubes to last me until the end of the year.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of its all natural claims and the word \\&quot;effortless\\&quot; in its description.  After several uses, I can say with absolution that this does NOT remove any make up, or cleanse the skin for that matter.  I use either a tinted moisturizer or organic mineral make up.  Neither of which are removed from my face after washing with this product. I wear regular Maybelene eye liner, and Physicians Formula mascara, (neither of which are even waterproof) so it&#x27;s not just any certain brand that this stuff doesn&#x27;t agree with.  And as for removing eye make up- this product doesn&#x27;t even *touch* it.  My eyes just look smeary black after washing.  I always use a toner after cleansing.  With this product, my cotton pad from the toner is always covered in make up.  It&#x27;s pretty much useless on all counts.  It does smell good though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be a little suspicious of reviews that claim this product works at all.</li>
            <li> This cleanser does NOT remove makeup as it says it will on the bottle. After washing my face with it, all of my makeup was still there. Just slightly smudged. However, other than it&#x27;s misleading name and description, this is a nice gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really like this creamy makeup remover!  It also works nicely on my eye makeup. It does not leave a residue like other brands with the creamy texture, like Ponds.  I use a L&#x27;oreal toner after cleansing and no makeup is on the cotton ball.  My skin does not dry out using this, in fact, it&#x27;s more \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;.  I use it morning and night.  I use a lot of St Ives products because the quality never disappoints and I love this one too!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and this product cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  Won&#x27;t use anything else.  Love It.</li>
            <li> This is the best, most gentle facial cleanser that I have ever used.  It is too bad it got discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  It is light, non-greasy and removes even waterproof mascara as well as make-up.  Last year I started to see that it was difficult to find.  I looked on the company&#x27;s web site and saw women writing into the company to complain.  St. Ives dropped this product and instead, instituted a new cleanser.  The women wrote reviews similar to my experience.  The new cleanser burns the eyes, it is too foamy and never quite rinses completely off.  I searched all over at discount stores and could not find this product.  I took a chance and looked on Amazon and there it was.  I have ordered this product twice and I don&#x27;t know what to do it Amazon drops it.  A very good product and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The best. I have used it for years. The last time I ordered I ordered a case. Now I wish I had ordered more. Please bring this product back. I have used more expensive products but just wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup remover. It works better than any other makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried so far. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It was shipped very fast also.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
            <li> I have loved St. Ives products for years.  You simply can&#x27;t beat the product quality for the price.  The formula is gentle with lots of plant extracts, so it is wonderful for my picky skin.  This particular cleanser is a light cream, fragrance free, easily washing off makeup, oil, and dirt.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, as most places only carry the scrub, so order plenty here!</li>
            <li> I have very dry mature skin and this cleanser was drying. Did not work for me at all&lt;br /&gt;Continued to use it for a couple of day and then returned it..</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and everyone tells me i look ten years younger than I actually am. Of course I don&#x27;t pretend that this is due to St Ives but when I cannot find it and use something else, I notice a visible difference in my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed having this Swiss formula makeup remover which I could not find it anymore where I live.  Nothing cleaned my face as this has&lt;br /&gt;before.  I will continue to order from you.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue this .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and have oily skin and have been using this make-up remover for many years and I have never had a problem with it breaking out my skin. It cleans well and washes off well leaving your face feeling clean without dryness. I think it&#x27;s a good buy and works fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this as it is a replacement for a similar item st Ives used to make. Unfortunately it does not remove my eye makeup as the previous did.</li>
