            <li>Highly recommend this great hair tool!!!!</li>
            <li>I have made my own since then and they work out much better.</li>
            <li>it is perfect and big tool, nice to work in extensions.</li>
            <li>so I was able to finish...</li>
            <li>I am glad this tool came on time and was as promised</li>
            <li>and I would order from this company again and look forward to seeing more products from them.....</li>
            <li>this item was just ok.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t picture a better tool for hair threading.</li>
            <li>Great shipping time, and the packaging in which it came was well taken care of and protected the looper, very well from bending.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>okay product</li>
            <li>Better than nothing</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love that you load &amp; can replace the wire.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite threader.</li>
            <li>BUT, this seller was easy to deal with and got me my item VERY QUICKLY!</li>
            <li>ordered a week ago, paid a great price, came new in envelope via post office.  </li>
            <li>The seller was quick to ship which was really nice.  </li>
            <li>You could easily just bend a wire and use that.</li>
            <li>I was very lucky that it did not cut deeper</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I imagine it will probably break soon as it bends fairly easy.</li>
            <li>The looper works fine, watch a youtube video to learn how to use it.  </li>
            <li>The cut fine but</li>
            <li>this product is fine</li>
            <li>I should have just stuck with and been happy with the one I bought at a local beauty supply.</li>
            <li>It does its job and its cheap.</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can make your own by simply using some dental floss.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to do by yourself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably worth just about the $2 it cost!</li>
            <li>This product serves its purpose, however the looper (metal piece at the top) is pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>great for using in the kitchen and outside works for everything you want heavy duty and works great</li>
            <li>I really think we should be able to leave zero stars.</li>
            <li>The did not ask any questions and where very helpful :)</li>
            <li>Very well made, better than the one I found in the stores and</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good product</li>
            <li>Cant really ask for anything else :)you can learn how to use it on youtube</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find a new one since I lost my old one.</li>
            <li>Broke really quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product broke the very first bead I put in my hair.  </li>
            <li>The dollar one I bought before with the wooden handle worked way better!</li>
            <li>many different styles feathers and colored hair all attach micro crimps easily.</li>
            <li>Great quality product, not cheap at all.</li>
            <li>ummmm it was worth it</li>
            <li>However the product is very cheaply made and broke within the first 15-30 minutes and couldn&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
            <li>The metal wire is very easily bent out of shape which can be a pain to bend back</li>
            <li>Very fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I tried this one first</li>
            <li>I will be using the needle from now on (which, despite my misgivings, was not difficult to use).</li>
            <li>I will not hesitate to make future purchases from Sexy Sparkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as in the picture, and for the price</li>
            <li>This tool is a life saver, it makes inserting the colored feather in your hair so much easier!  </li>
            <li>Made life sooo much easier!</li>
            <li>It brook the the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>THANKS!@  Can&#x27;t wait to use them to add feather extensions to client&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>she used to for the first time for extensions and the wire came out of the handle.</li>
            <li>I bought this item thinking that I was goin to need it, but i really dont, if you buy some feathers make sure that they come with a bead loader, so that you wont have to buy this extra.</li>
            <li>I would say I&#x27;ll get more, but mine is lasting very well, but when the time comes to get a new one, I&#x27;ll make sure it&#x27;s the exact same one again.</li>
            <li>It sort of looks like a good tool but it looks very weak and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The picture is very misleading.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>much cheaper here.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much to say, just, that you get what you&#x27;re buying, period.</li>
            <li>so much I would</li>
            <li>The leading tip is capable of snagging hair strands when separation of strands is not desired for crochet braids.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Even stepped on it sometimes, still not broken.</li>
            <li>well made nice wood handle and wire thin and very easily fit threw crimps.&lt;br /&gt;still</li>
            <li>the other beading tools for the feather hair extensions are better, but i haven&#x27;t tried it for the tinsel yet.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE MONEY!!</li>
            <li>This simple little tool helped me get $1600 at an art fair last summer.</li>
            <li>However by first use the wire dislodged and sliced open</li>
            <li>This works better than the small plastic ones that come in the bead pack.</li>
            <li>It was   cheaply made and left me in the middle of applying extensions having to continue to tape it back   together.</li>
            <li>Almost like it was old and been in storage.  </li>
            <li>this thing works really well and is an easy way to put a tiny bead onto a small strand of hair without any problem at all.</li>
            <li>Large beads will fall down the whole thing so I must  place my finger to stop them from sliding completely off.</li>
            <li>I wrote them and they next day aired me a new one.</li>
            <li>Take small pieces of hair, but you will move quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>good price,  bad product,  broke  with one use</li>

            <li> Take small pieces of hair, but you will move quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> good price,  bad product,  broke  with one use</li>
            <li> This beader makes it very easy to load the beads onto, but the loop is very stiff and hard to loop the hair through.</li>
            <li> but probably won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The tool does not have a formed &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; at the end, it is just a big loop fixed into a small wooden handle.  </li>
            <li> youd  be crazy to thread the hair threw beads w/o this magic wand.</li>
            <li> it was NOT broken when recieved came a tad bit late</li>
            <li> The Microring Links Bead Loader, Looper and Threader arrived in a timely manner and works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I know other reviews said something about this pulling hair</li>
            <li> (sergers make the stitch that comprises most of your tee shirts) and I&#x27;m disappointed in this tool and would have been even if I was using it for hair beading.  </li>
            <li> We only used it a couple times, so we are not sure how well it holds up to repeated use.</li>
            <li> I have other loopers</li>
            <li> because I thought the needle, with the tiny metal clasp, would be hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Not worth even$1.</li>
            <li> IT LOOKS SIMILAR TO THE TOOL PICTURED, HOWEVER, THE LOOP IS CRAZY BIG  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Used this multiple times for my hair, still haven&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SAD IMITATION OF A SIMILAR PRODUCT THAT I THOUGHT</li>
            <li> Due to my disappointment in the product, the company did issue credit back to my account.</li>
            <li> I used this product for putting beads on thread as well as small braids of hair.</li>
            <li> Worked well for adding feathers to small bundles of hair.  </li>
            <li> You slide a crimping bead on the tool, pull a small amt of ear hair thru the loop, slide the bead onto the hair, thread your feather into the bead and then using pliers crimp the bead and walla, feathers attached.  </li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> This company ripped me off my item arrived kinda late because of the hurricane Sandy</li>
            <li> I wasted so much money on this terrible item.</li>
            <li> EVEN WHEN TWEAKED, THIS WIRE THING IS NO GOOD.  </li>

            <li> As I was in the middle of doing someone&#x27;s extensions it broke, I had an extra so I was able to finish...</li>
            <li> Got this to put feather extensions into my hair - I bought this and the metal needle : [[ASIN:B004O6ITPE Pulling Microneedle for Hair Extension Installation, Micro Links and Dread Maintenance]] because I thought the needle, with the tiny metal clasp, would be hard to use.  I tried this one first and when I pulled it back to thread the hair through the ring, it pulled my hair and tugged one of my strands out!  I was very unhappy about that.  I will be using the needle from now on (which, despite my misgivings, was not difficult to use).</li>
            <li> I am glad this tool came on time and was as promised and I would order from this company again and look forward to seeing more products from them.....</li>
            <li> It sucks. Don&#x27;t you daree buy this item. I wasted so much money on this terrible item. If I were you I would not ever buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I really think we should be able to leave zero stars. This product broke the very first bead I put in my hair.  Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I know other reviews said something about this pulling hair but honestly I had no problems whatsoever.     If you&#x27;ve ever used a needle threader it works on the same idea and it&#x27;s super easy to do by yourself. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The picture is very misleading. You are not going to get beads! I bought this for the beads not for the item itself. Honestly, you can make your own by simply using some dental floss. It works just as well and you won&#x27;t have to pay for shipping. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered the micro link loader hoping it would speed up the process. However it broke after   I put in the third or fourth micro bead. I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It was   cheaply made and left me in the middle of applying extensions having to continue to tape it back   together. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> youd  be crazy to thread the hair threw beads w/o this magic wand. it takes threading feathers threw hair in seconds.   dragon mama</li>
            <li> this item was just ok. the other beading tools for the feather hair extensions are better, but i haven&#x27;t tried it for the tinsel yet. it might work for that. This item didn&#x27;t come with the beads like i thought it did. BUT, this seller was easy to deal with and got me my item VERY QUICKLY! they did not \\&quot;rip\\&quot; me off or antyhing. so item&#x3D;not good. seller&#x3D;very good. :) hope this helps!</li>
            <li> this thing works really well and is an easy way to put a tiny bead onto a small strand of hair without any problem at all. great for applying beads for hair feathers or hair bling.</li>
            <li> The Microring Links Bead Loader, Looper and Threader arrived in a timely manner and works as expected.  It appears to be the same tool that is used for inserting feather extensions at the hair salon I visit.  I will not hesitate to make future purchases from Sexy Sparkles.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY FROM PRO BEAUTY WHOLESALERS, THEY TAKE YOUR $$ AND RUN. THEY RIP YOU OFF!!!!!!!!!!!! The item is goOd I have purchased before from someone else, however do not buy from PRO BEAUTY WHOLESALERS.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great but the company iis even better. I got my package in the mail and it seemed to be tampered with. I wrote them and they next day aired me a new one. The did not ask any questions and where very helpful :)</li>
            <li> The looper works fine, watch a youtube video to learn how to use it.  But it does not come with the Beads as shown, this is somewhat deceiving as it is show with the beads. You could easily just bend a wire and use that.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. Very well made, better than the one I found in the stores and much cheaper here.Very fast shipment. Thank you.</li>
            <li> You have to have one of these if you are going to put beads or feathers in your hair and this does the job for a good price.</li>
            <li> The item itself came in a timely manner and looked quite nice. However by first use the wire dislodged and sliced open My hand ! Do not buy this item I was very lucky that it did not cut deeper then it did ! The cut fine but deep took about two weeks to heal !</li>
            <li> good price,  bad product,  broke  with one use</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking that I was goin to need it, but i really dont, if you buy some feathers make sure that they come with a bead loader, so that you wont have to buy this extra.</li>
            <li> Makes attaching microbeads to hair shaft neat and simple.  Inexpensive and easy to use.  Ideal for attaching feathers to hair.</li>
            <li> Helps out a lot for feathers!  Mine was a tad bit rusty.  Almost like it was old and been in storage.  But it works great!</li>
            <li> The metal wire is very easily bent out of shape which can be a pain to bend back but it still fits its purpose perfectly. I couldn&#x27;t picture a better tool for hair threading.</li>
            <li> Best way to do bead extensions. Take small pieces of hair, but you will move quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I ordered this threader for my extensions. The seller was quick to ship which was really nice.  However the product is very cheaply made and broke within the first 15-30 minutes and couldn&#x27;t be fixed. So I got rid of all three I bought. Why get used to using a tool that&#x27;s just going to break. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this is the best,....it was NOT broken when recieved came a tad bit late but i didnt mind. ummmm it was worth it</li>
            <li> Purchased this to put feathers in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  You just put the silicone bead on the threader, then put some hair through the threader &amp; pull the hair through the bead.  It works beautifully! :)</li>
            <li> I used this product for putting beads on thread as well as small braids of hair. It worked well, although the metal is a bit weak. Overall, it is a good product</li>
            <li> Great threader at a great price too. Very happy with the way this works, makes my job so much easier and I am happy about that.</li>
            <li> I was not going to use this tool for hair beading, even though I have done hair braiding and beading when I lived in STL.  I was going to use this as a tool to hide the thread tails that result from serged seams (sergers make the stitch that comprises most of your tee shirts) and I&#x27;m disappointed in this tool and would have been even if I was using it for hair beading.  It is made of thin cheap wire. The picture is misleading.  The tool does not have a formed &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; at the end, it is just a big loop fixed into a small wooden handle.  I should have just stuck with and been happy with the one I bought at a local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SAD IMITATION OF A SIMILAR PRODUCT THAT I THOUGHT I WAS PURCHASING. I NEED THIS AS A PULLING TOOL FOR WEAVES AND EXTENSIONS. THE PICTURE SHOWS THE TOOL I NEED, THE TOY THAT WAS SENT TO ME HAS NO FUNCTION AND IS NOT THE TOOL PICTURED.. IT LOOKS SIMILAR TO THE TOOL PICTURED, HOWEVER, THE LOOP IS CRAZY BIG  (KINDA LOOKS LIKE A TOPSY TAIL) AND CANNOT BE PULLED THROUGH OR UNDER ANYTHING WITHOUT TWEAKING WITH PLIERS. EVEN WHEN TWEAKED, THIS WIRE THING IS NO GOOD.  DO NOT WASTE MONEY!!</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much to say, just, that you get what you&#x27;re buying, period. Great shipping time, and the packaging in which it came was well taken care of and protected the looper, very well from bending. It&#x27;s exactly as in the picture, and for the price it&#x27;s great! Works like a charm, and it truly is my soul mate when it comes to applying my hair feathers. Great quality product, not cheap at all. I would say I&#x27;ll get more, but mine is lasting very well, but when the time comes to get a new one, I&#x27;ll make sure it&#x27;s the exact same one again. Highly recommend this great hair tool!!!!</li>
            <li> this makes putting feathers in my daughter&#x27;s hair a breeze!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it. I recommend it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Worked well for adding feathers to small bundles of hair.  We only used it a couple times, so we are not sure how well it holds up to repeated use.</li>
            <li> Broke after one use!  Beaded one braid, one time and the wire came apart. I have made my own since then and they work out much better.</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere for this item, now I have one!  It is made of good quality, even a nice decorative brass ring.</li>
            <li> This works well for pulling hair for the hair extentions and feathering for the plastic buds.  Great tool to use</li>
            <li> I love this it make it so easier to put beads on my daughter hair love it so much I would but this again</li>
            <li> Might work as a bead loader, but poorly made and worthless as a looper and threader.&lt;br /&gt;Probably worth just about the $2 it cost!</li>
            <li> great for using in the kitchen and outside works for everything you want heavy duty and works great okay product</li>
            <li> Broke really quickly.  Got 3 uses out of it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy - promised LOOPER and THREADER. got one.</li>
            <li> This tool is a life saver, it makes inserting the colored feather in your hair so much easier!  A must have if you like the feathers in your hair!</li>
            <li> This beader makes it very easy to load the beads onto, but the loop is very stiff and hard to loop the hair through. I have other loopers and I do like the ease of loading, so I do use it often.</li>
            <li> I love this feather threading tool! Made life sooo much easier! Great price, great product, and product arrived on time!</li>
            <li> You do NOT get the product pictured. What you get instead is a home made looking thing with regular wire that won&#x27;t even work as a looper.</li>
            <li> it is perfect and big tool, nice to work in extensions. I need it to use in a feather extension for my hair. that is great!</li>
            <li> What is this? This company ripped me off my item arrived kinda late because of the hurricane Sandy but this item is not Wat i ask for never again</li>
            <li> The leading tip is capable of snagging hair strands when separation of strands is not desired for crochet braids. Otherwise, it appears to be durable and functional.</li>
            <li> It brook the the first time I used it. It only cost 3$ so it&#x27;s not that big on a deal but it was junk. Not worth even$1.</li>
            <li> I use this to put my daughter&#x27;s beads on her hair. This product serves its purpose, however the looper (metal piece at the top) is pretty flimsy. I imagine it will probably break soon as it bends fairly easy. Nonetheless, it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> ordered a week ago, paid a great price, came new in envelope via post office.  THANKS!@  Can&#x27;t wait to use them to add feather extensions to client&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> well made nice wood handle and wire thin and very easily fit threw crimps.&lt;br /&gt;still using it after a year.&lt;br /&gt;so many different styles feathers and colored hair all attach micro crimps easily.</li>
            <li> bought this for my girlfriend and we did notice that it was very poorly built when we opened it but we didnt think it was going to be this bad. she used to for the first time for extensions and the wire came out of the handle. un usable now.</li>
            <li> It sort of looks like a good tool but it looks very weak and cheaply made. Better than nothing but probably won&#x27;t last long. The cap already fell off of one in the packaging.</li>
            <li> this product is fine I like how it pulls the hair through the looper on to the beads love it thanks</li>
            <li> Item broke after one use.</li>
            <li> I love that you load &amp; can replace the wire. I got this for applying beads to my daughter hair. This works better than the small plastic ones that come in the bead pack. Large beads will fall down the whole thing so I must  place my finger to stop them from sliding completely off.</li>
            <li> Used this multiple times for my hair, still haven&#x27;t broken. Even stepped on it sometimes, still not broken. BUY it.</li>
            <li> It does its job and its cheap. Cant really ask for anything else :)you can learn how to use it on youtube</li>
            <li> This is my favorite threader. I was so happy to find a new one since I lost my old one. I had to do the bending myself but that shouldn&#x27;t stop others from getting this item themselves.</li>
            <li> This simple little tool helped me get $1600 at an art fair last summer. If you ever need to put feathers in your own hair, or your friends, this is the tool to do it!</li>
            <li> Due to my disappointment in the product, the company did issue credit back to my account.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and works well. And this is a very good value for the price. I would definitely recommend this beader.</li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I tried putting beads on it. Piece of crap. The dollar one I bought before with the wooden handle worked way better!</li>
            <li> We use this tool for attaching decorative feathers to our groom dogs hair in place of hair bows.  You slide a crimping bead on the tool, pull a small amt of ear hair thru the loop, slide the bead onto the hair, thread your feather into the bead and then using pliers crimp the bead and walla, feathers attached.  So cute!</li>
            <li> Broke after two uses!</li>
