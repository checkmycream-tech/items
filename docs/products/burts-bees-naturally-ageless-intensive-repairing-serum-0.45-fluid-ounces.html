            <li>Good service.</li>
            <li>, it is my best serum ever, but when I bought it agin one week ago it wasn&#x27;t the original one,</li>
            <li>While I think that Burt&#x27;s Bees makes some great products, (I love the lip products)</li>
            <li>The anti-aging benefit is, I suppose, that it adds a great deal of moisture, which I found myself using it more on my elbows, knees and heels.  </li>
            <li>I bought this serum after reading so many great reviews here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about two years now, and really love it!</li>
            <li>Love this serum!</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>

            <li>One item which was part of a large collection of Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Product for a party Basket ( perfect ) Gift .</li>
            <li>Best of all is the price - very affordable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Burts Bess is good and if you care your skin, this could be a better choice.</li>
            <li>it smells nice and works</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and doesn&#x27;t smell &#x27;cosmetic&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked it - a lot -</li>
            <li>Maybe you could get the merchant I purchased them from to send me 2 more with good droppers.  </li>
            <li>I have found in the mornings when applying my makeup, I&#x27;m not using as much concealer around my nose which is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The serum feels nice</li>
            <li>Soaks into skin nicely</li>
            <li>Rose oil and organic jojoba oil were two of the oils I could use without exacerbating the problem.  </li>
            <li>makes my skin glow and feel alive, Amazon has the best price compared to CVS and Rite Aid</li>
            <li>is a great product, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This Burt&#x27;s Bee Naturally Ageless Serum is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Great product, just as described and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I call that a HUGE improvement in this amount of time!</li>
            <li>Love their products.</li>
            <li>I use two drops to cover my face and undereye area, and two more drops to cover my neck and chest.</li>
            <li>When I wake in the morning after using this, my skin has a healthy glow and</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I think the ones I do have look better.</li>
            <li>I normally love this product...</li>
            <li>and I love how moisturized my face feels.  </li>
            <li>But I couldn&#x27;t be sure because I didn&#x27;t have another bottle to compare it to at the time</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is a reputable manuf.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more when i run out.</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels after applying.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t much more than a lovely smelling blending of oils.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;d rather spend more on a product that does more.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I hope more fresher.</li>
            <li>Love Burts Bees products.</li>
            <li>Love it ....</li>
            <li>But I love it overnight.</li>
            <li>most)</li>
            <li>My skin really drinks this up and looks great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found an all-natural product that is cruelty-free/vegan,</li>
            <li>This serum is wonderful as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>sure weather they have changed the formula or not.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, didn&#x27;t work magic</li>
            <li>Love the refreshing smell also.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>While writing out what we spend a month, my husband was flabbergasted that I spend more on face care than my car.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product...</li>
            <li>They took more than a week to heal even after I stopped using the serum.</li>
            <li>Wish it had more of the pomogrante smell to it.</li>
            <li>I bought this one from amazon before and it was ok</li>
            <li>This is an excellent syrum, especially for the money.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better (and healthful)</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong but it&#x27;s not unpleasant, sometimes I even think it&#x27;s quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>first, I loved using just good ol&#x27;-fashioned olive oil, which was great in the middle of winter when my skin could get extra-dry.  </li>
            <li>I can see my skin becoming even more even.  </li>
            <li>My skin is dry and this is perfect, in the sun or under foundation.  </li>
            <li>I find that it works best for me in the winter when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m happy to have found an all natural product, and I just like it!</li>
            <li>Normally a good dropper will put out precisely the right amout.  </li>
            <li>I have taken very good care of my skin since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, light and fragrant.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I no longer feel dryness on my face, it gives my face a smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m happy to have found an all natural product, and I just like it!or items you can&#x27;t find in the store?  </li>
            <li>This way I can be pimple AND wrinkle free. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>After applying the serum to my face for a week, I&#x27;m glad to find that my face becomes glossy and smooth when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and I just love how smooth and supple it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily  </li>
            <li>But nothing can compare with this on because they are easy to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It shouldn&#x27;t flow out so easily.</li>
            <li>I love the naturally ageless day and night creams, and have had really good luck with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly glad I tried it since it led to the discovery that natural oils are superior to the products I was using.</li>
            <li>I have seen a definite improvement in skin tone and decrease in fine lines - and it smells good!</li>
            <li>Plus, its 100% natural and smells nice!</li>
            <li>The smell, I don&#x27;t care for and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes with my under eye and fine line areas.</li>
            <li>The fine lines are still there</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does sink into the skin quickly which I like.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging could be better...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great skin care product and it last quite a while</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>After that ran out, I started using my own combination of oils without seeing much difference.</li>
            <li>It keeps skin hydrated and oil free.</li>
            <li>When I first got this, I was thrilled (once I adjusted to the scent which is not bad but is distinctive).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for  three years, and love it so much!</li>
            <li>Love the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I use it at night after my face is clean</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how this goes - not overly impressed with first few weeks of use, however.</li>
            <li>so I removed one star since I prefer sweet smells.</li>
            <li>I love this product it really works though</li>
            <li>apply this onto my clean skin and then I follow it up with their super dreamy [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>no bad experiences with it.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the cost.</li>
            <li>serum has a medicinal/herbal scent that may be too strong for some people at first, but, after a couple of minutes, the scent not noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>and I love it, but this last time I receive it from Amazon, instead of the clean scent of tea tree oil, it smelled more like rancid cooking oil.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend. :))</li>
            <li>wonderful addition to their facial creams - day or night; perfect for normal or dry skin; young and/or mature skin</li>
            <li>It has greatly reduced the wrinkles around my eyes and seems to help with the dark circles.</li>
            <li>Bees can pretty much do no wrong in my book... great products, especially the lip balms.</li>
            <li>It does have a smell but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I use it more for maintenance and feel like occasional use works, but for skin more in need I would think daily use would show improvement over time based on my own experience.</li>
            <li>Because BB Naturally Ageless serum contained Rose oil as one of the first ingredients I tried it.  </li>
            <li>This really helps with the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It sits lightly on the skin, too, and really feel like it nourishes.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that everything is natural.  </li>
            <li>May be pricy but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I feel much better about using natural products.</li>
            <li>so worth the price.</li>
            <li>It helps me improve the skin condition, I use to have very day and wrinkled line on face, it gives the skin hydrating supply at night, I even put on the face during the day, Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bee for provide such good product.</li>
            <li>but I do feel that its worth it.</li>
            <li>I found this Burt&#x27;s Bees serum, in a clearance pile at a chain cosmetic store, and thought it would be worth checking it out for the price.  </li>
            <li>I think it is due to this and to good skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>I felt in love with this from the frist use; It leaves my skin soft and you can notice at the first glance.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts in the &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34; area which tends to get more oily, so I have to be SUPER careful when choosing anti-aging products, since so many of them are oily/high</li>
            <li>, my skin still feels soft and smooth when I wake up, and a fresh application for the day after the shower keeps it that way.  </li>
            <li>She likes it very much.</li>
            <li>am still new to the anti-aging products, so I haven&#x27;t tested verymany, but I can tell you that the Clinique products did nothing for me, and this showed very fast results that I am pleased with so far!</li>
            <li>(it is many different oils) for use during the day</li>
            <li>I paid full price at the drug store and in future will get from here and combine with another order for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;For everyone with dryer skin you may want to put a nightcream over top and put a drop or two in with your daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>lines&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- around the top of my upper lip&lt;br /&gt;- between the eyebrows</li>
            <li>I swear this is the same stuff that Clairens sells for way more money in the Department Stores.  </li>
            <li>and I love how my skin feels when I wake up the next morning.</li>
            <li>and this has really helped!  </li>
            <li>I find this to work better than many of the more expensive serums on the market.</li>
            <li>I use it year round because of the healthy glow my skin has, and how it virtually eliminates the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few years now and just Love how it makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>All positive feedback.</li>
            <li>N3161001, it already more than 3 years, too long.</li>
            <li>Before Amazon saved me and I was able to start using this product religiously, I was definitely starting to believe I was seeing some rapid &#x27;aging&#x27; in the mirror, as a year of some significant life changes</li>
            <li>Before Amazon saved me and I was able to start using this product religiously, I was definitely starting to believe I was seeing some rapid &#x27;aging&#x27; in the mirror, as a year of some significant life changes</li>
            <li>It made me wonder about the supplier, since I&#x27;ve read that tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t go rancid; it just becomes less effective.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this serum also works to calm my skin.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and oily skin and have found that it is too oily</li>
            <li>/&gt;And this serum is certainly helping.  </li>
            <li>On occasion I use pure jojoba oil and even Aquaphor without any problems, which gives you an idea of just how clogging this is.</li>
            <li>By using the both of these products, it makes my skin glow, feel super soft, and is actually helping minimize the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>and I definitely feel that its preventing fine lines.</li>
            <li>I am now subscribing this product because its price is really reasonable.</li>
            <li>we really need those to combat sun damage.  </li>
            <li>(I happen to really like the scent, but my husband can&#x27;t stand it.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>hydrates skin very well</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and I am not seeing much, if any, improvement on my eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Thanks to Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
            <li>but it does really well around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The defective dropper causes too much to come out when squeezed.  </li>
            <li>It works really well on your face and body.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>In the winter I have to use another moisturizer over it, but it really stretches out</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin much brighter and softer.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say I have seen much in the way of results.  </li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
            <li>I really like this serum better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin just looks better, pores seem smaller and less noticeable, and the fine lines around my mouth are diminished.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Need to use more than with other serums to spread over face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of the lucky gals in her late twenties that is dealing with both acne AND fine lines!</li>
            <li>I love it especially on dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>I refuse to spread chemical cocktails of toxins all over my face with ingredients found in most conventional creams and serums.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>With this product you will see a huge difference in dry skin.</li>
            <li>While my assessment is not scientific, I think some of those worry lines have diminished,and it seems I have significantly less crows feet and and creases across the forehead and neck than most women</li>
            <li>While my assessment is not scientific, I think some of those worry lines have diminished,and it seems I have significantly less crows feet and and creases across the forehead and neck than most women</li>
            <li>I notice the next morning that my skin has a glow to it and looks tighter (for lack of a better word, although it doesn&#x27;t actually feel tighter or anything).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using for my face and my hair, no kidding as we getting older my hair</li>
            <li>It works as well or better than more expensive items.</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t have super deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommendable.</li>
            <li>It goes on light for oil and sinks in and for my oily skin</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a nightcream that worked and wasn&#x27;t too heavy and cause some skin issues</li>
            <li>It is nothing overwhelming though, and dissipated within a few minutes of application.</li>
            <li>Or maybe they will just send me 2 new droppers.  </li>
            <li>The bottle on the left is the bottle that is clearly off, and the bottle on the right is what color it should be.  </li>
            <li>As most of these products, very little difference.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I buy their products for my young granddaughter too!</li>
            <li>my fine wrinkles (I&#x27;m almost 39) are smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>For the price and how long it lasts, I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I love this serum, like other reviewers I use it only at night along with the lines night lotion and eye cream.</li>
            <li>I only wish I didn&#x27;t have to layer another product over the top to add sun protection (though I don&#x27;t think this product is actually intended to be your daily moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ve been pretty blessed and gotten away with being a skincare slacker, usually only washing my face in the shower in the morning, adding a moisturizer, then calling it good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually love the product and have purchased it in the past.  </li>
            <li>Recently got married and combined finances.</li>
            <li>; as in this 56 year old broke out like a teenager!</li>
            <li>just a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Strange, right?</li>
            <li>finally found a less expensive serum than the one i used before and more effective!.</li>
            <li>Naturally Ageless Serum is better than the department store serums I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s ACTUALLY working, but in my eyes my skin looks a whole heap healthier - more elastic and plump.</li>
            <li>Perfect &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; protection for cold, dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin, my routine is use three drops ,one on forehead, one on each side of the face and pad in skin right after wash face.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with large pores, but I usually only break out around that time of the month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by how well this works.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve used nearly all of it</li>
            <li>This burt&#x27;s bees naturally ageless serum production date:</li>
            <li>so far, I am liking this a lot.</li>
            <li>From now on, I will be buying it directly from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural product to help with drying skin...</li>
            <li>So this, thus far, after years of experimentation, is my hands-down favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suffer from dermatitis and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have frequent breakouts or adult acne.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks plumper and healthier than it has since my early 20s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month in conjunction with the Naturally Ageless Night Cream.</li>
            <li>when i first got it i used it alot, and i guess too much of a good thing is a bad thing.</li>
            <li>My dry winter skin is already showing an amazing difference after only a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if it was the main cause as I am pregnant as well.</li>
            <li>This is a fast absorbing oil with primrose oil to hydrate VERY dry facial skin.</li>
            <li>I usually buy professional brands like Kinerase, Dr. Dennis Gross, Darphin, and StriVectin, but based on the many positive reviews for this product, and a tight wallet, I took a chance.</li>
            <li>I have some doubts because it is a little different or not that strong than I bought last time.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>only small complaint is that there is some kind of minty ingredient that bothers my eyes a bit if they are open with the product on, so I would put this on literally right before bed when you&#x27;re done reading and watching TV</li>
            <li>I was contacted by king of deals who offered to refund my money and send a replacement free of charge (after I remove my negative comment, of course).</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Intensive Repairing Serum, 0.45 Fluid Ounces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a 38 year old female.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the burt bees orange facial cleanser and the moisturizing lotion that is in the Naturally Ageless line.</li>
            <li>Both my 90 year old mom and I use this daily.</li>
            <li>I have mostly &#x27;normal&#x27; skin with a slight tendency towards dry on the forehead and cheeks alongside my nose, and I use this pretty liberally every morning as my overall moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>, you only need to use a little and you see the differents right away.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for those with extra dry or maturing skin like mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe, but I noticed a visual difference within the first couple nights I used it!  </li>

            <li> , it is my best serum ever, but when I bought it agin one week ago it wasn&#x27;t the original one,</li>
            <li> While I think that Burt&#x27;s Bees makes some great products, (I love the lip products)</li>
            <li> The anti-aging benefit is, I suppose, that it adds a great deal of moisture, which I found myself using it more on my elbows, knees and heels.  </li>
            <li> I bought this serum after reading so many great reviews here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about two years now, and really love it!</li>

            <li> One item which was part of a large collection of Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Product for a party Basket ( perfect ) Gift .</li>
            <li> Best of all is the price - very affordable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Burts Bess is good and if you care your skin, this could be a better choice.</li>
            <li> it smells nice and works</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and doesn&#x27;t smell &#x27;cosmetic&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked it - a lot -</li>
            <li> Maybe you could get the merchant I purchased them from to send me 2 more with good droppers.  </li>
            <li> I have found in the mornings when applying my makeup, I&#x27;m not using as much concealer around my nose which is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The serum feels nice</li>
            <li> Soaks into skin nicely</li>
            <li> Rose oil and organic jojoba oil were two of the oils I could use without exacerbating the problem.  </li>
            <li> makes my skin glow and feel alive, Amazon has the best price compared to CVS and Rite Aid</li>
            <li> is a great product, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This Burt&#x27;s Bee Naturally Ageless Serum is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Great product, just as described and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I call that a HUGE improvement in this amount of time!</li>
            <li> Love their products.</li>
            <li> I use two drops to cover my face and undereye area, and two more drops to cover my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> When I wake in the morning after using this, my skin has a healthy glow and</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> but I think the ones I do have look better.</li>
            <li> I normally love this product...</li>
            <li> and I love how moisturized my face feels.  </li>
            <li> But I couldn&#x27;t be sure because I didn&#x27;t have another bottle to compare it to at the time</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is a reputable manuf.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more when i run out.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after applying.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t much more than a lovely smelling blending of oils.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;d rather spend more on a product that does more.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I hope more fresher.</li>
            <li> Love Burts Bees products.</li>
            <li> Love it ....</li>
            <li> But I love it overnight.</li>
            <li> most)</li>
            <li> My skin really drinks this up and looks great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found an all-natural product that is cruelty-free/vegan,</li>
            <li> This serum is wonderful as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> sure weather they have changed the formula or not.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, didn&#x27;t work magic</li>
            <li> Love the refreshing smell also.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> While writing out what we spend a month, my husband was flabbergasted that I spend more on face care than my car.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product...</li>
            <li> They took more than a week to heal even after I stopped using the serum.</li>
            <li> Wish it had more of the pomogrante smell to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this one from amazon before and it was ok</li>
            <li> This is an excellent syrum, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better (and healthful)</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong but it&#x27;s not unpleasant, sometimes I even think it&#x27;s quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> first, I loved using just good ol&#x27;-fashioned olive oil, which was great in the middle of winter when my skin could get extra-dry.  </li>
            <li> I can see my skin becoming even more even.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry and this is perfect, in the sun or under foundation.  </li>
            <li> I find that it works best for me in the winter when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m happy to have found an all natural product, and I just like it!</li>
            <li> Normally a good dropper will put out precisely the right amout.  </li>
            <li> I have taken very good care of my skin since I was a teen.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely, light and fragrant.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I no longer feel dryness on my face, it gives my face a smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m happy to have found an all natural product, and I just like it!or items you can&#x27;t find in the store?  </li>
            <li> This way I can be pimple AND wrinkle free. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> After applying the serum to my face for a week, I&#x27;m glad to find that my face becomes glossy and smooth when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and I just love how smooth and supple it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily  </li>
            <li> But nothing can compare with this on because they are easy to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t flow out so easily.</li>
            <li> I love the naturally ageless day and night creams, and have had really good luck with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly glad I tried it since it led to the discovery that natural oils are superior to the products I was using.</li>
            <li> I have seen a definite improvement in skin tone and decrease in fine lines - and it smells good!</li>
            <li> Plus, its 100% natural and smells nice!</li>
            <li> The smell, I don&#x27;t care for and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes with my under eye and fine line areas.</li>
            <li> The fine lines are still there</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does sink into the skin quickly which I like.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging could be better...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great skin care product and it last quite a while</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> After that ran out, I started using my own combination of oils without seeing much difference.</li>
            <li> It keeps skin hydrated and oil free.</li>
            <li> When I first got this, I was thrilled (once I adjusted to the scent which is not bad but is distinctive).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for  three years, and love it so much!</li>
            <li> Love the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use it at night after my face is clean</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how this goes - not overly impressed with first few weeks of use, however.</li>
            <li> so I removed one star since I prefer sweet smells.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really works though</li>
            <li> apply this onto my clean skin and then I follow it up with their super dreamy [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> no bad experiences with it.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the cost.</li>
            <li> serum has a medicinal/herbal scent that may be too strong for some people at first, but, after a couple of minutes, the scent not noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> and I love it, but this last time I receive it from Amazon, instead of the clean scent of tea tree oil, it smelled more like rancid cooking oil.</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommend. :))</li>
            <li> wonderful addition to their facial creams - day or night; perfect for normal or dry skin; young and/or mature skin</li>
            <li> It has greatly reduced the wrinkles around my eyes and seems to help with the dark circles.</li>
            <li> Bees can pretty much do no wrong in my book... great products, especially the lip balms.</li>
            <li> It does have a smell but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I use it more for maintenance and feel like occasional use works, but for skin more in need I would think daily use would show improvement over time based on my own experience.</li>
            <li> Because BB Naturally Ageless serum contained Rose oil as one of the first ingredients I tried it.  </li>
            <li> This really helps with the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It sits lightly on the skin, too, and really feel like it nourishes.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that everything is natural.  </li>
            <li> May be pricy but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I feel much better about using natural products.</li>
            <li> so worth the price.</li>
            <li> It helps me improve the skin condition, I use to have very day and wrinkled line on face, it gives the skin hydrating supply at night, I even put on the face during the day, Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bee for provide such good product.</li>
            <li> but I do feel that its worth it.</li>
            <li> I found this Burt&#x27;s Bees serum, in a clearance pile at a chain cosmetic store, and thought it would be worth checking it out for the price.  </li>
            <li> I think it is due to this and to good skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> I felt in love with this from the frist use; It leaves my skin soft and you can notice at the first glance.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts in the &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34; area which tends to get more oily, so I have to be SUPER careful when choosing anti-aging products, since so many of them are oily/high</li>
            <li> , my skin still feels soft and smooth when I wake up, and a fresh application for the day after the shower keeps it that way.  </li>
            <li> She likes it very much.</li>
            <li> am still new to the anti-aging products, so I haven&#x27;t tested verymany, but I can tell you that the Clinique products did nothing for me, and this showed very fast results that I am pleased with so far!</li>
            <li> (it is many different oils) for use during the day</li>
            <li> I paid full price at the drug store and in future will get from here and combine with another order for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;For everyone with dryer skin you may want to put a nightcream over top and put a drop or two in with your daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> lines&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- around the top of my upper lip&lt;br /&gt;- between the eyebrows</li>
            <li> I swear this is the same stuff that Clairens sells for way more money in the Department Stores.  </li>
            <li> and I love how my skin feels when I wake up the next morning.</li>
            <li> and this has really helped!  </li>
            <li> I find this to work better than many of the more expensive serums on the market.</li>
            <li> I use it year round because of the healthy glow my skin has, and how it virtually eliminates the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few years now and just Love how it makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> All positive feedback.</li>
            <li> N3161001, it already more than 3 years, too long.</li>
            <li> Before Amazon saved me and I was able to start using this product religiously, I was definitely starting to believe I was seeing some rapid &#x27;aging&#x27; in the mirror, as a year of some significant life changes</li>
            <li> Before Amazon saved me and I was able to start using this product religiously, I was definitely starting to believe I was seeing some rapid &#x27;aging&#x27; in the mirror, as a year of some significant life changes</li>
            <li> It made me wonder about the supplier, since I&#x27;ve read that tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t go rancid; it just becomes less effective.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this serum also works to calm my skin.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and oily skin and have found that it is too oily</li>
            <li> /&gt;And this serum is certainly helping.  </li>
            <li> On occasion I use pure jojoba oil and even Aquaphor without any problems, which gives you an idea of just how clogging this is.</li>
            <li> By using the both of these products, it makes my skin glow, feel super soft, and is actually helping minimize the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> and I definitely feel that its preventing fine lines.</li>
            <li> I am now subscribing this product because its price is really reasonable.</li>
            <li> we really need those to combat sun damage.  </li>
            <li> (I happen to really like the scent, but my husband can&#x27;t stand it.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> hydrates skin very well</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and I am not seeing much, if any, improvement on my eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Thanks to Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
            <li> but it does really well around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The defective dropper causes too much to come out when squeezed.  </li>
            <li> It works really well on your face and body.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> In the winter I have to use another moisturizer over it, but it really stretches out</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin much brighter and softer.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say I have seen much in the way of results.  </li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> In the morning my skin just looks better, pores seem smaller and less noticeable, and the fine lines around my mouth are diminished.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Need to use more than with other serums to spread over face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the lucky gals in her late twenties that is dealing with both acne AND fine lines!</li>
            <li> I love it especially on dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I refuse to spread chemical cocktails of toxins all over my face with ingredients found in most conventional creams and serums.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> With this product you will see a huge difference in dry skin.</li>
            <li> While my assessment is not scientific, I think some of those worry lines have diminished,and it seems I have significantly less crows feet and and creases across the forehead and neck than most women</li>
            <li> While my assessment is not scientific, I think some of those worry lines have diminished,and it seems I have significantly less crows feet and and creases across the forehead and neck than most women</li>
            <li> I notice the next morning that my skin has a glow to it and looks tighter (for lack of a better word, although it doesn&#x27;t actually feel tighter or anything).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using for my face and my hair, no kidding as we getting older my hair</li>
            <li> It works as well or better than more expensive items.</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t have super deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommendable.</li>
            <li> It goes on light for oil and sinks in and for my oily skin</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a nightcream that worked and wasn&#x27;t too heavy and cause some skin issues</li>
            <li> It is nothing overwhelming though, and dissipated within a few minutes of application.</li>
            <li> Or maybe they will just send me 2 new droppers.  </li>
            <li> The bottle on the left is the bottle that is clearly off, and the bottle on the right is what color it should be.  </li>
            <li> As most of these products, very little difference.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I buy their products for my young granddaughter too!</li>
            <li> my fine wrinkles (I&#x27;m almost 39) are smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> For the price and how long it lasts, I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> I love this serum, like other reviewers I use it only at night along with the lines night lotion and eye cream.</li>
            <li> I only wish I didn&#x27;t have to layer another product over the top to add sun protection (though I don&#x27;t think this product is actually intended to be your daily moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ve been pretty blessed and gotten away with being a skincare slacker, usually only washing my face in the shower in the morning, adding a moisturizer, then calling it good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually love the product and have purchased it in the past.  </li>
            <li> Recently got married and combined finances.</li>
            <li> ; as in this 56 year old broke out like a teenager!</li>
            <li> just a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Strange, right?</li>
            <li> finally found a less expensive serum than the one i used before and more effective!.</li>
            <li> Naturally Ageless Serum is better than the department store serums I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s ACTUALLY working, but in my eyes my skin looks a whole heap healthier - more elastic and plump.</li>
            <li> Perfect &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; protection for cold, dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, my routine is use three drops ,one on forehead, one on each side of the face and pad in skin right after wash face.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with large pores, but I usually only break out around that time of the month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by how well this works.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve used nearly all of it</li>
            <li> This burt&#x27;s bees naturally ageless serum production date:</li>
            <li> so far, I am liking this a lot.</li>
            <li> From now on, I will be buying it directly from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural product to help with drying skin...</li>
            <li> So this, thus far, after years of experimentation, is my hands-down favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suffer from dermatitis and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have frequent breakouts or adult acne.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks plumper and healthier than it has since my early 20s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month in conjunction with the Naturally Ageless Night Cream.</li>
            <li> when i first got it i used it alot, and i guess too much of a good thing is a bad thing.</li>
            <li> My dry winter skin is already showing an amazing difference after only a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it was the main cause as I am pregnant as well.</li>
            <li> This is a fast absorbing oil with primrose oil to hydrate VERY dry facial skin.</li>
            <li> I usually buy professional brands like Kinerase, Dr. Dennis Gross, Darphin, and StriVectin, but based on the many positive reviews for this product, and a tight wallet, I took a chance.</li>
            <li> I have some doubts because it is a little different or not that strong than I bought last time.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> only small complaint is that there is some kind of minty ingredient that bothers my eyes a bit if they are open with the product on, so I would put this on literally right before bed when you&#x27;re done reading and watching TV</li>
            <li> I was contacted by king of deals who offered to refund my money and send a replacement free of charge (after I remove my negative comment, of course).</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Intensive Repairing Serum, 0.45 Fluid Ounces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a 38 year old female.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the burt bees orange facial cleanser and the moisturizing lotion that is in the Naturally Ageless line.</li>
            <li> Both my 90 year old mom and I use this daily.</li>
            <li> I have mostly &#x27;normal&#x27; skin with a slight tendency towards dry on the forehead and cheeks alongside my nose, and I use this pretty liberally every morning as my overall moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> , you only need to use a little and you see the differents right away.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for those with extra dry or maturing skin like mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe, but I noticed a visual difference within the first couple nights I used it!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if those real or fake..  especially those product for face you want to be sure that they are real!!!!</li>
            <li> I might try pure argon oil when this runs out to see how it compares but even though small bottle think will last 4 to 6</li>
            <li> tried other organic or natural serum products.</li>
            <li> It is oily a little goes a very long way I just pat it onto my face, my cheeks get very dry and this cleared that right up.</li>
            <li> I got my next subscribe-and-save shipment last night and it confirmed that the last bottle was fake or tampered with.  </li>
            <li> Not sure that it is working that much.  </li>
            <li> I have oily and problematic skin, but over the course of the night this stuff really seeps in, because it actually makes my skin LESS oily, and pores less noticeable in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and need to use about 5 drops of this to do my entire face.  </li>
            <li> It is the only product that helps with my dry skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause break outs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this every night for nearly 2 weeks, and I definitely see a slight improvement!</li>
            <li> Says to use around the eyes, but does nothing other than to dry out the skin around the eyes worse and so not good for sensitive eyes that is for sure!</li>
            <li> /&gt; Was able to find less expensive for a time if bought locally.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 55 and looks no older than earlier 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> stuff goes a LONG way, too.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m using this to prevent them for as long as I can.  </li>
            <li> but when I was diagnosed with Rosatia a few years ago I had to go to school to find out what I could do to help my highly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using several Burt&#x27;s Bees products over the years, so I thought I would try this one since my skin has never reacted to any of the other</li>
            <li> Helps with dry spots.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so it does help my skin from flaking.</li>
            <li> parenthesis lines are my biggest trouble spot, and my makeup is starting to settle there so that I&#x27;m constantly having to smudge it out of there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s pretty thick, I use it only at night, and usually use it maybe two or three times a week (on the nights when I don&#x27;t use Retin-A).</li>
            <li> It seems to work as well, if not better, than more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But the last subscribe-and-save shipment I received, I thought the product looked and smelled a little off.  </li>
            <li> so your eyes are closed and not getting that minty evaporation in them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can see not much on floor.</li>
            <li> It is quite greasy, so I have to be careful</li>
            <li> they were never really large.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tolerate using this because of the strong, unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> If I use it at night, the next day those little sleep wrinkles are MIA---and if I forget it, they start making a come-back!  </li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> we hope the other one like it too.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty expensive for that.</li>
            <li> Oil is reduced even without other creams(maybe</li>
            <li> Not worth the price of buying it again - will try something else.</li>
            <li> so this product had long expired—3 years past the use date; hence, the reason for the rancid odor.  </li>
            <li> I carefully removed the sticker w/o destroying the barcode.  </li>
            <li> --I just pat on a few drops when my skin and/or hands are wet.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like my small fine lines were getting worse!!</li>
            <li> think it is all the antioxidants and down here in San Antonio</li>
            <li> , I see very very subtle improvement, I THINK, it is so hard to tell - it is pretty unnoticable.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and my lines are less visible.</li>
            <li> My skin seems smoother and there&#x27;s less redness.  </li>
            <li> It has a sweet scent that isn&#x27;t exactly bad..</li>
            <li> Even so, olive oil typically felt too heavy, so I couldn&#x27;t use it often.  </li>
            <li> Still trying it out i can see a little differents bur will let you know after a month of use</li>
            <li> So i suggest not going crazy with it or any product really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it has changed the clarity of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for over a month and have yet to see any changes in my forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think since this is basically oil, it would be heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken out and have notice white heads forming.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit on the thick side</li>
            <li> For the first 10 days , I had not seen any improvement in my skin, and I was disappointed it.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this about 15 minutes before I go to bed</li>
            <li> The bottle it comes in in small, but it lasts awhile, probably about six months or</li>
            <li> , I started looking for products that would allow me to still be lazy but hopefully provide some &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; benefit.</li>
            <li> Besides, it just seemed weird keeping a big bottle of olive oil in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I then use my usual moisturizer and make up.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how to feel about this product.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his face instead of the expensive prescription serum he was given which had all kinds of potential side effects.</li>
            <li> who knows, so hard to tell with products like these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other expensive serums that didn&#x27;t deliver like this one!</li>
            <li> Very small amount in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> And $80 extra dollars in my pocket every two months isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember when I&#x27;ve had such an immediate, bad reaction.</li>
            <li> It is getting very hard to find</li>
            <li> So i gave it a break, then tried it again on a bad day when i was a lill swollen in the morning and my lines seemed to be pretty bad</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about using harmful chemicals or anything unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> This stuff seriously dries your face out!</li>
            <li> Dramatic difference in my creases since using--</li>
            <li> I used it 2 times and got very deep, very painful pimples overnight --</li>
            <li> I have this on automatic monthly delivery, because it is so difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Bought this, figuring I&#x27;d prove the importance of my expensive serum.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are faint</li>
            <li> I have always used expensive moisturizers on my face</li>
            <li> I have very thin and dry/normal skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because the cold weather?)</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> Others had commented that it also smelled bad</li>
            <li> so I decided to call Burt&#x27;s Bees myself and they told me it should not smell bad.  </li>
            <li> but it smells so bad that I can&#x27;t bring myself to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in Amazon&#x27;s product control sometimes.</li>
            <li> but it was disappointed ..</li>
            <li> was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> The lines around my lips were terrible.</li>
            <li> King of deals is terrible to work with</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this serum is great I have rosacea and this product is the only thing that does not cause my face to breakout while at the same time it moisturizes my skin.  It absorbs easily  and I love the fact that everything is natural.  May be pricy but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This really helps with the fine lines.  I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 weeks. For the first 10 days , I had not seen any improvement in my skin, and I was disappointed it. However, I have kept using this serum, and I can see visible change in my face. I know some reviewers said that one bottle will last 2 to 4 months. For my case, it lasts one month because I use it twice per day. I am now subscribing this product because its price is really reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love their products. This serum is wonderful. I feel much better about using natural products. I buy their products for my young granddaughter too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it has changed the clarity of my skin.  I have large pores and oily skin and have found that it is too oily (it is many different oils) for use during the day but it is great for using at night.  I have never been able to find a nightcream that worked and wasn&#x27;t too heavy and cause some skin issues but this has only improved my skin-think it is all the antioxidants and down here in San Antonio we really need those to combat sun damage.  I just use two to three drops on my face and another three for neck and chest. It goes on light for oil and sinks in and for my oily skin its all I need at night.  In the morning my skin just looks better, pores seem smaller and less noticeable, and the fine lines around my mouth are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is great-I paid full price at the drug store and in future will get from here and combine with another order for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, it works but now that see what essential oils can do I might try pure argon oil when this runs out to see how it compares but even though small bottle think will last 4 to 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyone with dryer skin you may want to put a nightcream over top and put a drop or two in with your daily moisturizer.  It works-give it a try!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. She likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about two years now, and really love it! I have oily skin with large pores, but I usually only break out around that time of the month. I was worried, however, that this serum might be too oily for my skin, but it&#x27;s not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has a medicinal/herbal scent that may be too strong for some people at first, but, after a couple of minutes, the scent not noticeable at all. (I happen to really like the scent, but my husband can&#x27;t stand it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s pretty thick, I use it only at night, and usually use it maybe two or three times a week (on the nights when I don&#x27;t use Retin-A). I usually apply this about 15 minutes before I go to bed so it has some time to sink in -- I use two drops to cover my face and undereye area, and two more drops to cover my neck and chest. The bottle it comes in in small, but it lasts awhile, probably about six months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my pillow case. When I wake in the morning after using this, my skin has a healthy glow and my fine wrinkles (I&#x27;m almost 39) are smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! It smells lovely, light and fragrant. It sits lightly on the skin, too, and really feel like it nourishes. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My skin is dry and this is perfect, in the sun or under foundation.  The stores in Anchorage no longer carry this product.  I am happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for over a month and have yet to see any changes in my forehead wrinkles. Did break out a bit as well but I&#x27;m not sure if it was the main cause as I am pregnant as well. Definitely not a fan of the scent at all either!!! Will try Argan oil instead.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously dries your face out! Says to use around the eyes, but does nothing other than to dry out the skin around the eyes worse and so not good for sensitive eyes that is for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the lucky gals in her late twenties that is dealing with both acne AND fine lines! I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts in the &amp;#34;T-zone&amp;#34; area which tends to get more oily, so I have to be SUPER careful when choosing anti-aging products, since so many of them are oily/high moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using several Burt&#x27;s Bees products over the years, so I thought I would try this one since my skin has never reacted to any of the other products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this every night for nearly 2 weeks, and I definitely see a slight improvement! These are the areas where I&#x27;m using it:&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;parenthesis lines&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- around the top of my upper lip&lt;br /&gt;- between the eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;- around the bottom and sides of my eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff goes a LONG way, too. For those areas, I am literally using 2 drops (one for the prenthesis and lip, one for the eyes and brow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parenthesis lines are my biggest trouble spot, and my makeup is starting to settle there so that I&#x27;m constantly having to smudge it out of there. After 2 weeks I have noticed that makeup no longer settles there, excepts where the lines are deepest just to the sides of my mouth. I call that a HUGE improvement in this amount of time! My frown lines between my brows are definitely softer, but I have to say I haven&#x27;t noticed any change around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also happy to report that even though I am using this product in my acne-prone areas, it has caused NO breakouts! That still amazes me, since this is a oil-based product. There is no skin irritation either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only small complaint is that there is some kind of minty ingredient that bothers my eyes a bit if they are open with the product on, so I would put this on literally right before bed when you&#x27;re done reading and watching TV so your eyes are closed and not getting that minty evaporation in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still new to the anti-aging products, so I haven&#x27;t tested verymany, but I can tell you that the Clinique products did nothing for me, and this showed very fast results that I am pleased with so far! For the price and how long it lasts, I think it&#x27;s worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Burt&#x27;s Bees is also a Cruelty-free product line!*</li>
            <li> I like this product; my face feels nicer when I use it, and the scent is terrific.  But I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the appearance of lines in my face since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, like other reviewers I use it only at night along with the lines night lotion and eye cream. It is oily a little goes a very long way I just pat it onto my face, my cheeks get very dry and this cleared that right up. I have  an oily t-zone and was worried about zits but it didn&#x27;t affect my skin in that way at all. I don&#x27;t have a lot of lines yet I&#x27;m trying to do the preventative maintenance thing but I think the ones I do have look better. either way it&#x27;s a great skin care product and it last quite a while so worth the price.</li>
            <li> It helps me improve the skin condition, I use to have very day and wrinkled line on face, it gives the skin hydrating supply at night, I even put on the face during the day, Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bee for provide such good product.</li>
            <li> One word...... LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> hydrates skin very well</li>
            <li> I normally love this product...I&#x27;ve ordered it for years and I love how moisturized my face feels.  But the last subscribe-and-save shipment I received, I thought the product looked and smelled a little off.  The color was different and it even smelled different..almost like it was just vegetable oil maybe.  But I couldn&#x27;t be sure because I didn&#x27;t have another bottle to compare it to at the time and I thought maybe my mind was playing tricks on me.  I got my next subscribe-and-save shipment last night and it confirmed that the last bottle was fake or tampered with.  The bottle on the left is the bottle that is clearly off, and the bottle on the right is what color it should be.  Disappointed in Amazon&#x27;s product control sometimes.</li>
            <li> Good price for an excellent product!  I have seen a definite improvement in skin tone and decrease in fine lines - and it smells good!</li>
            <li> Perfect &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; protection for cold, dry winter months.  I use it year round because of the healthy glow my skin has, and how it virtually eliminates the fine lines around my eyes.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about using harmful chemicals or anything unhealthy.  LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by how well this works. I don&#x27;t use it every day - I use it at night twice a week or so, and put it all over my face. I notice the next morning that my skin has a glow to it and looks tighter (for lack of a better word, although it doesn&#x27;t actually feel tighter or anything). I use it more for maintenance and feel like occasional use works, but for skin more in need I would think daily use would show improvement over time based on my own experience. It has a sweet scent that isn&#x27;t exactly bad..just a little too strong for me. That&#x27;s why I use it at night without any moisturizer over it, and also because it starts off with an oily/wet application. I have oily and problematic skin, but over the course of the night this stuff really seeps in, because it actually makes my skin LESS oily, and pores less noticeable in the morning. Best of all is the price - very affordable. I&#x27;ve tried a few other expensive serums that didn&#x27;t deliver like this one!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Love the more natural ingredients. I refuse to spread chemical cocktails of toxins all over my face with ingredients found in most conventional creams and serums. My dry winter skin is already showing an amazing difference after only a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum works great around my eyes and does not gradually work its way into my eyes causing them to burn, like the coconut oil I used to use. The smell is a tad herbal/medicinal so I removed one star since I prefer sweet smells. It is nothing overwhelming though, and dissipated within a few minutes of application.</li>
            <li> Too oily, it doesn&#x27;t seem to sink in to the skin. Need to use more than with other serums to spread over face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> This bottle is 3/4 used and I am not seeing much, if any, improvement on my eye wrinkles. I am putting 3/5 stars because I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products - maybe this product works on some but it does not work for me Again, I see very very subtle improvement, I THINK, it is so hard to tell - it is pretty unnoticable. Not worth the price of buying it again - will try something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using for my face and my hair, no kidding as we getting older my hair start thinning, and I try everything, when I try this serum my hair start growing and I can see not much on floor. Please don&#x27;t increase the price. I prefer to my friends too. So when I purchased I give to my friends for their birthday present.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Intensive Repairing Serum, 0.45 Fluid Ounces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bess is good and if you care your skin, this could be a better choice. haha</li>
            <li> When I received this product it reeked of petroleum!  Others had commented that it also smelled bad so I decided to call Burt&#x27;s Bees myself and they told me it should not smell bad.  They asked me for the barcode on the package--which the seller conveniently covered up--which only raised my suspicions.  I carefully removed the sticker w/o destroying the barcode.  The barcode revealed the product was manuf. in 2008!  BB told me it has a shelf life of only 3 yrs. so this product had long expired—3 years past the use date; hence, the reason for the rancid odor.  Burt&#x27;s Bees is a reputable manuf. and King of Deals is tainting their image by passing off expired, foul-odored merchandise.  DO NOT let this one seller dissuade you from buying BB&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really works though when i first got it i used it alot, and i guess too much of a good thing is a bad thing. It seemed like my small fine lines were getting worse!! So i gave it a break, then tried it again on a bad day when i was a lill swollen in the morning and my lines seemed to be pretty bad, well, it worked! So i suggest not going crazy with it or any product really. Like a pick me up and it does the job. I will be getting more when i run out.</li>
            <li> if i received any benefit or not.  who knows, so hard to tell with products like these but i&#x27;ve used nearly all of it</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after applying.</li>
            <li> makes my skin glow and feel alive, Amazon has the best price compared to CVS and Rite Aid , I have replaced my $60.00 creams with this and I am happy</li>
            <li> While I think that Burt&#x27;s Bees makes some great products, (I love the lip products) this isn&#x27;t much more than a lovely smelling blending of oils. The anti-aging benefit is, I suppose, that it adds a great deal of moisture, which I found myself using it more on my elbows, knees and heels.  Bottom line: I&#x27;d rather spend more on a product that does more. I think this is somewhat mis-advertised.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum better than any other I have tried. It seems to work as well, if not better, than more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used. It is getting very hard to find so I was pleased to find it at Amazon and at a bargain price!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I no longer feel dryness on my face, it gives my face a smooth feeling.  Thanks to Burt&#x27;s Bee.</li>
            <li> Recommend it. works great for the price. a great buy. no bad experiences with it. All positive feedback. Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and dry/normal skin. I use this every night after washing on my entire face. Yes its shiny/oily and have to wash my pillow case constantly but I do feel that its worth it. It definitely seals in the moisture and I definitely feel that its preventing fine lines. Pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum about three weeks ago and am very impressed. It has greatly reduced the wrinkles around my eyes and seems to help with the dark circles. It is quite greasy, so I have to be careful which areas I put it on (hello combination skin!) but it does really well around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> As most of these products, very little difference.&lt;br /&gt;But it smells nice and works okay. Nothing Like a Plastic&lt;br /&gt;surgeon would do! lol but hey good temporary.</li>
            <li> This burt&#x27;s bees naturally ageless serum production date: N3161001, it already more than 3 years, too long. I hope more fresher.</li>
            <li> After smoking 42 years, I quit last year. The lines around my lips were terrible. After using this product for about 2 months they are almost gone! Love Burts Bees products. Also use day cream, night cream, facial wash, shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Excellent products!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few years now and just Love how it makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes such a difference in my face. Helps with dry spots. Wish it helped with age spots. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Love it .... use it overnight</li>
            <li> so far, I am liking this a lot. I will have to see over time how it continues to work. I love the naturally ageless day and night creams, and have had really good luck with them. We&#x27;ll see how this goes - not overly impressed with first few weeks of use, however.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for years and I love it, but this last time I receive it from Amazon, instead of the clean scent of tea tree oil, it smelled more like rancid cooking oil. It made me wonder about the supplier, since I&#x27;ve read that tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t go rancid; it just becomes less effective. From now on, I will be buying it directly from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> But, I find that when I use it in the daytime (I wear glasses), sometimes I get the feeling like my eyes are getting cloudy. This seems to be the product out-gassing or somehow seeping into my eyes. Only seems to happen when I wear my glasses. Strange, right? But I love it overnight. My wife reports that it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees can pretty much do no wrong in my book... great products, especially the lip balms.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this serum!!!  I use it twice a day on face, neck and chest... it&#x27;s a fabulous product.  I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural product to help with drying skin... this is it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think since this is basically oil, it would be heavy.  Not so.  I have mostly &#x27;normal&#x27; skin with a slight tendency towards dry on the forehead and cheeks alongside my nose, and I use this pretty liberally every morning as my overall moisturizer.  It absorbs nicely, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and doesn&#x27;t smell &#x27;cosmetic&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even mornings when I haven&#x27;t washed my face the night before (err... most), my skin still feels soft and smooth when I wake up, and a fresh application for the day after the shower keeps it that way.  I only wish I didn&#x27;t have to layer another product over the top to add sun protection (though I don&#x27;t think this product is actually intended to be your daily moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit... I don&#x27;t take care of my skin the way my momma always told me I should.  I guess I&#x27;ve been pretty blessed and gotten away with being a skincare slacker, usually only washing my face in the shower in the morning, adding a moisturizer, then calling it good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, my &#x27;beauty routine&#x27; was simply Dove bar soap and Lubriderm lotion, until a combination of sun damage and girly hormones started to catch up to me and cause... yes, sun spots. Oh the horror!  Vanity shot to hell, I started looking for products that would allow me to still be lazy but hopefully provide some &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; benefit. So this, thus far, after years of experimentation, is my hands-down favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I loved using just good ol&#x27;-fashioned olive oil, which was great in the middle of winter when my skin could get extra-dry.  Even so, olive oil typically felt too heavy, so I couldn&#x27;t use it often.  Besides, it just seemed weird keeping a big bottle of olive oil in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this Burt&#x27;s Bees serum, in a clearance pile at a chain cosmetic store, and thought it would be worth checking it out for the price.  I liked it - a lot - so I used it sparingly, thinking that &#x27;clearance&#x27; likely meant &#x27;discontinued&#x27;.  But then, where do you look for items you can&#x27;t find in the store?  Yes, that&#x27;s right.  Amazon!  And now, I use it generously, every day, because I&#x27;ve got it on recurring Subscribe &amp; Save order - happy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it help?  I think so.  Before Amazon saved me and I was able to start using this product religiously, I was definitely starting to believe I was seeing some rapid &#x27;aging&#x27; in the mirror, as a year of some significant life changes seemed to be taking it&#x27;s toll.  While my assessment is not scientific, I think some of those worry lines have diminished,and it seems I have significantly less crows feet and and creases across the forehead and neck than most women my age that I know (and they often say the same).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to tell you - I&#x27;m happy to have found an all natural product, and I just like it!or items you can&#x27;t find in the store?

            <li> This is my magic elixir!  If I use it at night, the next day those little sleep wrinkles are MIA---and if I forget it, they start making a come-back!  Dramatic difference in my creases since using--and I have tried a million products to get rid of them.  This one is a 10!!</li>
            <li> I bought this serum after reading so many great reviews here on Amazon.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet so I&#x27;m using this to prevent them for as long as I can.  I have dry skin and need to use about 5 drops of this to do my entire face.  My skin really drinks this up and looks great.  I bought a bottle for my mom as well and she loves it too.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found an all-natural product that is cruelty-free/vegan, doesn&#x27;t make me break out and does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Another terrific product from Burts Bees.  I apply it on my damp face and it seems to keep the moisture in all day.  I then use my usual moisturizer and make up.  A little of this goes a long way.  I highly recommend this product.  It works as well or better than more expensive items.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this. She&#x27;s 55 and looks no older than earlier 40&#x27;s so it must be working.</li>
            <li> I actually love the product and have purchased it in the past.  This time the 2 bottles I ordered have a messed up dropper.  It is made out of glass and the tip where the product comes out is defective.  It does not function properly as a result.  Normally a good dropper will put out precisely the right amout.  The defective dropper causes too much to come out when squeezed.  Maybe you could get the merchant I purchased them from to send me 2 more with good droppers.  Or maybe they will just send me 2 new droppers.  Please help.  Thank you!  Marita Ramirez</li>
            <li> I do not use this but my wife uses it and she loves it. It is pricey, but it seems to do what it says it will do and that makes my wife happy.</li>
            <li> I swear this is the same stuff that Clairens sells for way more money in the Department Stores.  Sticking with Burts Bees now for all my face products</li>
            <li> I am a 38 year old female. I suffer from dermatitis and sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t have frequent breakouts or adult acne.  This product has not irritated my skin in any way.  I see a reduction in size of my pores but mind you they were never really large.  I have been complimented on having a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  I can see my skin becoming even more even.  I have been using the product now for almost 21/2 weeks. I also purchased the burt bees orange facial cleanser and the moisturizing lotion that is in the Naturally Ageless line.</li>
            <li> Both my 90 year old mom and I use this daily. She doesn&#x27;t look a day over 89! This serum is wonderful as a daily moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and this serum also works to calm my skin. I have this on automatic monthly delivery, because it is so difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Still trying it out i can see a little differents bur will let you know after a month of use</li>
            <li> Love it. My skin looks brighter and my lines are less visible. Will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
            <li> It works really well on your face and body.</li>
            <li> I love this intensive repairing serum for my eyes, it works great!  I am 57 and look only 40, I&#x27;m told.  I think it is due to this and to good skin.,no smoking and no drinking or sun for me.  Too blonde for that sun.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week and I LOVE it.  I use it at night after my face is clean and I love how my skin feels when I wake up the next morning. I have pretty sensitive skin and I was worried about the oil but I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts with this. I don&#x27;t necessarily know if it&#x27;s working for the &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; aspect but I do notice a difference when removing my makeup at night.  My skin seems smoother and there&#x27;s less redness.  I have found in the mornings when applying my makeup, I&#x27;m not using as much concealer around my nose which is wonderful.  I tend to have dry/normal skin and this has really helped!  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> tried other organic or natural serum products. But nothing can compare with this on because they are easy to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;But I have some doubts because it is a little different or not that strong than I bought last time.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure weather they have changed the formula or not.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to feel about this product. I have dry skin, so it does help my skin from flaking. The smell, I don&#x27;t care for and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes with my under eye and fine line areas. I&#x27;ve broken out and have notice white heads forming. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, didn&#x27;t work magic</li>
            <li> This is NOT a cream, so if you like creamy moistuizers this is not for you. This is a fast absorbing oil with primrose oil to hydrate VERY dry facial skin. I just recently moved to Arizona and my skin always feels dehydrated and nothing seemed to make a lasting difference till I tried this. I use a quarter size amount and massage into my skin for a minute or so after I wash. It will seem oily for about 10-20 minutes till it fully absorbes but it will keep you hydrated all day. With this product you will see a huge difference in dry skin. It also smells great and the primrose oil makes it a great anti-aging product. HIGHLY recommend! Im an aesthetician and I like this better then all the expensive fancy creams I&#x27;ve tried. Best to use at nighttime. Best also used to PREVENT skin from aging &amp; prevent against free-radical damage (I would not suggest for those trying to reverse signs of aging).</li>
            <li> This serum smells great and moisturizes well.  I find that its all I need in the summer months--I just pat on a few drops when my skin and/or hands are wet.  A little goes a long way.  In the winter I have to use another moisturizer over it, but it really stretches out whatever else I use.</li>
            <li> Naturally Ageless Serum is better than the department store serums I&#x27;ve used in the past. When I first got this, I was thrilled (once I adjusted to the scent which is not bad but is distinctive). I faithfully used the entire bottle. After that ran out, I started using my own combination of oils without seeing much difference. I&#x27;m certainly glad I tried it since it led to the discovery that natural oils are superior to the products I was using.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! It leaves my skin much brighter and softer. Not bad for the cost. Love the refreshing smell also.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> The serum feels nice but I wouldn&#x27;t say I have seen much in the way of results.  Would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> wonderful addition to their facial creams - day or night; perfect for normal or dry skin; young and/or mature skin</li>
            <li> My face find good.I use it everyday..Because it is safe,we are all like it..we hope the other one like it too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received an item that was over 3.5 years expired. I was contacted by king of deals who offered to refund my money and send a replacement free of charge (after I remove my negative comment, of course). That was almost 3 weeks ago and still nothing had been done that they agreed to do! They will argue that Burt&#x27;s bees does not expire---check the Burt&#x27;s bees website and you will find this is not correct at all. King of deals is terrible to work with and I will never purchase a product from them again.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good service.</li>
            <li> One item which was part of a large collection of Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Product for a party Basket ( perfect ) Gift .</li>
            <li> I order two .. but it was disappointed .. The color is different and those two come without boxes just in bag .. I am not sure if those real or fake..  especially those product for face you want to be sure that they are real!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Been using it for years and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Have been using a $100 serum from a department store for years. Recently got married and combined finances. While writing out what we spend a month, my husband was flabbergasted that I spend more on face care than my car. Bought this, figuring I&#x27;d prove the importance of my expensive serum. Wrong!  My skin looks plumper and healthier than it has since my early 20s. And $80 extra dollars in my pocket every two months isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his face instead of the expensive prescription serum he was given which had all kinds of potential side effects. Burt&#x27;s Bees is a name to trust.</li>
            <li> Love it! Never leaves my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tolerate using this because of the strong, unpleasant smell.  Very small amount in the bottle.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product...it has transformed my skin, and I have only been using it for a week! Highly highly recommend. :))</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month in conjunction with the Naturally Ageless Night Cream. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s ACTUALLY working, but in my eyes my skin looks a whole heap healthier - more elastic and plump. The fine lines are still there but they don&#x27;t seem to be as deep and dehydrated. The smell is quite strong but it&#x27;s not unpleasant, sometimes I even think it&#x27;s quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now and it really works.  No, I don&#x27;t have super deep wrinkles.  I&#x27;m 38.  But I am getting wrinkles on my forehead, around my mouth, and crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes.  Yes, they are faint but I still would like them to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this serum is certainly helping.  A lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this onto my clean skin and then I follow it up with their super dreamy [[ASIN:B00013Z15A Burt&#x27;s Bees - Carrot Nutritive Day Creme - 2 oz.]].  By using the both of these products, it makes my skin glow, feel super soft, and is actually helping minimize the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I continue to renew and order this product.  I&#x27;m 49... and I appreciate it&#x27;s results on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  It is the only product that helps with my dry skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause break outs.</li>
            <li> This serum is life saving for oily skin type that is prone to breakouts. It keeps skin hydrated and oil free. This way I can be pimple AND wrinkle free. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, my skin is even happier. I would highly recommend for those with extra dry or maturing skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I was allergic to the skin, rub in the face without allergies, and keep bright face  all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so soothing. I love it especially on dry winter skin. Plus, its 100% natural and smells nice!</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon and Burt&#x27;s Bees:&lt;br /&gt;Like Burt&#x27;s Bees and this product.&lt;br /&gt;Environmentally use proceeds to protect the USA honey bee.&lt;br /&gt;Clorox bought this company some time ago, and do not know if they kept same standards.&lt;br /&gt;A look into...&lt;br /&gt; Was able to find less expensive for a time if bought locally.  Needed to ask locally to stock this item.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Ageless&amp;#34; as in this 56 year old broke out like a teenager! I have taken very good care of my skin since I was a teen. I&#x27;m attuned with what works. I usually buy professional brands like Kinerase, Dr. Dennis Gross, Darphin, and StriVectin, but based on the many positive reviews for this product, and a tight wallet, I took a chance. I used it 2 times and got very deep, very painful pimples overnight -- I can&#x27;t remember when I&#x27;ve had such an immediate, bad reaction. They took more than a week to heal even after I stopped using the serum. On occasion I use pure jojoba oil and even Aquaphor without any problems, which gives you an idea of just how clogging this is. Now I am using it up on my feet! No problems to report but it&#x27;s pretty expensive for that.</li>
            <li> Not sure that it is working that much.  Don&#x27;t care for the smell at all.  Wish it had more of the pomogrante smell to it. Probably will give it away.</li>
            <li> After applying the serum to my face for a week, I&#x27;m glad to find that my face becomes glossy and smooth when I wake up in the morning. Oil is reduced even without other creams(maybe it&#x27;s because the cold weather?) Anyway, I like this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this one from amazon before and it was ok, it is my best serum ever, but when I bought it agin one week ago it wasn&#x27;t the original one, was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent syrum, especially for the money. I find that it works best for me in the winter when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> i am so impressed with burts bees.  the price is  very good and the results and very good too!</li>
            <li> This Burt&#x27;s Bee Naturally Ageless Serum is wonderful.  I like it a lot, you only need to use a little and you see the differents right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for  three years, and love it so much! This is a great product It makes a difference since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I find this to work better than many of the more expensive serums on the market. Soaks into skin nicely</li>
            <li> I have been use this product for 5plus years.  Works great, people thought I am 10 years younger than my actual age.  I have dry skin, my routine is use three drops ,one on forehead, one on each side of the face and pad in skin right after wash face. Once in morning and once before sleep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about three weeks now...&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any effects yet but it may be too soon to tell.&lt;br /&gt;It does sink into the skin quickly which I like.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging could be better... Twice I&#x27;ve accidentally knocked it off and lost quite a bit of the serum. It shouldn&#x27;t flow out so easily.</li>
            <li> Best product for the bags under my eyes that I have found.</li>
            <li> I am used to more expensive serums but a friend recommended me this one after a noticeable improvement in her skin (brighter, firmer). I felt in love with this from the frist use; It leaves my skin soft and you can notice at the first glance. It has quality oils in its composition. Highly recommendable.</li>
            <li> loving it! so happy that all the reviews that i read were all true! finally found a less expensive serum than the one i used before and more effective!.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of products that are more expensive.  This has made my skin look younger and smoother.  It has produced a noticeable difference in my skin.  I will continue to use this daily.</li>
            <li> Great product, just as described and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, no complaints from her...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and I just love how smooth and supple it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe, but I noticed a visual difference within the first couple nights I used it!  I have always used expensive moisturizers on my face but when I was diagnosed with Rosatia a few years ago I had to go to school to find out what I could do to help my highly sensitive skin.  Rose oil and organic jojoba oil were two of the oils I could use without exacerbating the problem.  Because BB Naturally Ageless serum contained Rose oil as one of the first ingredients I tried it.  I can&#x27;t believe how much better (and healthful) my skin looks!</li>
            <li> I had hoped I would like this but it smells so bad that I can&#x27;t bring myself to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit on the thick side but overall it protects my skin from dehydration. It does have a smell but not unpleasant.</li>
