            <li> In fact it dried my hair out even more and made it feel weak and brittle...</li>
            <li> My mother got this for me after a slight chemical burn and it worked within a month after this spot in the middle of my head sat bare for about 4 months.</li>
            <li> But now it&#x27;s all long to my shoulders</li>
            <li> and everybody says my hair is long.</li>
            <li> All this product did was make my hair dry</li>
            <li> definitely was NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> It took too long then I expected</li>
            <li> please do not waste your hard earned money</li>
            <li> cause the person on youtube said the spicy ground mustard could cause dandruff, due to that conditioner</li>
            <li> so my hair is sensitive to products, like it gets dry or feels dirty but mostly dry anyway out of topic</li>
            <li> well...I have very thin hair that like to grow super slow</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and my hair is about an inch and a half longer.</li>
            <li> I was like ( its not true man thats a lie</li>
            <li> I wish I found out earlier; this is not good for your hair!!</li>
            <li> and I mean I didnt believe them at all</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel awful you can barely brush it after you get out of the shower even with conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I bought it cause I started to believe it just might work since I kept cutting my hair</li>
            <li> whatsoever.very disappointed</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t to bad either!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I used as directions said, but did not see any results</li>
            <li> the first time I tried it I fell in love I will have to get more thank you</li>
            <li> this shampoo do not work at all.....</li>
            <li> It smells funny and I have been using it for over 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see major hair growth</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know because I haven&#x27;t been able to use it because the directions are in Arabic and I don&#x27;t read Arabic</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me. In fact it dried my hair out even more and made it feel weak and brittle...definitely was NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to seeing a faster result, but apparently that didn&#x27;t happen. I wish I found out earlier; this is not good for your hair!! If you want to grow out your hair use sulfate free products!&lt;br /&gt;The product I now use is Fructis Triple Nutrition (I use their shampoo/conditioner and hair spray).&lt;br /&gt;Also a faster result is hair care treatments, on that I saw on youtube that&#x27;s given my fast amazing results is (2tbsp water,  2tbsp sugar 2tbsp spicy ground mustard, 1tbsp cinnamon powder and 1egg yolk; mix thoroughly and massage onto your scalp; leave on for 1hr the rinse with conditioner &amp;#34;I use head &amp; shoulders cause the person on youtube said the spicy ground mustard could cause dandruff, due to that conditioner I&#x27;ve never noticed any&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;Also main fact if you want growth don&#x27;t shampoo it everyday(It can&#x27;t take that)!!! I shampoo/condition only twice a week, condition it three times a week and just rinse it twice a week in different orders.</li>
            <li> i have african American permed hair and I got a hair cut Labor Day weekend so my hair was at my shoulders, the next month my hair was starting to reach my back. The only problem is the bottle came to me damaged but I love the smell of the product</li>
            <li> All this product did was make my hair dry and there were no English directions on it</li>
            <li> I have to say this stuff does not work whatsoever.very disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair and been using it for three and half weeks and it works great. I see the difference. I had bald patches in the back of my head and now its covered up. Of course it will take alittle longer to get there but i will purchase product again! I also received my package in great condition.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet, but then again I don&#x27;t know how. It&#x27;s not in English. Wish they told me that a head of time. I assume it&#x27;s just like normal shampoo. Can&#x27;t wait to see how it works. Fingers crossed that I am using it right. Not sure if I need to leave it in or wash out right away</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this stuff works! My mother got this for me after a slight chemical burn and it worked within a month after this spot in the middle of my head sat bare for about 4 months. I got the eyelash serum too and I saw results in thickness and length within two weeks and everything is still growing. I honestly would have overlooked this product myself, the label looks gimmicky. Thank goodness my mom went for it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Described perfectly. Delivered promptly. I&#x27;m very happy &amp; recommend this seller &amp; product.</li>
            <li> well...I have very thin hair that like to grow super slow so I bought this hoping for a miracle. It says it will grow your hair out in 7 days but I didn&#x27;t get a good result. So I&#x27;m hoping once I finish the bottle I will have better results than I do now! Fingers crossed! I do love the way it makes my hair feel and the smell isn&#x27;t to bad either!</li>
            <li> I just got it today no instructions.  it takes a whole month to get it. 8/6/2015</li>
            <li> OMG I love this product my hair growth is awesome I went from four inches to six just in weeks and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> It took too long then I expected</li>
            <li> It does work!!! I didnt believe the reviews and I mean I didnt believe them at all I was like ( its not true man thats a lie oh really) and so on and so on I was mostly doubting but I looked at mt hair and im mix witdifferent race so my hair is sensitive to products, like it gets dry or feels dirty but mostly dry anyway out of topic but I bought it cause I started to believe it just might work since I kept cutting my hair so I bought this shampoo and HEY IT WORKS!! I mean my hair was near my neck when I didn&#x27;t use this product the only long hair I had was on my right side there was just one long hair on my right side and the rest was just short. But now it&#x27;s all long to my shoulders so I&#x27;m gonna buy the shampoo and conditioner next time so my hair can grow and plus it smells pretty good</li>
            <li> First time I order this I doubt about this product. I used this almost a month and everybody says my hair is long. Feels like have more hair, too. I really satisfied and will order again until I make certain length I want.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo it works and it spells great...</li>
            <li> Good so far starting to see a difference:)</li>
            <li> I order this product to try something new for me shampoo is fine I use it &amp; I really can&#x27;t say soft hair .....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this shampoo, your hair will fall out, mine started to fall out after 1 week of use..once I stop useing this shampoo, my hair stopped falling out</li>
            <li> Ive Been using it for about a month now, and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any results. But it&#x27;s not written in English, so there may be some certain direction im not following correctly. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference. I used only this product till it was gone.  I get results from FAST shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell but it looks like it did grow a bit.</li>
            <li> This helps to make hair strong</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not arbaic that a Thailand language how do I know cause it my first language</li>
            <li> Not in english .package was super damaged</li>
            <li> Does not work and smells like someone crapped then sprayed a cheap perfume...please do not waste your hard earned money</li>
            <li> Thanks you  good  stuff  but  it  sink! Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, I use it every other time I shampoo and it seems to be working because I can see it on my roots....need more touch up more often because of growth.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel awful you can barely brush it after you get out of the shower even with conditioner. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Does make hair thicker, but still waiting to see a difference with the length</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and my hair is about an inch and a half longer. Do wish it was in english.</li>
