            <li>It smells so nice</li>
            <li>I often try new products in the hopes in finding the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>it, I&#x27;m happy and can justify the price since you won&#x27;t run out of it too quickly.</li>
            <li>and I can breakout very easily</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old, and this is the best cleanser that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps others who are hesitant to try it- try a sample with the muslim cloth first and you will believe all the great reviews</li>

            <li>Now both my face and my chest are very smooth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very smooth.</li>
            <li>when I ran out I had to buy more ...</li>
            <li>Amazingly refreshing...</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say more than my header, I love it.</li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s a reason why this is the number one product in Europe and why it has won so many awards-</li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s a reason why this is the number one product in Europe and why it has won so many awards-</li>
            <li>I must have read 30 reviews of this cleanser, many of which involved complaints about how this product smells.</li>
            <li>The cleanser thoroughly cleans my skin, removes my eye makeup and exfoliates better than my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>with what I am saving by not trying the latest &amp;#34;luxury cleanser,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Received a sample of this from a department store and fell in love.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions of how to use the product to get the most out of it.  </li>
            <li>I love buying skin care products.  </li>
            <li>After years of trying various premium skin care lines, I think the Eve Lom Cleanser is about as perfect as it gets.  </li>
            <li>Some people find this medicinal and offensive, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I used it, mostly I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this cleanser removes makeup, as well-</li>
            <li>I always read the reviews on &amp;#34;beautypedia.com,&amp;#34; which are written by a cosmetic chemist, and she has some problems with the formultion of this product, but I love th smell and the experience, and I like how moisturizing it is.  </li>
            <li>I was sure this would be my favorite cleanser for all of time</li>
            <li>I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it in the USA, and here it is on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The product is just ok.</li>
            <li>Fantastic cosmetic cleanser!</li>
            <li>This cleanser did more than that.</li>
            <li>Everything felt better after doing the routine 2-3 times a week before bed time.</li>
            <li>best facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>Wish it were a bit more affordable.</li>
            <li>Lots of parabens and oils in this cleanser that I should have known better to stay away from with my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have been using it for more then 10years</li>
            <li>There is none better.</li>
            <li>it works better than an exfoliant scrub.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but in this case, the results I have experienced from using this magical cleanser is worth taking the time to share so others can benefit!</li>
            <li>mild  and effective</li>
            <li>It leaves my face very smooth and clean, and I love that.</li>
            <li>I shall be a loyal customer forever! :)</li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser - pricey but a real treat and worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the silky feel of my skin after using this and I like its clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser has a strong herbal odor.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This product not only removes all makeup, it leaves your skin feeling super soft, bright and with perfect moisture balance.  </li>
            <li>I shall be a loyal customer forever!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 2 weeks I can already see a huge difference in the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks I can already see a huge difference in the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have an issue with any of these scents, then I suppose this cleanser is not for you, but you will be missing out on a truly wonderful cleanser.</li>
            <li>I just apply a light sunscreen in the morning after I wash, but that&#x27;s all you</li>
            <li>So far I have loved this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I received a sample in a Nordstrom&#x27;s order, and loved the balmy texture and the way my skin felt post cleansing.  </li>
            <li>:)makeup as now my skin glows naturally on its own.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>My skin felt and looked better the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>the texture doesn&#x27;t like original one, but the wash cloth looks like original one.</li>
            <li>I love the muslin cloth, it&#x27;s very gentle and the makeup washed right off!  </li>
            <li>So, when I heard how wonderful this product is, and that it has it&#x27;s own ritual, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li>and within less than a week&#x27;s use, my skin is soft and smooth, and my skin tone is already looking more even toned, no break outs and looks and feels flawless!</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and moisturized after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks greasy in the jar but rinses off clean and the cloth that comes with</li>
            <li>While I love the ritual using the muslin, I tend to hurry in the morning and don&#x27;t want to do the steps while I am trying to get 2 boys out the door and somehow get ready for work.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel nice and soft after cleansing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to get past for beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>First tried this product at the Cosmopolitan in Vegas and loved it...</li>
            <li>My dry sinuses loved the treatment, my puffiness disappeared and my skin was/is glowing.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I still LOVE my Clarisonic!  </li>
            <li>I also alternate this with another cleanser depending on my day, what my skin has been exposed to and how much time I feel like doing a good pamper.</li>
            <li>; and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I really love the concept of this moisturizer and wish they would develop a natural version.</li>
            <li>So, I like this, I think it smells nice, it really cleans my makeup completely off my face, even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this cleanser, I bought it through Amazon due to the excellent price.</li>
            <li>a pretty quick effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m just not convinced that a good portion of how I feel isn&#x27;t due to the muslin facecloth that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li>I also was hesitant upon first seeing the balm like consistency on my skin and was worried I would break out instantly, but amazingly, the combination of the cleanser and the cloth  has transformed my skin</li>
            <li>, there is no need to follow ALL those steps, just massage in for about a minute and then wipe with the cloth with water as warm as you can stand, rinse frequently then finish off by rinsing the cloth in cold water and apply to your face; it feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>It may be pricy, but for the little amount you use and the incredible results it gives, I would gladly pay ten times more for the results I am seeing and can finally go out in public with confidence and without having to wear layers of makeup as now my skin glows naturally on its own.</li>
            <li>I bought a few samples of Eve Lom&#x27;s cleanser (with the muslim cloth included)  and the immediate results I experienced after just one use are nothing short of extraordinary!</li>
            <li>So I am a bit of a Clarisonic fanatic, and think it deserves a lot of credit for my great skin.  </li>
            <li>I did receive a sample of Liz Earle Cleanser with hot cloth, but couldn&#x27;t find it on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, who is with me? ;)</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of daily use, my skin looked better than it had in a decade.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that if I used the cloth with another face wash, it would give me the same results.</li>
            <li>A bit expensive though it is totally worth the price!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to exfoliate once in a while but not for everyday.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very heavy, but it cleanses and rinses so light and leaves your skin impeccably cleansed and soft.  </li>
            <li>and this does not cause any breakouts and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft!</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, with those hard to remove blemish spots fading better than using a skin lightener.</li>
            <li>Love the light fragrance, and loves how it cleans w/o stripping my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>Made my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li>But it just has too many steps and very time consuming, it&#x27;s like having to give yourself a facial every night.</li>
            <li>the original has these white gritty stuff that acts as exfoliators, but this one doesn&#x27;t have it -- might not be authentic?</li>
            <li>I am super sensitive to beauty products, but had the chance to try a sample of Eve Lom Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Not for everyone, but certainly for cosmetic junkies.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product woke very well.</li>
            <li>I really feel like I&#x27;m at the spa</li>
            <li>It really does give you a glowing, radiant appearance.  </li>
            <li>It really does give you a glowing, radiant appearance.</li>
            <li>It is the one cleanser I have ever used that really cleans well while making you feel you have had a spa treatment.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>I get some more money I really want to try their other anti-ageing products.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is doing more than any other for my pores.  </li>
            <li>Use only a little to wash your face can make your face very soft and clean, I love this product!</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so clean but properly moisturized before.  </li>
            <li>I have now purchased the full size cleanser, rescue mask, and hydration serum and have finally found my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of skin care products!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This little bottle is the most luxurious thing a girl can have in her beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li>The same size sells on Sephora.com for ~$80. Would not buy if it wasn&#x27;t for this seller, thanks!!</li>
            <li>I actually take a facial wet wipe and do a quick wipe with to get the top layer of make up off</li>
            <li>This stuff works and is fantastic on my dry, aging 40 year old skin.</li>
            <li>Your makeup comes completely off and my face is left feeling so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I used it for a few days, exactly as directly, and I actually liked the process and the towel, but it felt VERY waxy on my skin and shortly thereafter I noticed the damage it had caused.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left w a hydrated, soft, and fresh face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch, but I did my research, in order to make sure that I purchased from the best seller and the stuff I received was no where near the consistency or</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>You then use the muslin cloth to do a hot water compress which is repeated several times before using the muslin cloth to exfoliate the face and wipe off the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I did not have problems with the enclosed muslin cloth like some other people, I quite enjoyed using it actually.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although slightly time-consuming I really enjoy the nightly ritual of the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I get the occasional blemish here and there, but I really wanted to see if Eve Lom would live up to the hype of giving that radiant appearance.  </li>
            <li>Thin lines are diminished, pores diminished, skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This product has four natural oils in it that give it a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; - chamomile, eucalyptus, clove and hops.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s glowing and so soft.</li>
            <li>off all makeup, and leaves your skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>This cleanser comes with a white muslin cloth, which you are supposed to use in this whole cleansing &amp;#34;ritual.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to just using Dove sensitive and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li>May be used on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old, have an oily T-zone, and am naturally concerned with wrinkles and sagging.  </li>
            <li>I think the product from this seller is expired or old.</li>
            <li>skin feels soft and moisturized after washing.</li>
            <li>After using this product for a few weeks, my skin definitely changed for the better.  </li>
            <li>I am asked frequently about my secret for nice skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in the next few weeks as this has already had a pretty quick effect.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think it was the main cause of my cheeks breaking out in tiny bumps.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried the Vaseline like texture and that it would make my skin more oily, but actually it did the opposite.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried the Vaseline like texture and that it would make my skin more oily, but actually it did the opposite.</li>
            <li>The process of it all really doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and moisturised</li>
            <li>Although the cleanser is not cheap I have found it to be worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>Not cheap but worth the money.  </li>
            <li>After each use my skin feels soft and supple (never tight or dry!).</li>
            <li>It not only cleansed my face, but it left a soft, supple, non-oily feel to my skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I found that the cleanser was great for my combination skin, working on both my oily T-zone and dehydration and even removed waterproof mascara.</li>

            <li> It smells so nice</li>
            <li> I often try new products in the hopes in finding the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li> it, I&#x27;m happy and can justify the price since you won&#x27;t run out of it too quickly.</li>
            <li> and I can breakout very easily</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old, and this is the best cleanser that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps others who are hesitant to try it- try a sample with the muslim cloth first and you will believe all the great reviews</li>

            <li> Now both my face and my chest are very smooth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very smooth.</li>
            <li> when I ran out I had to buy more ...</li>
            <li> Amazingly refreshing...</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say more than my header, I love it.</li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s a reason why this is the number one product in Europe and why it has won so many awards-</li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s a reason why this is the number one product in Europe and why it has won so many awards-</li>
            <li> I must have read 30 reviews of this cleanser, many of which involved complaints about how this product smells.</li>
            <li> The cleanser thoroughly cleans my skin, removes my eye makeup and exfoliates better than my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> with what I am saving by not trying the latest &amp;#34;luxury cleanser,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Received a sample of this from a department store and fell in love.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions of how to use the product to get the most out of it.  </li>
            <li> I love buying skin care products.  </li>
            <li> After years of trying various premium skin care lines, I think the Eve Lom Cleanser is about as perfect as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Some people find this medicinal and offensive, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I used it, mostly I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this cleanser removes makeup, as well-</li>
            <li> I always read the reviews on &amp;#34;beautypedia.com,&amp;#34; which are written by a cosmetic chemist, and she has some problems with the formultion of this product, but I love th smell and the experience, and I like how moisturizing it is.  </li>
            <li> I was sure this would be my favorite cleanser for all of time</li>
            <li> I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it in the USA, and here it is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The product is just ok.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cosmetic cleanser!</li>
            <li> This cleanser did more than that.</li>
            <li> Everything felt better after doing the routine 2-3 times a week before bed time.</li>
            <li> best facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> Wish it were a bit more affordable.</li>
            <li> Lots of parabens and oils in this cleanser that I should have known better to stay away from with my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> It is okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have been using it for more then 10years</li>
            <li> There is none better.</li>
            <li> it works better than an exfoliant scrub.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but in this case, the results I have experienced from using this magical cleanser is worth taking the time to share so others can benefit!</li>
            <li> mild  and effective</li>
            <li> It leaves my face very smooth and clean, and I love that.</li>
            <li> I shall be a loyal customer forever! :)</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser - pricey but a real treat and worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the silky feel of my skin after using this and I like its clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser has a strong herbal odor.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product not only removes all makeup, it leaves your skin feeling super soft, bright and with perfect moisture balance.  </li>
            <li> I shall be a loyal customer forever!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 2 weeks I can already see a huge difference in the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I can already see a huge difference in the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have an issue with any of these scents, then I suppose this cleanser is not for you, but you will be missing out on a truly wonderful cleanser.</li>
            <li> I just apply a light sunscreen in the morning after I wash, but that&#x27;s all you</li>
            <li> So far I have loved this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I received a sample in a Nordstrom&#x27;s order, and loved the balmy texture and the way my skin felt post cleansing.  </li>
            <li> :)makeup as now my skin glows naturally on its own.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> My skin felt and looked better the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> the texture doesn&#x27;t like original one, but the wash cloth looks like original one.</li>
            <li> I love the muslin cloth, it&#x27;s very gentle and the makeup washed right off!  </li>
            <li> So, when I heard how wonderful this product is, and that it has it&#x27;s own ritual, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> and within less than a week&#x27;s use, my skin is soft and smooth, and my skin tone is already looking more even toned, no break outs and looks and feels flawless!</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and moisturized after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks greasy in the jar but rinses off clean and the cloth that comes with</li>
            <li> While I love the ritual using the muslin, I tend to hurry in the morning and don&#x27;t want to do the steps while I am trying to get 2 boys out the door and somehow get ready for work.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel nice and soft after cleansing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to get past for beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> First tried this product at the Cosmopolitan in Vegas and loved it...</li>
            <li> My dry sinuses loved the treatment, my puffiness disappeared and my skin was/is glowing.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I still LOVE my Clarisonic!  </li>
            <li> I also alternate this with another cleanser depending on my day, what my skin has been exposed to and how much time I feel like doing a good pamper.</li>
            <li> ; and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I really love the concept of this moisturizer and wish they would develop a natural version.</li>
            <li> So, I like this, I think it smells nice, it really cleans my makeup completely off my face, even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this cleanser, I bought it through Amazon due to the excellent price.</li>
            <li> a pretty quick effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m just not convinced that a good portion of how I feel isn&#x27;t due to the muslin facecloth that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> I also was hesitant upon first seeing the balm like consistency on my skin and was worried I would break out instantly, but amazingly, the combination of the cleanser and the cloth  has transformed my skin</li>
            <li> , there is no need to follow ALL those steps, just massage in for about a minute and then wipe with the cloth with water as warm as you can stand, rinse frequently then finish off by rinsing the cloth in cold water and apply to your face; it feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> It may be pricy, but for the little amount you use and the incredible results it gives, I would gladly pay ten times more for the results I am seeing and can finally go out in public with confidence and without having to wear layers of makeup as now my skin glows naturally on its own.</li>
            <li> I bought a few samples of Eve Lom&#x27;s cleanser (with the muslim cloth included)  and the immediate results I experienced after just one use are nothing short of extraordinary!</li>
            <li> So I am a bit of a Clarisonic fanatic, and think it deserves a lot of credit for my great skin.  </li>
            <li> I did receive a sample of Liz Earle Cleanser with hot cloth, but couldn&#x27;t find it on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Ladies, who is with me? ;)</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of daily use, my skin looked better than it had in a decade.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that if I used the cloth with another face wash, it would give me the same results.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive though it is totally worth the price!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to exfoliate once in a while but not for everyday.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very heavy, but it cleanses and rinses so light and leaves your skin impeccably cleansed and soft.  </li>
            <li> and this does not cause any breakouts and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even, with those hard to remove blemish spots fading better than using a skin lightener.</li>
            <li> Love the light fragrance, and loves how it cleans w/o stripping my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> Made my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> But it just has too many steps and very time consuming, it&#x27;s like having to give yourself a facial every night.</li>
            <li> the original has these white gritty stuff that acts as exfoliators, but this one doesn&#x27;t have it -- might not be authentic?</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive to beauty products, but had the chance to try a sample of Eve Lom Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Not for everyone, but certainly for cosmetic junkies.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product woke very well.</li>
            <li> I really feel like I&#x27;m at the spa</li>
            <li> It really does give you a glowing, radiant appearance.  </li>
            <li> It really does give you a glowing, radiant appearance.</li>
            <li> It is the one cleanser I have ever used that really cleans well while making you feel you have had a spa treatment.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> I get some more money I really want to try their other anti-ageing products.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is doing more than any other for my pores.  </li>
            <li> Use only a little to wash your face can make your face very soft and clean, I love this product!</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so clean but properly moisturized before.  </li>
            <li> I have now purchased the full size cleanser, rescue mask, and hydration serum and have finally found my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of skin care products!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This little bottle is the most luxurious thing a girl can have in her beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> The same size sells on Sephora.com for ~$80. Would not buy if it wasn&#x27;t for this seller, thanks!!</li>
            <li> I actually take a facial wet wipe and do a quick wipe with to get the top layer of make up off</li>
            <li> This stuff works and is fantastic on my dry, aging 40 year old skin.</li>
            <li> Your makeup comes completely off and my face is left feeling so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days, exactly as directly, and I actually liked the process and the towel, but it felt VERY waxy on my skin and shortly thereafter I noticed the damage it had caused.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left w a hydrated, soft, and fresh face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch, but I did my research, in order to make sure that I purchased from the best seller and the stuff I received was no where near the consistency or</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> You then use the muslin cloth to do a hot water compress which is repeated several times before using the muslin cloth to exfoliate the face and wipe off the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I did not have problems with the enclosed muslin cloth like some other people, I quite enjoyed using it actually.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although slightly time-consuming I really enjoy the nightly ritual of the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I get the occasional blemish here and there, but I really wanted to see if Eve Lom would live up to the hype of giving that radiant appearance.  </li>
            <li> Thin lines are diminished, pores diminished, skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This product has four natural oils in it that give it a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; - chamomile, eucalyptus, clove and hops.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s glowing and so soft.</li>
            <li> off all makeup, and leaves your skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This cleanser comes with a white muslin cloth, which you are supposed to use in this whole cleansing &amp;#34;ritual.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched to just using Dove sensitive and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> May be used on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old, have an oily T-zone, and am naturally concerned with wrinkles and sagging.  </li>
            <li> I think the product from this seller is expired or old.</li>
            <li> skin feels soft and moisturized after washing.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks, my skin definitely changed for the better.  </li>
            <li> I am asked frequently about my secret for nice skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in the next few weeks as this has already had a pretty quick effect.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think it was the main cause of my cheeks breaking out in tiny bumps.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried the Vaseline like texture and that it would make my skin more oily, but actually it did the opposite.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried the Vaseline like texture and that it would make my skin more oily, but actually it did the opposite.</li>
            <li> The process of it all really doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and moisturised</li>
            <li> Although the cleanser is not cheap I have found it to be worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> Not cheap but worth the money.  </li>
            <li> After each use my skin feels soft and supple (never tight or dry!).</li>
            <li> It not only cleansed my face, but it left a soft, supple, non-oily feel to my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is the real deal, and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> so in reality you would end of spending just as much, if not more on skin products.  </li>
            <li> , I follow with the Muslin cloth and first steam with hot water then rinse in cold and hold it to my face till the coolness wears off and apply my cream.</li>
            <li> I was seriously hesitant at first.  </li>
            <li> I still wasn&#x27;t convinced that I would like it long term.  </li>
            <li> If you are hesitating because you think it will take too long at night, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and have always taken care of my skin but wanted something to combat and balance my skin during and after this long harsh winter of 2013-14.</li>
            <li> I have combination &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin- still suffer from break outs, am in my early 40&#x27;s  and have issues with past sun damage and uneven skin tone and old acne scars.</li>
            <li> AND you no longer need to spend extra $$ on toner and all that other skin stuff because this does it all....</li>
            <li> I will never use any other deep cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered this, at the recommendation of a magazine, that it&#x27;s a very thick cream that is supposed to be massaged onto the face and left on for a bit, then gently blotted off with the muslin cloth</li>
            <li> I am 47 with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Is it really better for skin than any other cleanser?  than plain old cold cream?  </li>
            <li> After moving to Florida, my skin was dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> I do like the washcloth that came with it and will use that as long as I can with other products.</li>
            <li> and I have not had a single break out or any irritation since I began using the cleanser!</li>
            <li> but after a month of using it I did seem to get quite congested - little white dots - on my chin.</li>
            <li> It has a strange smell and the texture isn&#x27;t the same as usual.</li>
            <li> Also, my chest was rough and bumpy from the sun.  </li>
            <li> I need to preface this by stating I don&#x27;t have problem skin, however I was curious to see how this product would stack up after reading tons of reviews on how your skin \\&quot;glows\\&quot; if used correctly.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in the next few weeks as this has already had</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and needed something that didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and tight after cleansing.</li>
            <li> You do a hot a cold cleanse, to open and close pores once finished.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Be very careful.</li>
            <li> For $70, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend risking getting a bad batch like I did and this isn&#x27;t the first cosmetic that I&#x27;ve purchased from amazon.com that has been crap and not as good as the brand.  </li>
            <li> when I got this one, the price went down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cancer survivor and have been trying to cut down on any petroleum-based products.</li>
            <li> Why would something with mineral oil as the main ingredient be so expensive?  </li>
            <li> I was a little disapointed in the Eve Lom cleanser.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t an added fragrance, so you aren&#x27;t smothering your skin in a heavily fragranced balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> Although I have experience with make up removers made of oil (DHC and Shiseido), I found this too thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li> Also keep in mind, a little goes a long way, so the $75 price tag is bit shocking, but this should last for months to come.</li>
            <li> even mascara, which is always tough.  </li>
            <li> The product I received smelled horrible, was almost green and gritty in consistency.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product woke very well.</li>
            <li> Awesome cleanser! I can see my skin is smoother only after two uses!</li>
            <li> I found that the cleanser was great for my combination skin, working on both my oily T-zone and dehydration and even removed waterproof mascara. It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized and I found that after several days usage my makeup applied easier and several people remarked on my radiant complexion.</li>
            <li> so good, so fast.thanks!</li>
            <li> First tried this product at the Cosmopolitan in Vegas and loved it...it&#x27;s awesome...when I ran out I had to buy more ...I use it all the time and its wonderful ..it&#x27;s a must.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and needed something that didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and tight after cleansing. So far I have loved this cleanser. Your makeup comes completely off and my face is left feeling so clean and soft. I will definitely be buying again!!!</li>
            <li> So I am a bit of a Clarisonic fanatic, and think it deserves a lot of credit for my great skin.  So, when I heard how wonderful this product is, and that it has it&#x27;s own ritual, I was skeptical.  I received a sample in a Nordstrom&#x27;s order, and loved the balmy texture and the way my skin felt post cleansing.  I still wasn&#x27;t convinced that I would like it long term.  Would it irritate or cause breakouts?  But, after 2 weeks of use, I love it!  My skin feels lovely, it removes makeup beautifully, and no breakouts.  So why the 4 stars?  Why not 5?  I only use it in the evenings.  While I love the ritual using the muslin, I tend to hurry in the morning and don&#x27;t want to do the steps while I am trying to get 2 boys out the door and somehow get ready for work.  Secondly, I still LOVE my Clarisonic!  So I keep my Eminence chamomile cleanser in the shower and wash my face using the Clarisonic in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had tried numerous cleansers, both drugstore and prestige, before being recommended Eve Lom cleanser.  Although the cleanser is not cheap I have found it to be worth every cent.  It is not like regular cleansers - it is almost like giving yourself a home facial every day.  The Eve Lom cleanser is not recommended as an apply and rinse-off product. There is a procedure to it, and the box contains the cleanser, a muslin cloth and an instruction leaflet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is applied to the entire face and massaged in.  You then use the muslin cloth to do a hot water compress which is repeated several times before using the muslin cloth to exfoliate the face and wipe off the cleanser.  The cloth should then be rinsed in cold water and used as a compress to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the cleanser was great for my combination skin, working on both my oily T-zone and dehydration and even removed waterproof mascara.  It left my skin feeling soft and moisturised and I found that after several days usage my makeup applied easier and several people remarked on my radiant complection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although slightly time-consuming I really enjoy the nightly ritual of the cleanser.  If I have the time in the morning I use this cleanser, or if pressed for time I use the morning time cleanser which is a simple rinse-off formula [[ASIN:B003U8204I Eve Lom Morning Time Cleanser, 125 ml]]</li>
            <li> Great cleanser - pricey but a real treat and worth it.</li>
            <li> not yet use it, BTW good.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch, but I did my research, in order to make sure that I purchased from the best seller and the stuff I received was no where near the consistency or how awesome everyone else said this product was.  The product I received smelled horrible, was almost green and gritty in consistency.  I&#x27;ve been suffering through using, hoping that it would do some miracle on my face, but it hasn&#x27;t and the smell .... ugh.  I did receive a sample of Liz Earle Cleanser with hot cloth, but couldn&#x27;t find it on amazon.com.  So, I tried this stuff.  For $70, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend risking getting a bad batch like I did and this isn&#x27;t the first cosmetic that I&#x27;ve purchased from amazon.com that has been crap and not as good as the brand.  I have the same issue with workout DVDs.  Be very careful.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  I was seriously hesitant at first.  It goes on very heavy, but it cleanses and rinses so light and leaves your skin impeccably cleansed and soft.  I have oily, weird and aging skin, and this product was a delight to use.  It not only cleansed my face, but it left a soft, supple, non-oily feel to my skin.  You won&#x27;t believe it until you&#x27;ve tried it.  Smells amazing, too!</li>
            <li> Love the light fragrance, and loves how it cleans w/o stripping my sensitive dry skin. I&#x27;m left w a hydrated, soft, and fresh face. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I was a little disapointed in the Eve Lom cleanser.  I don&#x27;t think it is quite cracked up to what is advertised.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered this, at the recommendation of a magazine, that it&#x27;s a very thick cream that is supposed to be massaged onto the face and left on for a bit, then gently blotted off with the muslin cloth it comes with. I&#x27;m a mom and I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to dedicate to my skin - I was just looking for an ultra-moisturizing cleanser. I haven&#x27;t even used it yet - I regret spending the money on it.</li>
            <li> Amazingly refreshing...especially if you follow the enclosed directions for using it to massage your face. My skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say more than my header, I love it. Smells nice, cleans good and exfoliates. I actually take a facial wet wipe and do a quick wipe with to get the top layer of make up off then I apply this, massage it in and leave on for about 5-10 minutes. It smells so nice and I like the feel of it on my face, I follow with the Muslin cloth and first steam with hot water then rinse in cold and hold it to my face till the coolness wears off and apply my cream. I also alternate this with another cleanser depending on my day, what my skin has been exposed to and how much time I feel like doing a good pamper.</li>
            <li> It could be the cleanser, it could be the massage routine that goes with it, it could be the muslin cloth...who knows? This stuff works and is fantastic on my dry, aging 40 year old skin. Just the umph I was looking for! Definatly worth the extra 10 minutes to say the least. I follow up with hyaluronic acid and La Mer face cream.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but in this case, the results I have experienced from using this magical cleanser is worth taking the time to share so others can benefit! I have combination &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin- still suffer from break outs, am in my early 40&#x27;s  and have issues with past sun damage and uneven skin tone and old acne scars. I have tried everything under the sun - between peels and dermatologist recommended products to home made &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34;- and NOTHING has worked as incredible as this cleanser! I bought a few samples of Eve Lom&#x27;s cleanser (with the muslim cloth included)  and the immediate results I experienced after just one use are nothing short of extraordinary! My face literally &amp;#34;glows&amp;#34;  (never thought I would ever see my skin glowing!) and within less than a week&#x27;s use, my skin is soft and smooth, and my skin tone is already looking more even toned, no break outs and looks and feels flawless! I no longer have to use layers of foundation, concealer, powder, etc to mimic the look of having beautiful skin- using the cleanser with the muslim cloth has given me the skin I have always dreamed about, but never thought I would ever have! I have now purchased the full size cleanser, rescue mask, and hydration serum and have finally found my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; of skin care products! I also was hesitant upon first seeing the balm like consistency on my skin and was worried I would break out instantly, but amazingly, the combination of the cleanser and the cloth  has transformed my skin and I have not had a single break out or any irritation since I began using the cleanser! I even got my boyfriend to try it and now he is sold on it too after seeing the immediate results from just using the cleanser once on his skin! It may be pricy, but for the little amount you use and the incredible results it gives, I would gladly pay ten times more for the results I am seeing and can finally go out in public with confidence and without having to wear layers of makeup as now my skin glows naturally on its own. I hope this review helps others who are hesitant to try it- try a sample with the muslim cloth first and you will believe all the great reviews - there&#x27;s a reason why this is the number one product in Europe and why it has won so many awards- it truly is the BEST product out there! Thank you Eve Lom for making this amazing product and giving me the skin I never thought I would ever have!! I shall be a loyal customer forever! :)makeup as now my skin glows naturally on its own.

            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful present.&lt;br /&gt;She likes it.&lt;br /&gt;But when I got this one, the price went down. Whatever it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks, my skin definitely changed for the better.  After moving to Florida, my skin was dry and rough.  Also, my chest was rough and bumpy from the sun.  I use the cleanser on my chest, too.  Now both my face and my chest are very smooth.  I am 60 years old, and this is the best cleanser that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I must have read 30 reviews of this cleanser, many of which involved complaints about how this product smells. This product has four natural oils in it that give it a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; - chamomile, eucalyptus, clove and hops. If you have an issue with any of these scents, then I suppose this cleanser is not for you, but you will be missing out on a truly wonderful cleanser. This product, along with the muslin cloth, have made my good skin incredible. My skin tone is more even, with those hard to remove blemish spots fading better than using a skin lightener. The cleanser thoroughly cleans my skin, removes my eye makeup and exfoliates better than my Clarisonic. There isn&#x27;t an added fragrance, so you aren&#x27;t smothering your skin in a heavily fragranced balm. This product is the real deal, and a little goes a very long way. Couple that with what I am saving by not trying the latest &amp;#34;luxury cleanser,&amp;#34; and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive to beauty products, but had the chance to try a sample of Eve Lom Cleanser.  It comes with a muslin wash cloth that is part of the cleaning process.  My face has never felt so clean but properly moisturized before.  I have become a lifetime fan.  To buy this from Nordstroms would have been double the price.</li>
            <li> Received a sample of this from a department store and fell in love. My skin feels wonderful after and despite the &amp;#34;petroleum jelly&amp;#34; look in the container there is zero greasiness.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser. Removes eye and skin makeup. Only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser! My skin is different after using it for three days. It&#x27;s glowing and so soft. Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> This little bottle is the most luxurious thing a girl can have in her beauty arsenal. The cleanser was recommended to me by a beauty consultant I met in LA. Her face was flawless so I had to ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im so happy to have eve lom in my beauty kit. I really feel like I&#x27;m at the spa whenever I do this at home. Which really should be everyday. It comes with a cloth thats specifc for eve lom products. You do a hot a cold cleanse, to open and close pores once finished. It removes even the toughest makeup - think eyeliner and mascara preventing next day raccoon eyes. Ladies, who is with me? ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it, I&#x27;m happy and can justify the price since you won&#x27;t run out of it too quickly.</li>
            <li> One of the best cleansers i&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Takes off all makeup, and leaves your skin soft and hydrated. The smell is wonderful to. Takes off eye makeup&lt;br /&gt;even waterproof mascara. One of my favorites always!</li>
            <li> My wife got this to try and she loves it so she bought the next size bigger the next time. Great product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I need to preface this by stating I don&#x27;t have problem skin, however I was curious to see how this product would stack up after reading tons of reviews on how your skin \\&quot;glows\\&quot; if used correctly.  I get the occasional blemish here and there, but I really wanted to see if Eve Lom would live up to the hype of giving that radiant appearance.  I have to say I am VERY impressed! I have been using it for about 2 weeks now.  I use it in the morning and evening, as I tend to be on the oily skin side and that was recommended.  After each use my skin feels soft and supple (never tight or dry!). I love the muslin cloth, it&#x27;s very gentle and the makeup washed right off!  The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell...but it&#x27;s easy to get past for beautiful skin.  Make sure you follow the directions of how to use the product to get the most out of it.  Also keep in mind, a little goes a long way, so the $75 price tag is bit shocking, but this should last for months to come. AND you no longer need to spend extra $$ on toner and all that other skin stuff because this does it all....so in reality you would end of spending just as much, if not more on skin products.  I just apply a light sunscreen in the morning after I wash, but that&#x27;s all you need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks I can already see a huge difference in the tone of my skin. It really does give you a glowing, radiant appearance.  Also, I had a few small blemishes (god I hate pms!) and they were gone within a couple days and haven&#x27;t had any since.  I was a little worried the Vaseline like texture and that it would make my skin more oily, but actually it did the opposite.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in the next few weeks as this has already had a pretty quick effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried everything out there, you must give Eve Lom a whirl! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel nice and soft after cleansing. But it just has too many steps and very time consuming, it&#x27;s like having to give yourself a facial every night.</li>
            <li> My skin felt and looked better the first day I used it. After 2 weeks of daily use, my skin looked better than it had in a decade. I highly recommend for &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there is no need to follow ALL those steps, just massage in for about a minute and then wipe with the cloth with water as warm as you can stand, rinse frequently then finish off by rinsing the cloth in cold water and apply to your face; it feels wonderful.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a very smooth. my skin so good.</li>
            <li> I admit it...I love buying skin care products.  I often try new products in the hopes in finding the perfect solution.  After years of trying various premium skin care lines, I think the Eve Lom Cleanser is about as perfect as it gets.  I am 47 with dry skin.  This product not only removes all makeup, it leaves your skin feeling super soft, bright and with perfect moisture balance.  After 60 days of use, the benefits are untold.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it took 10 years off my face, but it definitely slowed the progress.  Thin lines are diminished, pores diminished, skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this cleanser, I bought it through Amazon due to the excellent price. The cleanser has a strong herbal odor.  Like.. cloves. Some people find this medicinal and offensive, but I love it. This cleanser comes with a white muslin cloth, which you are supposed to use in this whole cleansing &amp;#34;ritual.&amp;#34;  Sometimes I used it, mostly I don&#x27;t.  I love the way this cleanser removes makeup, as well- even mascara, which is always tough.  Is it really better for skin than any other cleanser?  than plain old cold cream?  I&#x27;m not sure.  I always read the reviews on &amp;#34;beautypedia.com,&amp;#34; which are written by a cosmetic chemist, and she has some problems with the formultion of this product, but I love th smell and the experience, and I like how moisturizing it is.  Not for everyone, but certainly for cosmetic junkies.</li>
            <li> Oh man, what is it about this cleanser? I loved it. Made my face soft and clean. I did not have problems with the enclosed muslin cloth like some other people, I quite enjoyed using it actually. I was sure this would be my favorite cleanser for all of time but after a month of using it I did seem to get quite congested - little white dots - on my chin. Bummer. I really loved it until then. I&#x27;ve since switched to just using Dove sensitive and haven&#x27;t had any problems. It&#x27;s cheaper too! I still look at the remainder of this container in my bathroom though and am so tempted to use it... :(</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this as well as the SPF 15 moisturizer when I saw the chemicals in them. I&#x27;m a cancer survivor and have been trying to cut down on any petroleum-based products. I really love the concept of this moisturizer and wish they would develop a natural version.</li>
            <li> Use only a little to wash your face can make your face very soft and clean, I love this product!</li>
            <li> May be used on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;In the evening after using skin care and sleep the next day can feel the changes in the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old, have an oily T-zone, and am naturally concerned with wrinkles and sagging.  This cleanser is doing more than any other for my pores.  It also is an amazing moisturizing cleanser that makes my skin radiant.</li>
            <li> Bought two for my wife, I think she‘d like it~</li>
            <li> I discovered this product while living in London, and have been using it for about 9 years now. I will never switch to another cleanser. It is like giving yourself a mini facial while taking every trace of makeup off of your face. I can&#x27;t live without it. I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it in the USA, and here it is on Amazon. Thank goodness! Update: I think the product from this seller is expired or old. It has a strange smell and the texture isn&#x27;t the same as usual. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years so I should know. Will buy from Sephora from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  My face feels clean and moisturized after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like giving yourself a mini facial each time!  Comes with one muslin cloth.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser. I use it every night as they suggest and it works like a charm. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and gets make-up off my face even after I&#x27;ve used my make-up removers. Love this stuff! Recommend buying the cloths with it!</li>
            <li> The product is just ok. It&#x27;s good to exfoliate once in a while but not for everyday.  That is all.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cosmetic cleanser!</li>
            <li> Love Eve Lom! This cleanser is the bomb! I have acne prone skin and this does not cause any breakouts and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is wonderful. Leaves no trace of makeup and is a joy to use. I am 50 years old and have always taken care of my skin but wanted something to combat and balance my skin during and after this long harsh winter of 2013-14. This cleanser did more than that. Everything felt better after doing the routine 2-3 times a week before bed time. My dry sinuses loved the treatment, my puffiness disappeared and my skin was/is glowing. A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;When I get some more money I really want to try their other anti-ageing products.</li>
            <li> It is the one cleanser I have ever used that really cleans well while making you feel you have had a spa treatment.  I will never use any other deep cleanser.  Not cheap but worth the money.  A little goes a long way!  Love it!</li>
            <li> So, I like this, I think it smells nice, it really cleans my makeup completely off my face, even waterproof mascara. It leaves my face very smooth and clean, and I love that. However, I&#x27;m just not convinced that a good portion of how I feel isn&#x27;t due to the muslin facecloth that&#x27;s included. That thing is great. I am pretty sure that if I used the cloth with another face wash, it would give me the same results. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!! I got a trial size of this the last time I was at Nordstrom and I couldn&#x27;t believe something that looked like it was going to make my face breakout, didn&#x27;t! I have very sensitive skin and I can breakout very easily and this is actually improving my skin!! I have only been using for a week and I love it! If you are hesitating because you think it will take too long at night, don&#x27;t. The process of it all really doesn&#x27;t take long at all. I will definitely buy again!!!! Love love LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product. A bit expensive though it is totally worth the price!!!!!! My friend also love this!</li>
            <li> Great deal for this product. The same size sells on Sephora.com for ~$80. Would not buy if it wasn&#x27;t for this seller, thanks!!</li>
            <li> excellent product . best facial cleaner. mild  and effective</li>
            <li> Best makeup remover product I ever bought! Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft and moisturized after washing.</li>
            <li> I love the silky feel of my skin after using this and I like its clean fragrance.  Wish it were a bit more affordable.</li>
            <li> Although I have experience with make up removers made of oil (DHC and Shiseido), I found this too thick and greasy.  I didn&#x27;t care for the consistency or the smell.  Why would something with mineral oil as the main ingredient be so expensive?  I do like the washcloth that came with it and will use that as long as I can with other products.</li>
            <li> the original has these white gritty stuff that acts as exfoliators, but this one doesn&#x27;t have it -- might not be authentic?</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me. In fact, I think it was the main cause of my cheeks breaking out in tiny bumps. Lots of parabens and oils in this cleanser that I should have known better to stay away from with my acne-prone skin. I used it for a few days, exactly as directly, and I actually liked the process and the towel, but it felt VERY waxy on my skin and shortly thereafter I noticed the damage it had caused.</li>
            <li> It is okay. Bcz the texture doesn&#x27;t like original one, but the wash cloth looks like original one.</li>
            <li> the best makeup remover ever.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using it for more then 10years and this is the best price</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for 13 years. There is none better. Well worth the price. I am asked frequently about my secret for nice skin. This is it!</li>
            <li> I love Eve Lom cleanser and am happy to have found it on Amazon at a fair price. Works great. Looks greasy in the jar but rinses off clean and the cloth that comes with it works better than an exfoliant scrub.</li>
