            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>of making your own, this is the best toothpaste out there for people who care what goes into their bodies</li>
            <li>Which is not at all uncommon when dealing with edible dirt.  </li>
            <li>Great formula.</li>
            <li>tastes good.</li>
            <li>anyone know of a good Non-Flouride toothpaste?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great flavor, great price, easy to get use to.</li>
            <li>(I will say Lemon is head over heels my FAVORITE, but this stuff is great.)  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The best part is the great list of ingredients with no extra chemicals or stuff you don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>Spearmint honestly reminds me of stomach acid</li>
            <li>Stay leaves a nice, polished feel though.</li>
            <li>It does a great job keeping his teeth clean and he likes the flavor.  </li>
            <li>Good flavor, and your teeth feel pearly smooth after use.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an all natural toothpaste with a great flavor, this is it!</li>
            <li>the taste is nice and it makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>and I received it quickly and in good condition</li>
            <li>Does being healthy have to hurt?</li>
            <li>daughter uses the lemon flavor and her breath is so much better.</li>
            <li>and I doubt there is anything to worry about, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a decisive answer on that either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit to get used to the idea of brushing your teeth with toothpaste that is not white, but aside from that, this is the best toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li>And I have lots of friends who use this and love it.  </li>
            <li>How anyone can use this more than twice is beyond me.  </li>
            <li>I love Earthpaste</li>
            <li>Love the cinnamon and lemon better</li>
            <li>i have basically eliminated MOST if not all chemicals from my life..</li>
            <li>After i did some more research on xylitol</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the toothpaste though.</li>
            <li>but I LOVE the Spearmint Earthpaste.  </li>
            <li>But the taste is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this paste.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste, not this flavor.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the great product and if i may suggest, next product you come out with should be completely/or partly organic, which i believe would get the attention of more customers! :)</li>
            <li>I like all the minty flavors and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li>I have been using Earthpaste now for months and my hygienist said my teeth are very clean.</li>
            <li>Great natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li>A toxin free healthy way to brush with a minty flavor.  </li>
            <li>I almost gagged because of how sweet it seemed to my adjusted taste buds!</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste from the first use!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be put off the &amp;#34;extra strong&amp;#34; on the label - the spearmint flavor isn&#x27;t overly strong and leaves a clean taste lingering in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I experienced definite sensitivity with this paste which I have never had a problem with before.  </li>
            <li>My son is allergic to corn and this toothpaste is corn free.  </li>
            <li>Not the best for organic toothpaste with few chemicals/ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I imagine this is a great toothpaste for people with certain health concerns or trying to avoid particular ingredients.  </li>
            <li>granted many people will order this, take a glance at the color and the feel of the paste and wonder if they made the right decision.</li>
            <li>New favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>This may be my new preferred toothpaste and will order more :)</li>
            <li>It tastes just like chewing on a fresh mint leaf!</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth feeling clean and my breath feeling fresh!</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this and appreciate how much more natural it is.</li>
            <li>the difference is noticeable, not just in the look of them, but in the way they clean.</li>
            <li>but I never felt clean either.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t very impressed my first week because I was hoping for sensitivity to be less of a problem</li>
            <li>cleans as good as other flavors, but I&#x27;ve found that the flavor is not as enjoyable as, say, peppermint</li>
            <li>love this spearmint toothpaste &amp; the lemon too (more like tangerine citrus) has which has become my favorite mostly because it&#x27;s a new &amp; different flavor.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to have found such a simple, natural and effective toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try something new and better for my teeth.</li>
            <li>There is a warning on the label that says may contain trace amounts of lead; not for pregnant women or children.  </li>
            <li>Well i specifically bought this because i was looking for a non-chemical toothpaste to use while pregnant.  </li>
            <li>This is by far our favorite flavor of Earthpaste, the kids even love it more than the Lemon, although Lemon comes in at a close second!</li>
            <li>Amazing how after a couple months of using this toothpaste, I was at a friend&#x27;s house and tried regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>its great knowing that its all natural and nothing you cant pronounce is added to it like the regular stuff.  </li>
            <li>to the warning label regarding traces of lead in the product as required by the state of California - so far I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything online that suggests this warning is anything but</li>
            <li>In the beginning i honestly wasn&#x27;t use to this toothpaste because it was brown instead of white</li>
            <li>This was a shock to me, it was SLS free, Fluoride free, and had no harsh chemicals or scents or whatever else</li>
            <li>The only kind of toothpaste I use now.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>But I am of the mindset that you pay a bit more to take care of yourself naturally, herbally,</li>
            <li>Thank you Redmond for making a toothpaste free of sugar/sweetener yet full of all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>I took my time and did a lot of research to find the right toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It has a decent taste and leaves my mouth feeling clean, will buy again.</li>
            <li>Love this and makes my teeth feel great, but only 4 stars because they are still listing Tea Tree oil as the last ingredient, which studies have recently found to be detrimental to your oral health.</li>
            <li>I have recently become much more concerned for my health and the chemicals i come into contact with.</li>
            <li>so i felt compelled to tell others about the fact that fluoride isnt exactly all its made out to be.</li>
            <li>My first time trying Earthpaste</li>
            <li>Do be aware that there is a label on it that warns you of trace amounts of lead.  </li>
            <li>and I tossed out the ones I ordered upon my first usage.  </li>
            <li>Spearmint extra strength is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and will never go back to toothpaste...</li>
            <li>It has a good flavor and it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals and foaming agents.  </li>
            <li>, teeth feel very clean after brushing and the mint is enough to flavor it but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>the last thing that  has concerned me was finding an organic natural deodorant and a really good natural tooth</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>but I really could not get used to the taste.</li>
            <li>It was very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>THEN the real kicker for me was there was a bug in my tube.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about Redmond</li>
            <li>but they seem promising.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon and wintergreen are the only flavors I enjoy using.  </li>
            <li>It really needs a touch of sweetness for the spearmint.</li>
            <li>Earthpaste cleans better then the other brand</li>
            <li>and it didnt foam in my mouth which made me question and get concerned that it wasnt going to clean my teeth properly.</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean even though I only brush once a day ( at night.)</li>
            <li>main ingredient, Redmond Clay, as well as Real Salt come from Redmond, Utah.</li>
            <li>It has a good flavor also a slight salty flavor but not gross.</li>
            <li>It may need to be shaken from time to time, but your teeth feel clean for a long time.</li>
            <li>these products are not sticky gooey, do not foam up in your mouth &amp; rinse well leaving mouth fresh &amp; teeth smooth &amp; slick.</li>
            <li>i realized that this toothpaste is so much healthier and better for you then any other one just based on the fact that it only uses natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>and I very much enjoy this flavor along with the other four.</li>
            <li>The flavor I tried was their new Spearmint which is unsweetened</li>
            <li>I like the new experience of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Just because something foams or looks more like the average toothpaste doesnt mean it is healthy for you.</li>
            <li>Glad there is an option without xylitol, as there are equal good and bad reviews of this ingredient.</li>
            <li>I also just started trying the Desert Essence mint, and so far no sensitivity to that</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line - of the three natural toothpastes I have tried so far: Earthpaste, Auromere and Desert</li>
            <li>This toothpaste does have a wonderfully natural mint flavor, though.  </li>
            <li>have been searching for natural toothpaste for some time now</li>
            <li>While i was on amazon shopping for natural tooth paste</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is because it is natural and there are no chemicals in it</li>
            <li>It is a different experience than other toothpaste products, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Out of fear i decided to use Earthpaste for only a few weeks before going to xylitol and in the beginning i really thought i was making the right decision.</li>
            <li>One thing I wasn&#x27;t aware of was the &amp;#34;trace amounts of lead.&amp;#34; The packaging has to list that, but it also makes the point that organic kale, tomatoes, and other organic vegetables have trace amounts of lead.</li>
            <li>The essential oils are wild crafted food grade oils from Sri Lanka.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my recent quest for a natural toothpaste without chemicals and added sweeteners I was very drawn to Earthpaste due to the minimal ingredients, which are as basic as it gets.  </li>
            <li>In reading reviews for other natural toothpastes apparently mint can cause problems with sensitivity</li>
            <li>although it was still much healthier then any of the other branded toothpastes you will find in your supermarket, it was still concerning to find some chemicals in there that were not natural.</li>

            <li> these products are not sticky gooey, do not foam up in your mouth &amp; rinse well leaving mouth fresh &amp; teeth smooth &amp; slick.</li>
            <li> i realized that this toothpaste is so much healthier and better for you then any other one just based on the fact that it only uses natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> and I very much enjoy this flavor along with the other four.</li>
            <li> The flavor I tried was their new Spearmint which is unsweetened</li>
            <li> I like the new experience of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Just because something foams or looks more like the average toothpaste doesnt mean it is healthy for you.</li>
            <li> Glad there is an option without xylitol, as there are equal good and bad reviews of this ingredient.</li>
            <li> I also just started trying the Desert Essence mint, and so far no sensitivity to that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line - of the three natural toothpastes I have tried so far: Earthpaste, Auromere and Desert</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does have a wonderfully natural mint flavor, though.  </li>
            <li> have been searching for natural toothpaste for some time now</li>
            <li> While i was on amazon shopping for natural tooth paste</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is because it is natural and there are no chemicals in it</li>
            <li> It is a different experience than other toothpaste products, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Out of fear i decided to use Earthpaste for only a few weeks before going to xylitol and in the beginning i really thought i was making the right decision.</li>
            <li> One thing I wasn&#x27;t aware of was the &amp;#34;trace amounts of lead.&amp;#34; The packaging has to list that, but it also makes the point that organic kale, tomatoes, and other organic vegetables have trace amounts of lead.</li>
            <li> The essential oils are wild crafted food grade oils from Sri Lanka.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my recent quest for a natural toothpaste without chemicals and added sweeteners I was very drawn to Earthpaste due to the minimal ingredients, which are as basic as it gets.  </li>
            <li> In reading reviews for other natural toothpastes apparently mint can cause problems with sensitivity</li>
            <li> although it was still much healthier then any of the other branded toothpastes you will find in your supermarket, it was still concerning to find some chemicals in there that were not natural.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t bother me that the toothpaste was brown (as some other natural toothpastes also are.)  </li>
            <li> so much so that usually the scent puts me off immediately.  </li>
            <li> I previously used Colgate Cinnamon, and the Auromere natural toothpaste I have been trying along with the Earthpaste is &amp;#34;non-mint&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Not that I plan on ingesting this stuff, but a certain amount would be hard to avoid.  </li>
            <li> but hey people...supply and demand, if they were selling the amount that Colgate Total sells I am sure it would be less expensive.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling SO fresh, like dentist level clean, but without all the crap in it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t sweetened, so that was strange for me (but</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the past from a store that was quite far from my house.  </li>
            <li> the brown color is weird only at first.</li>
            <li> My teeth are significantly whiter and not sensitive to cold</li>
            <li> It works well and do not consider it to be bitter at all, though it may take a couple days to get used to the taste when switching from a chemical-heavy brand.</li>
            <li> I am REALLY not a fan of spearmint...</li>
            <li> (their other flavors do have Xylitol.)  </li>
            <li> the other brands add to their tooth paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i can have this delivered to me every other month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will be back in a few months and update everyone with how its going with this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> this toothpaste is not sweet and it doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste too bad and gets my mouth clean without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I tried every flavor and found that they are be a little stung in flavor.  </li>
            <li> and it was just sitting on the shelf for a few months</li>
            <li> California being its usual self</li>
            <li> Suggest for anyone that doesnt want to be exposed to fluoride&#x27;s deadly effects!</li>
            <li> While using xylitol the past 1</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird</li>
            <li> but i felt it was getting worse.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like was the consistency of the paste which turns runny in your mouth and makes it difficult to brush your teeth without it drooling out.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> and i was using that for over 1 year until it came to my attention that they had some questionable ingredients (which i wont get into).</li>
            <li> Needless to say, never again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend switching from all the cruddy pharmaceutical toothpastes loaded with crap to Earthpaste.  </li>
            <li> My breathe didn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> My kids hate its taste.</li>
            <li> Tastes awful.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely nasty!  </li>

            <li> Yuck!  Tastes awful.  Does being healthy have to hurt?</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a month. It works well and do not consider it to be bitter at all, though it may take a couple days to get used to the taste when switching from a chemical-heavy brand.</li>
            <li> A toxin free healthy way to brush with a minty flavor.  Love it!</li>
            <li> New favorite toothpaste! My teeth are significantly whiter and not sensitive to cold anymore.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses the lemon flavor and her breath is so much better.</li>
            <li> I have been using name brand toothpaste my entire life but when I decided to kick anything fluoride I went and purchased this.  Of course it is WAY different than what youll be used to but its great knowing that its all natural and nothing you cant pronounce is added to it like the regular stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t have foaming agents either so you will need to get used to that also.  It has a decent taste and leaves my mouth feeling clean, will buy again.</li>
            <li> love this spearmint toothpaste &amp; the lemon too (more like tangerine citrus) has which has become my favorite mostly because it&#x27;s a new &amp; different flavor. these products are not sticky gooey, do not foam up in your mouth &amp; rinse well leaving mouth fresh &amp; teeth smooth &amp; slick. wonderful stuff !!!</li>
            <li> Good flavor, and your teeth feel pearly smooth after use. Will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> On my recent quest for a natural toothpaste without chemicals and added sweeteners I was very drawn to Earthpaste due to the minimal ingredients, which are as basic as it gets.  The flavor I tried was their new Spearmint which is unsweetened (their other flavors do have Xylitol.)  Don&#x27;t be put off the &amp;#34;extra strong&amp;#34; on the label - the spearmint flavor isn&#x27;t overly strong and leaves a clean taste lingering in your mouth.  It also didn&#x27;t bother me that the toothpaste was brown (as some other natural toothpastes also are.)  What I didn&#x27;t like was the consistency of the paste which turns runny in your mouth and makes it difficult to brush your teeth without it drooling out.  I don&#x27;t need a foaming sensation, but there was no substance/cohesiveness and I felt like I had to use a lot of toothpaste (I probably didn&#x27;t but that&#x27;s what it felt like.)  I found myself loading up my toothbrush and sometimes twice for a second pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I experienced definite sensitivity with this paste which I have never had a problem with before.  In reading reviews for other natural toothpastes apparently mint can cause problems with sensitivity so maybe it&#x27;s the mint and not necessarily the toothpaste. I previously used Colgate Cinnamon, and the Auromere natural toothpaste I have been trying along with the Earthpaste is &amp;#34;non-mint&amp;#34;.  I like the Auromere a lot but the non-mint is actually licorice flavored which I don&#x27;t care for, and I will be trying their mint flavor next.  I also just started trying the Desert Essence mint, and so far no sensitivity to that but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the warning label regarding traces of lead in the product as required by the state of California - so far I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything online that suggests this warning is anything but California being its usual self and I doubt there is anything to worry about, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a decisive answer on that either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - of the three natural toothpastes I have tried so far: Earthpaste, Auromere and Desert Essence - I much prefer the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shipment came from Highland Health and I received it quickly and in good condition - I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste from the first use!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste too bad and gets my mouth clean without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  It has a good flavor and it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals and foaming agents.  I purchased this in the past from a store that was quite far from my house.  I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.  I will order this over and over again.</li>
            <li> Sorry but I really could not get used to the taste. It was very &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to the idea of brushing your teeth with toothpaste that is not white, but aside from that, this is the best toothpaste out there. I like all the minty flavors and my mouth feels very clean. The best part is the great list of ingredients with no extra chemicals or stuff you don&#x27;t need. I took my time and did a lot of research to find the right toothpaste. I have been using Earthpaste now for months and my hygienist said my teeth are very clean.</li>
            <li> great toothpaste!  the brown color is weird only at first. the taste is nice and it makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Great natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I imagine this is a great toothpaste for people with certain health concerns or trying to avoid particular ingredients.  I was concerned about a healthful toothpaste and something without fluoride.  And I have lots of friends who use this and love it.  But I think I&#x27;ll stick with my fluoride-free Cr&amp;egrave;me de Mint toothpaste by Nature&#x27;s Gate for now, because I miss the feel of foam and the stronger mint flavor.  This toothpaste does have a wonderfully natural mint flavor, though.  It tastes just like chewing on a fresh mint leaf!</li>
            <li> It is a different experience than other toothpaste products, but that&#x27;s fine. One thing I wasn&#x27;t aware of was the &amp;#34;trace amounts of lead.&amp;#34; The packaging has to list that, but it also makes the point that organic kale, tomatoes, and other organic vegetables have trace amounts of lead. Not that I plan on ingesting this stuff, but a certain amount would be hard to avoid.  I wonder why organic vegetables are not required to disclose the presence of trace amounts of lead?  Maybe there&#x27;s a threshold that this toothpaste surpassed?</li>
            <li> Works great! Would recommend to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> Thank you Redmond for making a toothpaste free of sugar/sweetener yet full of all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> PROS: Great flavor, great price, easy to get use to. Suggest for anyone that doesnt want to be exposed to fluoride&#x27;s deadly effects!</li>
            <li> Amazing how after a couple months of using this toothpaste, I was at a friend&#x27;s house and tried regular toothpaste. I almost gagged because of how sweet it seemed to my adjusted taste buds! Love the feel of this and appreciate how much more natural it is. Spearmint has a stronger taste than peppermint version, which I like.</li>
            <li> My son is allergic to corn and this toothpaste is corn free.  It does a great job keeping his teeth clean and he likes the flavor.  I also use the wintergreen flavor and the clay leaves my mouth feeling like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nasty!  How anyone can use this more than twice is beyond me.  And the clay taste stays with you for hours!</li>
            <li> My kids hate its taste.</li>
            <li> I love Earthpaste and I very much enjoy this flavor along with the other four. I am very happy to have found such a simple, natural and effective toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love the cinnamon and lemon better</li>
            <li> Took me about a month to get used to a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t foam.  After I did I can&#x27;t imagine going back, teeth feel very clean after brushing and the mint is enough to flavor it but not overpowering.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have recently become much more concerned for my health and the chemicals i come into contact with. i have basically eliminated MOST if not all chemicals from my life..the last thing that  has concerned me was finding an organic natural deodorant and a really good natural tooth paste.&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for natural toothpaste for some time now, i used another brand by the name xylitol and i was using that for over 1 year until it came to my attention that they had some questionable ingredients (which i wont get into). While using xylitol the past 1+ years i had no issues with my teeth, no cavities, no staining etc so i felt compelled to tell others about the fact that fluoride isnt exactly all its made out to be. While i was on amazon shopping for natural tooth paste i purchased xylitol and i also purchased this toothpaste so i can do a side by side review. In the beginning i honestly wasn&#x27;t use to this toothpaste because it was brown instead of white and it didnt foam in my mouth which made me question and get concerned that it wasnt going to clean my teeth properly. Out of fear i decided to use Earthpaste for only a few weeks before going to xylitol and in the beginning i really thought i was making the right decision. (fyi During the weeks i used earthpaste i never had any issues with my teeth.) I also never threw away my EarthPaste and it was just sitting on the shelf for a few months, i thought when i ran out of xylitol i would just use this. After i did some more research on xylitol i realized that i did make a mistake...although it was still much healthier then any of the other branded toothpastes you will find in your supermarket, it was still concerning to find some chemicals in there that were not natural. So i came back on Amazon and started looking again until i came to this page...i realized that this toothpaste is so much healthier and better for you then any other one just based on the fact that it only uses natural ingredients! This was a shock to me, it was SLS free, Fluoride free, and had no harsh chemicals or scents or whatever else the other brands add to their tooth paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now granted many people will order this, take a glance at the color and the feel of the paste and wonder if they made the right decision. I did the same thing. Just because something foams or looks more like the average toothpaste doesnt mean it is healthy for you. I brushed my teeth with xylitol, ate some food and then came back to brush my teeth with Earthpaste....the difference is noticeable, not just in the look of them, but in the way they clean. Earthpaste cleans better then the other brand and i can actually feel the difference on my teeth. I am going to find the subscribe button so i can have this delivered to me every other month. Earthpaste, you have a customer for life. Thank you for the great product and if i may suggest, next product you come out with should be completely/or partly organic, which i believe would get the attention of more customers! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will be back in a few months and update everyone with how its going with this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try something new and better for my teeth. Wasn&#x27;t very impressed my first week because I was hoping for sensitivity to be less of a problem but i felt it was getting worse. My breathe didn&#x27;t smell bad but I never felt clean either. THEN the real kicker for me was there was a bug in my tube. Needless to say, never again.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste is not sweet and it doesn&#x27;t foam. My teeth are clean even though I only brush once a day ( at night.) I asked the manufacturer about the ingredients, and this is their response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The main ingredient, Redmond Clay, as well as Real Salt come from Redmond, Utah. The essential oils are wild crafted food grade oils from Sri Lanka. The food grade Non GMO Xylitol (in all flavors except for the Spearmint) is both corn and birch derived and is from China. These ingredients are mixed and packaged in Utah.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short of making your own, this is the best toothpaste out there for people who care what goes into their bodies</li>
            <li> I do like it, but it takes some getting used to as it does not have a foaming agent.</li>
            <li> My first time trying Earthpaste and I love it. Don&#x27;t know much about Redmond but they seem promising. It&#x27;s a little weird I guess being mud and all but I like it. tastes good. This may be my new preferred toothpaste and will order more :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t sweetened, so that was strange for me (but my fault for not reading). Love the toothpaste though. Leaves my teeth feeling clean and my breath feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!  There is a warning on the label that says may contain trace amounts of lead; not for pregnant women or children.  Well i specifically bought this because i was looking for a non-chemical toothpaste to use while pregnant.  If I am misinformed on this topic, someone please educate me.  I cannot understand why anyone would use this.</li>
            <li> Not the best for organic toothpaste with few chemicals/ingredients.  Do be aware that there is a label on it that warns you of trace amounts of lead.  Which is not at all uncommon when dealing with edible dirt.  I tried every flavor and found that they are be a little stung in flavor.  Spearmint honestly reminds me of stomach acid and I tossed out the ones I ordered upon my first usage.  Cinnamon and wintergreen are the only flavors I enjoy using.  Do be forewarned that this type of toothpaste does not protect you against cavities.</li>
            <li> Love this and makes my teeth feel great, but only 4 stars because they are still listing Tea Tree oil as the last ingredient, which studies have recently found to be detrimental to your oral health.</li>
            <li> It may need to be shaken from time to time, but your teeth feel clean for a long time. I would like it to come in travel sizes. I have shared it with my family.</li>
            <li> The only kind of toothpaste I use now. Simple and effective. Great formula. Spearmint extra strength is my favorite.</li>
            <li> cleans as good as other flavors, but I&#x27;ve found that the flavor is not as enjoyable as, say, peppermint (and I&#x27;m a fan of the mints). Stay leaves a nice, polished feel though.</li>
            <li> This is by far our favorite flavor of Earthpaste, the kids even love it more than the Lemon, although Lemon comes in at a close second! If you are looking for an all natural toothpaste with a great flavor, this is it!</li>
            <li> I am REALLY not a fan of spearmint...so much so that usually the scent puts me off immediately.  This stuff is fantastic.  I don&#x27;t know if it is because it is natural and there are no chemicals in it but I LOVE the Spearmint Earthpaste.  (I will say Lemon is head over heels my FAVORITE, but this stuff is great.)  No, it doesn&#x27;t foam...so if you can&#x27;t deal with that don&#x27;t buy it.  But the taste is phenomenal.  AH-MAAAZING!!!  I absolutely LOVE this paste.  It leaves your teeth feeling SO fresh, like dentist level clean, but without all the crap in it.  I highly recommend switching from all the cruddy pharmaceutical toothpastes loaded with crap to Earthpaste.  Is it a bit pricey?  Yeah, but hey people...supply and demand, if they were selling the amount that Colgate Total sells I am sure it would be less expensive.  But I am of the mindset that you pay a bit more to take care of yourself naturally, herbally, organically NOW instead of with drugs later.  This stuff rocks.  I LOVE it and will never go back to toothpaste...I love my mud!!!</li>
            <li> Without glycerin, toothpaste does not make suds - but who says that it should? I like the new experience of this toothpaste. Hoping to see an improvement in the health of my teeth. Glad there is an option without xylitol, as there are equal good and bad reviews of this ingredient.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste, not this flavor. It really needs a touch of sweetness for the spearmint. The lemon is great(and kid approved) as well as the cinnamon. The peppermint is torture to our kids.</li>
            <li> I wasnted to buy a Non-Fluoride toothpaste but this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients says it contains trace amounts of lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know of a good Non-Flouride toothpaste?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not trust Tom&#x27;s of Maine I read there paste conatins aluminum.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste! It has a good flavor also a slight salty flavor but not gross.</li>
