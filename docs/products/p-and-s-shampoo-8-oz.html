            <li>I thought this would be great to use after the P &amp; S hair liquid.</li>
            <li>Great product otherwise.</li>
            <li>Delivery was on time and very nicely pack.</li>
            <li>price was good</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used this many times before!</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great product quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Shampoos the oil out easily!</li>
            <li>It does the trick &amp; smells good &amp; leaves hair shiny &amp; static free.</li>
            <li>It is a good shampoo and mild.</li>
            <li>It works great, smells good (kind of baby oil-ish), and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It works great, smells good (kind of baby oil-ish), and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The doctor had prescribed steroidal products and they weren&#x27;t any better.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if helps itching but seems ok.</li>
            <li>Found it cheaper elsewhere with a better expiration date.</li>
            <li>i could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>its easy on my scalf and i feel it works well for me.</li>
            <li>I  bring a fine tooth comb in shower with me and loosen the scales while shampoo is in hair.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t change my P&amp;S because every time I use it, I&lt;br /&gt;feel like my hair is treated to a fine shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works great after the P and S Liquid to get that messy oil out of your hair, banish the flakiness and have your hair looking and smelling great for the day.</li>
            <li>It is working good and removing stickness and hair is soft after shower.</li>
            <li>The shampoo did a good job of washing out most of the Liquid (which is very very very oily), but still left a bit of oiliness in the hair.  </li>
            <li>delivered quickly and product was as described.</li>
            <li>Super 5 Star Service with no delays.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the price for 8 ounces of shampoo is a bit steep, I feel it is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the price for 8 ounces of shampoo is a bit steep, I feel it is absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>but this works which makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot Preferred Mart!</li>
            <li>I have scalp psoriasis for the last 25 years of my life and I am sure it&#x27;s not going away any time soon.</li>
            <li>Really!  </li>
            <li>Recommended by our dermatologist and works pretty well.</li>
            <li>First shampoo that has ever worked</li>
            <li>I could by it at a discount for large quantity purchase.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells nice (not strong medicine smell like some tar shampoos) and it makes hair soft (easier to have a good hair day than other shampoos for the scalp).</li>
            <li>didnt see much</li>
            <li>you do not need much for lather.</li>
            <li>After 5 straight days of using the products (night time oil and morning shampoo)</li>
            <li>Was packaged well came fast.  </li>
            <li>Leaves scalp flake free after several washings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I live in the driest climate ever!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it,</li>
            <li>seems to help a little, but for the price I was hoping for a better result</li>
            <li>finally this one prescribed P &amp; S as a first step to remedy the condition!</li>
            <li>I have also found that if we shampoo once to get the flakes out, then shampoo again (using less shampoo)--the old \\&quot;lather, rinse, repeat\\&quot;--we get better results.</li>
            <li>And leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>It really keeps my scalp clean  especially in the winter when it gets so dry.</li>
            <li>shampoo is quite thick, and I find myself using more than I would normally use of another shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is extremely thick and has huge curls, and whenever we use this shampoo, her hair looks better than any other time!</li>
            <li>It has no odor and rinses out completely.</li>
            <li>Used for my 12 year old son&#x27;s psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>a full head of hair less a widow&#x27;s peak, and my hair is always soft according to my grandkids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We generally comb the scalp, trying to remove as much flaking as possible, then treat the scalp with the meds.  </li>
            <li>She is constantly getting complements on her hair after she uses the P&amp;S, which is funny because she is fighting such severe flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the scaling simply turned into a million tiny bits, actually making it more rather than less noticable...</li>
            <li>Product was great the only disappointment that for the price the bottle is too small but regardless the product is worthy.</li>
            <li>I would not waste the shampoo on a double wash otherwise.</li>
            <li>I am a 71 year old male</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super messy, no matter how well you prepare or use multiple hair</li>
            <li>We used it initially in conjunction with the P&amp;S liquid, which you apply all over the scalp (sectioning the hair, and getting right down to the scalp), then wearing a shower cap (we found a silky one at the store, rather than a plastic one!)</li>

            <li> In the bad old days I used laundry detergent to try and get the Liquid out of my hair but the SHAMPOO IS FABULOUS.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>

            <li> this condition is very bad on his scalp, as all perscribed and non-perscribed shampoos don&#x27;t do the job.  </li>

            <li> Product worked great!  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s great ! It has all but cleared up my psoriasis in my scalp!!</li>
            <li> delivered quickly and product was as described. it does work well ,I used it for years and could no longer find it in the stores nearby. The doctor had prescribed steroidal products and they weren&#x27;t any better. I have no fears with this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works well for condition I have on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and love it.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo. Don&#x27;t know if helps itching but seems ok. Dr. said to try it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived before my expected date. Super 5 Star Service with no delays. I would use them again for future purchases.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for abt 2 years.  It works for me along with just plain crushed asprin after washing then rinsing asprin out from effected area.</li>
            <li> Great product quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The P&amp;S shampoo was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  It really keeps my scalp clean  especially in the winter when it gets so dry. But i&#x27;s not easy to find that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so happy Preferred Mart at Amazon carries this brand. I usually purchase two of them at the same time. Don&#x27;t want to be without it. Preferred Mart has an excellent shipping service and I get them in two days. Thanks a lot Preferred Mart!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great to use after the P &amp; S hair liquid. didnt see much improvement.&lt;br /&gt;it has 2%  Salicylic Acid so compare to store brands.</li>
            <li> Started using this as recommended by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s very gentle for sensitive skin.  And leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> This with the combination of the P&amp;S liquid did the job. It cleared up my granddaughters scalp after several treatments. A very good product.</li>
            <li> I have scalp psoriasis for the last 25 years of my life and I am sure it&#x27;s not going away any time soon. I live in the driest climate ever! This shampoo smells nice (not strong medicine smell like some tar shampoos) and it makes hair soft (easier to have a good hair day than other shampoos for the scalp). I try not to wash hair daily but when I do wash it, I use this shampoo and leave it in for at least 5 mins. I  bring a fine tooth comb in shower with me and loosen the scales while shampoo is in hair. you do not need much for lather. one bottle lasts about 3 months for me. I wish they came in liter size so I can just refill the smaller bottle or put a pump on it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t affect the skin problem at all. price was good but it didn&#x27;t do anything for the skin problem at all.</li>
            <li> seems to help a little, but for the price I was hoping for a better result</li>
            <li> Short expiration date. Found it cheaper elsewhere with a better expiration date. Great product otherwise. We&#x27;ve used this many times before!</li>
            <li> This is used to wash P&amp;Soil out of hair. It does the trick &amp; smells good &amp; leaves hair shiny &amp; static free.</li>
            <li> This is mandatory if you haVe used the P &amp; S liquid as it is the only shampoo that will wash out that oily liquid. My dermatologist told me to get this through Amazon. I hVe inverse psorasis &amp; after three dermatologists...finally this one prescribed P &amp; S as a first step to remedy the condition! I&#x27;ve ordered it several times &amp; it saved me !!</li>
            <li> You can actually get 3% salysilic acid in Selsyn. This is only 2%.</li>
            <li> Shampoos the oil out easily!</li>
            <li> Purchase and delivery perfect</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommended using this while treating the hair with a prescription for scalp psoriasis. We generally comb the scalp, trying to remove as much flaking as possible, then treat the scalp with the meds.  In the morning we&#x27;ll shampoo with the P&amp;S a couple times a week (other times she just wets her hair).  Her hair is extremely thick and has huge curls, and whenever we use this shampoo, her hair looks better than any other time! It actually softens her hair, shines it up, and gives her curls definition and bounce.  She is constantly getting complements on her hair after she uses the P&amp;S, which is funny because she is fighting such severe flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is quite thick, and I find myself using more than I would normally use of another shampoo.  I have also found that if we shampoo once to get the flakes out, then shampoo again (using less shampoo)--the old \\&quot;lather, rinse, repeat\\&quot;--we get better results. Really!  I would not waste the shampoo on a double wash otherwise. One bottle has lasted us about two and a half months so far, only using it a few times a week.  It is hard to find, so I ordered a second bottle when it had Prime shipping.  Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this shampoo for scalp psoriasis.  We used it initially in conjunction with the P&amp;S liquid, which you apply all over the scalp (sectioning the hair, and getting right down to the scalp), then wearing a shower cap (we found a silky one at the store, rather than a plastic one!) overnight, repeating for about a week. This gets the initial psoriasis buildup off the scalp so that we could begin treatment with the steroid liquid. The shampoo did a good job of washing out most of the Liquid (which is very very very oily), but still left a bit of oiliness in the hair.  (If you use the P&amp;S Liquid, your hair will look wet or greasy, or like you have a lot of hair product in it--be warned! It is hard to rinse out and will leave an oily film in your tub.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price for 8 ounces of shampoo is a bit steep, I feel it is absolutely worth it.  It works great, smells good (kind of baby oil-ish), and lasts a long time.  If you are fighting scalp psoriasis, don&#x27;t bother with the drugstore products.  Get the stuff that actually WORKS!!!  As a cheaper alternative though, the dermatologist recommended (as a second option) T-Sal (that is NOT T-gel).r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the price for 8 ounces of shampoo is a bit steep, I feel it is absolutely worth it.

It&#x27;s super messy, no matter how well you prepare or use multiple hair coverings.&lt;br /&gt;2.  After 5 straight days of using the products (night time oil and morning shampoo) the scaling simply turned into a million tiny bits, actually making it more rather than less noticable...</li>

            <li> With the P and S Liquid, this treatment is helping with my terrible scalp flaking. i could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I started using Baker&#x27;s P&amp;S Liquid for psoriasis of the scalp when I was 20. Then medications helped control the psoriasis for 40 years.  Within the last year I have had a medical condition which precludes internal meds so I returned to P&amp;S Liquid.  When I started to look for it online, I discovered P&amp;S SHAMPOO.  Hallelujah!  iT IS WONDERFUL!  Removes the oily Liquid in a flash, cleans my scalp and keeps me from itching for at least 3-4 days.  In the bad old days I used laundry detergent to try and get the Liquid out of my hair but the SHAMPOO IS FABULOUS.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could by it at a discount for large quantity purchase.</li>
            <li> If you have psoriasis with outbreaks on your scalp, this is the shampoo for you.  I would bet it would help dandruff as well. It is a good shampoo and mild. I highly recommend it,</li>
            <li> It is working good and removing stickness and hair is soft after shower. It is roming flakes partly not completely</li>
            <li> Really works great after the P and S Liquid to get that messy oil out of your hair, banish the flakiness and have your hair looking and smelling great for the day.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with &amp;#34;Head &amp; Shoulders&amp;#34; Shampoo. I probably use P&amp;S&lt;br /&gt;twice to three times a week and I shampoo every morning. I am a 71 year old male&lt;br /&gt;with a full head of hair less a widow&#x27;s peak, and my hair is always soft according to my grandkids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. I am very active but I wouldn&#x27;t change my P&amp;S because every time I use it, I&lt;br /&gt;feel like my hair is treated to a fine shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Ahern&lt;br /&gt;McHenry, Illinois</li>
            <li> Works well. Leaves scalp flake free after several washings. Contains no fragrance to trigger a reaction. I would recommend with out hesitation.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s doctor recommended PS Shampoo for his scalp condition so he has been using it for years but it&#x27;s not readily available in pharmacies. They always have to order it and it&#x27;s often unavailable.  I was pleased to find it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s expensive compared to Head &amp; Shoulders, etc. but this works which makes it worth the price.</li>
