            <li>okay delivery.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many gels and none compare to the Deva Curl Angell.  </li>
            <li>Any DevaCurl product is worth the money if you love your curls and want to protect them and your hair.</li>
            <li>I have to use this product because it is sulfa free</li>
            <li>Devacurl products are fabulous.</li>
            <li>My daughter started using it on her soft spiral curls and she LOVES it more every day she uses this hair care system!</li>
            <li>I want to use hot rollers, it is great at adding a bit of extra hold so that the additional curl from hot rollers will stay even longer in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My curls are not real tight, but are more than just wavy.  </li>
            <li>Good product...same as the salon sells for less.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.</li>
            <li>These products are miracle workers; it&#x27;s the only thing that has made my frizzy hair into cute and much complimented curls!  </li>
            <li>First let me tell you that I have curly, but not kinky hair.  </li>
            <li>my stylist first recommended Be-Leave gel.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, so I find it very cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a hot, humid climate and my hair is also frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a little more, so I tried the light conditioning gel (formerly AnGell).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It works for me better than any other product I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>First time ordering this product from an Amazon related site.  </li>
            <li>and I always get compliments on my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>Her hair is almost never frizzy yet her curls are soft and getting healthier every day.</li>
            <li>It keeps the frizz under control but hair feels soft.  </li>
            <li>Curl Angell Hyper-Allergic Conditioning Gel really helps my hair keep its curl, and also helps battle back the frizzies on humid days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it and so far it has not separated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used just about every gel out there on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft but with defined curls.  </li>

            <li> Leaves my curls bouncy and not at all stiff.  </li>
            <li> They usually leave my hair sticky, or crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I have found gels in the past that I like and then the company will go out of business.  </li>
            <li> It was left in my mail box on a very cold day and when I got it it was frozen solid.</li>

            <li> Any DevaCurl product is worth the money if you love your curls and want to protect them and your hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! My daughter started using it on her soft spiral curls and she LOVES it more every day she uses this hair care system! Her hair is almost never frizzy yet her curls are soft and getting healthier every day. It&#x27;s totally worth the price if you have curls of any kind!</li>

            <li> Have been using this product since last summer.  The only product I&#x27;ve ever used that controls frizz without leaving my hair crunchy.  Give it a try-you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Devacurl products are fabulous. I ordered this product on August 8th and it is August 20th and still has not arrived. Next time,I will order from another site.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times before and loved the results. This particular bottle however has a much different consistency than other bottles I&#x27;ve used in the past. It seems as though it was completely watered down therefore the results are not what I am accustomed to.</li>
            <li> Best light, curl defining  product on the market.  It is made specifically for curly hair and tames the frizzies and doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;!!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  It smells great too!!</li>
            <li> What a curly girl needs.</li>
            <li> The best gel product I have ever found for curly hair and I have tried hundreds.  It keeps the frizz under control but hair feels soft.  The DevaCurl One Conditioner is also a must have for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have longer curling hair that is thin. I live in a hot, humid climate and my hair is also frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deva Curl Angell Hyper-Allergic Conditioning Gel really helps my hair keep its curl, and also helps battle back the frizzies on humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want to use hot rollers, it is great at adding a bit of extra hold so that the additional curl from hot rollers will stay even longer in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use a small amount of this product. I use it on towel-dried, damp hair after I have combed it out starting at the ends. It doesn&#x27;t take much, so I find it very cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; \\&quot;I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather. Not screaming like the passengers in his cab.\\&quot; &lt;&lt;</li>
            <li> Good product...same as the salon sells for less. Unfortunately it got frozen. It was left in my mail box on a very cold day and when I got it it was frozen solid. I thawed it and it seems OK. I&#x27;ve been using it and so far it has not separated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every gel out there on my naturally curly hair.  They usually leave my hair sticky, or crunchy.  This does neither.  Leaves your hair soft but with defined curls.  The only way to go.</li>
            <li> These products are miracle workers; it&#x27;s the only thing that has made my frizzy hair into cute and much complimented curls!  I also recommend reading Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey both has made me love my curls!</li>
            <li> First time ordering this product from an Amazon related site.  Excellent product, excellent packing, okay delivery.  Will order from this site again, as price was competitive.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I use it all the time. It works for me better than any other product I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> First let me tell you that I have curly, but not kinky hair.  My curls are not real tight, but are more than just wavy.  I have found gels in the past that I like and then the company will go out of business.  Finally, I found this gel and I love it!  It&#x27;s light weight and works great for my hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many gels and none compare to the Deva Curl Angell.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2.5 years and I am still amazed at how good it is.  No crunchy feeling.  I get great shine, complete frizz control, and beautiful curl definition.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost two years and I always get compliments on my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my curly hair. Have been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> my stylist first recommended Be-Leave gel.  But as my hair got healthier it was obvious I needed a little more, so I tried the light conditioning gel (formerly AnGell).  It has enhanced my curls and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was the same as the Arc Angel gel; however after using this product my hair looks wet and is a little stiff. I have naturally long curly hair and this product just isn&#x27;t the same as the Arc angel gel from Deva</li>
            <li> This is a great gel.  Leaves my curls bouncy and not at all stiff.  It is my go-to product.  Highly recommend.</li>
