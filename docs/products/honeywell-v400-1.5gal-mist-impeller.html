    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I read through alot of reviews before deciding on this humidifier, and I can tell you, it&#x27;s works great.</li>
            <li>Leaks and just not that great.</li>
            <li>I bought this model 6 yrs ago &amp; it did a great job.  </li>
            <li>Works great if you can stand the noise.</li>
            <li>We liked it best of all the many choices out there.</li>
            <li>The pediatrician said it was good thing</li>
            <li>We are in search of a good alternative.  </li>
            <li>I got this humidifier and thinking VICKS would be a good brand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good idea to keep a ceiling fan on to keep the air moving.  </li>
            <li>I had this for a year and loved it.</li>
            <li>Best of luck to those who can use a cool mist humidifier of this nature.</li>
            <li>This is another product that if you decide to go against the reviews and try it for yourself, you better SAVE THE RECEIPT!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I never had any problem with this item.</li>
            <li>You need warm mist.</li>
            <li>I almost placed it on top of our nice wood nightstand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute for the kids and didn&#x27;t drench anything.</li>
            <li>The latest versions are not working well now.  </li>
            <li>I received the humidifier as a shower gift and it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>I would notice the water build up on the top of the humidifier</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people complain about this humidifier, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Once it does, it&#x27;ll be able to absorb all of the moisture put out by the humidifier and your pooling issues will be over.</li>
            <li>I love this humidifier.</li>
            <li>the reason why I think it doesn&#x27;t get more than 3 stars</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re on City water - very clean.   </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this product I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>ALSO, it is really important to ask if your baby need a cool or a warm mist because this can also cause an aggravation of your child condition.</li>
            <li>This is a fine humidifier.</li>
            <li>I found trimming a chopstick to fit down the tube worked the best.</li>
            <li>In fact, it was easy to use and easy for me to clean.</li>
            <li>Things I like about this humidifier include: it is cool-mist, easy to fill, and relatively easy to clean.</li>
            <li>as someone else mentioned, the sound of it running does not bother my children, and it does lull them to sleep.</li>
            <li>filters are available on the manufacturer&#x27;s website:</li>
            <li>I filled it to the line it says</li>
            <li>Everything was fantastic.</li>
            <li>at a comfortable humidity and temperature</li>
            <li>But, the things I dislike far outweigh the good things.  </li>
            <li>Most children need cool mist but children with ashma or allergies shouldn&#x27;t use cool mist.</li>
            <li>I recently went out and purchased the Vicks Cool Mist Model V3500 Humidifier which had great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Plus it really helps him breath more easily at night.  </li>
            <li>It was economically priced and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I glued a bit of cloth to each end to help scrub it clean.  </li>
            <li>Either we just lucked up on a really good tree, or the humidifier made a big difference.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the unit because of the air filter, but so far I see it as a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>I used the Vicks menthol gel on the inside to give it more of the eucalyptus scent in the air and to ease her congestion and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>But all in all, it puts water vapour back into my air and it does a good job doing it.</li>
            <li>First, the output is way too strong for any size room.  </li>
            <li>What I like best is that it really creates a humid environment in her room, not just a little mist like the three others we tried.</li>
            <li>I never had a defect in it and it worked fine from the first day that I got it.</li>
            <li>so I got lucky there.  </li>
            <li>I got mildly electrocuted turning this off because the cord was wet.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>There have been many times, they are fine the very next morning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The phone number to re-order filters is on the back of the filter itself (the top of the frame, you may need to hold it under the light to read it).</li>
            <li>This machine is definelty worth the money.</li>
            <li>And most important, after running the humidifier overnight, and with my daughter&#x27;s door partly open, water pools up all around the humidifier and soaks her carpet about 5-6 ft from where the humidifier sits on her dresser.  </li>
            <li>have tried other brand humidifiers and not had as good a result in using them, as we have this brand and model.</li>
            <li>The lady who said to put a towel under it was absolutely right.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing high-tech about it, but that can be a good thing sometimes, especially when it means you can get a pretty decent machine for around $30.</li>
            <li>The top section with the motor has many tight spots where you can see mold growth but not reach it.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the humidifier works fine, but if you cannot find the accessories...why bother.</li>
            <li>I should have read some reviews first.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that it holds enough water for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>However, upon first using this humudifier, it sounded like a train coming through my son&#x27;s bedroom.</li>
            <li>It is loud but soothing and I buy filters on line pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>The first couple of nights I used it</li>
            <li>I now have to cover her dresser with a vinyl tablecloth and cover most of her floor with towels to prevent further damage.  </li>
            <li>dust everywhere - especially in his crib, on his cloths, and I&#x27;m sure in his lungs.  </li>
            <li>(And we have a large piece of cardboard and a bath towel under it.)</li>
            <li>I too have a white film all over my daughter&#x27;s room and a huge puddle under the humidifier.</li>
            <li>so I was not turned off by reviews of this humidifier producing too much moisture.  </li>
            <li>It arrived much sooner than stated</li>
            <li>My daughter has allergies/asthma and it clears up her lungs really well.</li>
            <li>In all, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I agree it doesn&#x27;t make much noise.</li>
            <li>even though I have a dinosaur gas furnace that really scorches the air.</li>
            <li>The vapor from vicks really smouth there</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t make a fair comparison, but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the amount of water it spits out.</li>
            <li>Second, it is too much work to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>She sent me a new part for it and it worked fine the next day.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend it if you have city water because it&#x27;s a heck of a pain in the butt to clean if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t put the top upside down when opening the unit you run the risk of the stem snapping off.  </li>
            <li>Third, it is very, very noisy!  </li>
            <li>Our climate is normally humid, and we have had to put a towel underneath, it to protect any furniture.</li>
            <li>If there is already enough humidity in the air the mist will just fall right after coming out of the machine.  </li>
            <li>My family has used this humidifier for years, buying new replacements periodically.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now shopping for a new model and recommend you keep shopping too (unless you&#x27;re prepared to mop the floors after each use and don&#x27;t mind damaging your floors and furniture).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very loud.</li>
            <li>I bought a different one (same brand) with a wick and filter that is very quiet and has three settings for just 5 dollars more.</li>
            <li>At this point I am alsmost willing to go spend the money on a second humidifier just to find out.</li>
            <li>Plus, it makes the room smell funny, and it leaves a white dust over everything.  </li>
            <li>The quality was much better than the old Walgreen&#x27;s humidifiers I used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The rooms in our house run medium to a large open space.</li>
            <li>She identified that the pickup tube was bent and that when they manufacture the units, this happens frequently ( then why do they sell defective units?)</li>
            <li>Everything in the nursery was completely soaked including the carpet.</li>
            <li>This humidifier is way too loud.  </li>
            <li>I never had any white film and I have a whole house water softening system.</li>
            <li>I used it when our baby was 1 month old</li>
            <li>We used this periodically with our 4 month old.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for out 5 week old son.  </li>
            <li>and it is already making a loud racket.  </li>
            <li>Extremely loud.</li>
            <li>The moist air does not disperse easily, ends up falling back down, and produces a puddle of water around the unit.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback I have found so far is that there are some hard to clean nooks in the water container, and the manufacturer receommends cleaning pretty often</li>
            <li>I had, otherwise, the cough could have become something more serious.</li>
            <li>trick is you NEED TO CLEAN IT EVERYDAY like every humidifier.</li>
            <li>so this is a minor pain, but I am really just reaching for complaints now for balance.  </li>
            <li>It is not easy to clean and it also leaves puddles of water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Even after working through customer service to get new ones sent to us and our sending back the ones that didn&#x27;t work well, this machine just doesn&#x27;t perform anymore.  </li>
            <li>But it has not been a major problem for us.</li>
            <li>its loud bery hard to clean</li>
            <li>Oh, and you have to be a little extra careful not to snap off the stem in the middle of the top when you take it off to fill the bottom with water.  </li>
            <li>We have a water softener due to our well water and the salt in the water really gets caked on this unit and all over the room.</li>
            <li>I never had excess water in the air, on the floor, too much noise, mold, or any of the other plethora of complaints.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t hard, but it must be kept clean.</li>
            <li>When my daughter got a cold last winter, we bought this model because it was readily available and we needed a humidifier quick.  </li>
            <li>[an old nurses&#x27; trick] to eliminate any chance of mold, mildew or white powder forming (the white powder is from your water, not the machine.</li>
            <li>Found out the first time it got dirty that one can take the filter &amp; clean it w/soap &amp; water, let it dry, then it works like new.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter than my previous vaporizer.  </li>
            <li>To make the unit last you MUST clean the tank &amp; ESPECIALLY the long &#x27;straw&#x27; that sucks up the water.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> She identified that the pickup tube was bent and that when they manufacture the units, this happens frequently ( then why do they sell defective units?)</li>
            <li> Everything in the nursery was completely soaked including the carpet.</li>
            <li> This humidifier is way too loud.  </li>
            <li> I never had any white film and I have a whole house water softening system.</li>
            <li> I used it when our baby was 1 month old</li>
            <li> We used this periodically with our 4 month old.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for out 5 week old son.  </li>
            <li> and it is already making a loud racket.  </li>
            <li> Extremely loud.</li>
            <li> The moist air does not disperse easily, ends up falling back down, and produces a puddle of water around the unit.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback I have found so far is that there are some hard to clean nooks in the water container, and the manufacturer receommends cleaning pretty often</li>
            <li> I had, otherwise, the cough could have become something more serious.</li>
            <li> trick is you NEED TO CLEAN IT EVERYDAY like every humidifier.</li>
            <li> so this is a minor pain, but I am really just reaching for complaints now for balance.  </li>
            <li> It is not easy to clean and it also leaves puddles of water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Even after working through customer service to get new ones sent to us and our sending back the ones that didn&#x27;t work well, this machine just doesn&#x27;t perform anymore.  </li>
            <li> But it has not been a major problem for us.</li>
            <li> its loud bery hard to clean</li>
            <li> Oh, and you have to be a little extra careful not to snap off the stem in the middle of the top when you take it off to fill the bottom with water.  </li>
            <li> We have a water softener due to our well water and the salt in the water really gets caked on this unit and all over the room.</li>
            <li> I never had excess water in the air, on the floor, too much noise, mold, or any of the other plethora of complaints.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t hard, but it must be kept clean.</li>
            <li> When my daughter got a cold last winter, we bought this model because it was readily available and we needed a humidifier quick.  </li>
            <li> [an old nurses&#x27; trick] to eliminate any chance of mold, mildew or white powder forming (the white powder is from your water, not the machine.</li>
            <li> Found out the first time it got dirty that one can take the filter &amp; clean it w/soap &amp; water, let it dry, then it works like new.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter than my previous vaporizer.  </li>
            <li> To make the unit last you MUST clean the tank &amp; ESPECIALLY the long &#x27;straw&#x27; that sucks up the water.  </li>
            <li> only thing keeping me from giving this humidifier 5 stars is the lack of low/high settings, which would go a long way towards eliminating problems with excess moisture.</li>
            <li> have not experienced any extraordinary amount of water around the item, but that is probably because I don&#x27;t use it unless the air is dry.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to believe that it is becuase there is to much moisture in the air.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it makes a sound like an airplane taking off.  </li>
            <li> wet carpet and white dust.  </li>
            <li> Then about a week later I noticed that the carpet was wet.  </li>
            <li> She is almost 2 now and we have been using it since she was a few months old.</li>
            <li> I used it for a long time, stored it, and brought it out again and had no problem.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the noise that this humidifier makes and the only time that I had wet carpet was when the machine was on the floor.  </li>
            <li> also set one up in our living room, this past Christmas, because we had a live tree.</li>
            <li> When this happens, it&#x27;s time to turn the machine off for a while and let the air dry out a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on and off for the last few months and the results were ALWAYS the same....</li>
            <li> need a new one now since my g&#x27;daughter broke the part that sucks the water, and yes, I will buy this Vick&#x27;s model again.</li>
            <li> After 3 consecutive days of overnight use, the carpet was drenched AND there was this odd white dust on everything within a 2-3 foot radius of the humidifier!</li>
            <li> During the winter, the air in our home is VERY dry</li>
            <li> I bought this shortly after my daughter was born when she had her first cold last winter.  </li>
            <li> been using this brand for at least two years and other than the occasional pooling around the opening, we have not had any major problems.  </li>
            <li> But, the delivery was as expected and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> The carpet was wet beyond the dresser.  </li>
            <li> What do you expect from something that shoots wet air out of it?</li>
            <li> After the first use the nursery was entirely covered with a white film that was impossible to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> other reviews mention, either.  </li>
            <li> We just bought this unit the other night.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any other humidifies</li>
            <li> I bought this item because my son is stuffed up at night due to allegeries.</li>
            <li> I read all the other complaints.</li>
            <li> The mist is very heavy and there&#x27;s only one setting</li>
            <li> but by time you pay for shipping/time/etc, its not worth the hassel.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this is very inconvienient.  </li>
            <li> the rug was wet, the wall was dripping with water!!  </li>
            <li> I could tell a difference from doing that this year, and not having done that in previous years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it less than a month</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving one of these on 24/7 in a bedroom or other small area, because you&#x27;ll always have issues with excess humidity.</li>
            <li> When I stored it for 5 months and got it back out today when my son got sick, it was loud again just like before!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am very unhappy with the the Vicks Cool Mist Humidifier.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the receipt &amp; it&#x27;d been past 60 days</li>
            <li> (I only use this when I am ill</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am in the process of looking into humidiers that don&#x27;t drench carpet or produce white dust.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leak for me, but then again I put it on a stool with a small towel,</li>
            <li> It is louder than I would have expected and the filter just makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I bought it because my daughter had a horrific congestion problem and the air in my house is pretty dry.</li>
            <li> Filters are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it&#x27;s hard to find the filters.</li>
            <li> The biggest complaint is the soaked carpet even though we had a towel underneath the unit.  </li>
            <li> and it sucks...</li>
            <li> The steam is really thick and works well if you put that menthol vapor stuff in it.</li>
            <li> My daughter was then sick with her second cold and once again I had the same experience with this humidifier.  </li>
            <li> Last year, my child had a bad cough.</li>
            <li> The noise wasn&#x27;t too bad since it provided some white noise to sleep to.  </li>
            <li> Not a great value for the money, but at least it does not leak.</li>
            <li> Our son was sick and we wanted to use the humidifier to help him breath, but instead he ended up breathing the white dust.  </li>
            <li> The filters are also very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Then after a few weeks use it started to SMELL!!!!  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;I looked at the website &amp; called the customer service line &amp; was unable to fix it.  </li>
            <li> That is sad.</li>
            <li> Totally useless.</li>
            <li> my review of this product is unfair.</li>
            <li> I rate this very poorly</li>
            <li> This was the worst purchase in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to get out.  </li>
            <li> Within two days after using it, he got sick - coughing, sneezing, etc.  </li>
            <li> Both of my children got sick and it helped them a lot.</li>
            <li> Horrible horrible.  </li>
            <li> This product is horrible!  </li>
            <li> It is noisy and worst of all</li>
            <li> it produces a horrible musty smell!</li>
            <li> It is horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Our climate is normally humid, and we have had to put a towel underneath, it to protect any furniture. I would do this anyways, even if it didn&#x27;t spit out water. The rooms in our house run medium to a large open space. We have not had the problem others have mentioned, of it pooling on the floor. Nor have we seen any of the white dust other reviews mention, either.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have, however, received the benefit, or rather, my children have, of this humidifier. Last year, my child had a bad cough. I had this brand humidifier and ran it 24/7. The pediatrician said it was good thing I had, otherwise, the cough could have become something more serious. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This year, I have two in school. I have had the occasional need to run it, when one of them starts sniffling. There have been many times, they are fine the very next morning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The humidifier is not silent running, however, as someone else mentioned, the sound of it running does not bother my children, and it does lull them to sleep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also set one up in our living room, this past Christmas, because we had a live tree. I could tell a difference from doing that this year, and not having done that in previous years. Either we just lucked up on a really good tree, or the humidifier made a big difference.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using this brand for at least two years and other than the occasional pooling around the opening, we have not had any major problems.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The phone number to re-order filters is on the back of the filter itself (the top of the frame, you may need to hold it under the light to read it). Also, I spoke to the manager of the parmacy we got the humidifiers from, and the manager keeps the filters in stock for us. If I don&#x27;t feel like going in person to the store, I order them online. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried other brand humidifiers and not had as good a result in using them, as we have this brand and model. The others just did not raise the level of humidity to where it needed to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I give this one a four, because of the fact, yes it does spit water out around the opening. But it has not been a major problem for us.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product I was very satisfied.  The quality was much better than the old Walgreen&#x27;s humidifiers I used in the past.  It was quiet and didn&#x27;t get mold in it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After using about 6 times, the spinning wheel starting making the LOUDEST noise &amp; nothing would stop it.  I didn&#x27;t have the receipt &amp; it&#x27;d been past 60 days so I couldn&#x27;t return it.  (I only use this when I am ill therefore I&#x27;d had it over a year). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I looked at the website &amp; called the customer service line &amp; was unable to fix it.  It does come w/a 2 year manufacturers warrenty but by time you pay for shipping/time/etc, its not worth the hassel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had to throw it away.  In the end, I would NOT purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> We just bought this unit the other night.  Horrible horrible.  I should have read some reviews first.  The biggest complaint is the soaked carpet even though we had a towel underneath the unit.  I almost placed it on top of our nice wood nightstand so I got lucky there.  The noise wasn&#x27;t too bad since it provided some white noise to sleep to.  I returned it the next day and bought the Crane frog.  It&#x27;s cute for the kids and didn&#x27;t drench anything.</li>
            <li> This machine is AWFUL.&lt;BR&gt;Everything around this humidifier gets SOAKED.  I got mildly electrocuted turning this off because the cord was wet.&lt;BR&gt;And it&#x27;s LOUD.&lt;BR&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!  It is noisy and worst of all it produces a horrible musty smell!</li>
            <li> We have a water softener due to our well water and the salt in the water really gets caked on this unit and all over the room. I would only recommend it if you have city water because it&#x27;s a heck of a pain in the butt to clean if you don&#x27;t. The lady who said to put a towel under it was absolutely right. The mist is very heavy and there&#x27;s only one setting so you can&#x27;t adjust it. It&#x27;s also very loud. I bought a different one (same brand) with a wick and filter that is very quiet and has three settings for just 5 dollars more. Best of luck to those who can use a cool mist humidifier of this nature.</li>
            <li> This is a fine humidifier. It is not silent, and I didn&#x27;t expect it to be. I use it for my baby and the \\&quot;white noise\\&quot; actually helps him sleep! He loves it!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any extraordinary amount of water around the item, but that is probably because I don&#x27;t use it unless the air is dry. If there is already enough humidity in the air the mist will just fall right after coming out of the machine.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The filters are available on the manufacturer&#x27;s website: [...] - also not a big deal. I didn&#x27;t buy the unit because of the air filter, but so far I see it as a nice bonus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it holds enough water for 24 hours.  The only drawback I have found so far is that there are some hard to clean nooks in the water container, and the manufacturer receommends cleaning pretty often so this is a minor pain, but I am really just reaching for complaints now for balance.  Oh, and you have to be a little extra careful not to snap off the stem in the middle of the top when you take it off to fill the bottom with water.  If you don&#x27;t put the top upside down when opening the unit you run the risk of the stem snapping off.  No biggee.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am very unhappy with the the Vicks Cool Mist Humidifier.  We have white dust all over the nursery and it is very difficult to get out.  Our son was sick and we wanted to use the humidifier to help him breath, but instead he ended up breathing the white dust.  We used distilled bottled water so I dont undertand how this could occur.  I would definetly not recommend this.  Our pediatrician has even told us not to use it anymore.  I rate this very poorly</li>
            <li> The only reason why I rated this with one star is because mine did not leak at all. However, upon first using this humudifier, it sounded like a train coming through my son&#x27;s bedroom. I called the Kaz company and she asked me to put the phone up to the humidifier so she could hear it. She identified that the pickup tube was bent and that when they manufacture the units, this happens frequently ( then why do they sell defective units?) She sent me a new part for it and it worked fine the next day. When I stored it for 5 months and got it back out today when my son got sick, it was loud again just like before! I intend to throw it out!</li>
            <li> My family has used this humidifier for years, buying new replacements periodically. The latest versions are not working well now.  Even after working through customer service to get new ones sent to us and our sending back the ones that didn&#x27;t work well, this machine just doesn&#x27;t perform anymore.  That is sad. We liked it best of all the many choices out there. We are in search of a good alternative.  But, the delivery was as expected and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I got this humidifier and thinking VICKS would be a good brand.  However when I used it it SOAKED EVERYTHING!!!  I filled it to the line it says and I even put a towel under it when it was running!  The towel was soaked (you could ring water out of it) the rug was wet, the wall was dripping with water!!  Then after a few weeks use it started to SMELL!!!!  I washed it out and even looked in the store for filters and couldn&#x27;t find ANY!  I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this humidifier and it never functioned properly at all. Totally useless.</li>
            <li> I bought this shortly after my daughter was born when she had her first cold last winter.  After the first use the nursery was entirely covered with a white film that was impossible to get rid of.  The humidifier also shot out water similar to a fountain.  Everything in the nursery was completely soaked including the carpet. My daughter was then sick with her second cold and once again I had the same experience with this humidifier.  I do not recommend this model by any means unless you have a baby pool to stick it in.  It is horrible.  I recently went out and purchased the Vicks Cool Mist Model V3500 Humidifier which had great reviews.  I&#x27;m hoping that humidifier won&#x27;t turn my daughter&#x27;s room into Niagra Falls.</li>
            <li> I received the humidifier as a shower gift and it&#x27;s OK.  I do agree with the review that talked about the white dust.  I have no idea what it is, but it forms on my TV and furniture.</li>
            <li> During the winter, the air in our home is VERY dry so I was not turned off by reviews of this humidifier producing too much moisture.  Boy was I wrong!  After 3 consecutive days of overnight use, the carpet was drenched AND there was this odd white dust on everything within a 2-3 foot radius of the humidifier! I&#x27;ve used it on and off for the last few months and the results were ALWAYS the same....wet carpet and white dust.  Needless to say, I am in the process of looking into humidiers that don&#x27;t drench carpet or produce white dust.</li>
            <li> This humidifier is way too loud.  It is not easy to clean and it also leaves puddles of water.</li>
            <li> ...but also gets the floor damp around it. (And we have a large piece of cardboard and a bath towel under it.) Haven&#x27;t tried any other humidifies so I can&#x27;t make a fair comparison, but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the amount of water it spits out. Not sure if I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I read through alot of reviews before deciding on this humidifier, and I can tell you, it&#x27;s works great. No complaints here.  This machine is definelty worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in my home for 2 winter seasons and I do not recommend it at all for several reasons.  First, the output is way too strong for any size room.  The moist air does not disperse easily, ends up falling back down, and produces a puddle of water around the unit.  I had to keep 2-3 towels around it to prevent water damage to my hardwood floors.  Second, it is too much work to keep clean.  The weekly cleanings took over 1/2 hour.  And, only the bottom section gets truly cleaned.  The top section with the motor has many tight spots where you can see mold growth but not reach it.  Third, it is very, very noisy!  After using it for 2 winter seasons I just gave up and dumped the two units I owned in the garbage!</li>
            <li> i bought this humidifier for my baby and it sucks... its loud bery hard to clean and you end up with water all around it...do not buy it</li>
            <li> This was the worst purchase in a long time.  Leaks and just not that great.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because my son is stuffed up at night due to allegeries. I love it.  It&#x27;s much quieter than my previous vaporizer.  I love the on/off switch.  I have never had a problem with water leakage and I do have hardwood floors which would show drainage if any.  Plus it really helps him breath more easily at night.  I would totally buy this product again..</li>
            <li> I too have a white film all over my daughter&#x27;s room and a huge puddle under the humidifier. It is hard for me to believe that it is becuase there is to much moisture in the air. If the air is to moist then my review of this product is unfair. At this point I am alsmost willing to go spend the money on a second humidifier just to find out. It is loud but soothing and I buy filters on line pretty cheap. The white dust is a pain and I have city water so it does not have anything to do with the type of water you fill it with.</li>
            <li> This humidifier is horrible.  I registered for it without reading the reviews and I actually got it.  Anyhow, my daughter got a stuffy nose and the pediatrican recommended using the humidifier, so I drug it out of the closet (should have kept it there).  The first couple of nights I used it I would notice the water build up on the top of the humidifier and then I noticed that it dripped onto her dresser.  I went out an bought a vinyl placemat.  Then about a week later I noticed that the carpet was wet.  I thought that maybe it just dripped off the dresser, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  The carpet was wet beyond the dresser.  I read the instructions and it basically said that if is does that then it needs to be cleaned.  So, I cleaned it again and again.  I never had such a product that needed to be cleaned so often in order for it to work properly.  The filters are also very hard to find.  I did finally find them at CVS. This is another product that if you decide to go against the reviews and try it for yourself, you better SAVE THE RECEIPT!</li>
            <li> It arrived much sooner than stated so that was a bonus.  Everything was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people complain about this humidifier, but I love it. Yes, the steam makes water around the unit, but all you have to do it put a towel under it. What do you expect from something that shoots wet air out of it? The steam is really thick and works well if you put that menthol vapor stuff in it. My daughter has allergies/asthma and it clears up her lungs really well. She is almost 2 now and we have been using it since she was a few months old. What I like best is that it really creates a humid environment in her room, not just a little mist like the three others we tried.</li>
            <li> I read all the other complaints. I can honestly say that I never had any problem with this item. In fact, it was easy to use and easy for me to clean. I never had excess water in the air, on the floor, too much noise, mold, or any of the other plethora of complaints. I never had a defect in it and it worked fine from the first day that I got it. I bought it because my daughter had a horrific congestion problem and the air in my house is pretty dry. I fully expect a humidifier to send water into the air. I never had any white film and I have a whole house water softening system. I used the Vicks menthol gel on the inside to give it more of the eucalyptus scent in the air and to ease her congestion and it worked very well. I used it for a long time, stored it, and brought it out again and had no problem. In all, I really like this product. It was economically priced and easy to use. I would buy another one if I needed it.</li>
            <li> I recieved this as a baby shower gift.  I used it when our baby was 1 month old but it just splashes water out.  Now that my daughter is 3 months, I am going to give it another chance if it continues I will be throwing it out.  I agree it doesn&#x27;t make much noise.</li>
            <li> I wish I had seen the reviews for this product before I bought it. It leaks water when you use it. I would NOT recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> We bought this humidifier to help my daughter sleep at night.  Unfortunately, it makes a sound like an airplane taking off.  Returned immediately.</li>
            <li> I bought this model 6 yrs ago &amp; it did a great job.  Found out the first time it got dirty that one can take the filter &amp; clean it w/soap &amp; water, let it dry, then it works like new.  I&#x27;ve used the same filter since I bought this!  To make the unit last you MUST clean the tank &amp; ESPECIALLY the long &#x27;straw&#x27; that sucks up the water.  It isn&#x27;t hard, but it must be kept clean. I found trimming a chopstick to fit down the tube worked the best. I glued a bit of cloth to each end to help scrub it clean.  I also add a 2-3 tablespoons white vinegar to each tankful [an old nurses&#x27; trick] to eliminate any chance of mold, mildew or white powder forming (the white powder is from your water, not the machine. Try distilled water or buy one of those Insta-Pur filters for the faucet so your water doesn&#x27;t have excess anything. I have a whole-house water IONIX filtration system so that is never an issue for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a new one now since my g&#x27;daughter broke the part that sucks the water, and yes, I will buy this Vick&#x27;s model again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the noise that this humidifier makes and the only time that I had wet carpet was when the machine was on the floor.  However, I have looked EVERYWHERE for the so called &amp;quot;replaceable&amp;quot; filter cartridges!  They are non-existant!  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the humidifier works fine, but if you cannot find the accessories...why bother.</li>
            <li> This is as simple a humidifier as you&#x27;ll find, and is essentially the same design as humidifiers I remember using as a kid 20+ years ago. There&#x27;s nothing high-tech about it, but that can be a good thing sometimes, especially when it means you can get a pretty decent machine for around $30. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people complaining about water pooling around the machine, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it in the two seasons that I&#x27;ve used it. For those who have had issues, here&#x27;s something to consider: the water pools up around the machine and accumulates on the walls because the air is too humid to hold it--the machine&#x27;s working TOO well. When this happens, it&#x27;s time to turn the machine off for a while and let the air dry out a bit. Once it does, it&#x27;ll be able to absorb all of the moisture put out by the humidifier and your pooling issues will be over. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving one of these on 24/7 in a bedroom or other small area, because you&#x27;ll always have issues with excess humidity. One unit is enough to keep my kitchen, dining room and living room (about 600 sq. ft.) at a comfortable humidity and temperature even though I have a dinosaur gas furnace that really scorches the air. It&#x27;s also a good idea to keep a ceiling fan on to keep the air moving.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing keeping me from giving this humidifier 5 stars is the lack of low/high settings, which would go a long way towards eliminating problems with excess moisture.</li>
            <li> We used this periodically with our 4 month old.  We didn&#x27;t need it till about about two months ago, and didn&#x27;t have any problems till last week.  We finally had to throw it out.  It began leaking, soaking the towel we had to put under it and then the carpet.</li>
            <li> When my daughter got a cold last winter, we bought this model because it was readily available and we needed a humidifier quick.  Things I like about this humidifier include: it is cool-mist, easy to fill, and relatively easy to clean. But, the things I dislike far outweigh the good things.  Filters are hard to find.  And most important, after running the humidifier overnight, and with my daughter&#x27;s door partly open, water pools up all around the humidifier and soaks her carpet about 5-6 ft from where the humidifier sits on her dresser.  I now have to cover her dresser with a vinyl tablecloth and cover most of her floor with towels to prevent further damage.  I&#x27;m now shopping for a new model and recommend you keep shopping too (unless you&#x27;re prepared to mop the floors after each use and don&#x27;t mind damaging your floors and furniture).</li>
            <li> Bought this for out 5 week old son.  Within two days after using it, he got sick - coughing, sneezing, etc.  We kept using the humidifier to help him. Went to the doctor 3 times and the ER once.  Turns out, the humidifier was the cause of his illness, in our opinion.   &lt;br /&gt;White dust everywhere - especially in his crib, on his cloths, and I&#x27;m sure in his lungs.  The white film DOES NOT COME OUT OF CLOTHS.  We&#x27;re on City water - very clean.   &lt;br /&gt;Waiting to hear back from P&amp;G.  THIS IS A PROBLEM.   &lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I love this humidifier. It doesn&#x27;t leak for me, but then again I put it on a stool with a small towel, just incase I get water on the bottom of the unit when I fill it. It is louder than I would have expected and the filter just makes it worse. I took the filter out and it&#x27;s quiter now. Besides the fact that it&#x27;s hard to find the filters. But all in all, it puts water vapour back into my air and it does a good job doing it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had the option for 0 stars.  This humidifier SOAKS the carpet.  I have to use a shower curtain liner to protect my floor, and a towel to soak up all the water.  Needless to say, this is very inconvienient.  Plus, it makes the room smell funny, and it leaves a white dust over everything.  Only this was not warned on the package, only in the manual.  I&#x27;ve had it less than a month and it is already making a loud racket.  After spending $30, we have to buy something else.</li>
            <li> I had this for a year and loved it. Both of my children got sick and it helped them a lot. The vapor from vicks really smouth there cough and nasal congestion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The trick is you NEED TO CLEAN IT EVERYDAY like every humidifier. If you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll get your baby sicker. ALSO, it is really important to ask if your baby need a cool or a warm mist because this can also cause an aggravation of your child condition. Most children need cool mist but children with ashma or allergies shouldn&#x27;t use cool mist. You need warm mist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finaly the reason why I think it doesn&#x27;t get more than 3 stars it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not easy to clean. I accidently broke one piece and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere so I have to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Extremely loud. Works great if you can stand the noise. It constantly has to be cleaned and filter replaced. Not a great value for the money, but at least it does not leak.</li>
