            <li>The girls come out shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li>wife says it works great</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get used to them if you have never used a wand before, but once you have its a great thing to have.</li>
            <li>LOVE this curling wand!!</li>
            <li>It takes some time to get the hang of using this item without a way to hold the hair without having to hold it yourself but the curls are amazing!  </li>
            <li>They size fit almost perfectly,</li>
            <li>The size of the wands are the perfect size to make a significant difference in the type of curls you want to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works great, i love the size options.</li>
            <li>and I really do like these the best.  </li>
            <li>They are very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I love the many diff.</li>
            <li>and I have a cute curly bouncy ponytail.</li>
            <li>I MOSTLY USE THE 1 INCH</li>
            <li>The largest is listed as a 1.50&amp;#34; and its more like a 1.25&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Unlike the flat iron, you can choose the temperature that works best for your hair to prevent damaging your locks.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>and it is a perfect match to the zebra flat iron.</li>
            <li>Great irons, no issues so far.</li>
            <li>With the competitor wands, my hair would slip off the barrels easily.  </li>
            <li>curls I get are absolutely beautiful and last all day with a light hold hair</li>
            <li>like cheaply made plastic.  </li>
            <li>This came in the box, nice and new!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light weight.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to find a reasonably priced styling wand with more then one size barrel</li>
            <li>They stay so nicely that the next day all I do is pull my hair up in a ponytail</li>
            <li>With a just a little hair spray I get a whole day of beautiful bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Amazon would not give me sellers contact info to ensure right shipment if I do re-purchase.</li>
            <li>Hoping to re-order and get the right thing this time.</li>
            <li>It heats up really well and is easy to change the irons however; it really didn&#x27;t work to make the curls how I had hoped they would be.</li>
            <li>The barrels are nice and sturdy, but handset seems and feels a little cheap...</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Did not get hot at all.</li>
            <li>I used the middle iron and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Since we have fine hair, the bigger barrel doesn&#x27;t give very lasting curl, but the 2 smaller barrels give great curl and volume.</li>
            <li>They will last up to two days for me with my fine hair even after sleeping on it.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>BUT I LOVE THE OTHER BARRELS TOO!  </li>
            <li>main reason I decided on trying</li>
            <li>Had no serious issues with it at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this curling wand</li>
            <li>Glad I wasted 2 day shipping for nothing.</li>
            <li>The curls at the ends of my hair (and some of the mid shaft) last more than a day, but the curls close to the roots are flat after day 1.  </li>
            <li>it so far...</li>
            <li>My hair always comes out ij bice soft curls</li>
            <li>So I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a lasting hold without having to use a lot of products on your hair.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls last.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product since I use the Iso Turbo Silk Flat Iron</li>
            <li>Only thing was changing the sizes is kinda hard but other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>It will burn your fingers and arms if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>although they are slightly wide in my heel area, I noticed the heel is wearing out faster on the right side side only, so that&#x27;s the only reason I noticed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So other than the fear of breaking this curler, I do find it works very well</li>

            <li> Sizing is def off as usual with these off brands.</li>
            <li> its very hard to pull off, push on.  </li>

            <li> All I get is an I am sorry for the inconvenience?</li>
            <li> It is incredibly difficult to pull the wands off of the base and leaving me to believe that if done improperly, the prongs that hold it in place could break.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this curler set twice since I received it.  I&#x27;m very happy w/ it so far...i have used both 400°F and 420°F settings and it curls my hair well without smelling burned!  I have used other curling wands by Remington and Conair - both used to leave my hair smelling burned.  The curls at the ends of my hair (and some of the mid shaft) last more than a day, but the curls close to the roots are flat after day 1.  For reference, my hair is mid length and slightly wavy.  I don&#x27;t add any product pre-curling, but I do use a texturizing spray post curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I decided on trying this set is that I like how these barrels aren&#x27;t tapered.  With the competitor wands, my hair would slip off the barrels easily.  I don&#x27;t have this problem using the Iso Trio wand.  Also, its a bonus that you get 3 barrel sizes.  I do have trouble attaching /detaching the 19mm, 25mm barrels to the handset...its very hard to pull off, push on.  The barrels are nice and sturdy, but handset seems and feels a little cheap... like cheaply made plastic.  It&#x27;s super light weight.  I just hope the handset part lasts...especially w/ constant switching of barrel sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, description doesn&#x27;t state it, but a heat protectant glove is included w/ the set, and all is in a sleek box!</li>
            <li> AWESOME hair styler.!</li>
            <li> Did not get hot at all.</li>
            <li> This came in the box, nice and new! I love the many diff. Wand sizes! My hair always comes out ij bice soft curls</li>
            <li> It heats up really well and is easy to change the irons however; it really didn&#x27;t work to make the curls how I had hoped they would be.</li>
            <li> i wish it came with two gloves. it works great, i love the size options. i also wish it came with instructions or styling ideas.</li>
            <li> LOVE this curling wand!! Heats up superfast. I only hold it on my hair for 10 seconds. The girls come out shiny and beautiful. With a just a little hair spray I get a whole day of beautiful bouncy curls. They stay so nicely that the next day all I do is pull my hair up in a ponytail and I have a cute curly bouncy ponytail. I highly recommend this curling wand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing these throughout the winter, along with a few others I bought and I really do like these the best.  They are very comfortable.  There&#x27;s enough room in the calf area to tuck in even not-so-skinny jeans, so I get a lot of use out of them.  I get compliments on them a lot as well.  They size fit almost perfectly, although they are slightly wide in my heel area, I noticed the heel is wearing out faster on the right side side only, so that&#x27;s the only reason I noticed.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  The material isn&#x27;t wearing out at all (besides a little on the heel) after using them a lot this winter.  I would definitely buy  Breckelles boots again.</li>
            <li> I did not get the Zebra one I received a black one which works well.  It will burn your fingers and arms if you are not careful.  It takes some time to get the hang of using this item without a way to hold the hair without having to hold it yourself but the curls are amazing!  They will last up to two days for me with my fine hair even after sleeping on it.  So I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a lasting hold without having to use a lot of products on your hair.</li>
            <li> BEST CLIPLESS CURLING IRON SET!!! I MOSTLY USE THE 1 INCH BUT I LOVE THE OTHER BARRELS TOO!  AWESOME SET!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product since I use the Iso Turbo Silk Flat Iron and I absolutely adore it. I would give this product a five star rating, but there are a few concerns I have with it. So to start:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1.The curls I get are absolutely beautiful and last all day with a light hold hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;2. It heats up really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3. Unlike the flat iron, you can choose the temperature that works best for your hair to prevent damaging your locks.&lt;br /&gt;4. The size of the wands are the perfect size to make a significant difference in the type of curls you want to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is incredibly difficult to pull the wands off of the base and leaving me to believe that if done improperly, the prongs that hold it in place could break.&lt;br /&gt;2. Just as pulling a wand off, it is equally as difficult to put a new one on. My biggest struggle is the 25mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So other than the fear of breaking this curler, I do find it works very well and it is a perfect match to the zebra flat iron.</li>
            <li> I just got my curling wand today and decided to try it out.  I used the middle iron and I love it.  It worked great! I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other sized irons!</li>
            <li> Was kinda hesitant after reading reviews about people receiving wrong item but I got what I ordered and wife says it works great so I&#x27;m happy with product!</li>
            <li> Great irons, no issues so far. Sizing is def off as usual with these off brands. The largest is listed as a 1.50&amp;#34; and its more like a 1.25&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter with really long thick hair.  She loves it! Heats up fast and curls last. Takes some practice and ser works well together.</li>
            <li> This is a good set! Very fast shipping anf curls my hair well.</li>
            <li> Works really good! Had no serious issues with it at all. Only thing was changing the sizes is kinda hard but other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> I just wanted to find a reasonably priced styling wand with more then one size barrel and this was it. I bought one for myself and one for my sister. Since we have fine hair, the bigger barrel doesn&#x27;t give very lasting curl, but the 2 smaller barrels give great curl and volume. It takes a while to get used to them if you have never used a wand before, but once you have its a great thing to have.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY! I purchased this curling iron set and today I received a pack of dollar store balloons. Is this a joke?! Amazon customer service sucked. All they could do is refund my money, which takes 3 days and asked me to re-purchase. Glad I wasted 2 day shipping for nothing. Amazon would not give me sellers contact info to ensure right shipment if I do re-purchase. At this point, I am scared to put more money on the line!!! PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU SHIP OUT PEOPLE!&lt;br /&gt;Re-purchased.... was promised that this would not happen again! SELLER IS A CROOK!! PISSED OFF FOR THE LAST TIME! Purchased curler set now twice, both times I received a dollar store package of balloons. All I get is an I am sorry for the inconvenience? WASTE OF MY TIME. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Zebra one to match our Zebra theme and received a plain black one instead.  Hoping to re-order and get the right thing this time.</li>
            <li> this product did not even work when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;It did not heat up. Horrible experience</li>
