            <li>Yes it has helped tremendously, at the start of use</li>

            <li>, I sleep better, and I have more time because I am not in my bed with the blinds closed and ear plugs in with a migraine.</li>
            <li>cream is nothing less than AMAZING!</li>

            <li>everyone around me thanks you!</li>

            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>While the package came quickly and met my expectations, it seemed to run out quicker than normal</li>
            <li>I concur with the other reviews as to how effective this product is.</li>
            <li>I was experiencing severe hot flashes and mood changes and everything that goes along with change of life and this product has really balanced my system.</li>
            <li>Haha, obviously I think it was more than this, but this really helped as we have been trying for a while and all it just took a boost of prolief to get the process started.</li>
            <li>and now i&#x27;m worried it was expired product, which would be altogether less effective...</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend it to menopausal women.</li>
            <li>Cycles are always right on track and super short periods.  </li>
            <li>so it was a \\&quot;PREDICTIBLE\\&quot; gauge to see if it really worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissatisfied.does</li>
            <li>This cream has REALLY helped me.</li>
            <li>3+ times a night to sleeping straight through.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try if you are experiencing menopause symptoms.</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were too high.  </li>

            <li>This product was recommended to me by a young friend in my office.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised Arbonne doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
            <li>The progesterone is natural and does not cause cancer.</li>
            <li>It only tells you how much to use.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by a health care professional.  </li>
            <li>WOW .</li>

            <li>I used this Product &amp;#34; Arbonne Prolief Natural Hormone Balancing Cream&amp;#34; recommened by my Chiropractor (</li>
            <li>Prolief has saved marriages, saved lives of people going through depression, allowed women who couldn&#x27;t get pregnant get pregnant, decreased menopause symptoms</li>
            <li>I still had 2-4 major migraines a month.</li>
            <li>and I have had 3 major migraines in 2 years.</li>
            <li>(Apparently she used it for stretch marks and some hormone imbalance.)</li>
            <li>My night sweats and physical symptoms of PMS went away completely.</li>

            <li> I have had less hot flashes</li>
            <li> Finally, no more hot flashes every 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> Not sure it was worth the money I paid since the pump didn&#x27;t work correctly.</li>
            <li> If it were at least 5 oz (figure in $3 for packaging), I would be willing to pay $60.</li>
            <li> I love the product but the pump failed before it was empty.  </li>
            <li> I had regular cycles with little to no cramps.</li>
            <li> I have low testosterone, but the pills were making my periods worse as well as increasing facial and body hair (gross!).</li>
            <li> The doctor gave me birth control that made my mood swings extreme.</li>
            <li> It has helped reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines which I used to have due to progestrone imbalance every month.</li>
            <li> I still get some cramping with my period but haven&#x27;t had any cysts (or at least cyst pain) since starting this product.</li>
            <li> Age:46-I have slowly seen my emotional stability begin to deteriorate.</li>
            <li> + pounds everyday.  </li>
            <li> After the first month, my patience was returned and irritability lessened with only one pump per day, as well as, my horrible period cramps/</li>
            <li> No more pill popping for migraines.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel less tired.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no where near as bad as when I was taking pills.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It loses value.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference in skin tone and what little information is on the bottle is vague, giving you no goal to reach.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from terrible hot flashes.</li>
            <li> I was getting discouraged because I wanted it to work immediately because of the discomfort of severe hot flashes that made me miserable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and my body was going crazy over this past year after quitting birth control.  </li>
            <li> I had horrible cramps and ovarian cysts on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> There not as bad when I use this 2x&#x27;s a day, was recommended by my chiropractor.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that I was unable to finish off this product.  </li>
            <li> I had terrible problems with my cycle, severe  cramps, pms, etc.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> said it could cause cancer,</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Quick service.</li>
            <li> Love this. Easy to apply, no sticky feeling.  Works quickly.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a young friend in my office. She said she had a great experience with it following the birth of her youngest child. (Apparently she used it for stretch marks and some hormone imbalance.) I am middle-aged and had no idea what to expect from the product, except that she thought the product would keep my (already) good skin looking good. I noticed no difference in skin tone and what little information is on the bottle is vague, giving you no goal to reach. There was no skin irritation from the creme, but I didn&#x27;t notice that anything at all actually changed. Perhaps I just don&#x27;t know what to look for???</li>
            <li> Age:46-I have slowly seen my emotional stability begin to deteriorate. I was becoming easily irritated, quick tempered, and literally whinny. This was not me and I knew it. The doctor gave me birth control that made my mood swings extreme. Who wants to take one more pill everyday, UGH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is nothing less than AMAZING! I started using twice a day and within the first week I felt a calm I hadn&#x27;t felt for a long time. After the first month, my patience was returned and irritability lessened with only one pump per day, as well as, my horrible period cramps/back aches \\&quot;almost\\&quot; gone.  I am a home schooling mom with a 4th grader ... I know I have not imagined this change because \\&quot;school lessons\\&quot; remain the same so it was a \\&quot;PREDICTIBLE\\&quot; gauge to see if it really worked. Ladies, IT WORKS! I do make sure I only put it on a thinner skinned area just after I have showered to be sure my body is able to absorb and not blocked from natural skin oils forming.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the most work this result takes.  Thank you, Arbonne!</li>
            <li> I have really liked this product!</li>
            <li> Arbonne Prolief Balancing Cream is an excellent product. It has helped reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines which I used to have due to progestrone imbalance every month. My doctor advised me to use this cream and I am very glad to have found a solution to my headaches.</li>
            <li> The pumps did not work and I need a replacement for both</li>
            <li> I can sleep sooo much better now.  This is a great over the counter product!  I certainly recommend it to menopausal women.</li>
            <li> I chose the rating because of the pump.it&#x27;s alot of money to&lt;br /&gt;Pay for 2.5oz to begin with.i think the product is amazing.with the pump not working&lt;br /&gt;I feel I&#x27;m not getting the full benefit from the product.i heard one the cream is exposed to air&lt;br /&gt;It loses value. I&#x27;m very dissatisfied.does anyone have any tips to get the pump to work?</li>
            <li> According to my OB-GYN, this cream works for about 65% of women who are experiencing the beginnings of hormornal changes pre-menopause. I was getting some heart palpitations, couldn&#x27;t sleep and experiencing an overall feeling of being supercharged a week to a week-and-a-half before my period. This cream has REALLY helped me. I would suggest asking your doctor about it. I use one pump at night on days 12-26 of my cycle. Hope this helps someone!</li>
            <li> I used this for 1 out of my 3 pregnancies and I had never felt so good I continued to use it for a while and it totally Helps get rid of pms to the review that says in the state of California it will cause cancer just to let you know everywhere you go on California there are signs that say that everywhere you go! even when you go out to eat it just has to do with some law there!</li>
            <li> I love the product but the pump failed before it was empty.  I am very disappointed that I was unable to finish off this product.  I am teluctant to order another.</li>
            <li> It really works! Finally, no more hot flashes every 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> A miracle.  I went from waking up drenched 3+ times a night to sleeping straight through.  The furnace is turned off.</li>
            <li> I am finding I love it.  It is making an amazing change in my well-being. I am going to reorder at this time.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing severe hot flashes and mood changes and everything that goes along with change of life and this product has really balanced my system.</li>
            <li> I began using Arbonne Cream about 2 months ago, after 2 years of experiencing worsening menopausal symptoms.  I am age 48.  Based on my own research, I believed myself to have estrogen dominance.  After further research, I found many recommendations for the Arbonne cream so decided to give it a try.  Within a few days of starting to use it, I began to feel better and more energetic.  My hot flashes and night sweats gradually went away, and now are completely gone! I feel like myself again.</li>
            <li> A natural way to balance &#x27;life&#x27;!  Will definitely purchase again!  Thank you....and, I should add, everyone around me thanks you!</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it works for my itching skin while I go through menopause.  It was given to me to try and have not stopped using it.I am really surprised Arbonne doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
            <li> This really helps relieve my night sweats, tenderness, and helps me sleep. I highly recommend giving it a try if you are experiencing menopause symptoms.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has helped my hormonal acne and keep me on a regular cycle. Very Thankful.</li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were too high.  It did help with my sleep but that is about it.  At this stage of life you have to find the product that works for you.</li>
            <li> Ive been to,d it takes a bit to really notice a difference but I do see an improvement .... I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it.  Made my hormones all wacky.</li>
            <li> I just read on my bottle that this product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.  Do not use if pregnant, considering becoming pregnant, or breast feeding.  People with known medical conditions should consult with a physician prior to using this product.  Studies have shown that the use of ingredients in this product may pose a risk to your health.  Discontinue use if sensitivity occurs. After reading this I have stopped using this product.</li>
            <li> I order this to help my migraines, I think it does work! There not as bad when I use this 2x&#x27;s a day, was recommended by my chiropractor.</li>
            <li> My night sweats and physical symptoms of PMS went away completely. I&#x27;m petite, so I&#x27;m using smaller pumps, not always twice a day. It really has helped me feel much better though my peri-menopause.</li>
            <li> There is a difference between progesterone and progesterine. The latter is cancer causing because it is synthetic. The progesterone is natural and does not cause cancer. The state of California puts that label on almost every skin care, beauty, or hormone product that is sold there. Prolief has saved marriages, saved lives of people going through depression, allowed women who couldn&#x27;t get pregnant get pregnant, decreased menopause symptoms and I could go on and on. Yes I am a consultant, but yes I have watched this product change lives including my own. If you have any questions please contact me at jd0482@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years ,it really helps and makes you feel great  . Makes you feel less tired.</li>
            <li> I concur with the other reviews as to how effective this product is. My only frustration is that the product is only 2.5 oz, though it appears much larger because of the packaging, so $14 an ounce. If it were at least 5 oz (figure in $3 for packaging), I would be willing to pay $60.</li>
            <li> PERFECT BALANCING CREAM. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 5 YEARS NOW.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from terrible hot flashes. They were intesnse and were coming every 20 minutes.  They woke me up at night. I tried a herbal supplement and it helped a bit, but not enough. I tried this and saw an immediate effect. My hot flashes are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life- Winnig for CMT&lt;br /&gt;www.run4cmt.com</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it has always been successful for me. I will continue to purchase this until it is no longer available. I recommend this product if you have premenstral symptoms.</li>
            <li> Have been using this since 5/2014.  I&#x27;m 31 and my body was going crazy over this past year after quitting birth control.  This has helped with my sleeping, mood swings and water weight.  I&#x27;m now at a more stable weight, no more up/down 5+ pounds everyday.  Not only do I recommend this to all my friends, but my husband tells all his friends to have their wives take it too.  Cycles are always right on track and super short periods.  No discomfort or side effects.</li>
            <li> I had terrible problems with my cycle, severe  cramps, pms, etc.  Within three months of use.  I had regular cycles with little to no cramps. I take it at bedtime, because it makes me sleepy.  Bonus effect</li>
            <li> I worry this was sold to me illegally...as my sister is an Arbonne seller and thinks it may not be a good idea to buy Arbonne products online. The products may be expired. While the package came quickly and met my expectations, it seemed to run out quicker than normal and now i&#x27;m worried it was expired product, which would be altogether less effective...</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure how this cream is going to work. I was dissapointed that there weren&#x27;t any indications on this product.  It only tells you how much to use. I looked  online and. It doesn&#x27;t say anything on how it works or what to be carefull with, etc.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly.This product was recommended to me by a health care professional.  I have just started using it so I don&#x27;t know the full effect yet but am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> Amazing! No more pill popping for migraines. I was spending approx $200.00 in co-pays to \\&quot;assist\\&quot; with my migraines every month (4-8 pills someday days)and I still had 2-4 major migraines a month. I have been using this for 2 years now and I have had 3 major migraines in 2 years. WOW . I have had less hot flashes, I sleep better, and I have more time because I am not in my bed with the blinds closed and ear plugs in with a migraine. My Doctor still wants me to pop the pills because he says this wont last............hahahhah 2 years and still in love this with wonderful product!!!!! All natural and NO Doctor pushing pills! All you have to do is try it, if it doesn&#x27;t work what have you lost $38.00.... if it does work BETTER for you than all those pills.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with hot flashes .... migraines .... sleep problems .... Try this product!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.  Menopausal symptoms are no laughing matter.  This products helps you feel like yourself again.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it has made such a difference, thank you Arbonne.</li>
            <li> Yes it has helped tremendously, at the start of use I was getting discouraged because I wanted it to work immediately because of the discomfort of severe hot flashes that made me miserable. But after several applications I noticed and felt a difference so I say thank you.</li>
            <li> By far the best hormonal creams Ive bought in a long time! Quality vs price is great! Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> Better results than prescription</li>
            <li> Am already seeing a difference with this cream.....love it</li>
            <li> I was on progesterone pills for months and they weren&#x27;t working well - I have low testosterone, but the pills were making my periods worse as well as increasing facial and body hair (gross!). My Doctor actually took me off the pills and recommended this product and it was worked miracles! I had horrible cramps and ovarian cysts on a regular basis. I still get some cramping with my period but haven&#x27;t had any cysts (or at least cyst pain) since starting this product. I still get some chin hair from time to time but it&#x27;s no where near as bad as when I was taking pills. I only use it on days 11-25 of my cycle. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been wakeing up to drenched sheets and nothing I had tried stopped the Day and Night Sweats&lt;br /&gt;until I used this Product &amp;#34; Arbonne Prolief Natural Hormone Balancing Cream&amp;#34; recommened by my Chiropractor (what a Great guy).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, no guessing about the amount to use.  It&amp;#34;s Great</li>
            <li> The pump did not work well so it was not always dispensed correctly.  The product itself was acceptable. Not sure it was worth the money I paid since the pump didn&#x27;t work correctly.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent shipping. Highly recommend this vendor and product.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years and I am very satisified.</li>
            <li> Haha, obviously I think it was more than this, but this really helped as we have been trying for a while and all it just took a boost of prolief to get the process started. Great all natural product. Used it with my last pregnancy as well :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
