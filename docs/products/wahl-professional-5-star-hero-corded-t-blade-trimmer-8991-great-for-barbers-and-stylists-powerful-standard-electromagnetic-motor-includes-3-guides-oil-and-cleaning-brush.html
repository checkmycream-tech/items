            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love these trimmers!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes u get more!  </li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Received this trimmer and was looking forward to using it as I have seen many great reviews, but the trimmer was defective right out of the package!!!  </li>
            <li>But once I out it on it was amazing</li>
            <li>One of the best on the market may be more powerful than the wahl detailer.  </li>
            <li>This thing is the perfect size and has alot of power(Does not Vibrate to much).</li>
            <li>I might add but the angle of the blade kind of hinders you abit</li>
            <li>It would be nice if I had a choice of combs for it.  </li>
            <li>these wahl clippers are nice.</li>
            <li>quality made and nicely priced.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and in great condition!</li>
            <li>I own 4 liners and 2 faders.</li>
            <li>and this is the most superior liner to hit the market.</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer to do my own shape ups.</li>
            <li>but this is a handy trimmer.</li>
            <li>these things are nice to use.  </li>
            <li>and i thought to myself I can save alot if i just purchased my own.</li>
            <li>Look nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought all the reviews were just hype</li>
            <li>I own the andis outliners 1 and 2, m3s, T edgers, styliners 2 and have been using these for years.</li>
            <li>Had it for about 3-4 months works great for neck link clean ups.</li>
            <li>then it is also great for &#x27;quick pass&#x27; before you</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it were rechargeable, but  I suppose that might change the shape and weight which are now very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>, I felt the need to use the pro-set tool right after unboxing the trimmer!!!</li>
            <li>These work great and give you a crisp edge every time!</li>
            <li>this trimmer is a very good one ,,cuts very sharp,clean lines..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m my own barber :)</li>
            <li>This trimmer is powerful and is great for trimming a goat t.</li>
            <li>I love the guards, nice and even cut.  </li>
            <li>I have to say these trimmers are great, powerful and compact.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best liner ive ever owned!</li>
            <li>awesome, light weight and makes crisp lines.</li>
            <li>Work great light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>When you first get them I recommend zero overlapping them so that you can get a Perfect close clean trim.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all barbers.it does not cut skin like wahl peanut.it very good price compare with peanut.</li>
            <li>It works good, it feels cheap :)</li>
            <li>Cuts great and crisp.</li>
            <li>Very light touches.</li>
            <li>The plastic feels very cheap.</li>
            <li>Trimmers are very light weight</li>
            <li>once its adjusted and doest cut skin you can get very detailed lines love it.</li>
            <li>The professional brand&lt;br /&gt;is very good, and cuts/trims with ease.</li>
            <li>I would love to give them a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>Got this for a birthday present &amp; my hubby loved it!!</li>
            <li>min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison the WAHL HERO cuts a more sharper line than both the ANDIS i used before, but without the bulkiness and heat.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you oil it before a any use</li>
            <li>To be honest, this thing worked like a smooth s</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I might have read that in a review somewhere</li>
            <li>I love em&#x27;.</li>
            <li>it is more aggressive than avg.</li>
            <li>so it requires more attention if you going to shave with it.</li>
            <li>Top screw would not screw off, so i could not adjust the blade.</li>
            <li>but I like the hero way better.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so light!</li>
            <li>Pros: I love these.</li>
            <li>Out the box, this trimmer may disappoint, but give them some time after adding oil and using it for another 2-3 weeks, it has gotten better.</li>
            <li>okay..</li>
            <li>if wahl addresses the issue and designs a better machanism</li>
            <li>I also love how lightweight they are.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li>More importantly i would like to thank Wahl for providing a zero gap tool because it is hell to do on ones own.</li>
            <li>great product but not yet tested, thanks.</li>
            <li>I think the Wahl Detailer is much better ofr that</li>
            <li>I am a barber and I have many liners, but this one is in my top 3.</li>
            <li>I find myself using these more than my outliners</li>
            <li>and I gotta say its better than my andis t-outliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>work better than wahl peanut.</li>
            <li>It does not nick your skin like most clippers do.</li>
            <li>It works well and the quality is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Detailers still my favorite</li>
            <li>You will love them.</li>
            <li>Opinion the Hero&#x27;s are much better</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>ok ..</li>
            <li>but these are much better and easier to use.</li>
            <li>but I love this product a lot.</li>
            <li>the andis feel like they are better made but the blade on the hero is thinner and the clipper is faster.  </li>
            <li>Much better than any of the battery powered clippers.  </li>
            <li>I have 15 grand children...</li>
            <li>seven boys and three son-in-laws... a son and cut most of their hair....</li>
            <li>SURE</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>For the price I don&#x27;t there is a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>I must say that I am glad that I purchased these trimmers.</li>
            <li>Better than Andis liners period.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>So trust me you won&#x27;t find a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>These clippers are smal light and powerfull, this clippers are nice</li>
            <li>Great clippers fast shipping</li>
            <li>It has a quality feel, all it needs is a mildly skilled wielder to go with it.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased with these trimmers.</li>
            <li>My wahl detailers are much better a tool for barbering.</li>
            <li>but I love</li>
            <li>It cuts much better than my Andis T Outliner and that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li>Best  Deal on the net..</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I selected this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>this trimmer wahl is simply the best for a reason</li>
            <li>I zero gapped it and it cuts crisp shape ups!!!</li>
            <li>I have an Andis T-outliner which is good, but the Wahl hero just does a better job at crisp lines on one pass.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice clean line and works well on my hairline or beard.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice clean line.</li>
            <li>Happy Happy Happy, no more nappy nappy nappy!!!!!</li>
            <li>These trimmers are just as good as the higher priced Wahl trimmers.</li>
            <li>I loved them the first week I had them.</li>
            <li>Pretty good compared to andis</li>
            <li>This clipper here is pretty good</li>
            <li>I tried them for the first time and man do they have my beard looking good.</li>
            <li>and they worked pretty good...</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping and the clippers are nice addition!  </li>
            <li>Works quite fine, very light.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing for such a great quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re excellent for dry shaving.</li>
            <li>easy to use and safe on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Overall I say Wahl put together a very good clipper that is both quality and cost efficient.</li>
            <li>I will spend the extra money to get a very good one.</li>
            <li>When zeroed correctly the T liners are still more accurate b</li>
            <li>does the job great so far..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit loud, jet my girlfriend is happy with the product.</li>
            <li>While I prefer the andis t outliner which I also own a tad more, I do appreciate that the blade on these doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li>I love them light weight and gets the job done</li>
            <li>i love the cheap price.</li>
            <li>But most importantly they don&#x27;t lose alignment like the Andis t out liners and they don&#x27;t need oil.</li>
            <li>I am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>It gets the work done, it cuts very close to the skin, good for non-professional trimming.</li>
            <li>edges out good cuts fast</li>
            <li>Which is good when shaping up a whole head and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The zero gaping tool it comes with is actually useful and a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>nice decent power quick jobs good</li>
            <li>thing has power, Wahl states that it has as much power as the ANDIS MASTER full size clipper!!!</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did, these trimmers are very sharp and very easy to manuever and best of all the do not get super hot like the andis.</li>
            <li>These trimmers are a good clipper to add to your collection, they are great for beards and makes line ups even have a more sharp and crisp look to it!</li>
            <li>Other than that their perfect!</li>
            <li>Other than that I think their the best liners on the marker.</li>
            <li>He loves it and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My advice, take it easy.</li>
            <li>a better clean up job.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to hold in your hands and edge up your hair lines if needed.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is an easy to use trimmer for outlining and shaping up.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Small and Easy To Travel With&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t matter because it was easy to adjust to zero without it.</li>
            <li>If you have a strong beard or don&#x27;t shave as often</li>
            <li>These liners have been going strong.</li>
            <li>Does not seem strong, but will surprise you when you start using it.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it stays cool, doesn&#x27;t over heat easily.</li>
            <li>I can get through the hair once or twice which is pretty nice for me.</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t know why professional barbers the wahls hero because of out the box with no adjustment they cut the best all around the face beard, and back of the neck.</li>
            <li>The wahl detailor is the best wahl trimmer hands down.</li>
            <li>The 5 star trimmer is light, has a nice grip, easy to use and does not get hot.</li>
            <li>It was working perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Honey loves them easy to use light weight</li>
            <li>Still works fine for trimming and lining up though.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the delivery came so quickly.</li>
            <li>Now, it is much more lip and nose friendly when maintaining a clean line on your beard &amp; stash.</li>
            <li>perfect for around the ear and a tight neck cleaning...</li>
            <li>The clippers are VERY light (almost too light to where I thought they may be cheap) but they cut very crisp and precise.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good trimmer to clean up or what ever it may be, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>They hit nice crisp clean lines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is perfect for a beginner or novice, cuts clean without being too sharp and will be sufficient for me until we find a replacement barber in the area!</li>
            <li>a couple days later,firs ttime i turned it on,very power motor,cuts and trims very nice,leaves nice edges and precise lines according to your arm</li>
            <li>Not as I thought they would be and not as accurate as the T-Trimmers</li>
            <li>Overall a great edger with lots of power.</li>
            <li>** coming out of an ass, it cuts hair so smooth .</li>
            <li>Smooth against the skin and no ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Worked perfect for a few weeks, then stopped working about 5 weeks in after literally using the machine about 8 to 10 times.</li>
            <li>Overall a great trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really cheap material</li>
            <li>its precise..</li>
            <li>but once I break them in, they will be fantastic.</li>
            <li>btw, i had to request for the tool from wahl (it&#x27;s free, just call em and ask for the t-blade tool).</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great personal trimmer</li>
            <li>He said he can&#x27;t believe how nice this trimmer is compared to the much cheaper trimmer he was using before this.</li>
            <li>I give them 5 stars because they deliver accurate and precise points and lines.</li>
            <li>Great while they last</li>
            <li>light Weight</li>
            <li>These are easy to clean and take apart and reassemble; they even include a blade adjustment tool to zero gap.  </li>
            <li>Great clippers, especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Feel cheap</li>
            <li>The Newer trimmer is more powerful</li>
            <li>light weight and does not heat up like andis.</li>
            <li>Wahl Professional WA8991 Hero T Blade Trimmer great for trimming not cutting hear.</li>
            <li>then I oiled them up good, Wow the overheating problem wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>I needed a good trimmer and this does the job as well as any professional trimmer barbers have used on me.</li>
            <li>excellent product for a much cheaper price then your local hair products store.  </li>
            <li>Its lightweight which is a good thing and doesn&#x27;t really get hot that easily.</li>
            <li>They are extremely light and very powerful.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to zero gap if not set right and maintenance it after use.</li>
            <li>Very good sharp crisp lines without hesitation!!</li>
            <li>Haha!!!</li>
            <li>I must say this trimmer is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>They are very powerful trimmers that will leave you line up looking crispy.</li>
            <li>it was described as to be the best when it comes down to shaping up your beard or cut, instead the blade was dough and not cutting.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice product, can be very sharp when adjusted and is very light.</li>
            <li>but it works great not too loud crisp clean edging</li>
            <li>but for 30 odd bucks, I&#x27;m more than happy.</li>
            <li>If you want something easy, light weight, and powerful.</li>
            <li>very handy, small for nice trimming ability.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>and it was a nice change from the normal.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m used the the size now and the pack a powerful punch!</li>
            <li>Product is good and there are no major complaints but its quite loud and not as good as I thought it would be based on reviews.  </li>
            <li>I accepted!&lt;br /&gt;The blade is sharp....very clean points.</li>
            <li>I also have noticed the blades tend to rust, and I clean them before or after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So be cautious when giving a clean edge up or lined up the beard.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a trimmer to clean up around the edges after I do my haircut.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to clean up my hair line a maintain my beard.</li>
            <li>I had heard so many positive things &amp; seen so many positive reviews about these trimmers.</li>
            <li>Although they are very sharp,they are also very smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>Is a great, precise, and sharp trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nicely designed with a clean metallic look, reasonably priced, trims a beard like weasel running the bleeding edge off a methadrine high (in a good way).</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re light-weight, fit comfortably in your hand and are great for getting around those tight corners and ears.</li>
            <li>After a few months of use, keeping in mind that I am not a barber, this feels like a very good quality tool that I can use for maintaining the look between the cuts.</li>
            <li>great clipper just how i expected it to be, got to me within 5 days</li>
            <li>Read the reviews itw good for personal use .</li>
            <li>Very,very light but powerful motor.</li>
            <li>If that isn&#x27;t good enough for you it came with a pro set tool that helps you \\&quot;zero gap\\&quot; the blades.</li>
            <li>Andis Cool Care Plus.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the hero t blade is a good product.  </li>
            <li>these clippers look nice, cut close, but are a bit too loud</li>
            <li>This might be good for someone to use for personal home usebut nothing mre</li>
            <li>The trimmer is light weight &amp; powerful.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but nooooooooo good for facial hair or sideburns.</li>
            <li>This trimmer cuts so good, I&#x27;m simply speechless.  </li>
            <li>My blades were not lined up when I first opened it but easily adjustable.</li>
            <li>The shave is great and extremely close.  </li>
            <li>If the price difference between these trimmers and the Andis has you second guessing don&#x27;t be fooled by how much cheaper they are because they are a GREAT PAIR OF TRIMMERS and also would be great for traveling vice the Andis due to size.</li>
            <li>really well I am happy with this product but only used it once.</li>
            <li>Trims super close and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>and then just do a quick pass with a razor.</li>
            <li>They are also super lite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this with the Wahl super close shaver to help reduce and/or eliminate ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li>The Wahl Hero is definitely smaller than most top of the liner trimmers but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the andis cordless trimmers as well, there like 40$ and work better than hero&#x27;s</li>
            <li>You might wanna try the trimmers right out the box and see if they cut good enough already.</li>
            <li>There are many options to choose in trimmers, but this little Hero has become my Big Hero and it performs flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>does the trick, very sharp , may need to adjust for kids, but it works great</li>
            <li>I have to say I like these Whal Hero trimmers for shaving more than the Andis T-Outliner even after I put the new blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my new trimmers.</li>
            <li>All in all these are pretty good trimmers, the power is definately there, and the size is a plus, but I think the cord may be abit short..</li>
            <li>Im not a professional but adjusting the buzzer to make it sharper is a pain , Im sure this goes for many buzzers aswell</li>
            <li>It cuts very well and is easy to control.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for &amp; some!</li>
            <li>i feel like calling wahl and saying this is why andis and oster gets talked about in a higher regaurd they make metal pieces!</li>
            <li>Small in compact to easily fit in hand;yet very powerful!!!</li>
            <li>It gave a crisp line right out the box!</li>
            <li>Very neat and precise edge up.</li>
            <li>My old peanuts worked better than these..</li>
            <li>The Heros do have a powerful motor however, I still prefer the andis T liners.</li>
            <li>Also, I tried lining myself up w/ success</li>
            <li>Thank you Wahl for standing behind your product, as these are still one of the best trimmers on the Market!!!</li>
            <li>No customer would enjoy this loud of sound in ear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My old trimmer was an &#x27;okay&#x27; battery powered rechargable.  </li>
            <li>So far these are my favorite trimmers.</li>
            <li>These trimmers are powerful, use these trimmers for home use.</li>
            <li>These trimmers are well worth the buck.</li>
            <li>Lightweight but powerful</li>
            <li>I use this more for children and people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful and cuts clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just make sure you press lightly and only cut at the correct angle</li>
            <li>You have to take off the outer case so its ideal for cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li>Fits my smaller hand nicely.</li>
            <li>As powerful as the reviews make these out to be seemed elusive to me.</li>
            <li>This thing is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Initially purchased one pair to do clients hair as well as my own, and I loved the Hero so much that I bought two additional pairs for future backups and just in case I could not find them again.  </li>
            <li>Love them they are sharp and way better than the Andis style liners I used to use.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the larger T-Outline blades for these trimmers and have set them but not used them as of yet because I am pleased with the original blades at the moment.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the Oster Fast Feed from Amazon and these are a great compliment to each other.</li>
            <li>i think this trimmer could be a really good match for any other one on the markey</li>
            <li>They will become razor sharp but the blades don&#x27;t bite (cut your skin) which is good.</li>
            <li>but hey, everyone has to try it for themselves, right??</li>
            <li>and they turned right up</li>
            <li>They get very close and are great for cleaning up the neckline, I&#x27;ve even used them to trim down to zero on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this little trimmer has more power than you would expect and is very precise.</li>
            <li>they are powerful and they dont get hot like the andis outliners do.</li>
            <li>i still prefer my Andis T-Outliners but when using the Andis for several clients in a row, the blade can become super hot!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also good for trimming down my beard before I go over it with my 5-Star Shaper Shaver.</li>
            <li>3 little guides are nice and fit snug so they won&#x27;t fall of but not as versatile for beard trimming since spacing</li>
            <li>I also like how it comes with a maintenance clip so you can easily adjust the head back to the original setting if it were to fall out of alignment</li>
            <li>Another fantastic product from the\\&quot;NEW and IMPROVED WAHL CLIPPERS and TRIMMERS\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Now this trimmer does have a strong loud motor.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to send somebody used clippers it would be a nice idea to sanitize and try to clean the previous hairs.</li>
            <li>Works better on ethnic hair than straight Caucasian hair in my professional opinion.  </li>
            <li>Overall they are great to be so small and cute</li>
            <li>good for lining up, however I wish it was a little stronger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit louder than I had hoped for but it is so much higher in quality than the crappy plastic norelco beard trimmer units.  </li>
            <li>I may need to get to T blade instead of the regular blade to be able to line the front of my head up.</li>
            <li>Exactly what anyone needs to line up your bread or your hairline.</li>
            <li>Quality of the product seems first rate.</li>
            <li>I had to adjust the blades at first, but after adjusting this trimmer has been working like a charm.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer seemed just okay enough not to send back,until the screw that keeps the metal plate held in place came off.  </li>
            <li>cause the motor stopped on the first set after two years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it performs consistently.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely put this as one the top 3 trimmers ever.</li>
            <li>Make sure you adjust properly or</li>
            <li>After a while the blades get too hot and burn the skin when edging a hair cut</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>When you first pick it up you think this is some bullsh!t</li>
            <li>this is my favorite tiny trimmer...better than peanut..</li>
            <li>This trimmer is a lot better than the personal one that Wahl makes.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY YOU WILL GET, INSTEAD OF GIVING TRICKY DESCRIPTIONS AND PICTURES</li>
            <li>Cuts pretty well&lt;</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these to professionals and anyone looking for a dependable, light, and cool operating trimmer.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot at all.  </li>
            <li>This clipper can be better than a razor if you properly zero gap the blade.</li>
            <li>Very close, super fast motor.</li>
            <li>These are much more suitable for smaller children and they cut pretty sharp right out of the package, no adjustment needed.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, easy to handle, and gives a sharp line.  </li>
            <li>I took them apart and clean them completely</li>
            <li>Cut with utter easy straight out the box!  </li>
            <li>This trimmer does a very good job of cutting straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>Trimmer runs fast &amp; does not get hot.</li>
            <li>trimms chest hear, sides, its good all over but small jobs.</li>
            <li>The attachments/guards are nice to fade in side burns or even knock down your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There extremely sharp out the box clean cut light and doesnt really run hot.. must have and there inexpensive</li>
            <li>These trimmers (combined with the Wahl Double Wide T-Blade) are amazing!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is small but gives a close shave,  it gets the job done and is very compact,  it is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>I left them on for 15min straight and barely got warm.</li>
            <li>Nice liner..smaller, so easier too get into tight places like mustaches.</li>
            <li>Cuts nice and tight.</li>
            <li>They do a fine job cleaning up around my ears and the back of my neck, etc.</li>
            <li>Its sharp, fast, strong, and when you set it up with zero-gap, it will cut skin!</li>
            <li>Good clippers just a little loud but.</li>
            <li>They cuty very sharp and they are super easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>overall,it may not look powerful,but as others have said,its very power,it gets the job done...</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t that much of a problem.</li>
            <li>Once u adjust them they are the real deal.</li>
            <li>work very well</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>The hump in the front is very distracting when doing a line up.</li>
            <li>Very Lightweight and work very well.</li>
            <li>He loves these trimmers and it worked really well  for him trimmer his gold-T.</li>
            <li>but can we really believe them??</li>
            <li>anyways, i really dig the rotary motor...</li>
            <li>but no so much for a stylist</li>
            <li>You dont need to adjust them much.</li>
            <li>I use the &amp;#34;Hero T Blade trimmer&amp;#34; for the straight line cuts.</li>
            <li>As a reviewer stated &amp;#34;It is very loud&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Blade didn&#x27;t need much adjusting.</li>
            <li>I like this trimmer so much that I put my Andis T-Edjer up.</li>
            <li>I still need to pre trim with electric hair cutter because my beard is very course</li>
            <li>Competes very well with Andis</li>
            <li>They cut very close</li>
            <li>As a cosmetologist I can guarantee you&#x27;ll really like these trimmers.  </li>
            <li>they cut very close.  </li>
            <li>Very lite on the hand ...</li>
            <li>thanks....</li>
            <li>makes my work much easier</li>
            <li>Andis and oater need to really step it up.</li>
            <li>It gets really close shave</li>
            <li>Recieved my package in a very timely manner which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>Really precise, lightweight and pleasent to use, only downside: it doesnt come with a blade guard</li>
            <li>The trimmer fits nicely and firm in your hand while you are using it.  </li>
            <li>i used to just use my body trimmers to shape myself up but got tired of not being able to get into the edges of my line good enough.</li>
            <li>I messed up my first one and had to purchase a new one after owning it for five years.</li>
            <li>but they are all true, these joints hit, and I mean hard, after almost 20 years using the andis styliners I took a chance with these, and it was a good move, they are very light to a point that u would think there toys</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and pretty small.</li>
            <li>other than that they&#x27;re my favorite</li>
            <li>I love how sharp my shape ups look when I use this trimmer.</li>
            <li>If they are able to cut my son&#x27;s hair razor sharp.</li>
            <li>its sharp but leaves many marks.</li>
            <li>These clippers provides crisp sharp linings and they stay cool for after 30 minutes, I really did feel it get hot until about 45 mins.</li>
            <li>Great price, small, give the quiet of the motor a 3/5</li>
            <li>If you adjust the blade right, you&#x27;ll get zero nicks and can buzz your head down pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys the look of a razor sharp line-up.</li>
            <li>had to get the blade adjusted, crisp lining and gets the job done, this is my spare liners, not everyday use</li>
            <li>Its small and its nice for shaping up clients.</li>
            <li>I only used it a hand full of time and it started pulling my hair instead of trimming.</li>
            <li>Pretty loud buzzing while in use.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>These are one of my favorite trimmers hands down.</li>
            <li>excellent trimmer be careful they are sharp and will cut you if you don&#x27;t adjust the blades correctly, powerful little trimmer!</li>
            <li>Better than previously purchased Oster Finish Line Salon Textured System trimmers.</li>
            <li>Mainly using this machine when it comes to beards.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a decent pair of trimmers for quite some time until I purchased these.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly, and I actually got a random compliment from a guy at a party.  </li>
            <li>Absolute complete garbage!</li>
            <li>Very Loud motor!  </li>
            <li>Go slow and make sure you have it lined up right.</li>
            <li>Motor is not strong enough for a really good lining.</li>
            <li>strong powerful little machine, Very light weight, goes thru thick beards pretty easily, may cut skin at times very sharp, Im a barber for 11 years plus</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to the at home</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t trim too quickly but does the job for the most part with a few passes in the same area.  </li>
            <li>If your in a busy shop with a large client list these are a must have.</li>
            <li>Very easy to get into small areas of the face.</li>
            <li>I should have invested a little bit more money for some nicer ones.</li>
            <li>I love this little guy.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>they are sharp and easy to zero with the tool provided.</li>
            <li>Not as strong or sharp as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Dont get me wrong,they are very sharp but SMOOTH.Well to say the least,WAHL thanks again for another fine product.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old son has hair that grows really fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping also original packaging came with 4 other items in one box.</li>
            <li>When I first got these I did a simple shape up on myself, Wow they hit pretty close compare to a close shave after a day.</li>
            <li>I always use Andis Cool Care Plus or Whals spray for clippers that I had already before every use and it keeps them cutting good.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, quiet and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a lot of little trimmers that died quickly, this one feels substantial and powerful.</li>
            <li>Clipper and they are sharp enough that once is good enough tap and go.</li>
            <li>my only concern is the blade is the blade isn&#x27;t set right.</li>
            <li>They are nice and small, reasonably quiet and cut very well.  </li>
            <li>It is SHARP and precise.  </li>
            <li>ALSO HAS A NEW BLADE OUT.</li>
            <li>I trully think whal does this on purpose so you can keep buying new ones.</li>
            <li>Since I had to order new blades</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to my area, and have yet to find a barber who can tackle our job...</li>
            <li>I noticed that his new barber uses these</li>
            <li>I gave it to my barber/stylist while it was still new</li>
            <li>Again, nothing wrong with it, nice solid feel, sharp blades, looks good.</li>
            <li>out&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;These are VERY LOUD trimmers.</li>
            <li>Very very loud.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by this clipper.</li>
            <li>Would love a v5000 or v9000 motor in a small trimmer balding clipper.  </li>
            <li>and I feel that the hook loop/hole is too small for most hooks</li>
            <li>Very nice little trimmer, smaller than expected and louder than anticipated when compared to its size.</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as my Wahl T-Blade, but this is MUCH better on my sensitive areas, like the back of my neck.</li>
            <li>Was not sharp out of the box.had to adjust several times to get right</li>
            <li>I used other Trimmers before such as ANDIS styliner M3 and the T outliner, The M3 vibrates way to much and gets hot way to quick and really heavy, The T_Outliner vibrates to much and gets hot after 5</li>
            <li>They are strong and powerful and with a simple You Tube search on how to zero these bad boys out, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>and sometimes it makes loud noise.</li>
            <li>but so far I zero gap them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned just about every pair of professional trimmers and/or clippers on the market.  </li>
            <li>Way too loud to use on my clients.</li>
            <li>They are a bit loud but who cares</li>
            <li>but these were gentle enough to use on all ages without nicking skin.</li>
            <li>This is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i do not cut professionally</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 16 year old barber</li>
            <li>It is loud if you have a guide attached.</li>
            <li>My only concern is that it may break very easliy, if it falls.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always had to get the blades professionally sharpened before using, but this is not the case with the Wahl 5 star trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a professional product and it&#x27;s made to endure.  </li>
            <li>Not recommend for professional use because of this.</li>
            <li>I used to be a professional hair dresser</li>
            <li>Weaker motor than Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer</li>
            <li>A must for all barbers whether at home or professional</li>
            <li>but they are far from it</li>
            <li>and I was initially taking back by how powerful they were.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a licensed professional do not waste your money on these they can barely cut a neckline!!!</li>
            <li>Also, since it&#x27;s so small, it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Small but has a strong motor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not to through andis under the bus, these clipper are better because their is a lower chance of me cutting my clients and they don&#x27;t get hot as fast</li>
            <li>Trimmer is powerful &amp; sharp.</li>
            <li>Nice crisp lines with little pressure, very small and compact.</li>
            <li>and it hits pretty hard when u set it right</li>
            <li>i often went back to my other trimmer to clean up what the wahl hero could not get.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy these trimmers, they are small &amp; also durable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light, and small.</li>
            <li>Small and light</li>
            <li>is minimal (0.5&amp;#34;, 1&amp;#34;, 1.5&amp;#34;), I imagine value would come in for fades.</li>
            <li>My first experience with t-blade trimmers was with my brother&#x27;s Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer, which works extremely well</li>
            <li>Extremely precise, clean cutting action.</li>
            <li>(Although I&#x27;m only an amateur! :-) )</li>
            <li>They are not sharp out the box, but if you zero gap the blade</li>
            <li>It does not get hot nor does it cut my skin like other clippers out there.</li>
            <li>Powerful little trimmer.</li>
            <li>These are quiet, just the right size and not too sharp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Think i&#x27;ll be staying away from Wahl products in general.</li>
            <li>Not only did I receive a used product directly from Amazon</li>
            <li>I barely noticed it was there.</li>
            <li>On the downside it is slightly noisy, but overall it is a great investment to take any barber&#x27;s game to the next level.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and forth between the detailer (which sounded less than powerful, closer to a peanut) and the Andis detailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clippers are still cutting good, however, you must remember to oil them at least once every 2 months and keep the blade clean of hair after each trimming.</li>
            <li>As others have said, the blades are sharp and cut very close.  </li>
            <li>They are a little bigger but are well worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it seems to be cheaply built.</li>
            <li>the power and the blade sharpness and design the only thing wierd is that the head of the blade is angled really far back</li>
            <li>I admit, out of the box it was not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>Will certainly have to consider other models/brands before buying this trimmer again!</li>
            <li>and it is hard to clean properly.</li>
            <li>2 things I disliked, first the body of it is too fat when your shaping up somebody or even your self</li>
            <li>Small in size but has a powerful punch</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to break down and learn how to use a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The high blade speed of these trimmers set them apart from other rotary motors.  </li>
            <li>The power of this little trimmer is amazing doesn&#x27;t heat up has a rotary motor can also put the t wide blade for extra closeness and for 30.00 how could you not love</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that these do get hot which can make a cut with someone who is sensitive.</li>
            <li>Besides being a bit weak, the clipper does give you a precise shave when used properly.</li>
            <li>They are Small and light weight and have really sharp blades and comes with a zero gaping tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Oster fast feed cutters and this little wahl trimmer for the finishing touches...</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that its not ideal for cuttting your own hair due to the bulkiness of the front of the case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little loud, but not too loud.</li>
            <li>Now that we have the good out of the way here comes the bad.</li>

            <li> Sometimes u get more!  </li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> Received this trimmer and was looking forward to using it as I have seen many great reviews, but the trimmer was defective right out of the package!!!  </li>
            <li> But once I out it on it was amazing</li>
            <li> One of the best on the market may be more powerful than the wahl detailer.  </li>
            <li> This thing is the perfect size and has alot of power(Does not Vibrate to much).</li>
            <li> I might add but the angle of the blade kind of hinders you abit</li>
            <li> It would be nice if I had a choice of combs for it.  </li>
            <li> these wahl clippers are nice.</li>
            <li> quality made and nicely priced.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and in great condition!</li>
            <li> I own 4 liners and 2 faders.</li>
            <li> and this is the most superior liner to hit the market.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to do my own shape ups.</li>
            <li> but this is a handy trimmer.</li>
            <li> these things are nice to use.  </li>
            <li> and i thought to myself I can save alot if i just purchased my own.</li>
            <li> Look nice.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought all the reviews were just hype</li>
            <li> I own the andis outliners 1 and 2, m3s, T edgers, styliners 2 and have been using these for years.</li>
            <li> Had it for about 3-4 months works great for neck link clean ups.</li>
            <li> then it is also great for &#x27;quick pass&#x27; before you</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it were rechargeable, but  I suppose that might change the shape and weight which are now very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> , I felt the need to use the pro-set tool right after unboxing the trimmer!!!</li>
            <li> These work great and give you a crisp edge every time!</li>
            <li> this trimmer is a very good one ,,cuts very sharp,clean lines..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m my own barber :)</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful and is great for trimming a goat t.</li>
            <li> I love the guards, nice and even cut.  </li>
            <li> I have to say these trimmers are great, powerful and compact.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best liner ive ever owned!</li>
            <li> awesome, light weight and makes crisp lines.</li>
            <li> Work great light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> When you first get them I recommend zero overlapping them so that you can get a Perfect close clean trim.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for all barbers.it does not cut skin like wahl peanut.it very good price compare with peanut.</li>
            <li> It works good, it feels cheap :)</li>
            <li> Cuts great and crisp.</li>
            <li> Very light touches.</li>
            <li> The plastic feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> Trimmers are very light weight</li>
            <li> once its adjusted and doest cut skin you can get very detailed lines love it.</li>
            <li> The professional brand&lt;br /&gt;is very good, and cuts/trims with ease.</li>
            <li> I would love to give them a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Got this for a birthday present &amp; my hubby loved it!!</li>
            <li> min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison the WAHL HERO cuts a more sharper line than both the ANDIS i used before, but without the bulkiness and heat.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you oil it before a any use</li>
            <li> To be honest, this thing worked like a smooth s</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I might have read that in a review somewhere</li>
            <li> I love em&#x27;.</li>
            <li> it is more aggressive than avg.</li>
            <li> so it requires more attention if you going to shave with it.</li>
            <li> Top screw would not screw off, so i could not adjust the blade.</li>
            <li> but I like the hero way better.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so light!</li>
            <li> Pros: I love these.</li>
            <li> Out the box, this trimmer may disappoint, but give them some time after adding oil and using it for another 2-3 weeks, it has gotten better.</li>
            <li> okay..</li>
            <li> if wahl addresses the issue and designs a better machanism</li>
            <li> I also love how lightweight they are.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li> More importantly i would like to thank Wahl for providing a zero gap tool because it is hell to do on ones own.</li>
            <li> great product but not yet tested, thanks.</li>
            <li> I think the Wahl Detailer is much better ofr that</li>
            <li> I am a barber and I have many liners, but this one is in my top 3.</li>
            <li> I find myself using these more than my outliners</li>
            <li> and I gotta say its better than my andis t-outliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> work better than wahl peanut.</li>
            <li> It does not nick your skin like most clippers do.</li>
            <li> It works well and the quality is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Detailers still my favorite</li>
            <li> You will love them.</li>
            <li> Opinion the Hero&#x27;s are much better</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> ok ..</li>
            <li> but these are much better and easier to use.</li>
            <li> but I love this product a lot.</li>
            <li> the andis feel like they are better made but the blade on the hero is thinner and the clipper is faster.  </li>
            <li> Much better than any of the battery powered clippers.  </li>
            <li> I have 15 grand children...</li>
            <li> seven boys and three son-in-laws... a son and cut most of their hair....</li>
            <li> SURE</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> For the price I don&#x27;t there is a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am glad that I purchased these trimmers.</li>
            <li> Better than Andis liners period.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> So trust me you won&#x27;t find a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> These clippers are smal light and powerfull, this clippers are nice</li>
            <li> Great clippers fast shipping</li>
            <li> It has a quality feel, all it needs is a mildly skilled wielder to go with it.</li>
            <li> You will be pleased with these trimmers.</li>
            <li> My wahl detailers are much better a tool for barbering.</li>
            <li> but I love</li>
            <li> It cuts much better than my Andis T Outliner and that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li> Best  Deal on the net..</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I selected this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer wahl is simply the best for a reason</li>
            <li> I zero gapped it and it cuts crisp shape ups!!!</li>
            <li> I have an Andis T-outliner which is good, but the Wahl hero just does a better job at crisp lines on one pass.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice clean line and works well on my hairline or beard.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice clean line.</li>
            <li> Happy Happy Happy, no more nappy nappy nappy!!!!!</li>
            <li> These trimmers are just as good as the higher priced Wahl trimmers.</li>
            <li> I loved them the first week I had them.</li>
            <li> Pretty good compared to andis</li>
            <li> This clipper here is pretty good</li>
            <li> I tried them for the first time and man do they have my beard looking good.</li>
            <li> and they worked pretty good...</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and the clippers are nice addition!  </li>
            <li> Works quite fine, very light.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing for such a great quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re excellent for dry shaving.</li>
            <li> easy to use and safe on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clean and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Overall I say Wahl put together a very good clipper that is both quality and cost efficient.</li>
            <li> I will spend the extra money to get a very good one.</li>
            <li> When zeroed correctly the T liners are still more accurate b</li>
            <li> does the job great so far..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud, jet my girlfriend is happy with the product.</li>
            <li> While I prefer the andis t outliner which I also own a tad more, I do appreciate that the blade on these doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li> I love them light weight and gets the job done</li>
            <li> i love the cheap price.</li>
            <li> But most importantly they don&#x27;t lose alignment like the Andis t out liners and they don&#x27;t need oil.</li>
            <li> I am happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> It gets the work done, it cuts very close to the skin, good for non-professional trimming.</li>
            <li> edges out good cuts fast</li>
            <li> Which is good when shaping up a whole head and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The zero gaping tool it comes with is actually useful and a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> nice decent power quick jobs good</li>
            <li> thing has power, Wahl states that it has as much power as the ANDIS MASTER full size clipper!!!</li>
            <li> I am very glad I did, these trimmers are very sharp and very easy to manuever and best of all the do not get super hot like the andis.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are a good clipper to add to your collection, they are great for beards and makes line ups even have a more sharp and crisp look to it!</li>
            <li> Other than that their perfect!</li>
            <li> Other than that I think their the best liners on the marker.</li>
            <li> He loves it and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My advice, take it easy.</li>
            <li> a better clean up job.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to hold in your hands and edge up your hair lines if needed.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use trimmer for outlining and shaping up.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Small and Easy To Travel With&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t matter because it was easy to adjust to zero without it.</li>
            <li> If you have a strong beard or don&#x27;t shave as often</li>
            <li> These liners have been going strong.</li>
            <li> Does not seem strong, but will surprise you when you start using it.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it stays cool, doesn&#x27;t over heat easily.</li>
            <li> I can get through the hair once or twice which is pretty nice for me.</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know why professional barbers the wahls hero because of out the box with no adjustment they cut the best all around the face beard, and back of the neck.</li>
            <li> The wahl detailor is the best wahl trimmer hands down.</li>
            <li> The 5 star trimmer is light, has a nice grip, easy to use and does not get hot.</li>
            <li> It was working perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Honey loves them easy to use light weight</li>
            <li> Still works fine for trimming and lining up though.</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the delivery came so quickly.</li>
            <li> Now, it is much more lip and nose friendly when maintaining a clean line on your beard &amp; stash.</li>
            <li> perfect for around the ear and a tight neck cleaning...</li>
            <li> The clippers are VERY light (almost too light to where I thought they may be cheap) but they cut very crisp and precise.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good trimmer to clean up or what ever it may be, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> They hit nice crisp clean lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is perfect for a beginner or novice, cuts clean without being too sharp and will be sufficient for me until we find a replacement barber in the area!</li>
            <li> a couple days later,firs ttime i turned it on,very power motor,cuts and trims very nice,leaves nice edges and precise lines according to your arm</li>
            <li> Not as I thought they would be and not as accurate as the T-Trimmers</li>
            <li> Overall a great edger with lots of power.</li>
            <li> ** coming out of an ass, it cuts hair so smooth .</li>
            <li> Smooth against the skin and no ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for a few weeks, then stopped working about 5 weeks in after literally using the machine about 8 to 10 times.</li>
            <li> Overall a great trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really cheap material</li>
            <li> its precise..</li>
            <li> but once I break them in, they will be fantastic.</li>
            <li> btw, i had to request for the tool from wahl (it&#x27;s free, just call em and ask for the t-blade tool).</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great personal trimmer</li>
            <li> He said he can&#x27;t believe how nice this trimmer is compared to the much cheaper trimmer he was using before this.</li>
            <li> I give them 5 stars because they deliver accurate and precise points and lines.</li>
            <li> Great while they last</li>
            <li> light Weight</li>
            <li> These are easy to clean and take apart and reassemble; they even include a blade adjustment tool to zero gap.  </li>
            <li> Great clippers, especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Feel cheap</li>
            <li> The Newer trimmer is more powerful</li>
            <li> light weight and does not heat up like andis.</li>
            <li> Wahl Professional WA8991 Hero T Blade Trimmer great for trimming not cutting hear.</li>
            <li> then I oiled them up good, Wow the overheating problem wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> I needed a good trimmer and this does the job as well as any professional trimmer barbers have used on me.</li>
            <li> excellent product for a much cheaper price then your local hair products store.  </li>
            <li> Its lightweight which is a good thing and doesn&#x27;t really get hot that easily.</li>
            <li> They are extremely light and very powerful.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to zero gap if not set right and maintenance it after use.</li>
            <li> Very good sharp crisp lines without hesitation!!</li>
            <li> Haha!!!</li>
            <li> I must say this trimmer is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> They are very powerful trimmers that will leave you line up looking crispy.</li>
            <li> it was described as to be the best when it comes down to shaping up your beard or cut, instead the blade was dough and not cutting.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product, can be very sharp when adjusted and is very light.</li>
            <li> but it works great not too loud crisp clean edging</li>
            <li> but for 30 odd bucks, I&#x27;m more than happy.</li>
            <li> If you want something easy, light weight, and powerful.</li>
            <li> very handy, small for nice trimming ability.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> and it was a nice change from the normal.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m used the the size now and the pack a powerful punch!</li>
            <li> Product is good and there are no major complaints but its quite loud and not as good as I thought it would be based on reviews.  </li>
            <li> I accepted!&lt;br /&gt;The blade is sharp....very clean points.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed the blades tend to rust, and I clean them before or after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So be cautious when giving a clean edge up or lined up the beard.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a trimmer to clean up around the edges after I do my haircut.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to clean up my hair line a maintain my beard.</li>
            <li> I had heard so many positive things &amp; seen so many positive reviews about these trimmers.</li>
            <li> Although they are very sharp,they are also very smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> Is a great, precise, and sharp trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nicely designed with a clean metallic look, reasonably priced, trims a beard like weasel running the bleeding edge off a methadrine high (in a good way).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re light-weight, fit comfortably in your hand and are great for getting around those tight corners and ears.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, keeping in mind that I am not a barber, this feels like a very good quality tool that I can use for maintaining the look between the cuts.</li>
            <li> great clipper just how i expected it to be, got to me within 5 days</li>
            <li> Read the reviews itw good for personal use .</li>
            <li> Very,very light but powerful motor.</li>
            <li> If that isn&#x27;t good enough for you it came with a pro set tool that helps you \\&quot;zero gap\\&quot; the blades.</li>
            <li> Andis Cool Care Plus.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the hero t blade is a good product.  </li>
            <li> these clippers look nice, cut close, but are a bit too loud</li>
            <li> This might be good for someone to use for personal home usebut nothing mre</li>
            <li> The trimmer is light weight &amp; powerful.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but nooooooooo good for facial hair or sideburns.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts so good, I&#x27;m simply speechless.  </li>
            <li> My blades were not lined up when I first opened it but easily adjustable.</li>
            <li> The shave is great and extremely close.  </li>
            <li> If the price difference between these trimmers and the Andis has you second guessing don&#x27;t be fooled by how much cheaper they are because they are a GREAT PAIR OF TRIMMERS and also would be great for traveling vice the Andis due to size.</li>
            <li> really well I am happy with this product but only used it once.</li>
            <li> Trims super close and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> and then just do a quick pass with a razor.</li>
            <li> They are also super lite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with the Wahl super close shaver to help reduce and/or eliminate ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl Hero is definitely smaller than most top of the liner trimmers but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the andis cordless trimmers as well, there like 40$ and work better than hero&#x27;s</li>
            <li> You might wanna try the trimmers right out the box and see if they cut good enough already.</li>
            <li> There are many options to choose in trimmers, but this little Hero has become my Big Hero and it performs flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> does the trick, very sharp , may need to adjust for kids, but it works great</li>
            <li> I have to say I like these Whal Hero trimmers for shaving more than the Andis T-Outliner even after I put the new blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new trimmers.</li>
            <li> All in all these are pretty good trimmers, the power is definately there, and the size is a plus, but I think the cord may be abit short..</li>
            <li> Im not a professional but adjusting the buzzer to make it sharper is a pain , Im sure this goes for many buzzers aswell</li>
            <li> It cuts very well and is easy to control.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for &amp; some!</li>
            <li> i feel like calling wahl and saying this is why andis and oster gets talked about in a higher regaurd they make metal pieces!</li>
            <li> Small in compact to easily fit in hand;yet very powerful!!!</li>
            <li> It gave a crisp line right out the box!</li>
            <li> Very neat and precise edge up.</li>
            <li> My old peanuts worked better than these..</li>
            <li> The Heros do have a powerful motor however, I still prefer the andis T liners.</li>
            <li> Also, I tried lining myself up w/ success</li>
            <li> Thank you Wahl for standing behind your product, as these are still one of the best trimmers on the Market!!!</li>
            <li> No customer would enjoy this loud of sound in ear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My old trimmer was an &#x27;okay&#x27; battery powered rechargable.  </li>
            <li> So far these are my favorite trimmers.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are powerful, use these trimmers for home use.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are well worth the buck.</li>
            <li> Lightweight but powerful</li>
            <li> I use this more for children and people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful and cuts clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just make sure you press lightly and only cut at the correct angle</li>
            <li> You have to take off the outer case so its ideal for cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> Fits my smaller hand nicely.</li>
            <li> As powerful as the reviews make these out to be seemed elusive to me.</li>
            <li> This thing is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Initially purchased one pair to do clients hair as well as my own, and I loved the Hero so much that I bought two additional pairs for future backups and just in case I could not find them again.  </li>
            <li> Love them they are sharp and way better than the Andis style liners I used to use.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the larger T-Outline blades for these trimmers and have set them but not used them as of yet because I am pleased with the original blades at the moment.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the Oster Fast Feed from Amazon and these are a great compliment to each other.</li>
            <li> i think this trimmer could be a really good match for any other one on the markey</li>
            <li> They will become razor sharp but the blades don&#x27;t bite (cut your skin) which is good.</li>
            <li> but hey, everyone has to try it for themselves, right??</li>
            <li> and they turned right up</li>
            <li> They get very close and are great for cleaning up the neckline, I&#x27;ve even used them to trim down to zero on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this little trimmer has more power than you would expect and is very precise.</li>
            <li> they are powerful and they dont get hot like the andis outliners do.</li>
            <li> i still prefer my Andis T-Outliners but when using the Andis for several clients in a row, the blade can become super hot!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also good for trimming down my beard before I go over it with my 5-Star Shaper Shaver.</li>
            <li> 3 little guides are nice and fit snug so they won&#x27;t fall of but not as versatile for beard trimming since spacing</li>
            <li> I also like how it comes with a maintenance clip so you can easily adjust the head back to the original setting if it were to fall out of alignment</li>
            <li> Another fantastic product from the\\&quot;NEW and IMPROVED WAHL CLIPPERS and TRIMMERS\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Now this trimmer does have a strong loud motor.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to send somebody used clippers it would be a nice idea to sanitize and try to clean the previous hairs.</li>
            <li> Works better on ethnic hair than straight Caucasian hair in my professional opinion.  </li>
            <li> Overall they are great to be so small and cute</li>
            <li> good for lining up, however I wish it was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit louder than I had hoped for but it is so much higher in quality than the crappy plastic norelco beard trimmer units.  </li>
            <li> I may need to get to T blade instead of the regular blade to be able to line the front of my head up.</li>
            <li> Exactly what anyone needs to line up your bread or your hairline.</li>
            <li> Quality of the product seems first rate.</li>
            <li> I had to adjust the blades at first, but after adjusting this trimmer has been working like a charm.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer seemed just okay enough not to send back,until the screw that keeps the metal plate held in place came off.  </li>
            <li> cause the motor stopped on the first set after two years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it performs consistently.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely put this as one the top 3 trimmers ever.</li>
            <li> Make sure you adjust properly or</li>
            <li> After a while the blades get too hot and burn the skin when edging a hair cut</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> When you first pick it up you think this is some bullsh!t</li>
            <li> this is my favorite tiny trimmer...better than peanut..</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a lot better than the personal one that Wahl makes.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY YOU WILL GET, INSTEAD OF GIVING TRICKY DESCRIPTIONS AND PICTURES</li>
            <li> Cuts pretty well&lt;</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these to professionals and anyone looking for a dependable, light, and cool operating trimmer.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot at all.  </li>
            <li> This clipper can be better than a razor if you properly zero gap the blade.</li>
            <li> Very close, super fast motor.</li>
            <li> These are much more suitable for smaller children and they cut pretty sharp right out of the package, no adjustment needed.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, easy to handle, and gives a sharp line.  </li>
            <li> I took them apart and clean them completely</li>
            <li> Cut with utter easy straight out the box!  </li>
            <li> This trimmer does a very good job of cutting straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> Trimmer runs fast &amp; does not get hot.</li>
            <li> trimms chest hear, sides, its good all over but small jobs.</li>
            <li> The attachments/guards are nice to fade in side burns or even knock down your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There extremely sharp out the box clean cut light and doesnt really run hot.. must have and there inexpensive</li>
            <li> These trimmers (combined with the Wahl Double Wide T-Blade) are amazing!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is small but gives a close shave,  it gets the job done and is very compact,  it is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> I left them on for 15min straight and barely got warm.</li>
            <li> Nice liner..smaller, so easier too get into tight places like mustaches.</li>
            <li> Cuts nice and tight.</li>
            <li> They do a fine job cleaning up around my ears and the back of my neck, etc.</li>
            <li> Its sharp, fast, strong, and when you set it up with zero-gap, it will cut skin!</li>
            <li> Good clippers just a little loud but.</li>
            <li> They cuty very sharp and they are super easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> overall,it may not look powerful,but as others have said,its very power,it gets the job done...</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t that much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Once u adjust them they are the real deal.</li>
            <li> work very well</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> The hump in the front is very distracting when doing a line up.</li>
            <li> Very Lightweight and work very well.</li>
            <li> He loves these trimmers and it worked really well  for him trimmer his gold-T.</li>
            <li> but can we really believe them??</li>
            <li> anyways, i really dig the rotary motor...</li>
            <li> but no so much for a stylist</li>
            <li> You dont need to adjust them much.</li>
            <li> I use the &amp;#34;Hero T Blade trimmer&amp;#34; for the straight line cuts.</li>
            <li> As a reviewer stated &amp;#34;It is very loud&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Blade didn&#x27;t need much adjusting.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer so much that I put my Andis T-Edjer up.</li>
            <li> I still need to pre trim with electric hair cutter because my beard is very course</li>
            <li> Competes very well with Andis</li>
            <li> They cut very close</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist I can guarantee you&#x27;ll really like these trimmers.  </li>
            <li> they cut very close.  </li>
            <li> Very lite on the hand ...</li>
            <li> thanks....</li>
            <li> makes my work much easier</li>
            <li> Andis and oater need to really step it up.</li>
            <li> It gets really close shave</li>
            <li> Recieved my package in a very timely manner which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Really precise, lightweight and pleasent to use, only downside: it doesnt come with a blade guard</li>
            <li> The trimmer fits nicely and firm in your hand while you are using it.  </li>
            <li> i used to just use my body trimmers to shape myself up but got tired of not being able to get into the edges of my line good enough.</li>
            <li> I messed up my first one and had to purchase a new one after owning it for five years.</li>
            <li> but they are all true, these joints hit, and I mean hard, after almost 20 years using the andis styliners I took a chance with these, and it was a good move, they are very light to a point that u would think there toys</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and pretty small.</li>
            <li> other than that they&#x27;re my favorite</li>
            <li> I love how sharp my shape ups look when I use this trimmer.</li>
            <li> If they are able to cut my son&#x27;s hair razor sharp.</li>
            <li> its sharp but leaves many marks.</li>
            <li> These clippers provides crisp sharp linings and they stay cool for after 30 minutes, I really did feel it get hot until about 45 mins.</li>
            <li> Great price, small, give the quiet of the motor a 3/5</li>
            <li> If you adjust the blade right, you&#x27;ll get zero nicks and can buzz your head down pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys the look of a razor sharp line-up.</li>
            <li> had to get the blade adjusted, crisp lining and gets the job done, this is my spare liners, not everyday use</li>
            <li> Its small and its nice for shaping up clients.</li>
            <li> I only used it a hand full of time and it started pulling my hair instead of trimming.</li>
            <li> Pretty loud buzzing while in use.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> These are one of my favorite trimmers hands down.</li>
            <li> excellent trimmer be careful they are sharp and will cut you if you don&#x27;t adjust the blades correctly, powerful little trimmer!</li>
            <li> Better than previously purchased Oster Finish Line Salon Textured System trimmers.</li>
            <li> Mainly using this machine when it comes to beards.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a decent pair of trimmers for quite some time until I purchased these.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly, and I actually got a random compliment from a guy at a party.  </li>
            <li> Absolute complete garbage!</li>
            <li> Very Loud motor!  </li>
            <li> Go slow and make sure you have it lined up right.</li>
            <li> Motor is not strong enough for a really good lining.</li>
            <li> strong powerful little machine, Very light weight, goes thru thick beards pretty easily, may cut skin at times very sharp, Im a barber for 11 years plus</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to the at home</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim too quickly but does the job for the most part with a few passes in the same area.  </li>
            <li> If your in a busy shop with a large client list these are a must have.</li>
            <li> Very easy to get into small areas of the face.</li>
            <li> I should have invested a little bit more money for some nicer ones.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> they are sharp and easy to zero with the tool provided.</li>
            <li> Not as strong or sharp as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong,they are very sharp but SMOOTH.Well to say the least,WAHL thanks again for another fine product.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old son has hair that grows really fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping also original packaging came with 4 other items in one box.</li>
            <li> When I first got these I did a simple shape up on myself, Wow they hit pretty close compare to a close shave after a day.</li>
            <li> I always use Andis Cool Care Plus or Whals spray for clippers that I had already before every use and it keeps them cutting good.  </li>
            <li> Powerful, quiet and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of little trimmers that died quickly, this one feels substantial and powerful.</li>
            <li> Clipper and they are sharp enough that once is good enough tap and go.</li>
            <li> my only concern is the blade is the blade isn&#x27;t set right.</li>
            <li> They are nice and small, reasonably quiet and cut very well.  </li>
            <li> It is SHARP and precise.  </li>
            <li> ALSO HAS A NEW BLADE OUT.</li>
            <li> I trully think whal does this on purpose so you can keep buying new ones.</li>
            <li> Since I had to order new blades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to my area, and have yet to find a barber who can tackle our job...</li>
            <li> I noticed that his new barber uses these</li>
            <li> I gave it to my barber/stylist while it was still new</li>
            <li> Again, nothing wrong with it, nice solid feel, sharp blades, looks good.</li>
            <li> out&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;These are VERY LOUD trimmers.</li>
            <li> Very very loud.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by this clipper.</li>
            <li> Would love a v5000 or v9000 motor in a small trimmer balding clipper.  </li>
            <li> and I feel that the hook loop/hole is too small for most hooks</li>
            <li> Very nice little trimmer, smaller than expected and louder than anticipated when compared to its size.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as my Wahl T-Blade, but this is MUCH better on my sensitive areas, like the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> Was not sharp out of the box.had to adjust several times to get right</li>
            <li> I used other Trimmers before such as ANDIS styliner M3 and the T outliner, The M3 vibrates way to much and gets hot way to quick and really heavy, The T_Outliner vibrates to much and gets hot after 5</li>
            <li> They are strong and powerful and with a simple You Tube search on how to zero these bad boys out, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it makes loud noise.</li>
            <li> but so far I zero gap them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned just about every pair of professional trimmers and/or clippers on the market.  </li>
            <li> Way too loud to use on my clients.</li>
            <li> They are a bit loud but who cares</li>
            <li> but these were gentle enough to use on all ages without nicking skin.</li>
            <li> This is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i do not cut professionally</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 16 year old barber</li>
            <li> It is loud if you have a guide attached.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that it may break very easliy, if it falls.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had to get the blades professionally sharpened before using, but this is not the case with the Wahl 5 star trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a professional product and it&#x27;s made to endure.  </li>
            <li> Not recommend for professional use because of this.</li>
            <li> I used to be a professional hair dresser</li>
            <li> Weaker motor than Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer</li>
            <li> A must for all barbers whether at home or professional</li>
            <li> but they are far from it</li>
            <li> and I was initially taking back by how powerful they were.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a licensed professional do not waste your money on these they can barely cut a neckline!!!</li>
            <li> Also, since it&#x27;s so small, it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Small but has a strong motor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to through andis under the bus, these clipper are better because their is a lower chance of me cutting my clients and they don&#x27;t get hot as fast</li>
            <li> Trimmer is powerful &amp; sharp.</li>
            <li> Nice crisp lines with little pressure, very small and compact.</li>
            <li> and it hits pretty hard when u set it right</li>
            <li> i often went back to my other trimmer to clean up what the wahl hero could not get.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy these trimmers, they are small &amp; also durable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light, and small.</li>
            <li> Small and light</li>
            <li> is minimal (0.5&amp;#34;, 1&amp;#34;, 1.5&amp;#34;), I imagine value would come in for fades.</li>
            <li> My first experience with t-blade trimmers was with my brother&#x27;s Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer, which works extremely well</li>
            <li> Extremely precise, clean cutting action.</li>
            <li> (Although I&#x27;m only an amateur! :-) )</li>
            <li> They are not sharp out the box, but if you zero gap the blade</li>
            <li> It does not get hot nor does it cut my skin like other clippers out there.</li>
            <li> Powerful little trimmer.</li>
            <li> These are quiet, just the right size and not too sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Think i&#x27;ll be staying away from Wahl products in general.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive a used product directly from Amazon</li>
            <li> I barely noticed it was there.</li>
            <li> On the downside it is slightly noisy, but overall it is a great investment to take any barber&#x27;s game to the next level.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and forth between the detailer (which sounded less than powerful, closer to a peanut) and the Andis detailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clippers are still cutting good, however, you must remember to oil them at least once every 2 months and keep the blade clean of hair after each trimming.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the blades are sharp and cut very close.  </li>
            <li> They are a little bigger but are well worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to be cheaply built.</li>
            <li> the power and the blade sharpness and design the only thing wierd is that the head of the blade is angled really far back</li>
            <li> I admit, out of the box it was not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Will certainly have to consider other models/brands before buying this trimmer again!</li>
            <li> and it is hard to clean properly.</li>
            <li> 2 things I disliked, first the body of it is too fat when your shaping up somebody or even your self</li>
            <li> Small in size but has a powerful punch</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to break down and learn how to use a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The high blade speed of these trimmers set them apart from other rotary motors.  </li>
            <li> The power of this little trimmer is amazing doesn&#x27;t heat up has a rotary motor can also put the t wide blade for extra closeness and for 30.00 how could you not love</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that these do get hot which can make a cut with someone who is sensitive.</li>
            <li> Besides being a bit weak, the clipper does give you a precise shave when used properly.</li>
            <li> They are Small and light weight and have really sharp blades and comes with a zero gaping tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Oster fast feed cutters and this little wahl trimmer for the finishing touches...</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that its not ideal for cuttting your own hair due to the bulkiness of the front of the case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud, but not too loud.</li>
            <li> Now that we have the good out of the way here comes the bad.</li>
            <li> Meaning I would use this only for personal care and not as professional tool to work on other people.</li>
            <li> So if you sweat the way I do, wipe it down with a dry cloth really well.</li>
            <li> it last for long time.</li>
            <li> and idk how long this clipper is going to last</li>
            <li> but trist me they wont last long.</li>
            <li> I hope they last as long as Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll see how long they last but for $35 you can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, they will last long term.</li>
            <li> I am a single mom of an Afro American boy with severe autism.</li>
            <li> Be very careful because it&#x27;s powerful and if you press too hard, you can cut the guy&#x27;s head up.</li>
            <li> Works well, sounds very quiet, very lightweight and very small.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a little loud</li>
            <li> This trimmer hits hard real pro-gear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll normally use this if I got lazy and didn&#x27;t want to shave my head for a week or so.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Super Long Cord.</li>
            <li> Cleaning up someone neck doesn&#x27;t take as long.</li>
            <li> They appear to be professional level quality and have a heavy duty cord,  </li>
            <li> but that ain&#x27;t nothin, long story</li>
            <li> Doesnt mean much of anything but that first impression was not good.  </li>
            <li> And it can be used for dry shaving.</li>
            <li> Blade alignment tool is indispensable for non-pro like me though it feels like it could break on a few thin points if not used with care.</li>
            <li> but my concerns were that it was used and not new as they claim it smelt like oil burned hair</li>
            <li> Rather loud for a small clipper</li>
            <li> Loud but small.</li>
            <li> if you purchase these liners you have to adjust them often because the screws will come loose and make the liner blades over lap which will cut you.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to knock my facial hair down to a &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> But after I pretty much zero gapped it, I was shocked.</li>
            <li> (at my cost due to being fulfilled by someone other than amazon) and had ordered the &amp;#34;Wide T-blade&amp;#34; for accessory to this device, and will not need it now, so again I will eat the cost of sending this back too.  </li>
            <li> I continue to buy the trimmer knowing it will only give me half a years life.</li>
            <li> but I saw the same set at Walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li> This clipper is equipped with an adjustable 5 Star blade so that you can set it for precise cutting.</li>
            <li> but i have been cutting my own hair for at least 8 years and cut hair in the army as well (volunTOLD situation).</li>
            <li> , then 20 seconds later there was \\&quot;Smoke\\&quot; and nothing, I officially declared them dead.</li>
            <li> Careful on the neck though, they can do some damage if you don&#x27;t know for to handle them.</li>
            <li> I have not tried to cut my head hair with it, and that&#x27;s not really what it&#x27;s intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> your having trouble with the bum from the gray plastic covering unscrew the 2 screw in the back of the clippers and take off the gray cover</li>
            <li> YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN T BLADE AND THE T WIDE BLADE BEFORE PURCHASING.....</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s not really a hassle.</li>
            <li> but they hit harder than any liners I know of.</li>
            <li> And do yourself a favor and cop the t wide blade</li>
            <li> I am not much for words..</li>
            <li> I am not much for words.</li>
            <li> I use it a few mins everyday and so far I have not had any problems</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer almost everyday for the past 7 months and is still working like new.  </li>
            <li> They are very small, smaller than your regular clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li> would advise that you be careful the trimmer blade can be a bit sharp.</li>
            <li> Weren&#x27;t sharp at all...</li>
            <li> Actually quite pointless clippers ...</li>
            <li> I think I should&#x27;ve listened to everyone else that reviewed these trimmer&#x27;s when they said they we&#x27;re sharp, I just got them today, and immediately added them into my line-up, after about 2 cuts w/ them</li>
            <li> Wahl does not make any other combs for it, either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not too sharp and doesn&#x27;t cut too close.</li>
            <li> overall, i am not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp is</li>
            <li> Cannot be compared to any other trimmer in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Sharp but not to sharp.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve heard from other barbers aswell that theirs broke in about 3 months.</li>
            <li> it IS sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought this item twice because my brother took the other pair when he used them</li>
            <li> However, it is a sharp blade.  </li>
            <li> If you drop them then that may be it due to the body being plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Sharp.</li>
            <li> Without a guide attached it is no louder than my other clippers.</li>
            <li> novice barber photo shows my first ever attempt at a lineup so not perfect</li>
            <li> Just got my trimmers the other day</li>
            <li> does not overheat like other edgers out there.</li>
            <li> these babies are sharp and you will cut someone</li>
            <li> These were my go to liners when i wanted to leave a sharp line.</li>
            <li> It dogs a little through longer hair but is expected I guess.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything negative about the product, but in hindsight I may have sought after a different edger.</li>
            <li> Not worth $1.</li>
            <li> I looked on youtube and saw from different barbers that this is common for these clippers.</li>
            <li> It gets me down to a stubble that would be the equivalent of 24hrs after a shave with my safety razor.</li>
            <li> but i have to give it a thumbs down</li>
            <li> Rusted after a few months and became brutally sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very Sharp and no adjustments were needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since retired my previous Andis trimmers!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previously an owner of Andis and switched over to Wahl...</li>
            <li> I wish it came with some pouch for accessories and that there is 1/2 gear for less vibes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It broke in less then a week.</li>
            <li> It dropped from a height of less than 4 inches and broke.</li>
            <li> Haircuts for us are typically a nightmare if we don&#x27;t have a patient barber.</li>
            <li> So for half the price of the andis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for over 15 years and this is the first time that I can say that Wahl has hit the nail on the head with a product.</li>
            <li> I tried adjusting them several times but still no good.</li>
            <li> the wahl hero (with the t-wide blade and zero gapped) did not clean up my edge up as well as i thought it should.</li>
            <li> It does cut an lines the hair , but I must say U diffentely have to have a touch and must practice using this little Hero.. peace</li>
            <li> i cut my son&#x27;s hair and the usual T-edge liners were to sharp for him and he&#x27;d cry.  </li>
            <li> They have a little bite</li>
            <li> Makes me excited about cutting again!</li>
            <li> They are a little noisey but its no bother to me.</li>
            <li> These little trimmer packs a punch.  </li>
            <li> They received 4 stars from me because they are a little louder than the Wahl detailers.</li>
            <li> I expected the Wahl to be small but not at small.</li>
            <li> &amp; I been cutting hair for 25 years+ THANKs</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Ive used quit few trimers.different brands,i wasnt satified with them,I came across this one,looking for a quality trimmer for the fraction of the price,so after reading the the postive reviews,ive pulled the trigger and bought,got it</li>
            <li> I noticed a few clients complaining about the \\&quot;Bite\\&quot; of the trimmers...</li>
            <li> but I disliked this.</li>
            <li> someone mentioned, after a few weeks of use (cleaning and oiling)</li>
            <li> These trimmers are beasty, heavy hitters no lies.</li>
            <li> If your heavy user, you might want to purchase 2 because they will die after a while.</li>
            <li> (while oiling it every few days of course)</li>
            <li> One barber in my shop bought a pair and his broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying they are small and feel like a little toy.</li>
            <li> i was just cutting with it its not even a week old and the black poped out and a piece went fflying.</li>
            <li> We needed a new trimmer for cutting side burns, trimming around the ears and neckline.</li>
            <li> Very tight did not have to adjust to them</li>
            <li> its small compared to andis but dont let that fool you,its very powerfuland strong cutting  ill give it 5stars!!!</li>
            <li> Surprised that I dont see any other reviews that suggest that the motor in these things are bad.</li>
            <li> but it gets stuck a lot on thick hair and its a little noisey..</li>
            <li> They are small which helps you maneuver the.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are known for their short life expectancy.</li>
            <li> i usually dont buy wahl products but had to try this one..</li>
            <li> after my experience with this trimmer and the andis superliner, i was not pleased.</li>
            <li> Wahl fixes is the fact that tjet trimmer itself breaksdown after no more than 6 months for various reasons,  housing cracks, switch fails, motor dies.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size fool you</li>
            <li> This is a small but verry powerfull trimmer.</li>
            <li> The clipper is small but creates an impact on the outlining process.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to be so small.</li>
            <li> A professional clipper for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I have been cutting for over 25 years.</li>
            <li> Do not let the small size fool you</li>
            <li> its small and compact yes,</li>
            <li> Didnt know they were going to be that small and compact</li>
            <li> Small doesn&#x27;t get as close as I need</li>
            <li> i threw my wahl hero in the garbage because i became so frustrated after i spent a long time adjusting it.</li>
            <li> They do the job with hard to reach edges while lining up like using a pencil.</li>
            <li> I tried to keep using but then it became dull.</li>
            <li> this blade is hard to zero gap even w/ the tool.</li>
            <li> Hard to cut the hair close to the face.</li>
            <li> however you like and they hit really hard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press too hard though because they will leave a mark.</li>
            <li> Hard to achieve the 2 day beard look, but not at all disapointed for the price, i do recommend this</li>
            <li> negative it</li>
            <li> and I would have to go over the neck at least 4 to 6 times.</li>
            <li> I take him to the barber at least once a week.</li>
            <li> cutting the facial hair and using it for edge ups.&lt;br /&gt;Close cuts without the bite.</li>
            <li> The next time I used these clippers I noticed the cutting blade was shifting without it being powered.</li>
            <li> Be careful with that because these bad boys are sharp!</li>
            <li> those guys are putting a serious markup on this product.</li>
            <li> You seriously cannot hear anything else but the trimmers when they are on.</li>
            <li> im beafing up my arsenal because ive been getting serious with barbering</li>
            <li> : The Only bad things I have to say about these trimmers is that they seem to heat up after about 10 Minutes of usage.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want to make the blades overly sharp and end up cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It scrapes the first couple of times but once you get it broken in, its a beast!!!!!</li>
            <li> Weak, no power.</li>
            <li> my scalf- over heats).I wonder what to buy next. :(</li>
            <li> and ive always used the andis T liner so this was tough to get used to</li>
            <li> No more andis trimmers for me!!  </li>
            <li> The Wahl Hero packs a mean punch!</li>
            <li> Put a little oil on it and started cutting.</li>
            <li> I ended up making them dull and unable to cut.  </li>
            <li> My 5 star Heroes are one of my secret weapons.</li>
            <li> Upon closer inspection, I realized that the metal tube that holds the screw was broken and had been installed on a slant.  </li>
            <li> If your a do it your self barber just cutting a  few heads here</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not as sharp, it doesn&#x27;t irritate as badly.</li>
            <li> Not a very good product to begin with, broken and badly constructed makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair since the late 80&#x27;s I could&#x27;ve taught me nephew how to do</li>
            <li> the worst part is that even with the slightest pressure, it still made my skin turn red for a day.</li>
            <li> This made for awkward positioning and would result in hand fatigue, or worse yet, getting cut by this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> For 30 something bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> that because of the way it&#x27;s shaped it is difficult to see the blade when your detailing.</li>
            <li> ill see what my fam say</li>
            <li> In my experience they failed to meet up to the hype.</li>
            <li> but when I got the replacement my grandfathers barber said it was defective, something was wrong with the blade.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the trimmer though.</li>
            <li> I mean REALLY bad rusting.</li>
            <li> The infamous \\&quot;bump\\&quot; on the body of the trimmer did not affect the cutting ability at all.</li>
            <li> I am very frustrated with this product, its no better than Andis(burned</li>
            <li> He is into hair cutting, shape outs and stuff like that.</li>
            <li> but i have to hold them at an awkward angle for the closest shave.</li>
            <li> but i am an enthusiast when it comes to cutting hair</li>
            <li> I the trimmer body is awkward, but I have no issues with it at all.  </li>
            <li> So, I can say this trimmer has enhanced my cutting skills.</li>
            <li> but when you start cutting.....</li>
            <li> , i didnt even have this for a month before it started cutting people.</li>
            <li> There is no going wrong with these, all you do is adjust the blade with the instructions and you have clear,accurate trimming!</li>
            <li> so disgusted at how poor the quality is</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed with this purchase....</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really really disappointed!</li>
            <li> this berly even cuts very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Terrible ,  period ,  can&#x27;t do a line up with  </li>
            <li> Worst amazon order ever.</li>
            <li> Really terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice &amp; cuts close! Great value my hubby loves them! Great price.</li>
            <li> Very tight did not have to adjust to them they came set</li>
            <li> Wahl Professional WA8991 Hero T Blade Trimmer great for trimming not cutting hear. works great it last for long time. trimms chest hear, sides, its good all over but small jobs.</li>
            <li> It works good, it feels cheap :) and sometimes it makes loud noise. The noise is not constant, it varies even though this product has only one speed. It gets the work done, it cuts very close to the skin, good for non-professional trimming. Meaning I would use this only for personal care and not as professional tool to work on other people.</li>
            <li> The Clippers are everything I accepted!&lt;br /&gt;The blade is sharp....very clean points.</li>
            <li> The best trimmers on the market. They are small which helps you maneuver the. Clipper and they are sharp enough that once is good enough tap and go.</li>
            <li> Weren&#x27;t sharp at all... Actually quite pointless clippers ... My old peanuts worked better than these.. I was highly disappointed with this purchase.... Waste of money</li>
            <li> Ive used quit few trimers.different brands,i wasnt satified with them,I came across this one,looking for a quality trimmer for the fraction of the price,so after reading the the postive reviews,ive pulled the trigger and bought,got it a couple days later,firs ttime i turned it on,very power motor,cuts and trims very nice,leaves nice edges and precise lines according to your arm lol...overall,it may not look powerful,but as others have said,its very power,it gets the job done...def would recommend this..</li>
            <li> Nice crisp lines with little pressure, very small and compact. I have big hands and it isn&#x27;t that much of a problem. Overall a great edger with lots of power.</li>
            <li> These are awesome trimmesr! They do the job with hard to reach edges while lining up like using a pencil. I would love to give them a 5 star rating. But, I&#x27;ve had to purchase them after 60 to 90 days. Unfortunately, they are known for their short life expectancy.</li>
            <li> I must say this trimmer is very powerful.  One of the best on the market may be more powerful than the wahl detailer.  And I might add its about 15 dollars cheaper buying it online than at your local beauty store those guys are putting a serious markup on this product.</li>
            <li> Once u adjust them they are the real deal.</li>
            <li> On time and in tact. The Heros do have a powerful motor however, I still prefer the andis T liners. When zeroed correctly the T liners are still more accurate b</li>
            <li> Best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have an Andis T-outliner which is good, but the Wahl hero just does a better job at crisp lines on one pass.  I zero gapped mine for an even closer trim and they&#x27;re excellent for dry shaving.</li>
            <li> these trimmers have a place in the middle that pinches and scratches my clients. i should have sent them back but i thought mabe the blades were on crooked but i had them taken off two times and put back on and they still pinch and scratch. had to run to sallys and get some peanuts.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to knock my facial hair down to a &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a bit louder than I had hoped for but it is so much higher in quality than the crappy plastic norelco beard trimmer units.  The attachments/guards are nice to fade in side burns or even knock down your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love my purchase!</li>
            <li> It does cut an lines the hair , but I must say U diffentely have to have a touch and must practice using this little Hero.. peace</li>
            <li> Besides being a bit weak, the clipper does give you a precise shave when used properly. Its lightweight which is a good thing and doesn&#x27;t really get hot that easily. I loved it.</li>
            <li> Trimmer so good I had to buy 2</li>
            <li> Got this for a birthday present &amp; my hubby loved it!! He is into hair cutting, shape outs and stuff like that.</li>
            <li> work very well but i have to hold them at an awkward angle for the closest shave. other than that they&#x27;re my favorite</li>
            <li> Brought this for the bf. He loves it and easy to use.</li>
            <li> great trimmers this trimmer works great. edges out good cuts fast does the job great so far..</li>
            <li> Nice liner..smaller, so easier too get into tight places like mustaches. I recommend gapping for sharper lines. I would buy again</li>
            <li> Works really well really well I am happy with this product but only used it once. Only time will tell</li>
            <li> Today I got The WAHL HERO for personal use and to use on family and friends...This thing is the perfect size and has alot of power(Does not Vibrate to much). I zero gapped it and it cuts crisp shape ups!!! I used other Trimmers before such as ANDIS styliner M3 and the T outliner, The M3 vibrates way to much and gets hot way to quick and really heavy, The T_Outliner vibrates to much and gets hot after 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison the WAHL HERO cuts a more sharper line than both the ANDIS i used before, but without the bulkiness and heat. Which is good when shaping up a whole head and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing has power, Wahl states that it has as much power as the ANDIS MASTER full size clipper!!! BEAST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS ALSO HAS A NEW BLADE OUT. The T-Wide blade which is wider than the standard blade. I will get this so i can cut a faster shape up.</li>
            <li> I gave it this rating because the hair always sticks inside and it is hard to clean properly. It worked well in the beginning but didnt last. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud, jet my girlfriend is happy with the product. Just make sure you oil it before a any use</li>
            <li> the motor on this machine is killer!!&lt;br /&gt;I would consider it to all barbers!&lt;br /&gt;I chose this rating because it is the best detailer out there!&lt;br /&gt;It scrapes the first couple of times but once you get it broken in, its a beast!!!!!</li>
            <li> this trimmer is a very good one ,,cuts very sharp,clean lines.. i usually dont buy wahl products but had to try this one..its small compared to andis but dont let that fool you,its very powerfuland strong cutting  ill give it 5stars!!!</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars , only because I just got them an only used them a couple times but I can see I made a good choose by buying these trimmer an I&#x27;m putting them with team an put them to the test an once I see how they hold up , I&#x27;ll come back an tell you what&#x27;s really good but so far I zero gap them an them work great</li>
            <li> To be honest, this thing worked like a smooth s*** coming out of an ass, it cuts hair so smooth .</li>
            <li> Great blade. Trims super close and well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a cautionary tale. Mine rusted up within two uses. I mean REALLY bad rusting. I determined it was from my sweat. So if you sweat the way I do, wipe it down with a dry cloth really well. Keep it well oiled for longevity!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever owned. I will not be buying anymore Andis trimmers ever. These cut right out of the box, great buy!!!</li>
            <li> I think I should&#x27;ve listened to everyone else that reviewed these trimmer&#x27;s when they said they we&#x27;re sharp, I just got them today, and immediately added them into my line-up, after about 2 cuts w/ them I noticed a few clients complaining about the \\&quot;Bite\\&quot; of the trimmers... That&#x27;s my fault, I felt the need to use the pro-set tool right after unboxing the trimmer!!! Also, I tried lining myself up w/ success I might add but the angle of the blade kind of hinders you abit but I&#x27;m sure I might have read that in a review somewhere but hey, everyone has to try it for themselves, right?? All in all these are pretty good trimmers, the power is definately there, and the size is a plus, but I think the cord may be abit short.. I love em&#x27;. I&#x27;ve since retired my previous Andis trimmers!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE MARCH 2013** -2 Months after purchasing these clipper&#x27;s I was overseas and I plugged them into a 120v/220v Adapter and they turned right up, then 20 seconds later there was \\&quot;Smoke\\&quot; and nothing, I officially declared them dead. I then sent them into the Wahl Repair Facility in Sterling, IL and a week later I was back in Business. Thank you Wahl for standing behind your product, as these are still one of the best trimmers on the Market!!!</li>
            <li> strong powerful little machine, Very light weight, goes thru thick beards pretty easily, may cut skin at times very sharp, Im a barber for 11 years plus and ive always used the andis T liner so this was tough to get used to but now i just use both. Mainly using this machine when it comes to beards. Im between 3 and 4 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut hair for over 20 years. I&#x27;ve owned just about every pair of professional trimmers and/or clippers on the market.  The high blade speed of these trimmers set them apart from other rotary motors.  Great for detail work.  These, as well as the andis t outliners are the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Product works great but my concerns were that it was used and not new as they claim it smelt like oil burned hair so l knew then that it was used but it works great not too loud crisp clean edging will I purchase from this seller again probably not!</li>
            <li> It would be nice if I had a choice of combs for it.  The ones it comes with are too short and it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; size.  Wahl does not make any other combs for it, either.</li>
            <li> Is a great, precise, and sharp trimmer. I may need to get to T blade instead of the regular blade to be able to line the front of my head up. That&#x27;s my only gripe.</li>
            <li> Exactly what anyone needs to line up your bread or your hairline. Just make sure to zero gap if not set right and maintenance it after use.</li>
            <li> Previously an owner of Andis and switched over to Wahl...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too sharp and doesn&#x27;t cut too close. Smooth against the skin and no ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> My 5 star Heroes are one of my secret weapons. I really only use them for two things: edging up my cuts and trimming my beard. They are strong and powerful and with a simple You Tube search on how to zero these bad boys out, you&#x27;ll be glad you did. Careful on the neck though, they can do some damage if you don&#x27;t know for to handle them. My advice, take it easy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping also original packaging came with 4 other items in one box. No complaints</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product, can be very sharp when adjusted and is very light. 2 things I disliked, first the body of it is too fat when your shaping up somebody or even your self the body of the buzzer would lean on the skin making you think that its buzzing but in reality no it was just the bulky body of the buzzer leaning against the skin. Number 2, Im not a professional but adjusting the buzzer to make it sharper is a pain , Im sure this goes for many buzzers aswell but I disliked this.</li>
            <li> When I got it I was like this is a toy ! But once I out it on it was amazing and I now don&#x27;t spend any money on the barber I&#x27;m my own barber :)</li>
            <li> Very nice little trimmer, smaller than expected and louder than anticipated when compared to its size. 3 little guides are nice and fit snug so they won&#x27;t fall of but not as versatile for beard trimming since spacing is minimal (0.5&amp;#34;, 1&amp;#34;, 1.5&amp;#34;), I imagine value would come in for fades. Blade alignment tool is indispensable for non-pro like me though it feels like it could break on a few thin points if not used with care. I wish it came with some pouch for accessories and that there is 1/2 gear for less vibes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are so close that you can shave you face with it and then just do a quick pass with a razor. Because it doesn&#x27;t have the mesh cover it is more aggressive than avg. beard shaver so it requires more attention if you going to shave with it. If you have a strong beard or don&#x27;t shave as often then it is also great for &#x27;quick pass&#x27; before you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone mentioned, after a few weeks of use (cleaning and oiling) the blades have settled in and don&#x27;t nick the skin. Now, it is much more lip and nose friendly when maintaining a clean line on your beard &amp; stash. With some practice my sideburns and beard lines are looking like I walked out of the barber shop. After a few months of use, keeping in mind that I am not a barber, this feels like a very good quality tool that I can use for maintaining the look between the cuts.</li>
            <li> My Wife uses these on me about once a week or so to touch up my neck.  They are nice and small, reasonably quiet and cut very well.  Quality of the product seems first rate.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more power &amp; precision! Exactly what I was looking for &amp; some! Definitely recommend to anyone looking to take your cuts to the next level!</li>
            <li> after my experience with this trimmer and the andis superliner, i was not pleased. i even bought the wahl t-wide blade and attached it to my wahl hero. the wahl hero (with the t-wide blade and zero gapped) did not clean up my edge up as well as i thought it should. i often went back to my other trimmer to clean up what the wahl hero could not get. the worst part is that even with the slightest pressure, it still made my skin turn red for a day. if i lowered the moving blade just a hairline below the guard blade, the wahl hero would not even cut. overall, i am not pleased with this product. i will never buy another rotary trimmer ever again (wahl detailer, wahl hero, andis superliner, etc.) i threw my wahl hero in the garbage because i became so frustrated after i spent a long time adjusting it.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp is I thought it was going to be. The hump in the front is very distracting when doing a line up.</li>
            <li> i always buy wahl products.so i can say that any of thier products is good stuff but the blades could be sharper</li>
            <li> Cannot be compared to any other trimmer in my opinion. The wahl detailor is the best wahl trimmer hands down. Now this trimmer does have a strong loud motor. What if I was to change the blade on the hero ?</li>
            <li> These trimmers get close. I&#x27;m a white guy who trims his face and head before shaving with a blade. Both at the same time. This trimmer is powerful and is great for trimming a goat t.</li>
            <li> Absolute complete garbage! Worked perfect for a few weeks, then stopped working about 5 weeks in after literally using the machine about 8 to 10 times.</li>
            <li> had to get the blade adjusted, crisp lining and gets the job done, this is my spare liners, not everyday use</li>
            <li> does the trick, very sharp , may need to adjust for kids, but it works great</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer.  I had to adjust the blades at first, but after adjusting this trimmer has been working like a charm.  Definitely gives a close shave without the razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I went through 3 \\&quot;consumer\\&quot; trimmers, the 5 Star Detailer, and the Andis T-outliner before I settle on these. If you&#x27;re looking for a beard trimmer and something for lines ups and touch ups....look no further. This does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good clippers just a little loud but. Read the reviews itw good for personal use . Sharp but not to sharp.</li>
            <li> Not as strong or sharp as I was expecting. Way too loud to use on my clients. I bought a different one a day later</li>
            <li> When I first got these I did a simple shape up on myself, Wow they hit pretty close compare to a close shave after a day. They are a bit loud but who cares it&#x27;s a trimmer and like shavers they are suppose to be a bit.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve have used detailers, t-outliners, and a pair of conairs but these were gentle enough to use on all ages without nicking skin. I have heard the same from others who have used these as well.&lt;br /&gt; My only complaint is that these do get hot which can make a cut with someone who is sensitive. Besides that I would have gave it 5+. Overall a great trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Update*&lt;br /&gt;So I took them apart and clean them completely then I oiled them up good, Wow the overheating problem wasn&#x27;t a problem. I left them on for 15min straight and barely got warm. I had to come back and change my review to 4 to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money. It broke in less then a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going bald for quite some time, but I got that monk hair-do going if I don&#x27;t shave. When I don&#x27;t feel like using a safety razor, I use this thing. It gets me down to a stubble that would be the equivalent of 24hrs after a shave with my safety razor. If you adjust the blade right, you&#x27;ll get zero nicks and can buzz your head down pretty quick. I&#x27;ll normally use this if I got lazy and didn&#x27;t want to shave my head for a week or so.</li>
            <li> Flimsy, felt like a toy. Weak, no power. Top screw would not screw off, so i could not adjust the blade. Had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think i&#x27;ll be staying away from Wahl products in general. Go with Andis.</li>
            <li> I have the wahl detailer and the wahl hero clippers but I like the hero way better. It&#x27;s very clean and easy to hold. Would recommend to anybody!!!</li>
            <li> Very Lightweight and work very well. Gives a nice clean line and works well on my hairline or beard. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy these trimmers, they are small &amp; also durable. I would have given it 5 stars but the only reason why I refuse to is the fact that the owner has sent me used clippers. If you&#x27;re going to send somebody used clippers it would be a nice idea to sanitize and try to clean the previous hairs. I&#x27;ve been cutting hair since the late 80&#x27;s I could&#x27;ve taught me nephew how to do a better clean up job.</li>
            <li> perfect is the best trimmer works goog i recommend i am a profesional barber  20 years expierence in this busines</li>
            <li> Received this trimmer and was looking forward to using it as I have seen many great reviews, but the trimmer was defective right out of the package!!!  The trimmer would only run if you held the power button constantly &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; while operating!  This made for awkward positioning and would result in hand fatigue, or worse yet, getting cut by this trimmer.  Had to return it (at my cost due to being fulfilled by someone other than amazon) and had ordered the &amp;#34;Wide T-blade&amp;#34; for accessory to this device, and will not need it now, so again I will eat the cost of sending this back too.  Will certainly have to consider other models/brands before buying this trimmer again!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! Best trimmer I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim too quickly but does the job for the most part with a few passes in the same area.  For the money it will do for now.</li>
            <li> I needed a good trimmer and this does the job as well as any professional trimmer barbers have used on me. Compact size, with a good feel in the hand.  Extremely precise, clean cutting action. It would be nice if it were rechargeable, but  I suppose that might change the shape and weight which are now very comfortable.  So I guess I can accept the cord.  I recommend this trimmer if you do not mind the cord.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are a good clipper to add to your collection, they are great for beards and makes line ups even have a more sharp and crisp look to it!</li>
            <li> i cut my son&#x27;s hair and the usual T-edge liners were to sharp for him and he&#x27;d cry.  These are much more suitable for smaller children and they cut pretty sharp right out of the package, no adjustment needed.</li>
            <li> This whal Hero T is one of the best trimmers out there yet. It cuts through any type of hair! It&#x27;s a little loud, but not too loud. It was working perfectly fine. And then when changing the blades everything inside broke. Never to be used again? Literally broke. This was my best trimmer!  I was really really disappointed! And I&#x27;ve heard from other barbers aswell that theirs broke in about 3 months. I trully think whal does this on purpose so you can keep buying new ones. Really cheap material, that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so light! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Just purchased and &amp;#34;tested out&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;These are VERY LOUD trimmers. No customer would enjoy this loud of sound in ear.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning and sticking to my Wahl Echos.</li>
            <li> This replaced my peanut.  (I still have it but use it less)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back and forth between the detailer (which sounded less than powerful, closer to a peanut) and the Andis detailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price for this was what swayed me.  And I do like it.  The bump doesn&#x27;t bother me for my beard and stache, which is what I use it for an lining things up.  I have not zero gapped it yet.  I love the guards, nice and even cut.  For 30 something bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I have not tried to cut my head hair with it, and that&#x27;s not really what it&#x27;s intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect? no.  Would love a v5000 or v9000 motor in a small trimmer balding clipper.  Ah to dream.  For 50 bucks, I would have tried the andis.  but for 30 odd bucks, I&#x27;m more than happy.</li>
            <li> Good close shave, I shave my head and beard with this.  It dogs a little through longer hair but is expected I guess.</li>
            <li> Pros: I love these. Just what I expected. I had heard so many positive things &amp; seen so many positive reviews about these trimmers. These trimmers are just as good as the higher priced Wahl trimmers. The price is amazing for such a great quality trimmer. When you first get them I recommend zero overlapping them so that you can get a Perfect close clean trim. Dont worry about not knowing what that is or how to do it, because the instructions come inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The Only bad things I have to say about these trimmers is that they seem to heat up after about 10 Minutes of usage. Other than that their perfect!</li>
            <li> I loved them the first week I had them. It&#x27;s been about 3 to 4 weeks now of using them daily at work and oiling then regularly, the blade comes off track so they cut and pinch my clients. I should have invested a little bit more money for some nicer ones. But like I said I use them every day all day.</li>
            <li> This trimmer seemed just okay enough not to send back,until the screw that keeps the metal plate held in place came off.  Upon closer inspection, I realized that the metal tube that holds the screw was broken and had been installed on a slant.  Not a very good product to begin with, broken and badly constructed makes it worse.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer was an &#x27;okay&#x27; battery powered rechargable.  It was not bad per se, it just wasn&#x27;t very good and after a while the battery would not charge correctly.  This is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely designed with a clean metallic look, reasonably priced, trims a beard like weasel running the bleeding edge off a methadrine high (in a good way).</li>
            <li> Very light touches. Go slow and make sure you have it lined up right. Be very careful because it&#x27;s powerful and if you press too hard, you can cut the guy&#x27;s head up. Great liner.</li>
            <li> these wahl clippers are nice. very handy, small for nice trimming ability. quality made and nicely priced. i have been using last two weeks with no complaints. i would recommend.</li>
            <li> i would go to the barber every two weeks and spend thirty dollars now i can do my self these are awesome</li>
            <li> Used these to trim and edge my son and my hair. Love them they are sharp and way better than the Andis style liners I used to use. Had to buy another set cause the motor stopped on the first set after two years but I think water or liquid may have gotten inside the casing.</li>
            <li> These are great. Not as sharp as my Wahl T-Blade, but this is MUCH better on my sensitive areas, like the back of my neck. I also use it to shape up my mask. Because it&#x27;s not as sharp, it doesn&#x27;t irritate as badly. Don&#x27;t get me wrong... it IS sharp. But I use my T-blade for my edge up. I use this for everything else.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also good for trimming down my beard before I go over it with my 5-Star Shaper Shaver.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy. Its sharp, fast, strong, and when you set it up with zero-gap, it will cut skin! but that just means it works well. Perfect for shape-ups.</li>
            <li> Out the box, this trimmer may disappoint, but give them some time after adding oil and using it for another 2-3 weeks, it has gotten better. I can&#x27;t say anything negative about the product, but in hindsight I may have sought after a different edger.</li>
            <li> Rock solid piece of gear.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it performs consistently.  Hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and in great condition! So far these are my favorite trimmers. I would definitely put this as one the top 3 trimmers ever. You cant beat this buy.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! Rusted after a few months and became brutally sharp. I tried to keep using but then it became dull. Not worth $1.</li>
            <li> It dropped from a height of less than 4 inches and broke.</li>
            <li> Not as I thought they would be and not as accurate as the T-Trimmers</li>
            <li> okay.. 1st of all i was soo happy with this trimmer the power and the blade sharpness and design the only thing wierd is that the head of the blade is angled really far back so u have to liekm basically fraw with it when u hold it but its precise.. i was just cutting with it its not even a week old and the black poped out and a piece went fflying. i tryed to put it back together but its broken and its put together with a spring and cheap piece of plastic that slides the blade back and forth im so disgusted at how poor the quality is i feel like calling wahl and saying this is why andis and oster gets talked about in a higher regaurd they make metal pieces! if wahl addresses the issue and designs a better machanism i think this trimmer could be a really good match for any other one on the markey but i have to give it a thumbs down cuz now im out of a trimmer! get the wahl detailer of the andis superliner instead</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer. Very close, super fast motor. My blades were not lined up when I first opened it but easily adjustable. The metal case is a bit too big and the only thing that bothers me.</li>
            <li> great pair of trimmers works great I bought this item twice because my brother took the other pair when he used them</li>
            <li> These trimmers (combined with the Wahl Double Wide T-Blade) are amazing! They have a little bite but once I break them in, they will be fantastic. I also love how lightweight they are. I haven&#x27;t had a decent pair of trimmers for quite some time until I purchased these. Makes me excited about cutting again! (Although I&#x27;m only an amateur! :-) )</li>
            <li> Great alternative to $50 Andis clippers. Very sharp. Make sure you adjust properly or your line-up will leave you red.</li>
            <li> very light weight unlike andis trimmers i was using...works awesome for designs..edge ups..beard work...recommend to everybody!</li>
            <li> Pretty good compared to andis</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for college and it helped me alot. I only used the blades it came with for 2 weeks. I suggest buying the T-wide blade and using them. it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li> I finally used these trimmers and was amazed by the power they had. They are very small, smaller than your regular clippers and trimmers. This makes it easy to hold in your hands and edge up your hair lines if needed. They are also super lite.</li>
            <li> I own 4 liners and 2 faders. i do not cut professionally but i am an enthusiast when it comes to cutting hair and this is the most superior liner to hit the market. More importantly i would like to thank Wahl for providing a zero gap tool because it is hell to do on ones own.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are beasty, heavy hitters no lies. These trimmers are powerful, use these trimmers for home use. These clippers provides crisp sharp linings and they stay cool for after 30 minutes, I really did feel it get hot until about 45 mins. They are not sharp out the box, but if you zero gap the blade it looks like you left the barbershop. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s been over 2 years now (4/14/15). These liners have been going strong. There are a couple issues/tips I will like to provide.&lt;br /&gt;One if you purchase these liners you have to adjust them often because the screws will come loose and make the liner blades over lap which will cut you. I also have noticed the blades tend to rust, and I clean them before or after every use.&lt;br /&gt;If your having trouble with the bum from the gray plastic covering unscrew the 2 screw in the back of the clippers and take off the gray cover and you&#x27;ll have a regular liner.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t zero gap out the box break them in same with the T-wide blade. Once you break them in. Then zero-gap you&#x27;ll have the freshest lines out there. I only use these for my home use. Their great never had a problem. If your heavy user, you might want to purchase 2 because they will die after a while. Other than that I think their the best liners on the marker.</li>
            <li> These babies are awesome. Very easy to use and pretty small. I use them for line ups and edging.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectation. Its small and its nice for shaping up clients. It leaves a nice clean line. It arrived promptly and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> great product but not yet tested, thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband picked these out to use. He loves these trimmers and it worked really well  for him trimmer his gold-T. He is AA.</li>
            <li> Honey loves them easy to use light weight</li>
            <li> One of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased. It is lightweight and easy to use. I love how sharp my shape ups look when I use this trimmer.</li>
            <li> excellent product for a much cheaper price then your local hair products store.  I have used this trimmer almost everyday for the past 7 months and is still working like new.  (while oiling it every few days of course)</li>
            <li> this blade is hard to zero gap even w/ the tool. btw, i had to request for the tool from wahl (it&#x27;s free, just call em and ask for the t-blade tool). supposedly, this blade comes zero gapped from the factory.. but can we really believe them?? Haha!!! anyways, i really dig the rotary motor... it runs alot cooler than the traditional motors. i still prefer my Andis T-Outliners but when using the Andis for several clients in a row, the blade can become super hot!!! this is when i bust out the Wahl Detailers!</li>
            <li> Works really good cuts close but it gets stuck a lot on thick hair and its a little noisey.. I think it&#x27;s a great personal trimmer but no so much for a stylist</li>
            <li> These are one of my favorite trimmers hands down. You dont need to adjust them much. They hit nice crisp clean lines. I always put the T-Wide blade on it . It makes it official for any type of cut. The only downfall I Hope Wahl fixes is the fact that tjet trimmer itself breaksdown after no more than 6 months for various reasons,  housing cracks, switch fails, motor dies. I continue to buy the trimmer knowing it will only give me half a years life.</li>
            <li> I heard and read rave reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  However, it is a sharp blade.  Works better on ethnic hair than straight Caucasian hair in my professional opinion.  Very Loud motor!  Just a touch quieter than a Bullet or a Peanut.</li>
            <li> Great clippers! There extremely sharp out the box clean cut light and doesnt really run hot.. must have and there inexpensive</li>
            <li> Bought for my son as a Christmas gift. He said he can&#x27;t believe how nice this trimmer is compared to the much cheaper trimmer he was using before this.</li>
            <li> Works well, sounds very quiet, very lightweight and very small. 1 negative it that because of the way it&#x27;s shaped it is difficult to see the blade when your detailing. I think the Wahl Detailer is much better ofr that but that machine has a problem with the way its built.</li>
            <li> After a while the blades get too hot and burn the skin when edging a hair cut</li>
            <li> this is a excellent product i do recommend it great buy good price very powerful top noch</li>
            <li> Happy Happy Happy, no more nappy nappy nappy!!!!!😼👍</li>
            <li> Best trimmer on the market my only concern is the blade is the blade isn&#x27;t set right. It moves and could cut people. So be cautious when giving a clean edge up or lined up the beard.</li>
            <li> Another fantastic product from the\\&quot;NEW and IMPROVED WAHL CLIPPERS and TRIMMERS\\&quot;.These trimmers are well worth the buck.I give them 5 stars because they deliver accurate and precise points and lines.Very,very light but powerful motor.Although they are very sharp,they are also very smooth to the touch.These are not the type of trimmers that leave cuts and gashes on the skin. Dont get me wrong,they are very sharp but SMOOTH.Well to say the least,WAHL thanks again for another fine product.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this trimmer and I was pleasantly surprised. Don&#x27;t let the small size fool you this little trimmer has more power than you would expect and is very precise. This clipper is equipped with an adjustable 5 Star blade so that you can set it for precise cutting. It gave a crisp line right out the box! If that isn&#x27;t good enough for you it came with a pro set tool that helps you \\&quot;zero gap\\&quot; the blades. Be careful with that because these bad boys are sharp! I am a barber and I have many liners, but this one is in my top 3. My only complaint is that it seems to be cheaply built. One barber in my shop bought a pair and his broke after a few months. If you drop them then that may be it due to the body being plastic. I take care of my stuff so that isn&#x27;t an issue for me. Overall I say Wahl put together a very good clipper that is both quality and cost efficient.</li>
            <li> I only used it a hand full of time and it started pulling my hair instead of trimming.I am very frustrated with this product, its no better than Andis(burned my scalf- over heats).I wonder what to buy next. :(</li>
            <li> Lightweight but powerful I find myself using these more than my outliners</li>
            <li> Good trimmers. The zero gaping tool it comes with is actually useful and a nice bonus. While I prefer the andis t outliner which I also own a tad more, I do appreciate that the blade on these doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 16 year old barber and I just started bought this clipper like a mouth ago and I gotta say its better than my andis t-outliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to through andis under the bus, these clipper are better because their is a lower chance of me cutting my clients and they don&#x27;t get hot as fast</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a licensed professional do not waste your money on these they can barely cut a neckline!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This clipper here is pretty good it gives some good shape ups and it hits pretty hard when u set it right and idk how long this clipper is going to last but I&#x27;m going to use it until it dies on me</li>
            <li> work better than wahl peanut.Highly recommend for all barbers.it does not cut skin like wahl peanut.it very good price compare with peanut.</li>
            <li> GREAT TRIMMER FOR SHAVING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these trimmers because I wanted another pair of trimmers and also because in the process of trying to sharpen my Andis T-Outliner blades I ended up making them dull and unable to cut.  Since I had to order new blades I figured why not pick up another trimmer as well.  I have to say these trimmers are great, powerful and compact.  I have read reviews that people say the hump I the trimmer body is awkward, but I have no issues with it at all.  The trimmers come with a zero gapping tool which I did use before I even began to use the trimmers because I already knew I wanted the blades as close as I could get them for shaving with them.  The shave is great and extremely close.  I also ordered the larger T-Outline blades for these trimmers and have set them but not used them as of yet because I am pleased with the original blades at the moment.  I always use Andis Cool Care Plus or Whals spray for clippers that I had already before every use and it keeps them cutting good.  As for a comparison between these trimmers and the Andis T-Outliners I think they are both great for my purpose of use which is for shaving and edge ups.  I have to say I like these Whal Hero trimmers for shaving more than the Andis T-Outliner even after I put the new blades.  I&#x27;m no barber but I would say that either trimmer you go with will provide you the results you are looking for with the proper adjustment of the blades and keeping them oiled with Andis Cool Care Plus.  If the price difference between these trimmers and the Andis has you second guessing don&#x27;t be fooled by how much cheaper they are because they are a GREAT PAIR OF TRIMMERS and also would be great for traveling vice the Andis due to size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Sharp. I love it!</li>
            <li> This trimmer hits hard real pro-gear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new trimmers. It came on time, and I can&#x27;t stop using to shape up my sons edge up. Their awesome.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to do my own shape ups. I use the &amp;#34;Hero T Blade trimmer&amp;#34; for the straight line cuts. This trimmer does a very good job of cutting straight and smooth. It does not nick your skin like most clippers do. As a reviewer stated &amp;#34;It is very loud&amp;#34;. It is loud if you have a guide attached. Without a guide attached it is no louder than my other clippers. By the way, my co-worker was impressed with the trim I did on my own head yesterday. So, I can say this trimmer has enhanced my cutting skills.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! Works quite fine, very light. My only concern is that it may break very easliy, if it falls. The plastic feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> excellent trimmer be careful they are sharp and will cut you if you don&#x27;t adjust the blades correctly, powerful little trimmer!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I thought it would. But it doed a half decent job.Would I recommend it, no.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I ordered. It works well and the quality is fantastic! I would order similar products from Wahl!</li>
            <li> Great razor, cuts close. Better than previously purchased Oster Finish Line Salon Textured System trimmers. Best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is powerful &amp; sharp. Blade didn&#x27;t need much adjusting. Trimmer runs fast &amp; does not get hot. I like this trimmer so much that I put my Andis T-Edjer up. After all the you tube videos I saw especially the ones from Ron Legend I&#x27;m now a believer for myself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for over 15 years and this is the first time that I can say that Wahl has hit the nail on the head with a product. I&#x27;ve owned nothing but Andis products (T-outliner, T-edjer, and Master) and I&#x27;ve always had to get the blades professionally sharpened before using, but this is not the case with the Wahl 5 star trimmer. The 5 star trimmer is light, has a nice grip, easy to use and does not get hot. On the downside it is slightly noisy, but overall it is a great investment to take any barber&#x27;s game to the next level.</li>
            <li> Quality trimmer. Detailers still my favorite but this is a handy trimmer. I use this more for children and people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> once its adjusted and doest cut skin you can get very detailed lines love it. great for shape ups beards and shaving</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use trimmer for outlining and shaping up.  As others have said, the blades are sharp and cut very close.  I use this at home for the occasional touch up.</li>
            <li> Beats by battery operated beard trimmer by a mile. Powerful, quiet and lightweight. I still need to pre trim with electric hair cutter because my beard is very course</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer but the motor will eventually blow. I have had two pair and 1st pair blew out n 3 weeks. 2nd lasted for 2months then blew. Surprised that I dont see any other reviews that suggest that the motor in these things are bad. Great while they last but trist me they wont last long.</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers! Definitely worth the money.  FiveStsr hits another home run.  If you like a close shave without the bumps from a razor, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> I love these trimmers!  Cut with utter easy straight out the box!  However it does feel like a toy. When you first pick it up you think this is some bullsh!t but when you start cutting.....WOW!! The cord is the thickest cord ive seen on a trimmer.  The packaging gets a 1 star!  Doesnt mean much of anything but that first impression was not good.  Trust me and buy these!!!!  You will love them. If not return it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Opinion the Hero&#x27;s are much better then the Whal Detailers</li>
            <li> I am a single mom of an Afro American boy with severe autism. Haircuts for us are typically a nightmare if we don&#x27;t have a patient barber. I&#x27;m new to my area, and have yet to find a barber who can tackle our job... So what is left ?? Momma is now a barber!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for a beginner or novice, cuts clean without being too sharp and will be sufficient for me until we find a replacement barber in the area! I would highly recommend to the at home novice barber photo shows my first ever attempt at a lineup so not perfect but with m</li>
            <li> Love them.Work great light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> just got this today and I&#x27;m a barber this berly even cuts very disappointed with this product this will be the last time I buy this product I should&#x27;ve just baught the Penut</li>
            <li> I like it. Competes very well with Andis outliner.&lt;br /&gt;It is light, and small. It is powerful and cuts clean.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for shaving, If I use a blade I get bump.</li>
            <li> This is a small but verry powerfull trimmer. It dilivers crispy lines good for shaping up the hair and facail hair.</li>
            <li> Just got my trimmers the other day and I tried them and I was initially taking back by how powerful they were. The clippers are VERY light (almost too light to where I thought they may be cheap) but they cut very crisp and precise. I&#x27;m use to Andis T-Outliners and it was a nice change from the normal. I hope they last as long as Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very light Weight&lt;br /&gt;Small and Easy To Travel With&lt;br /&gt;Crisp&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Overheat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Super Long Cord.</li>
            <li> its a give for a family member but i guess it works ok .. ill see what my fam say</li>
            <li> There is no going wrong with these, all you do is adjust the blade with the instructions and you have clear,accurate trimming! If you are looking for a good trimmer to clean up or what ever it may be, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> nice decent power quick jobs good</li>
            <li> This trimmer is small but gives a close shave,  it gets the job done and is very compact,  it is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> After adjusting the blades, the trimmer cut like a charm.  The trimmer fits nicely and firm in your hand while you are using it.  Does not seem strong, but will surprise you when you start using it.  Great product.  Would definitely buy again.  Another recommendation for a trimmer would be the Andis T-Outliners.  They are a little bigger but are well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, the hero t blade is a good product.  the produce arrived on time.</li>
            <li> These clippers are wonderful. My barber recommended them and I thank him ever time I visit.  They cut very close but they dont cut your skin at all. I&#x27;ve had the andis for years but these are much better and easier to use. Great product</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist I can guarantee you&#x27;ll really like these trimmers.  They&#x27;re light-weight, fit comfortably in your hand and are great for getting around those tight corners and ears. The guards work well for beard and even eye brow trimming.  These are easy to clean and take apart and reassemble; they even include a blade adjustment tool to zero gap.  They get very close and are great for cleaning up the neckline, I&#x27;ve even used them to trim down to zero on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is too short for my taste and I feel that the hook loop/hole is too small for most hooks so I had to improvise a bit as I don&#x27;t like to just leave these laying around.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the delivery came so quickly. Now, the Wahl Hero T Blade Trimmer works wonders. I can get through the hair once or twice which is pretty nice for me. Cleaning up someone neck doesn&#x27;t take as long. I had the Andis Style Liner 2 and I would have to go over the neck at least 4 to 6 times. I expected the Wahl to be small but not at small. It does take some time to get use to but I love this product a lot. If you want something easy, light weight, and powerful. This is the product to get. And! I love the fact that it stays cool, doesn&#x27;t over heat easily.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s service and delivery was great!  Product is good and there are no major complaints but its quite loud and not as good as I thought it would be based on reviews.  However, I must say, since receiving my husband has NOT reverted back to his Andis liners/trimmers.</li>
            <li> these things are nice to use.  they cut very close.  i was hesitant to buy a rotary motor trimmer.  i am used to my oster t trimmer with rotary motor.  these clippers look nice, cut close, but are a bit too loud</li>
            <li> Very Sharp and no adjustments were needed.  They are extremely light and very powerful. I cut mine and my sons hair.  We are very happy not having to worry about being pinched.</li>
            <li> The clipper is small but creates an impact on the outlining process. It does not get hot nor does it cut my skin like other clippers out there. Works good and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great barbering tool. Very neat and precise edge up.</li>
            <li> Powerful little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Had it for about 3-4 months works great for neck link clean ups.</li>
            <li> perfect for around the ear and a tight neck cleaning...Very lite on the hand ...this is my favorite tiny trimmer...better than peanut..</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a lot better than the personal one that Wahl makes.  The professional brand&lt;br /&gt;is very good, and cuts/trims with ease.</li>
            <li> Cuts line perfect. does not overheat like other edgers out there. I personally reccommend this product. This is an edger you should buy today.</li>
            <li> After purchasing and returning the andis t outliner trimmer 2, I decided to give the Hero a try.  I am very glad I did, these trimmers are very sharp and very easy to manuever and best of all the do not get super hot like the andis. They also came with a guide to zero gap!  So for half the price of the andis it goes to show u  u don&#x27;t always get what u pay for. Sometimes u get more!  They are a little noisey but its no bother to me. I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys the look of a razor sharp line-up.</li>
            <li> Im a cosmetologist and i do a lot of haircuts in a day, i didnt even have this for a month before it started cutting people. I know how to properly use a trimmer too. I dont know if it was just the one i got but i wont ever get this again. I will spend the extra money to get a very good one. This might be good for someone to use for personal home usebut nothing mre</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer after having a pair of andis styleliners and outliners for about 8years.  This gives the best edge up I&#x27;ve seen. I had to adjust the blade to get zero gap. Put a little oil on it and started cutting. The body doesn&#x27;t feel like it is the best quality so I&#x27;ll see how long they last but for $35 you can&#x27;t beat it.  the andis feel like they are better made but the blade on the hero is thinner and the clipper is faster.  I purchased the wahl detailers as well, I would compare those to the andis outliners but there not on the level of these hero trimmers</li>
            <li> The trimmer is light weight &amp; powerful. Was not sharp out of the box.had to adjust several times to get right</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price, but doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I thought it would. Still works fine for trimming and lining up though. Unless you&#x27;re dealing with beards, I wouldn&#x27;t use it for shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a professional product and it&#x27;s made to endure.  I&#x27;ve bought a lot of little trimmers that died quickly, this one feels substantial and powerful.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, especially considering the price.  Much better than any of the battery powered clippers.  Arrived within a few days.</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home trimming</li>
            <li> Terrible ,  period ,  can&#x27;t do a line up with  these one day returned  them save  ur $$$ wouldn&#x27;t  cut</li>
            <li> I love them light weight and gets the job done</li>
            <li> The product gets 5 stars however,  the pro set tool didn&#x27;t come with it as advertised but it didn&#x27;t matter because it was easy to adjust to zero without it.I tried them for the first time and man do they have my beard looking good. Trimmers are very light weight but you can feel the power once you turn them on just make sure you press lightly and only cut at the correct angle these babies are sharp and you will cut someone</li>
            <li> Great trimmer! The only drawback is that its not ideal for cuttting your own hair due to the bulkiness of the front of the case. You have to take off the outer case so its ideal for cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great on beards, mustaches,necks....trimming around the ears is a breeze...I have 15 grand children...seven boys and three son-in-laws... a son and cut most of their hair....I use Oster fast feed cutters and this little wahl trimmer for the finishing touches...GREAT PRODUCT......thanks....makes my work much easier</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to be so small. But it works nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Cuts well, sometimes bites so I&#x27;ll have to adjust blades.  Pretty loud buzzing while in use.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a trimmer to clean up around the edges after I do my haircut. I settled on these after doing a lot of online research and am happy I did. They appear to be professional level quality and have a heavy duty cord,  They do a fine job cleaning up around my ears and the back of my neck, etc. I also purchased the Oster Fast Feed from Amazon and these are a great compliment to each other.</li>
            <li> PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN T BLADE AND THE T WIDE BLADE BEFORE PURCHASING.....i MADE THIS MISTAKE BECAUSE OF HOW THE PRODUCT WAS ADVERTISED!!! THE PROBLEM HERE WAS THAT IN THE PICTURES, IT DIDNT SHOW THE PACKAGING WHICH WOULD LET YOU &amp;#34;THE CUSTOMER&amp;#34; KNOW WHAT EXACTLY YOU WILL GET, INSTEAD OF GIVING TRICKY DESCRIPTIONS AND PICTURES THEY FOUND ON GOOGLE OR SOMETHING... EBAY WOULD&#x27;VE TAKEN CARE OF THIS ISSUE ALREADY!!!!!  2CENTS IN</li>
            <li> Great t - edger. Very powerful. Good for edging beards / moustaches. Fits my smaller hand nicely. I use it daily on my customers.</li>
            <li> Very very loud. Not recommend for professional use because of this. You seriously cannot hear anything else but the trimmers when they are on.</li>
            <li> In the industry walh trimmers have gotten a lot of attention. However, in my experince with their latest addition, the walh hero, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. In the industry they say once you zero gap these they cut like butter. In my experience they failed to meet up to the hype. As powerful as the reviews make these out to be seemed elusive to me. I will continue to stick with what I know, the ANDIS Trimmers.</li>
            <li> I use it a few mins everyday and so far I have not had any problems</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I used to be a professional hair dresser and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this trimmer. Nowadays I just cut my husband and boy&#x27;s hair, but it works great. We needed a new trimmer for cutting side burns, trimming around the ears and neckline. Cuts nice and tight. Excellent product for the price. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This trimmers gives great edge ups. Don&#x27;t let the size fool you because its very powerful and can gives excellent results. For the price I don&#x27;t there is a better trimmer. The blade performs great. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have been a barber for 20+years, I like the comfort these trimmers provide, very smooth, cord could be a bit longer..!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by this clipper.Very good sharp crisp lines without hesitation!! Small in compact to easily fit in hand;yet very powerful!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to clean up my hair line a maintain my beard. You might have to go over the lines a couple of times with this machine but, it&#x27;s not really a hassle. I was able to gets my blades perfectly flush using the blade adjustment tool. My first experience with t-blade trimmers was with my brother&#x27;s Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer, which works extremely well (I&#x27;d give it a 5/5), but, this WA8991 works almost as well (motor is a bit weaker. Overall it&#x27;s a good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Small and light&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts pretty well&lt;br /&gt;- Guides for maintaining close cropped (facial) hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Blade adjustment tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Weaker motor than Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer&lt;br /&gt;- No carrying case, I store it in the plastic that it was shipped in.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly, and I actually got a random compliment from a guy at a party.  It is smooth, easy to handle, and gives a sharp line.  I look zexy now!</li>
            <li> My 9 year old son has hair that grows really fast. I take him to the barber at least once a week. SOmetimes he just needs a simple edge up. I noticed that his new barber uses these and i thought to myself I can save alot if i just purchased my own. If they are able to cut my son&#x27;s hair razor sharp. i love the cheap price. Cant wait until they arrive!!</li>
            <li> There are many options to choose in trimmers, but this little Hero has become my Big Hero and it performs flawlessly.  Initially purchased one pair to do clients hair as well as my own, and I loved the Hero so much that I bought two additional pairs for future backups and just in case I could not find them again.  I definitely recommend these to professionals and anyone looking for a dependable, light, and cool operating trimmer.</li>
            <li> Rather loud for a small clipper but it cuts great.</li>
            <li> These little trimmer packs a punch.  Hopefully, they will last long term.</li>
            <li> It had a bunch of hair in the blade and in the box. Not only did I receive a used product directly from Amazon but when I got the replacement my grandfathers barber said it was defective, something was wrong with the blade. Worst amazon order ever.</li>
            <li> Very good set of clippers, I have had them for almost a year now and I use them once a week. The clippers are still cutting good, however, you must remember to oil them at least once every 2 months and keep the blade clean of hair after each trimming.</li>
            <li> A professional clipper for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I have been cutting for over 25 years. They are great clippers for African-Americans and their hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m cutting the facial hair and using it for edge ups.&lt;br /&gt;Close cuts without the bite.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am glad that I purchased these trimmers. They received 4 stars from me because they are a little louder than the Wahl detailers. They are very powerful trimmers that will leave you line up looking crispy.</li>
            <li> These are my go to liners. Zero gapped. Look nice. Feel cheap but they hit harder than any liners I know of. Better than Andis liners period.  They don&#x27;t get hot at all.  The wahl detailers are also hitters as well I got those too</li>
            <li> it was described as to be the best when it comes down to shaping up your beard or cut, instead the blade was dough and not cutting.</li>
            <li> Motor is not strong enough for a really good lining. It&#x27;s okay but I saw the same set at Walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li> This clipper can be better than a razor if you properly zero gap the blade. And it can be used for dry shaving. Not to mention its very good for doing C-Notes, forehead edge ups , and mustaches. But most importantly they don&#x27;t lose alignment like the Andis t out liners and they don&#x27;t need oil. So trust me you won&#x27;t find a better trimmer. Andis and oater need to really step it up.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor based on some youtube videos I saw of barbers using this model.  I didn&#x27;t want to break down and learn how to use a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It opened the box and zeroed the blades immediately.  I have no complaints, especially considering the low price I paid for this razor.  It is SHARP and precise.  I have lighter skin and darker hair, so line-ups were always a challenge for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with the Wahl super close shaver to help reduce and/or eliminate ingrown hair.  Hard to cut the hair close to the face.</li>
            <li> These clippers are smal light and powerfull, this clippers are nice I wish I had found these years ago...I will refer these clippers to my friends....</li>
            <li> easy to use and safe on your skin.  I am happy with it so far. Great for beard and mustache definition.</li>
            <li> Great clippers fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is by far the best liner ive ever owned! I currently use the andis t outliner,andis outliner,andis styliner and of course these. They cuty very sharp and they are super easy to adjust. These were my go to liners when i wanted to leave a sharp line. Do not let the small size fool you they are powerful and they dont get hot like the andis outliners do.Now that we have the good out of the way here comes the bad. I purchased my set in May 2014 because im beafing up my arsenal because ive been getting serious with barbering and I was completly satified up until about 4 weeks ago. I was lining up my face before I went out. After about 20 minutes of use I heard a pop inside the clipper. I thought it was shorting out but I smelled nothing electric burning so i continued my shape up. The next time I used these clippers I noticed the cutting blade was shifting without it being powered. I looked on youtube and saw from different barbers that this is common for these clippers. Amazon was great as always with taking care of the return even after my return date was expired. If your a do it your self barber just cutting a  few heads here and there I would not recommend these. If your in a busy shop with a large client list these are a must have. Whats $35 bucks every 3 month if your makin thousads.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my face do to having bumps under my chin and on my neck. It gets really close shave and it does not cut my neck or scratch it. I also like how it comes with a maintenance clip so you can easily adjust the head back to the original setting if it were to fall out of alignment</li>
            <li> its small and compact yes, but nooooooooo good for facial hair or sideburns. its sharp but leaves many marks. I tried adjusting them several times but still no good. BUT the wahl detailers are awesome! Highly recommend the andis cordless trimmers as well, there like 40$ and work better than hero&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have no credentials as a barber but i have been cutting my own hair for at least 8 years and cut hair in the army as well (volunTOLD situation). i used to just use my body trimmers to shape myself up but got tired of not being able to get into the edges of my line good enough. I am extremely happy with these trimmers! they are sharp and easy to zero with the tool provided. You might wanna try the trimmers right out the box and see if they cut good enough already. you don&#x27;t want to make the blades overly sharp and end up cutting yourself. Great price, small, give the quiet of the motor a 3/5</li>
            <li> This is an awesome trimmer. Cuts great and crisp. Just becareful when you ajust it cuz you can cut your self.</li>
            <li> Didnt know they were going to be that small and compact I used them as soon as I got them and they worked pretty good...no complaints at this time will see what happens later.....didn&#x27;t give it a five star cause in my opinion the blade needs to be a bit wider for my liking...maybe I just need to get used to them....is that boi smokin Joe....</li>
            <li> It works fine but I&#x27;m no barber. I screwed up the sides of my hair trying to trim it up with this. I shouldn&#x27;t have attempted it. Nothing wrong with the trimmer though. It has a quality feel, all it needs is a mildly skilled wielder to go with it. I gave it to my barber/stylist while it was still new and before I was tempted to try it again. Again, nothing wrong with it, nice solid feel, sharp blades, looks good. Wahl makes good products.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts so good, I&#x27;m simply speechless.  No more andis trimmers for me!!  A must for all barbers whether at home or professional</li>
            <li> good for lining up, however I wish it was a little stronger. The Newer trimmer is more powerful</li>
            <li> Small but has a strong motor. Very easy to get into small areas of the face.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and the clippers are nice addition!  They are smaller than I anticipated but I&#x27;m used the the size now and the pack a powerful punch!</li>
            <li> I will start by saying they are small and feel like a little toy. Will you get them I suggest that you set your blades however you like and they hit really hard. Overall they are great to be so small and cute lol. It takes no effort to give line ups or designs. You will be pleased with these trimmers.</li>
            <li> These are quiet, just the right size and not too sharp. Excellent for getting a great line. Great for beginners or experts.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are best ones on the market and that&#x27;s coming from a master Barber that has used every trimmer on the market. They are Small and light weight and have really sharp blades and comes with a zero gaping tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone from a rookie to a master Barber</li>
            <li> I honestly thought all the reviews were just hype but they are all true, these joints hit, and I mean hard, after almost 20 years using the andis styliners I took a chance with these, and it was a good move, they are very light to a point that u would think there toys but they are far from it they&#x27;re a little loud but that ain&#x27;t nothin, long story short cop these!!!! And do yourself a favor and cop the t wide blade</li>
            <li> Loud but small. My wahl detailers are much better a tool for barbering.</li>
            <li> Really terrible product. It should be banned. I am not much for words.. I am not much for words. Is that 13 words?</li>
            <li> great clipper just how i expected it to be, got to me within 5 days im based in uk !</li>
            <li> Recieved my package in a very timely manner which I appreciate. The T timmer works great mind you I&#x27; ve only had it a short time but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I would advise that you be careful the trimmer blade can be a bit sharp.</li>
            <li> These work great and give you a crisp edge every time! Don&#x27;t press too hard though because they will leave a mark.</li>
            <li> I choose to sport a bald head. My wife loves it too. I have purchased six clippers before finding this one at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. This is the only one that makes my head loom like I used a razor on it. I messed up my first one and had to purchase a new one after owning it for five years. Excellent product and a very good price!</li>
            <li> great product. light weight and does not heat up like andis.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Hero packs a mean punch! It cuts very well and is easy to control. I use it for shape-ups/edge-ups and beard trimming. I admit, out of the box it was not sharp enough. But after I pretty much zero gapped it, I was shocked. It cuts much better than my Andis T Outliner and that&#x27;s saying a lot. The infamous \\&quot;bump\\&quot; on the body of the trimmer did not affect the cutting ability at all. I barely noticed it was there. The Wahl Hero is definitely smaller than most top of the liner trimmers but don&#x27;t let that fool you. This thing is definitely worth the buy. I suggest you use the blade adjuster that comes with the kit and zero gap the blades. They will become razor sharp but the blades don&#x27;t bite (cut your skin) which is good. They stayed cooled after 30min of continued use which is a plus. Also, since it&#x27;s so small, it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to maneuver. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily throw away my Andis T Outliner&#x27;s because time will tell if these will hold up overtime. But for now, this is the best trimmer I ever used!</li>
            <li> Trimmers catch the skin and cut it.  They don&#x27;t cut the hair as well as would like which means you have to go over the same spot several times.  The trimmers just don&#x27;t seem to do well with coarse hair at all.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!</li>
            <li> awesome, light weight and makes crisp lines. only thing is these are noisy.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. Small in size but has a powerful punch</li>
            <li> Love them! a must buy</li>
            <li> This are the best trimmers on the market. I own the andis outliners 1 and 2, m3s, T edgers, styliners 2 and have been using these for years. Honestly I don&#x27;t know why professional barbers the wahls hero because of out the box with no adjustment they cut the best all around the face beard, and back of the neck. It does not leave any cuts and marks. It is the all around best trimmers for beginners and pros and they are a good price.</li>
            <li> muy bueno economico tiene un corte fino y poderoso bueno para detalles y dise&amp;ntilde;os como lineas, sideburns, mustaches etc m</li>
            <li> Best  Deal on the net.. these trimmers are the best on the market.. &amp; I been cutting hair for 25 years+ THANKs</li>
            <li> Really precise, lightweight and pleasent to use, only downside: it doesnt come with a blade guard smaller thant 1/2.. Hard to achieve the 2 day beard look, but not at all disapointed for the price, i do recommend this</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I selected this trimmer.  It is working great with no adjustments needed.</li>
            <li> The power of this little trimmer is amazing doesn&#x27;t heat up has a rotary motor can also put the t wide blade for extra closeness and for 30.00 how could you not love this trimmer wahl is simply the best for a reason</li>
            <li> Small doesn&#x27;t get as close as I need</li>
