            <li>From the first time my skin bright and it is whiter than before.</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t by here I am posting the review under any vendor so people will know how good this product really is.</li>

            <li>For best results, I&#x27;ve used the mask every other day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was too easy to remove- as it had been sliding all over our faces</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, soothing and cooling.</li>
            <li>Liked the product very much.  </li>
            <li>Stays in place best if it is applied and used while lying down, but I gave used it while cleaning house as well.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that  it works better after a  taking a shower and a mild moisturizer after applying....</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that refreshing my facial skin and make me look bright.</li>
            <li>These are great, I&#x27;d definitely buy them again for the cost</li>
            <li>I actually bought one of these from a seller and it worked great.</li>
            <li>If you want to be fooled by a cheap face mask that doesn&#x27;t even work, doesn&#x27;t stay on your face and does nothing for you, then go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li>Great instant result.</li>
            <li>Such a great product</li>
            <li>My husband that never notices anything, &amp;#34; told me that my face looked so smooth and refreshed&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>Plump and smooth and radiant.  </li>
            <li>Packaging secure.</li>
            <li>and Wow my skin and face looked so good.</li>
            <li>Great to use if you have a special event approaching.</li>
            <li>Such a great product, and plum full of collagen.</li>
            <li>I need to be more consistent with their use.</li>
            <li>try it, it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was expecting, I love these</li>
            <li>and then I stumble upon this great product</li>
            <li>After I used it for the first time, i felt in love with it.</li>
            <li>It was noticeably smaller after removing the mask and m skin is so bright and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great fix for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I bought these and even popped for the gold mask as a special treat for my friends.</li>
            <li>Always take a long time to receive it, but these are works fine and price is good.</li>
            <li>, I had to try the full face masks.</li>
            <li>CAN&#x27;T GET FULL USE BECAUSE IT SLIDES OFF.</li>
            <li>My Chinese girlfriend loved this product.  </li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>I feel I have clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT AND AM ORDERING A YEARS WORTH, AND WILL SHARE ONE TO SEVERAL FRIENDS.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel more moisturized than normal..</li>
            <li>I used the mask last night, and I have to admit, it felt pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li>I burned  my skin a little from the peel and these were a great relief.  </li>
            <li>It evened out my skin tone , softened/filled the fine lines on my face around my eyes and mouth, and even seemed to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the upper lids, giving my face a more youthful look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, nor pretty to see for your significant other, but our skin is significantly smoother and more elastic after keeping it on for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I used this once few hours before I went night out, after removing the mask my face looked so great</li>
            <li>Skin looks radiant, and fresh after 30 min .I</li>
            <li>It feel so fresh</li>
            <li>but I think it worth it.</li>
            <li>nice effect but need several uses to see it</li>
            <li>They leave your skin feeling fresh, softened and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I had a spa party every guest had this mask,  we all looked like iron man, it was a fun time.</li>
            <li>IF WORTH BUYING.</li>
            <li>This product really makes you feel like fresh , shiny and light.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a mask to use on my face for a fun day gift to myself.</li>
            <li>I will be sticking to this mask worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Product leaves skin feeling fresh &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li>First time I bought this for my sister, after she use and her face looks really different then before , so I bought more!</li>
            <li>They are a great pick me up after a long stressful day or just a fast way to look vibrant before you go out on a date!</li>
            <li>Tightens my skin right up</li>
            <li>These are a great alternative to the much more expensive brands out there, and they work just as well.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time and it left my skin looking radiant, soft and bright.</li>
            <li>The mask feels cool and good for the entire time it is on the face (I left it on for 40 minutes).</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I love a facial mask.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>When my wife was wearing the mask, I couldn&#x27;t decide if I was married to iron man or C3PO.  </li>
            <li>These facial masks are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but I tried them and they are great!  </li>
            <li>My facialist charges A FORTUNE for this exact product.  </li>
            <li>I used it and found that my skin looked more vitalized and younger.</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest this product to others and I am getting more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>I have tried many masks and this is definitely one I would not recommend.</li>
            <li>When I used it the first time.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very watery!</li>
            <li>It delivers exactly what it promises.  </li>
            <li>good mask,but no cheap</li>
            <li>but it feels very fresh and baby soft skin afterward</li>
            <li>They are thicker and easer to work with and the results are deep hydration and a flawless look for at least a couple of days.</li>
            <li>The mask seems to clarify and smooth top of skin, not sure what benefits are occurring beneath the skin.</li>
            <li>work in a large dealership with a lot of men.  </li>
            <li>The redness did disappear quickly, but I felt it wasn&#x27;t the right facial mask for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>I have to cut these apart to make them work then lay very still.  </li>
            <li>Mines stayed on the whole time I&#x27;ve walked around and everything</li>
            <li>You really have to use the serum.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I got fast response</li>
            <li>Conforms to your face very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference yet</li>
            <li>Put as much as you like on the mask AFTER you have applied it to your face.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I notice my skin is much brighter after using this.</li>
            <li>It has a very perfumey smell that didn&#x27;t appeal to me.</li>
            <li>i really like it after using this product.</li>
            <li>Save your money, this mask does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I&#x27;m a real person.</li>
            <li>Very slippery.</li>
            <li>It does feel sooo nice and soothing tho, and it does help with softness and radiance for a few days afterward.  </li>
            <li>its smells like rose water and it is cold and it is nice to use as a compress..</li>
            <li>I must say it really Surprised me!!!</li>
            <li>but I am African American with pretty ok skin but wanted to beat the aging clock so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this face masks for my father for Christmas as he&#x27;s been on a skin care kick lately and he said they were just ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li>Then if I have time ill put it in a hot bath and soak in it after a shower, makes my skin feel great,</li>
            <li>Not as great as I hoped, its cold on face and hard to place right but is good for the face</li>
            <li>but nothing special, I will look for another mask in future.</li>
            <li>However, I could get the same result from a cool washcloth soaked in aloe vera gel....</li>
            <li>I left the mask on for a few hours or longer usually at night when I have time, then take it off my face and put it on my neck for an hour or so when I take it all the way off the face and neck look soo healthy and young and looks beautiful, glows even.</li>
            <li>mouth and eyes particularly for her eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>My face has a instant glow, smooth, and soft to touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent prize</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these masks to every girl out there.</li>
            <li>Make sure to open it on a flat surface or over a sink.</li>
            <li>still using these, made my face real soft too</li>
            <li>Gentle soft gel texture sticks to you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one so far and find it better or the same as my Sk11 masks which cost almost $15 per treatment.  </li>
            <li>My skin was much softer after my first use, I&#x27;m currently doing one per week.  </li>
            <li>specially in this weather (winter), my face is usually dry, but i found the solution to that.</li>
            <li>I am older, with mature skin.</li>
            <li>Skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and acne prone</li>
            <li>I surprised with that reasult!</li>
            <li>Also, the fit is off, and I have an average size face.</li>
            <li>and my face feels so soft!</li>
            <li>For First use, I left it on all night.  </li>
            <li>This mask is kind of heavy and slippery, you will need to lay flat when use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend you lay down to enjoy this</li>
            <li>Skin felt smooth and soft, with less noticeable pores immediately after application.  </li>
            <li>Slippery, hard to place on your face, most the liquid stays in the plastic tray after you remove the mask.</li>
            <li>It really whitens your facial skin and makes it soft.</li>
            <li>Today the General Sales Manager stopped me and told me that I look more refreshed than I had in the past.  </li>
            <li>after I used it, my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and radiant</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin soft and looking refreshed.  </li>
            <li>the mask did plump up the skin people were surprised.</li>
            <li>wow~</li>
            <li>I woud recommend  everybody to try at least once, and people you would love to use it forever.</li>
            <li>real 24k gold bio collagen facial mask</li>
            <li>I felt 10 years young after removing the mask, the wrinkles were noticeably reduced.</li>
            <li>I am sticking to natural and organic products for my face after this.</li>
            <li>Like it very much.....use it on regular basis&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is so moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I understand that nothing is going to give me 20 year old skin again</li>
            <li>Hydrates my face and my skins feels so soft and plump looking</li>
            <li>The only saving grace for me was that I used the extra collagen on my hands right before I put my keratin gloves on.</li>
            <li>Cheap price not very effective.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, though a little messy the first time, before I knew what I was dealing with.</li>
            <li>The mask does fit well over the face and stays put, but after a few minutes I took it off and my face was red and splotchy in places.</li>
            <li>So far I only used one of the 5 masks.</li>
            <li>So far, I like the feeling of the mask on my face &amp; the actual texture when I touch it &#x3D;0P</li>
            <li>I go the the spa on a regular basis...because of my busy schedule nowadays...</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised about the terrific result that I have seen and felt.</li>
            <li>but it really does the job of keeping my facial skin feels clean, softer, tight with less visible lines and pores...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s heavy, yet flimsy,  and will fall right off your face the minute you get</li>
            <li>I have tried different masks in the past and this one is by far the only one that makes my face look young and fresh</li>
            <li>but i dont really see the benefits other than that.</li>
            <li>and I could not tell much difference other than the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit sloppy at first, but laying back with it on is very relaxing</li>
            <li>I usually get professional facials and purchase high end products.  </li>

            <li> Love this product for collagen treatment</li>
            <li> This product is ok.</li>
            <li> Did not see outstanding results.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied and I will use it over and over again.</li>
            <li> I usually use a mud mask, but had a wonderful collagen masque gifted to me, tried it and loved the ease of use and easy</li>
            <li> From the first time my skin bright and it is whiter than before.</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t by here I am posting the review under any vendor so people will know how good this product really is.</li>

            <li> I really wanted to love this product, because I love finding great home spa treatments that really work.</li>
            <li> For best results, I&#x27;ve used the mask every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was too easy to remove- as it had been sliding all over our faces</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, soothing and cooling.</li>
            <li> Liked the product very much.  </li>
            <li> Stays in place best if it is applied and used while lying down, but I gave used it while cleaning house as well.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that  it works better after a  taking a shower and a mild moisturizer after applying....</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that refreshing my facial skin and make me look bright.</li>
            <li> These are great, I&#x27;d definitely buy them again for the cost</li>
            <li> I actually bought one of these from a seller and it worked great.</li>
            <li> If you want to be fooled by a cheap face mask that doesn&#x27;t even work, doesn&#x27;t stay on your face and does nothing for you, then go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li> Great instant result.</li>
            <li> Such a great product</li>
            <li> My husband that never notices anything, &amp;#34; told me that my face looked so smooth and refreshed&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> Plump and smooth and radiant.  </li>
            <li> Packaging secure.</li>
            <li> and Wow my skin and face looked so good.</li>
            <li> Great to use if you have a special event approaching.</li>
            <li> Such a great product, and plum full of collagen.</li>
            <li> I need to be more consistent with their use.</li>
            <li> try it, it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting, I love these</li>
            <li> and then I stumble upon this great product</li>
            <li> After I used it for the first time, i felt in love with it.</li>
            <li> It was noticeably smaller after removing the mask and m skin is so bright and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great fix for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these and even popped for the gold mask as a special treat for my friends.</li>
            <li> Always take a long time to receive it, but these are works fine and price is good.</li>
            <li> , I had to try the full face masks.</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T GET FULL USE BECAUSE IT SLIDES OFF.</li>
            <li> My Chinese girlfriend loved this product.  </li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> I feel I have clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT AND AM ORDERING A YEARS WORTH, AND WILL SHARE ONE TO SEVERAL FRIENDS.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel more moisturized than normal..</li>
            <li> I used the mask last night, and I have to admit, it felt pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li> I burned  my skin a little from the peel and these were a great relief.  </li>
            <li> It evened out my skin tone , softened/filled the fine lines on my face around my eyes and mouth, and even seemed to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the upper lids, giving my face a more youthful look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, nor pretty to see for your significant other, but our skin is significantly smoother and more elastic after keeping it on for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I used this once few hours before I went night out, after removing the mask my face looked so great</li>
            <li> Skin looks radiant, and fresh after 30 min .I</li>
            <li> It feel so fresh</li>
            <li> but I think it worth it.</li>
            <li> nice effect but need several uses to see it</li>
            <li> They leave your skin feeling fresh, softened and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I had a spa party every guest had this mask,  we all looked like iron man, it was a fun time.</li>
            <li> IF WORTH BUYING.</li>
            <li> This product really makes you feel like fresh , shiny and light.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mask to use on my face for a fun day gift to myself.</li>
            <li> I will be sticking to this mask worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Product leaves skin feeling fresh &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> First time I bought this for my sister, after she use and her face looks really different then before , so I bought more!</li>
            <li> They are a great pick me up after a long stressful day or just a fast way to look vibrant before you go out on a date!</li>
            <li> Tightens my skin right up</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to the much more expensive brands out there, and they work just as well.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time and it left my skin looking radiant, soft and bright.</li>
            <li> The mask feels cool and good for the entire time it is on the face (I left it on for 40 minutes).</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I love a facial mask.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> When my wife was wearing the mask, I couldn&#x27;t decide if I was married to iron man or C3PO.  </li>
            <li> These facial masks are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I tried them and they are great!  </li>
            <li> My facialist charges A FORTUNE for this exact product.  </li>
            <li> I used it and found that my skin looked more vitalized and younger.</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest this product to others and I am getting more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have tried many masks and this is definitely one I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> When I used it the first time.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very watery!</li>
            <li> It delivers exactly what it promises.  </li>
            <li> good mask,but no cheap</li>
            <li> but it feels very fresh and baby soft skin afterward</li>
            <li> They are thicker and easer to work with and the results are deep hydration and a flawless look for at least a couple of days.</li>
            <li> The mask seems to clarify and smooth top of skin, not sure what benefits are occurring beneath the skin.</li>
            <li> work in a large dealership with a lot of men.  </li>
            <li> The redness did disappear quickly, but I felt it wasn&#x27;t the right facial mask for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> I have to cut these apart to make them work then lay very still.  </li>
            <li> Mines stayed on the whole time I&#x27;ve walked around and everything</li>
            <li> You really have to use the serum.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I got fast response</li>
            <li> Conforms to your face very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference yet</li>
            <li> Put as much as you like on the mask AFTER you have applied it to your face.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I notice my skin is much brighter after using this.</li>
            <li> It has a very perfumey smell that didn&#x27;t appeal to me.</li>
            <li> i really like it after using this product.</li>
            <li> Save your money, this mask does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I&#x27;m a real person.</li>
            <li> Very slippery.</li>
            <li> It does feel sooo nice and soothing tho, and it does help with softness and radiance for a few days afterward.  </li>
            <li> its smells like rose water and it is cold and it is nice to use as a compress..</li>
            <li> I must say it really Surprised me!!!</li>
            <li> but I am African American with pretty ok skin but wanted to beat the aging clock so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this face masks for my father for Christmas as he&#x27;s been on a skin care kick lately and he said they were just ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Then if I have time ill put it in a hot bath and soak in it after a shower, makes my skin feel great,</li>
            <li> Not as great as I hoped, its cold on face and hard to place right but is good for the face</li>
            <li> but nothing special, I will look for another mask in future.</li>
            <li> However, I could get the same result from a cool washcloth soaked in aloe vera gel....</li>
            <li> I left the mask on for a few hours or longer usually at night when I have time, then take it off my face and put it on my neck for an hour or so when I take it all the way off the face and neck look soo healthy and young and looks beautiful, glows even.</li>
            <li> mouth and eyes particularly for her eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> My face has a instant glow, smooth, and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent prize</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these masks to every girl out there.</li>
            <li> Make sure to open it on a flat surface or over a sink.</li>
            <li> still using these, made my face real soft too</li>
            <li> Gentle soft gel texture sticks to you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far and find it better or the same as my Sk11 masks which cost almost $15 per treatment.  </li>
            <li> My skin was much softer after my first use, I&#x27;m currently doing one per week.  </li>
            <li> specially in this weather (winter), my face is usually dry, but i found the solution to that.</li>
            <li> I am older, with mature skin.</li>
            <li> Skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and acne prone</li>
            <li> I surprised with that reasult!</li>
            <li> Also, the fit is off, and I have an average size face.</li>
            <li> and my face feels so soft!</li>
            <li> For First use, I left it on all night.  </li>
            <li> This mask is kind of heavy and slippery, you will need to lay flat when use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend you lay down to enjoy this</li>
            <li> Skin felt smooth and soft, with less noticeable pores immediately after application.  </li>
            <li> Slippery, hard to place on your face, most the liquid stays in the plastic tray after you remove the mask.</li>
            <li> It really whitens your facial skin and makes it soft.</li>
            <li> Today the General Sales Manager stopped me and told me that I look more refreshed than I had in the past.  </li>
            <li> after I used it, my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and radiant</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin soft and looking refreshed.  </li>
            <li> the mask did plump up the skin people were surprised.</li>
            <li> wow~</li>
            <li> I woud recommend  everybody to try at least once, and people you would love to use it forever.</li>
            <li> real 24k gold bio collagen facial mask</li>
            <li> I felt 10 years young after removing the mask, the wrinkles were noticeably reduced.</li>
            <li> I am sticking to natural and organic products for my face after this.</li>
            <li> Like it very much.....use it on regular basis&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face is so moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I understand that nothing is going to give me 20 year old skin again</li>
            <li> Hydrates my face and my skins feels so soft and plump looking</li>
            <li> The only saving grace for me was that I used the extra collagen on my hands right before I put my keratin gloves on.</li>
            <li> Cheap price not very effective.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, though a little messy the first time, before I knew what I was dealing with.</li>
            <li> The mask does fit well over the face and stays put, but after a few minutes I took it off and my face was red and splotchy in places.</li>
            <li> So far I only used one of the 5 masks.</li>
            <li> So far, I like the feeling of the mask on my face &amp; the actual texture when I touch it &#x3D;0P</li>
            <li> I go the the spa on a regular basis...because of my busy schedule nowadays...</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised about the terrific result that I have seen and felt.</li>
            <li> but it really does the job of keeping my facial skin feels clean, softer, tight with less visible lines and pores...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy, yet flimsy,  and will fall right off your face the minute you get</li>
            <li> I have tried different masks in the past and this one is by far the only one that makes my face look young and fresh</li>
            <li> but i dont really see the benefits other than that.</li>
            <li> and I could not tell much difference other than the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit sloppy at first, but laying back with it on is very relaxing</li>
            <li> I usually get professional facials and purchase high end products.  </li>
            <li> It also cools down any feeling of irritation (I have a very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> you can find something way less expensive that works better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is real gold in what amount</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even try to take it out flat, the way it is packaged.</li>
            <li> This mask is by far the most messy, difficult to get on your face, face mask I have ever used...</li>
            <li> it is more on my cheek bone and it drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> So in the long run, it&#x27;s beneficial since anytime you&#x27;re adding nutrition for the skin, well...</li>
            <li> mask can ONLY be worn lying flat on your back...and this causes the serum to slip down into your eyes...</li>
            <li> They fit very poorly, I had trouble keeping it on my face and it slid down and completely missed my nose, an area I especially want  </li>
            <li> Disappointed because I was expecting these to work like 24k gold, but I guess you get what you pay for :/ Great shipping though</li>
            <li> ...when used lying down, after spending an insane amount of time to carefully remove the mask from the packaging without losing all of the serum, it does make my face feel nice and fresh...</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but decided to go for it because the price was marked down.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Be careful they melt in the warmer.</li>
            <li> Made me curious what the ingredients are the packaging doesn&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> Next day, my skin was a few shades brighter, had a glow and appeared plumped up (less wrinkles).  </li>
            <li> cuz I bough same product 10 PCs for less than half price!!</li>
            <li> Not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Go with the cheaper and thinner masks where at least the extra collagen can be used over the mask and it penetrates.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and the dark spots start to fade.  </li>
            <li> I saw where some said you had to lay down during the process</li>
            <li> not much improve on my skin!!</li>
            <li> if I dont have time for a bath, ill put it back in the package til the next night for a bath.</li>
            <li> This is extremely messy and not worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin and my face is tired these days due to several issues.</li>
            <li> no wonderfully clean</li>
            <li> The mask is a little bit slippery.</li>
            <li> Waste my money.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> course I do recommend this product for you especially if you suffer from tired skin.</li>
            <li> It felt like a waste money</li>
            <li> I have used them a few times in the past with favorable results for the cost.</li>
            <li> I then did my usual night time ritual.  </li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m not sure what this mask will do longterm</li>
            <li> It is hard to form to your face - it just doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> Just hard to keep on your face and apply the mask without ripping it.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s thick, you can&#x27;t scoop the collagen and try to put it onto the mask as the mask is non-absorbable.</li>
            <li> Too bad is a little pricey for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed any changed after using this mask.</li>
            <li> but this hasn&#x27;t given me any bad reaction</li>
            <li> Buy and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disgusted by this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed any changed after using this mask. However, it does feel refreshing</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my skin.  Highly recommend!  This is the first mask I&#x27;ve purchased that actually fits properly and stays on (and I have bought probably 10 different brands over the past 6 months)</li>
            <li> I must say it really Surprised me!!!</li>
            <li> i like it very good quality and price</li>
            <li> This mask is by far the most messy, difficult to get on your face, face mask I have ever used...&lt;br /&gt;By the time you open the package and get the mask out....All of the serum has dripped off...&lt;br /&gt;This mask can ONLY be worn lying flat on your back...and this causes the serum to slip down into your eyes...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy, yet flimsy,  and will fall right off your face the minute you get vertical.&lt;br /&gt;But ...when used lying down, after spending an insane amount of time to carefully remove the mask from the packaging without losing all of the serum, it does make my face feel nice and fresh...it didn&#x27;t break me out or anything...However, I could get the same result from a cool washcloth soaked in aloe vera gel....Won&#x27;t be repurchasing this mask again</li>
            <li> Gave my answer earlier</li>
            <li> Nice feeling...I would recommend you lay down to enjoy this</li>
            <li> Just got my mask yesterday and it is soo soothing. I feel asleep with it on. It makes my skin so smooth and hydrated looking!</li>
            <li> leaves skin very smooth</li>
            <li> did use the mask, but saw no different. Not bad but nothing special, I will look for another mask in future.</li>
            <li> These are great, I&#x27;d definitely buy them again for the cost</li>
            <li> First time I bought this for my sister, after she use and her face looks really different then before , so I bought more! I tried it It&#x27;s good one!</li>
            <li> The mask feels cool and good for the entire time it is on the face (I left it on for 40 minutes). Skin feels very soft. I caught the excess serum in a container and use it up as a toner.  So far I only used one of the 5 masks. I liked it because of the cooling effect.</li>
            <li> I bought this face masks for my father for Christmas as he&#x27;s been on a skin care kick lately and he said they were just ok, nothing special. Disappointed because I was expecting these to work like 24k gold, but I guess you get what you pay for :/ Great shipping though, sellers great, products ok nothing great.</li>
            <li> I have to cut these apart to make them work then lay very still.  Not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  Tried it in one piece, finally cut it into 4 pieces and 2 stayed on, 2 fell on the floor.</li>
            <li> I actually bought one of these from a seller and it worked great. But remeber when applying the mask ask extra serum Thts already in the pack to put it on your face. Mines stayed on the whole time I&#x27;ve walked around and everything and it didn&#x27;t fall off. You really have to use the serum. the directions tell you to use the serum left in the pack when you remove it from the pack if you read the directions on the back of the pack then it will work.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Product as described.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my skin when done after over an hour with this mask on.  A glowing on my face that I hadn&#x27;t seen years.  Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THEEEESE!!  If I could afford to wear one every evening, I would in a heart beat.  Such a great product, and plum full of collagen.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really love the gold Bio Gold-collagen mask, and would buy them again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rose water! I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Always take a long time to receive it, but these are works fine and price is good. We Can do more business with.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great an I got fast response thank you  will order this again from you.</li>
            <li> I just used one last night. I didn&#x27;t see anything amazing happening to my skin BUT the feeling while having it on, I LOVE!  Gonna use them all &amp; see what the results are. So far, I like the feeling of the mask on my face &amp; the actual texture when I touch it &#x3D;0P</li>
            <li> Feels good, I used the masks on weekly basis, its good for oily skin, I recommend to use toner and cleanser before applying it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars cuz I bough same product 10 PCs for less than half price!! order it from Korea or china.</li>
            <li> So slippery!  Make sure to open it on a flat surface or over a sink. Conforms to your face very well. My friends and I felt refreshed after.</li>
            <li> Ease to apply. Skin looks radiant, and fresh after 30 min .I would recommend​  it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Although I did not see a lot of change in the mirror I thoughly enjoyed the mask. I saw where some said you had to lay down during the process but I actually sat up and watched a movie without any problems.</li>
            <li> I love a facial mask. I especially enjoy treating my girlfriends- sister- mom, and treating them to a night of pampering. I usually use a mud mask, but had a wonderful collagen masque gifted to me, tried it and loved the ease of use and easy removal.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought these and even popped for the gold mask as a special treat for my friends. I was so very disappointed. They fit very poorly, I had trouble keeping it on my face and it slid down and completely missed my nose, an area I especially want  to cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;It was too easy to remove- as it had been sliding all over our faces so we finally just sat back in chairs for the required time. When we sat up it just slid off your face- no peeling required.&lt;br /&gt;But once we were done, none of us felt a bit of difference.  None of the tightening of skin you often feel after a mask, no silky feel  to the skin, no wonderfully clean feel.&lt;br /&gt;There is no price that would entice me to buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product result oriented.</li>
            <li> This mask is the best one out there!! I have tried different masks in the past and this one is by far the only one that makes my face look young and fresh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far and find it better or the same as my Sk11 masks which cost almost $15 per treatment.  Very happy to have found these.  They are thicker and easer to work with and the results are deep hydration and a flawless look for at least a couple of days. I will be getting more for gifts around the holidays.</li>
            <li> It feel so fresh I don&#x27;t see much difference yet but it feels very fresh and baby soft skin afterward</li>
            <li> This is a very wonderful product</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described. I left the mask on for a few hours or longer usually at night when I have time, then take it off my face and put it on my neck for an hour or so when I take it all the way off the face and neck look soo healthy and young and looks beautiful, glows even. And the masks smells great. Then if I have time ill put it in a hot bath and soak in it after a shower, makes my skin feel great, if I dont have time for a bath, ill put it back in the package til the next night for a bath. I still use face cream at night after using the mask to lock in that moisture!</li>
            <li> I have never bought a product as bogus as this one. Total waste of money. If you want to be fooled by a cheap face mask that doesn&#x27;t even work, doesn&#x27;t stay on your face and does nothing for you, then go ahead and buy it. The directions are horrendous, written by some ignorant person. What is HORRINESS?? Yes, the the directions say - it takes the giddiness away from your face. So disgusted by this product. I am definitely returning it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product. I would purchase again. I need to be more consistent with their use.</li>
            <li> Slippery, hard to place on your face, most the liquid stays in the plastic tray after you remove the mask.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I hoped, its cold on face and hard to place right but is good for the face</li>
            <li> It works beautifully! However I had to make the slits bigger over my clients mouth and eyes particularly for her eyelash extensions. I did not need to add any moisturizer on her face after and she had a beautiful glow after!</li>
            <li> I love it, after I used it, my skin was so soft. Very Happy with this purchased. I will recommend it!!</li>
            <li> When my wife was wearing the mask, I couldn&#x27;t decide if I was married to iron man or C3PO.  She seemed to like it</li>
            <li> Does wonders. Can&#x27;t believe it. The lines disappear. I have given these friends. They love them. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this 5-pc set.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice - it feels GREAT!  My skin is soft and radiant (I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s) after use.  Plus it provides a great &amp;#34;at home spa&amp;#34; opportunity to RELAX while I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say yep, try it out.  It does have excellent, nurturing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, It doesn&#x27;t erase 10 years off your face.  It does feel sooo nice and soothing tho, and it does help with softness and radiance for a few days afterward.  So in the long run, it&#x27;s beneficial since anytime you&#x27;re adding nutrition for the skin, well... it only helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d try it, it&#x27;s worth it!  (compare prices between Amazon &amp; eBay because they do vary)</li>
            <li> Wow this is an excellent mask. Let me start by saying I used this once few hours before I went night out, after removing the mask my face looked so great I just couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how great of a product it is. My face has a instant glow, smooth, and soft to touch. I&#x27;m so in love with it. I put it on my face 4pm and removed  after 8pm. Great instant result. It&#x27;s decent prize but I think it worth it. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Would I order this again no not, up to my expectations! Cheap price not very effective. You get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT AND AM ORDERING A YEARS WORTH, AND WILL SHARE ONE TO SEVERAL FRIENDS.</li>
            <li> still using these, made my face real soft too</li>
            <li> It really whitens your facial skin and makes it soft. You will look like an ironman with this mask on by the way. Gentle soft gel texture sticks to you face quite well and you can move around without any problems of the mask falling off of your face.</li>
            <li> Liked it ok but the mask is a lite to gummy, feels like it could tear easily, prefer the cotton type mask.</li>
            <li> nice effect but need several uses to see it</li>
            <li> I have used twice now. The mask seems to clarify and smooth top of skin, not sure what benefits are occurring beneath the skin.</li>
            <li> These facial masks are fabulous! I started out just using the eye masks and was so impressed with the results, I had to try the full face masks. They leave your skin feeling fresh, softened and moisturized. My skin always has that &#x27;glow&#x27; every time I apply a mask. They are a great pick me up after a long stressful day or just a fast way to look vibrant before you go out on a date! I highly recommend these masks to every girl out there. These are a great alternative to the much more expensive brands out there, and they work just as well.</li>
            <li> I recommed this mask everyone. Such a great product</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, soothing and cooling. My skin was much softer after my first use, I&#x27;m currently doing one per week.  Stays in place best if it is applied and used while lying down, but I gave used it while cleaning house as well. Something I will continue to yes.</li>
            <li> Never buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Just water! Waste my money.</li>
            <li> I love it and I order 5 times :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I tried them and they are great!  I purchased these as an after peel mask..I burned  my skin a little from the peel and these were a great relief.  Very easy to use .  I like d the way my skin felt after</li>
            <li> I like this, I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Be careful they melt in the warmer. I put mine in there pulled it out to use on a client and it was melted.</li>
            <li> I used the mask last night, and I have to admit, it felt pretty darn good.  Very refreshing and relaxing.  It does leave my skin soft and looking refreshed.  It does smell like Rose Water, but I like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I work in a large dealership with a lot of men.  Today the General Sales Manager stopped me and told me that I look more refreshed than I had in the past.  I thought, &amp;#34;okay, something&#x27;s working!!&amp;#34;.  I have only used one mask to date, but I already ordered another package.  I do not want to run out of these.&lt;br /&gt;There is quite  a bit of leftover liquid in the package after you take out the mask.  Put as much as you like on the mask AFTER you have applied it to your face.  After I was done with the mask, I used the remainder of the liquid and applied it all over my face, especially around my lips and eyes and my chest area.  I then did my usual night time ritual.  Wash your face before you apply the mask for best results.</li>
            <li> I had a spa party every guest had this mask,  we all looked like iron man, it was a fun time. the mask did plump up the skin people were surprised. plan on doing it again.</li>
            <li> interesting. its smells like rose water and it is cold and it is nice to use as a compress.. but i dont really see the benefits other than that.</li>
            <li> Wooow! I surprised with that reasult! I love use it every week!</li>
            <li> it is a interesting concept</li>
            <li> wow~ it was some kinda magic. after you use this mask, you can see how your face is better. I love it . and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> NOTICE RESULTS BUT THE THING DOES NOT STAY ON YOUR FACE. NOT SURE IF WORTH BUYING. CAN&#x27;T GET FULL USE BECAUSE IT SLIDES OFF. FACE DID LOOK BRIGHTER.</li>
            <li> This product is great for making your face look youthful and tighter. I have used them a few times in the past with favorable results for the cost. But note that the youthful look is temporary...maybe 2-3 weeks per mask. Great to use if you have a special event approaching. But again, good for the money. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is my favorite. It works amazingly. Wrinkle disappeared in 30 minutes!!! I will bight more.</li>
            <li> I just use, but I like it.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting, I love these</li>
            <li> Oh yeah this was good</li>
            <li> I go the the spa on a regular basis...because of my busy schedule nowadays... I just couldnt find the time and then I stumble upon this great product been using it for several weeks and I&#x27;m glad I found it...not only does it saves me time and money...but it really does the job of keeping my facial skin feels clean, softer, tight with less visible lines and pores...I also noticed that  it works better after a  taking a shower and a mild moisturizer after applying....love love love it!!</li>
            <li> This product really makes you feel like fresh , shiny and light. I woud recommend  everybody to try at least once, and people you would love to use it forever.</li>
            <li> real 24k gold bio collagen facial mask&lt;br /&gt;LOTS OF COLLAGEN !!!!</li>
            <li> I use paper facial mask all the time. This mask is kind of heavy and slippery, you will need to lay flat when use it.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the result is the same with paper mask and I could not tell much difference other than the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely provides a glow. Buy and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> i just want everybody know i love this product .my skin looks amazing smooth and i want to keep using this forever.thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> So relaxing and quite a good value.  My facialist charges A FORTUNE for this exact product.  Tightens my skin right up and I feel like a million dollars after 15 minutes with this.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It&#x27;s easy to apply, nor pretty to see for your significant other, but our skin is significantly smoother and more elastic after keeping it on for 30 minutes. It also cools down any feeling of irritation (I have a very sensitive skin). I felt 10 years young after removing the mask, the wrinkles were noticeably reduced.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mask to use on my face for a fun day gift to myself. I found this product while searching and decided to go ahead and purchase. I was a little skeptical at first, but decided to go for it because the price was marked down. I am so glad i did. I love love love this item. I used it and found that my skin looked more vitalized and younger. I would definitely suggest this product to others and I am getting more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> This is extremely messy and not worth it. Go with another type of mask. Don&#x27;t even try to take it out flat, the way it is packaged. Just scrunch it up so you can mix it into the collagen that collects at the bottom of the package. If not, you basically get a damp piece of plastic on your face. Since it&#x27;s thick, you can&#x27;t scoop the collagen and try to put it onto the mask as the mask is non-absorbable. Also, the fit is off, and I have an average size face. It doesn&#x27;t reach to the ears, yet the portion below the nose and above the lip has extra material that just hangs there. It is hard to form to your face - it just doesn&#x27;t stay. I have tried many masks and this is definitely one I would not recommend. Doesn&#x27;t do much. The only saving grace for me was that I used the extra collagen on my hands right before I put my keratin gloves on. A waste of money. Go with the cheaper and thinner masks where at least the extra collagen can be used over the mask and it penetrates.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order again. I&#x27;m not sure if there is real gold in what amount but when I rub my fingers on the mask I can see the gold/glittery dust. I have a very sensitive skin and acne prone but this hasn&#x27;t given me any bad reaction, I think it actually help cleared my skin up. I also notice it helps with sun damage.. I notice my skin is much brighter after using this. I suggest using this with a derma roller or a deep exfoliation before applying.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, because I love finding great home spa treatments that really work. But, this didn&#x27;t have the effect I was hoping for. It has a very perfumey smell that didn&#x27;t appeal to me. The mask does fit well over the face and stays put, but after a few minutes I took it off and my face was red and splotchy in places. The redness did disappear quickly, but I felt it wasn&#x27;t the right facial mask for me. Made me curious what the ingredients are the packaging doesn&#x27;t say. I am older, with mature skin. I am sticking to natural and organic products for my face after this.</li>
            <li> Did not meet the expectation</li>
            <li> Like it very much.....use it on regular basis&lt;br /&gt;Eyebpads are great and I use it as needed in the mornings</li>
            <li> i really like it after using this product. delivery is on time. good customer services. I will buy this product for the next time</li>
            <li> Wow good product !!! Help hydrate the skin !!!</li>
            <li> My Chinese girlfriend loved this product.  I will be ordering more this month.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t purchased again..... not much improve on my skin!!</li>
            <li> This product is so awesome!  I usually get professional facials and purchase high end products.  With this it works perfectly.  When I used it the first time. My husband that never notices anything, &amp;#34; told me that my face looked so smooth and refreshed&amp;#34; . I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best products i ever bought.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m not sure what this mask will do longterm but when I use it my skin looks brighter and tighter and smells of rosewater. So basically it&#x27;s a relaxing delightful treat of a mask that I&#x27;ve been using after I give myself microdermabrasion because it&#x27;s very gentle......and just maybe I will look 33 after all five treatments, who knows!</li>
            <li> Great product!  My skin looks brighter and the dark spots start to fade.  For best results, I&#x27;ve used the mask every other day.</li>
            <li> After I used it for the first time, i felt in love with it. My face is so moist and soft. specially in this weather (winter), my face is usually dry, but i found the solution to that. I would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> just water with a nice scent. After 5 uses I can&#x27;t report any improvement from it.</li>
            <li> I can see and feel the difference of my skin after I&#x27;ve started to use this mask. Very happy with the result. Skin gets looking younger. Will recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely incredible element - it makes your entire face look 20 years younger when you take it off.  Will use it forever!!!</li>
            <li> Liked the product very much.  My skin feels more hydrated after using it and my skin looks glowing and dewy.</li>
            <li> I loved the face look ,so radiant</li>
            <li> Save your money, this mask does absolutely nothing. I didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34; glow &amp;#34; people refer too. My skin didn&#x27;t feel more moisturized than normal.. you can find something way less expensive that works better!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed. I have only used it once and I noticed a substantial improvement in my skin tone after one use!  Not a shill here.  Just a happy customer.  It made my skin feel denser. Plump and smooth and radiant.  Shipping time was as stated. Packaging secure.</li>
            <li> Love it will buy more!</li>
            <li> .A+++ product. As described and shown in photo. Bravo.</li>
            <li> Love this product for collagen treatment</li>
            <li> was charged for two and ordered only one, what a ripoff!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes</li>
            <li> Nice mosturizing mask, if you have an oily skin look for another one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel my face moisturized after this mask...</li>
            <li> good mask,but no cheap</li>
            <li> I have used this mask and I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon (was cheaper also) but i digress..This product truly does work. Last nite a did another beauty facial using the Dermaroller and placed this mask on my face and Wow my skin and face looked so good. I did keep it on my face longer than 30 minutes watching reality TV. I have under eye puffiness but not bags it is more on my cheek bone and it drives me crazy. It was noticeably smaller after removing the mask and m skin is so bright and smooth. Not that it matters but I am African American with pretty ok skin but wanted to beat the aging clock so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped. Since I didn&#x27;t by here I am posting the review under any vendor so people will know how good this product really is.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. Did not see outstanding results. Just feels good when you apply it on your face, no improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin and my face is tired these days due to several issues. I was quite depressed about how my face and my skin look like. I was looking for something that refreshing my facial skin and make me look bright. I have read about this mask and I decided to use it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have used it once and I was really surprised about the terrific result that I have seen and felt. From the first time my skin bright and it is whiter than before. I feel I have clean and fresh skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I do recommend this product for you especially if you suffer from tired skin. I am totally satisfied and I will use it over and over again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I tried it for the first time and it left my skin looking radiant, soft and bright. I used it after a microdermabrasion session and saw amazing results. Will definitely be buying more of these when I run out. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I understand that nothing is going to give me 20 year old skin again (I&#x27;m 50). However, this product made my skin look and feel great. I have used it twice now. I was so impressed after the first use that I ordered more! Oh, and I&#x27;m a real person. It evened out my skin tone , softened/filled the fine lines on my face around my eyes and mouth, and even seemed to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; the upper lids, giving my face a more youthful look. It had a wonderful cooling effect. It was easy to use, though a little messy the first time, before I knew what I was dealing with. The mask is a little bit slippery. Overall I give this product 5 stars. I would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Very slippery. It starts to fall apart. It&#x27;s also very watery!</li>
            <li> Came quickly, I have only used in once but felt great after using the derma roller!</li>
            <li> The product itself worked great. Skin felt smooth and soft, with less noticeable pores immediately after application.  Just hard to keep on your face and apply the mask without ripping it.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a bit sloppy at first, but laying back with it on is very relaxing and my face feels so soft! Going to get some for my mom; I know she&#x27;ll love them!</li>
            <li> Good item and ok packaging. One of the mask leaked and was not usable.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Too bad is a little pricey for me.</li>
            <li> It felt like a waste money</li>
            <li> Hydrates my face and my skins feels so soft and plump looking after I get done wearing the mask. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> You can tell instantly.  Wrinkles disapear</li>
            <li> Love this mask!  It delivers exactly what it promises.  For First use, I left it on all night.  Next day, my skin was a few shades brighter, had a glow and appeared plumped up (less wrinkles).  I reused the mask again and saw benefits again.  I will be sticking to this mask worth the money.  Forget about the $40 masks they cannot even compete!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a word of caution, when you try to remove the plastic tray the mask may slip back in the pack.  Do not try to make the mask slip out from the open end by shaking the pack or else, all the liquid will fall out.  You need the liquid to reapply over mask.</li>
            <li> Product leaves skin feeling fresh &amp; moisturized. Great fix for dry skin.</li>
