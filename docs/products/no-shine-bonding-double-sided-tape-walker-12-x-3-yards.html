    <ol>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Good product!!</li>
            <li>Best tape I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Held in the tape extensions excellent.</li>
            <li>Not the best tape, but it does the job--Hard to handle when trying to make it work.</li>
            <li>Happy I purchased!</li>
            <li>Happy with the experience all around!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I heard great things about this tape, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for taping your strapless dress to you to help keep it up</li>
            <li>and they held up nicely!</li>
            <li>This tape sticks so good.</li>
            <li>Its a good alternative to glue because the removal of the bond is easier.</li>
            <li>Works almost too good.</li>
            <li>When removing the tape make sure to use an oil or conditioner!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own any lace front wigs, so I cannot vouch for the transparency and no shine tech.</li>
            <li>once hair is stuck to it, its stuck, so unless you&#x27;ve mastered the art of creating your own tape extensions, get help with the preparation and installation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i wanted a tape that I could use on my own, if I had an issue with one of them falling out.  </li>
            <li>this stuff holds like super glue  its great.</li>
            <li>The tape is very strong.</li>
            <li>The best bonding tape I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>The tape is a strong adhesive, so I recommend not doing this on your own...</li>
            <li>This tape is super super strong very good.</li>
            <li>Great shipped fast no problems</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>works great does not leave as much sticky residue like the pro tape.</li>
            <li>I have had an enjoyable experience with this.</li>
            <li>The original packaging was even scotch taped over!</li>
            <li>luv it..... easy to use on my clip in Hair extensions....</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply on and take off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t wash that often because it is more comfortable than clip ins and almost as quick.</li>
            <li>the 1 inch is fine</li>
            <li>She is very satisfied and so far has not lost any more hearing aids.</li>
            <li>so I guess that&#x27;s the important part.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>The original order was for 1/2 inch tape.</li>
            <li>It really does the job of holding what you need with your hair together and is comfortable!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to get out too...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hold up to first shampoo!</li>
            <li>Very effective in keeping my implant hearing aids firmly in place.</li>
            <li>Falls right off..</li>
            <li>or it will slide right off.</li>
            <li>Works great on African American hair!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It slips after 4 or 5 days even securing with hot iron.</li>
            <li>And you have to go thru the whole bonding remover because of the junk!</li>
            <li>i will buy more next time to stock uo</li>
            <li>This is the first bonding tape I&#x27;ve used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to another</li>
            <li>product worked exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>I have hot head extensions in</li>
            <li>I did not wash for 24 hours after installing, as that is what my stylist says with hot head tape.  </li>
            <li>Hair ripped out / slid out of this after first wash.</li>
            <li>My first time applying tape to my extensions I used tabs, but they aren&#x27;t practical for my use.</li>
            <li>Got it really fast.  </li>
            <li>Yeah it stickes really well almost to well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t appear to damage real hair at all.</li>
            <li>The tape holds all day, and in my experience, you can reset the tape with some gentle peeling.</li>
            <li>Holds really well but does shine, looks like plastic.</li>
            <li>When removing your tape ins this tape is really sticky and leaves a bit of residue.</li>
            <li>doesnt stick very well.</li>
            <li>The seller did not have that in Stock and very graciously emailed to give me the choice to wait or accept the 3/8 width.</li>
            <li>Once done, though, it really had a lot of stick.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair daily and have very fine and short hair.  </li>
            <li>it was kind of small.</li>
            <li>Stuck my hair decently, had to use heat though.</li>
            <li>I pulled on tugged the hair and the tape held steady.</li>
            <li>I use it with my GoPro cameras and I&#x27;m able to place my cameras and locations not normally accessible because you have to use a clamp</li>
            <li>I love the long lasting wear of tape extensions with this tape!</li>
            <li>Make sure if you have long nails to ask someone with short nails to help you peel off the unsticky side.</li>
            <li>This roll must have been old!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>But it really does keep my extensions in for a long time</li>
            <li>Was very confused on how to use at first, but once I got it, it was easy.</li>
            <li>Make sure if you are using this with extensions you don&#x27;t get them wet for at least 3 days</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Definitely use the flat iron to bond it once you have it where you want it</li>
            <li> And it keeps my frontals flat.</li>
            <li> So far, its been a week and it is in tight.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it lasts as long as it says but I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Price doesn&#x27;t matter if I spent more money and time and energy putting in to be a FAIL!</li>
            <li> This held the bonds well with minor slipping.</li>
            <li> I recommend the second size down.</li>
            <li> I washed the hair with the tape about 2 days later and it was still tightly gripped in my hair.</li>
            <li> It was a bit too wide for my hair tape extensions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this over any other tape</li>
            <li> No tug or pulling affect with this tape and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> just use a little olive or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> However, it is very hard to peel back the liner.</li>
            <li> it was waste of money.</li>
            <li> hard to use</li>
            <li> I had a hard time separating the sticky part from the plastic.  </li>
            <li> I use it for tape in hair extensions and it lasts at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> It even takes the hair too, and a little difficult to remove from my hair.</li>
            <li> A little difficult for me to use.  </li>
            <li> I have oily hair to begin with, but still disappointing since I spent $200 on the hair and had a pro install it for $150.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to peel the backing off.</li>
            <li> but I got tired of the hair and wanted to change it out.</li>
            <li> Not happy I ordered</li>
            <li> My wife uses the tape to keep&amp;#34; her behind the ear&amp;#34; hearing aids in place.</li>
            <li> I use this product often &amp; have noticed dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very effective in keeping my implant hearing aids firmly in place.</li>
            <li> The best bonding tape I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> The tape is very strong. Held the hair in placed for days. i could have left it on longer but I got tired of the hair and wanted to change it out.</li>
            <li> I use it with my GoPro cameras and I&#x27;m able to place my cameras and locations not normally accessible because you have to use a clamp</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Works great! Made Tape in extensions and they held up nicely!</li>
            <li> Got it really fast.  Was exactly as described. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Stuck my hair decently, had to use heat though. Didn&#x27;t stick well with extensions.</li>
            <li> Yeah it stickes really well almost to well. It even takes the hair too, and a little difficult to remove from my hair. Good product!!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stay in my bleached hair through one washing. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t wash that often because it is more comfortable than clip ins and almost as quick. It slips after 4 or 5 days even securing with hot iron. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair?</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair for tape in extensions and it held fantastically for about 7 weeks. I washed the hair with the tape about 2 days later and it was still tightly gripped in my hair. I let it air dry. I pulled on tugged the hair and the tape held steady. Best tape I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried about 20 different kinds....</li>
            <li> This tape sticks so good. I use it for tape in hair extensions and it lasts at least 6 weeks. Would last longer, but I don&#x27;t like when they start dropping from my hair growing. It&#x27;s pretty easy to get out too...just use a little olive or coconut oil. Doesn&#x27;t appear to damage real hair at all.</li>
            <li> It was a bit too wide for my hair tape extensions. I recommend the second size down.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. The tape holds all day, and in my experience, you can reset the tape with some gentle peeling. I don&#x27;t own any lace front wigs, so I cannot vouch for the transparency and no shine tech. :C</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! Didn&#x27;t hold up to first shampoo! And you have to go thru the whole bonding remover because of the junk! This roll must have been old! The original packaging was even scotch taped over! I will not buy from them again! Price doesn&#x27;t matter if I spent more money and time and energy putting in to be a FAIL!</li>
            <li> luv it..... easy to use on my clip in Hair extensions.... i will buy more next time to stock uo</li>
            <li> Great product. Held in the tape extensions excellent. It&#x27;s all I will use. I love the long lasting wear of tape extensions with this tape! Easer to work with!</li>
            <li> I Boughy tape from Sally&#x27;s. It did not work well. This held the bonds well with minor slipping. I&#x27;d recommend this over any other tape</li>
            <li> This is the first bonding tape I&#x27;ve used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product worked exactly as it should. I used it on Locks and Bonds hair wefts  (they were clip-ins, I removed the clips). Realistically,the tape keeps your extension in for about 4 weeks if you take care of it. Its a good alternative to glue because the removal of the bond is easier. The tape is a strong adhesive, so I recommend not doing this on your own...once hair is stuck to it, its stuck, so unless you&#x27;ve mastered the art of creating your own tape extensions, get help with the preparation and installation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great adhesive&lt;br /&gt;Simple product, does what it says it will&lt;br /&gt;Great price</li>
            <li> This tape works wonders. It holds in place. And it keeps my frontals flat.</li>
            <li> Great shipped fast no problems</li>
            <li> Falls right off.. the 1 inch is fine this is no good&lt;br /&gt; I doubled this up because the 1 inch was out of stock..waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not happy I ordered three tape only recieved two .</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply on and take off.  Works like what it said it would and last okay.  I will be using this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised.  I read TONS of reviews on different tapes.  I have hot head extensions in and i wanted a tape that I could use on my own, if I had an issue with one of them falling out.  So far, its been a week and it is in tight.  I wash my hair daily and have very fine and short hair.  Definitely use the flat iron to bond it once you have it where you want it and I washed my hair with blue dawn prior to installing.  I did not wash for 24 hours after installing, as that is what my stylist says with hot head tape.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this tape, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Hair ripped out / slid out of this after first wash. I have oily hair to begin with, but still disappointing since I spent $200 on the hair and had a pro install it for $150. I may use this tape for wigs in the future, but never doing tape in extensions again.</li>
            <li> Not the best tape, but it does the job--Hard to handle when trying to make it work.</li>
            <li> My wife uses the tape to keep&amp;#34; her behind the ear&amp;#34; hearing aids in place. She is very satisfied and so far has not lost any more hearing aids.</li>
            <li> this stuff holds like super glue  its great. nothing fell out</li>
            <li> Tape is a lot smaller than I thought but it gets the job done. However, it is very hard to peel back the liner. Make sure if you are using this with extensions you don&#x27;t get them wet for at least 3 days or it will slide right off.</li>
            <li> Was very confused on how to use at first, but once I got it, it was easy. Make sure if you have long nails to ask someone with short nails to help you peel off the unsticky side.</li>
            <li> Holds really well but does shine, looks like plastic. Looking for another bonding tape that doesn&#x27;t shine. I would buy again for the hold.</li>
            <li> The tape did not hold at all.It&#x27;s very hard to peel the backing off.I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it lasts as long as it says but I will be buying again! When removing your tape ins this tape is really sticky and leaves a bit of residue.</li>
            <li> Works great on African American hair! Does not pull out hair at all if removed properly and can be used to keep that lace or silk based closure in place! When removing the tape make sure to use an oil or conditioner! Do not try to take it out without using some sort of product with slip! It really does the job of holding what you need with your hair together and is comfortable! No tug or pulling affect with this tape and a little goes a long way! Happy I purchased!</li>
            <li> hard to use doesnt stick very well.</li>
            <li> it did not stick . it was kind of small. it was waste of money. you should not buy this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for taping your strapless dress to you to help keep it up</li>
            <li> I use this product often &amp; have noticed dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Works almost too good. This damn stuff stays in your hair FOREVER. It&#x27;s a bitch to get out. But it really does keep my extensions in for a long time so I guess that&#x27;s the important part.</li>
            <li> works great does not leave as much sticky residue like the pro tape.</li>
            <li> I have had an enjoyable experience with this. My first time applying tape to my extensions I used tabs, but they aren&#x27;t practical for my use. The original order was for 1/2 inch tape. The seller did not have that in Stock and very graciously emailed to give me the choice to wait or accept the 3/8 width. Happy with the experience all around!</li>
            <li> I did NOT expect this to work on my front lace. I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This tape worked well with the bulk hair I bought to make tape-in hair extensions. But it did seem to lose it&#x27;s stickiness after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> A little difficult for me to use.  I had a hard time separating the sticky part from the plastic.  Once done, though, it really had a lot of stick.</li>
            <li> This tape is super super strong very good. Tape will order again</li>
