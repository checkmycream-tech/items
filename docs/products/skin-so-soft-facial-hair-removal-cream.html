            <li>This product is awesome</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything wonderful about this product</li>
            <li>It worked great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Love it, works great!  </li>
            <li>This product does a good job of removing hair and my skin was not irritated by it.</li>
            <li>it came in so quick with this awesome seller and the product leaves you hairless and smooth the tube</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I think this is the perfect facial hair remover!</li>
            <li>No burns and most of all no irritation.</li>
            <li>DO A SPOT CHECK FIRST!!!  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it removes all of my fine blonde hair no problem!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but experienced no issues with this product.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Huge swollen craters on skin as well.</li>
            <li>so great finally product that I can stick with because it does what it should!!!!!!</li>
            <li>But if you follow instructions you get a smooth, hair free face without a lot of fuss and bother.</li>
            <li>what I did before applying the product was adding a light coat of Vaseline to my skin then applying the cream</li>
            <li>1oz doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot</li>
            <li>After that I was brave enough to try it on some bothersome hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li>It irritated my skin, didn&#x27;t do a good job of removing hair, and hair grew back more quickly than when I used products like Nair.</li>
            <li>; line has such a long-standing reputation for being mild and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Okay so I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Therefore this product is just okay, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li>The tube is small but it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>It left my sideburn area very smooth.</li>
            <li>So glad I got this, My tube will last me forever.</li>
            <li>I should had have done a spot check first</li>
            <li>Also the delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing more unfeminine than than a woman having facial hair.</li>
            <li>If it would be a little thinner, it would spread more easily.</li>
            <li>I also have fine blonde hair I was trying to tackle.</li>
            <li>This works really really well</li>
            <li>He said, &amp;#34;Mom, you really should do something about it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Avon.</li>
            <li>When I purchase this item, I really thought it was a normal size depilatory shaving cream for men.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and did not leave&lt;br /&gt;it on a minute later.</li>
            <li>If you gonna advertise a facial hair removing product, you should be more specific as to which hair from the face this tiny tube will cover.</li>
            <li>I have average skin, aging but still smooth.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it on my sideburns and left it on about 2 1/2 min.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate even the delicate skin of a 5 year old but strong enuf to do the job and remove all unwanted hair after just 5 min!</li>
            <li>Lately I have noticed more peach fuzz on my face than I used to have.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive and acne proned skin.</li>
            <li>I took a wet paper towel and it came right off.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because my son was the first to point out that my once barely noticeable hair above my upper lip was now noticeable.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to put on a thick layer!</li>
            <li>I was self conscious about without any of the red blotches.</li>
            <li>, I was a little nervous to try it at first .</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin, did not leave red irritated skin like other products.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave in on too long for sensitive skin areas.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Gentle on the skin, did not leave red irritated skin like other products.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave in on too long for sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li> but it actually lasts A very long time.</li>
            <li> You must be careful not to leave it on longer than recommended,  </li>
            <li> It does its job just like any of the other competitors.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t have high</li>
            <li> and it got all the little hairs</li>
            <li> but I did not experience any burning or even a little rash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little skeptical about getting this because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> is thin but will last awhile&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff works well in removing facial hair without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> This quantity is way Too small Too little.</li>
            <li> It is usually a bit numbat to the touch for a few hours, but no pain.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really say anything bad.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom, but she never used it because she couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I mean something that would at least give me 3 shaving use.</li>
            <li> It did not remove the facial hair and it had a awful smell.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would burn my skin.</li>
            <li> :c worked for my sister but not me</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad!</li>

            <li> This works really really well, I was a little nervous to try it at first . Would it sting or cause redness or cause a rash.&lt;br /&gt;Well none of that. Very gentle. I wondered if it was even working, but it did! I followed the directions exactly and did not leave&lt;br /&gt;it on a minute later. I ordered it because my son was the first to point out that my once barely noticeable hair above my upper lip was now noticeable. He said, &amp;#34;Mom, you really should do something about it. No ignoring or pretending that middle age is now working on me. So glad I got this, My tube will last me forever. Thanks Avon.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great!  Don&#x27;t leave in on too long for sensitive skin areas.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome it came in so quick with this awesome seller and the product leaves you hairless and smooth the tube is thin but will last awhile&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;Its so great finally product that I can stick with because it does what it should!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hair was definitely gone, but the aftermath was it left my skin irritated, red and splotches allll over. Huge swollen craters on skin as well. :c worked for my sister but not me... darn.</li>
            <li> DO A SPOT CHECK FIRST!!!  Follow manufactures recommendations.... I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin but it burnt my face all over.... I put it on, then wiped it off immediatly....Who knows, it could just be my skin....I should had have done a spot check first so I would have known how my skin would react....Please do what they recommend, SPOT CHECK!</li>
            <li> When I purchase this item, I really thought it was a normal size depilatory shaving cream for men. I mean something that would at least give me 3 shaving use. Instead it was just a tiny tube not even enough to shave one side of my face. I was very disappointed with the quantity.  If you gonna advertise a facial hair removing product, you should be more specific as to which hair from the face this tiny tube will cover. whether its an eyebrow or just the moustache because this definitely cannot remove hair on the face from sideburn to the beard section of the face. This quantity is way Too small Too little.</li>
            <li> It does the job with no pain but it still makes facial hair thicken, if you don&#x27;t want thicker hair on your face you should probably go for waxing.</li>
            <li> I have average skin, aging but still smooth.  Lately I have noticed more peach fuzz on my face than I used to have.  This stuff works well in removing facial hair without irritating my skin.  You must be careful not to leave it on longer than recommended,  But if you follow instructions you get a smooth, hair free face without a lot of fuss and bother.</li>
            <li> Okay so I have really sensitive skin but this stuff did not irritate my skin one bit. what I did before applying the product was adding a light coat of Vaseline to my skin then applying the cream and it got all the little hairs I was self conscious about without any of the red blotches. Also the delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> This product does not work in taking off the hair on your face.  Does nothing to eliminate the hair on your face</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t an outstanding product. It does its job just like any of the other competitors. I can&#x27;t say anything wonderful about this product but I can&#x27;t really say anything bad. Therefore this product is just okay, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Skin So Soft&amp;#34; line has such a long-standing reputation for being mild and perfect for sensitive skin. But I&#x27;ve never had luck. And this was no different. It irritated my skin, didn&#x27;t do a good job of removing hair, and hair grew back more quickly than when I used products like Nair. Also, this is a tiny quantity to sell for the price.</li>
            <li> I think this is the perfect facial hair remover! 1oz doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot but it actually lasts A very long time. I use for my upper lip and between my daughters eyebrows. Gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate even the delicate skin of a 5 year old but strong enuf to do the job and remove all unwanted hair after just 5 min!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more unfeminine than than a woman having facial hair. It&#x27;s embarrassing and women just want it GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical about getting this because my skin is so sensitive. I was afraid that it would burn my skin. I was pleasantly surprised. The first time I tried it on my sideburns and left it on about 2 1/2 min. Some of the hair came off but the remaining hair was still obvious.  I tried another 2 1/2 min. and the remaining hair was gone. I then learned that 5 mins is my limit and will remove all of my unwanted hair. It left my sideburn area very smooth. No burns and most of all no irritation. After that I was brave enough to try it on some bothersome hairs on my neck.  This time I left it on for 5 mins.  I took a wet paper towel and it came right off. I&#x27;m a believer and I plan to order another tube. The tube is small but it&#x27;s very effective. My only pet peeve is that this product needs to be sold in a larger tube.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job of removing hair and my skin was not irritated by it. If it would be a little thinner, it would spread more easily. I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This item did not work well for me.  It did not remove the facial hair and it had a awful smell.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It worked great! Doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad! Just make sure to put on a thick layer! I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Gentle on the skin, did not leave red irritated skin like other products.  Fast and easy to use.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive and acne proned skin. I also have fine blonde hair I was trying to tackle. Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes- but I did not experience any burning or even a little rash. It is usually a bit numbat to the touch for a few hours, but no pain.  The best part is that it removes all of my fine blonde hair no problem! I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and price!</li>
            <li> Works fine. I have sensitive skin but experienced no issues with this product.  I do recommend it for its stated purpose.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom, but she never used it because she couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
