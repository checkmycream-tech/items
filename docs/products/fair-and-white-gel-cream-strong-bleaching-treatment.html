            <li>and if you want follow me on twitter @travisisbeast23 :)</li>
            <li>So make sure you try it on your arm before applying it your face.</li>
            <li>so happy!i&#x27;m more confident wearing sleevless tops now.i</li>
            <li>so please,before throwing the stone at people using products with hydroquinone,come up with a better product/solution and value.that will be appreciated,i&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>It took a week for it to start lightening my scars and now my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and it does what it is suppose to, lightens your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used the gel off and on (most days of the week</li>
            <li>I stongly recommend this item, easy to use and perfect especially for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>Let me say I have the DARKEST of dark circles, so I thought I would be perfect to use this product.</li>
            <li>and i can see a huge difference to my face.</li>
            <li>I am of Afican descent with light skin</li>
            <li>Significant improvement to my skin....</li>
            <li>The cream&#x27;s reaction is probably unique to one&#x27;s skin type and hormones.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Used as directed but had to discontinue after it significantly irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>Another bright side is it is not harsh on my skin at all, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>so I think it will take a couple more of this product to really see result.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 6 tubes (I think, give or take one) in conjunction with the Fair and White exfoliating soap.  </li>
            <li>I used this \\&quot;Fair &amp; White\\&quot; product and the third day</li>
            <li>(It can be very harmful to slap things on your skin that can damage it even more.)    </li>
            <li>B001773ZIO Fair &amp; White Gel Cream</li>
            <li>Fair &amp; White works and</li>
            <li>I just got another shipment of the creme because I go through it quickly</li>
            <li>I then decided to be bold and place it on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Most competitors have 2% or more for about the same price.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews I am hoping to see some really good results in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li>,I&#x27;m buying even more of it ,please dont stop selling this product for it is everything it claims to be and much much more,I&#x27;m sold,Thank-You very much.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I considered it was worth it to do it with this.</li>
            <li>Not even worth buying twice.</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the product was working on my face because it would feel warm, tingly, and look red.  </li>
            <li>(This is a French product; I&#x27;m guessing it worked better in France because its mostly a cool seasoned country).</li>
            <li>Good thing that I found a way to bring back the natural color of my skin, but it took a lot of work.</li>
            <li>Anyway,after about 3 months of using F&amp;W cream on my underarms,twice a day in the begining ( now i mostly use it mainly at night;it&#x27;s so hot where i live</li>
            <li>It does however, react funny with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than laser treatments!</li>
            <li>and i should be the first video.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>So happy I found something that can clear my dark spots in just two weeks.</li>
            <li>it looked like 3 tones darker than what it looked in the first place &#x3D;&#x27;</li>
            <li>First, let me just say, things happen.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to clear my armpits.</li>
            <li>and now i have a very dark forehead and everything else is light, but i have ordered some lactic acid and my doctor said it should make me look way better.</li>
            <li>well, thats pretty much it.</li>
            <li>The creme peeled my skin to reveal fresh new skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using it for three weeks eccept my skin is more dry.</li>
            <li>Strong Bleaching Treatment]]&lt;br /&gt;I got opposite result.</li>
            <li>First off, the main ingredient is 1.9% of hydroquinone  a carcinogen that can cause liver damage, cancer, etc).  </li>
            <li>so, i ordered this with very high hopes..</li>
            <li>, you just got to be careful about the climate and make sure you don&#x27;t get in the sun much.</li>
            <li>but i ended up with a very discolored face.</li>
            <li>but my forehead didnt bleach as much as my face did</li>
            <li>so when I have acne scars (as I do now) they really stand out.     </li>
            <li>If you have read my reviews, you know I keep it real.     </li>
            <li>I would say that this did not do much for me.</li>
            <li>The description needs to reveal that it is VERY GREASY, and doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin.</li>
            <li>Do not use this if you have acne prone skin because it is very oily.</li>
            <li>I used the gel around my eyes; it does work just after 3 weeks I noticed how my skin lighted up, but very oily.  </li>
            <li>every time I get a blemish, no matter how much I ignore it, I always end up with a scar.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had a lip allergy to some lip balm and while healing, my lips became much darker.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of heavy</li>
            <li>So I quit using it and bough the Fair and white Dark Spot remover</li>
            <li>but, then its like after that more dark spots started coming.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I used it and after 2 weeks I notice some dark spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li>all the dark spots are fading fast,I love this</li>
            <li>After the first night the lightening power was very noticeable the very next morning, it leaves the skin very even toned and radiant, got complements on my skin immediately and continue to do so.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The problem was that since it was a dark spot instead of disappearing the spot and blend it with my own skin tone it turned the spot white...</li>
            <li>Well, I started using this on my lips and within a week, my lips returned to their normal color or maybe even lighter.  </li>
            <li>but when it arrived I looked at the ingredients (it would do us all slot of good if the sellers would list the ingredients in their product description); after seeing that it only had a small amount of fading ingredient I immediately emailed the seller asking for a refund of the unused and unopened product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my legs</li>
            <li>can finally see real results,people!!my underarm skin is so much clearer!i&#x27;ve never wore tank tops so much in my adult</li>
            <li>Within the first 24 hrs, I noticed that my face looked a bit ashy, by the end of the second day, my face looked and felt like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>Not only didn&#x27;t it work but had a funny odor and gave me a rash.</li>
            <li>I also believe that \\&quot;strong bleaching treatment\\&quot; in the title is a little misleading.</li>
            <li>I never take the time to leave reviews but after using so many products to get rid of dark spots left by acne</li>
            <li>Your skin will peel a little, but a toner on a cotton ball will wipe away the peels to reveal smooth clearer skin.</li>
            <li>I began using the soap and the bleach creme to clear my face up.</li>
            <li>and I guess attacks my nerves/blood vessels directly under the skin.</li>
            <li>If you have extremely sensitive and non-oily  skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>( at least mine took more than a decade to get that bad)so be patient and persistent.   </li>
            <li>and my face is finally flawlesss thanks to this...</li>
            <li>Came early haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for me but the only problem was that it made my skin peel.</li>
            <li>I now was my face with Dudu Osun African Black Soap, use Nutiva Extra Virgin Coconut Oil as my moisturizer, then use the Fair and White Bleaching Treatment (creme) on my dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I though this might be a step to getting it lighter but, so far it still looks the same.</li>
            <li>Some of the spots have disappeared completely and others are obviously lighter.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to light up dark spots this product its not for you, use the dark spot remover.</li>
            <li>It has really helped to fade the dark spots on my face and even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m bringing this up because i&#x27;m not sure i would have obtained the same results,using F&amp;W cream directly without the previous action( with mild result)of the Likas soap....  </li>
            <li>My skin therapist was really pleased with the change on my face as the dark spots were all diminished, she did not have to work as hard on my face as before.  </li>

            <li> but, then its like after that more dark spots started coming.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I used it and after 2 weeks I notice some dark spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li> all the dark spots are fading fast,I love this</li>
            <li> After the first night the lightening power was very noticeable the very next morning, it leaves the skin very even toned and radiant, got complements on my skin immediately and continue to do so.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The problem was that since it was a dark spot instead of disappearing the spot and blend it with my own skin tone it turned the spot white...</li>
            <li> Well, I started using this on my lips and within a week, my lips returned to their normal color or maybe even lighter.  </li>
            <li> but when it arrived I looked at the ingredients (it would do us all slot of good if the sellers would list the ingredients in their product description); after seeing that it only had a small amount of fading ingredient I immediately emailed the seller asking for a refund of the unused and unopened product.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my legs</li>
            <li> can finally see real results,people!!my underarm skin is so much clearer!i&#x27;ve never wore tank tops so much in my adult</li>
            <li> Within the first 24 hrs, I noticed that my face looked a bit ashy, by the end of the second day, my face looked and felt like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> Not only didn&#x27;t it work but had a funny odor and gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> I also believe that \\&quot;strong bleaching treatment\\&quot; in the title is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> I never take the time to leave reviews but after using so many products to get rid of dark spots left by acne</li>
            <li> Your skin will peel a little, but a toner on a cotton ball will wipe away the peels to reveal smooth clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I began using the soap and the bleach creme to clear my face up.</li>
            <li> and I guess attacks my nerves/blood vessels directly under the skin.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely sensitive and non-oily  skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> ( at least mine took more than a decade to get that bad)so be patient and persistent.   </li>
            <li> and my face is finally flawlesss thanks to this...</li>
            <li> Came early haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for me but the only problem was that it made my skin peel.</li>
            <li> I now was my face with Dudu Osun African Black Soap, use Nutiva Extra Virgin Coconut Oil as my moisturizer, then use the Fair and White Bleaching Treatment (creme) on my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I though this might be a step to getting it lighter but, so far it still looks the same.</li>
            <li> Some of the spots have disappeared completely and others are obviously lighter.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking to light up dark spots this product its not for you, use the dark spot remover.</li>
            <li> It has really helped to fade the dark spots on my face and even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m bringing this up because i&#x27;m not sure i would have obtained the same results,using F&amp;W cream directly without the previous action( with mild result)of the Likas soap....  </li>
            <li> My skin therapist was really pleased with the change on my face as the dark spots were all diminished, she did not have to work as hard on my face as before.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t possibly see how that small amount of hydroquinone can do anything positive in lightening the skin.  </li>
            <li> This product works fast and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed one in particular is very dark</li>
            <li> I used Meladerm last time and it worked, but it took a long time.</li>
            <li> I read negative reviews but since it is topical and did not cost that much, I tried it anyway.</li>
            <li> i tried some more expensive products to solve my underarms problems like Makari,glutathione based products and some other stuff</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a cream which would even out my skin tone, and when I came across this product on this website, I overlooked the negative reviews  which I never do) and when straight to purchase.</li>
            <li> The tube is 2x smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> and they worked somewhat over a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> in the last 2 weeks using this product 2 twice a day as instructed i see great results... i have used other item before with no results -wasted money :( - ...</li>
            <li> i only used  one tube and it only lasted a week and a half if i contiued to use it my skin would of been lighter , during the one week i used it</li>
            <li> still have very little dark patches here and there in my armpits that are clearing up fast.i&#x27;m certain within a month or less,everything will be even.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it every day - only every other day when I took a shower in the evening.  </li>
            <li> That spot is now showing some dry skin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it works or not, but I see the area I applied become so dry</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, but the product was not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 1 week and already my dark spots are almost gone.  </li>
            <li> This cream has been the only thing to help the dark spots under my arms.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this because I used it for a month 2xs a day, and only saw average improvement.</li>
            <li> about 3 months;Likas soap did exfoliate the black skin off my armpits and they were looking a little clearer.i stopped because it appeared the soap action was now unnoticable and the soap was now burning me...</li>
            <li> It has been about a week, so I will come back in a few weeks and share the results.</li>
            <li> also,results WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT!!!it took long to get that dark</li>
            <li> i had spent hundreds of dollars trying to get rid of acne scaring</li>
            <li> but its not really buying if they just rob you, is it?</li>
            <li> I WILL send this back and get a refund before I even waste my time to use it.</li>
            <li> While using this cream in the winter my skin started to glow and my skinned actually lightened but as summer approached the cream made my skin feel sticky, slimy and I soon turned a little dark.</li>
            <li> This works,and so fast ,I was just amazed at how fast It works ,my skin was in bad shape and in less than two-weeks you should see my face now ,it&#x27;s lighter brither ,and smoother,and</li>
            <li> so I stopped using it due to eye irritation though I am still using the creme.  </li>
            <li> Buying another tube for other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> So please be advised it has extreme amount of oil in this product and being that I already have oily skin</li>
            <li> Later on in the evening my red cheeks became swollen , the following morning I developed a hard bump on each cheek where I had applied the cream it itches and burns like crazy.   </li>
            <li> It should be posted with the description that the active ingredient is HYDROQUINONE.</li>
            <li> Later on at work I noticed my cheeks started turning red, I immediately knew I had some sort of reaction to the the cream but didn&#x27;t expect for it to get worse.....</li>
            <li> so I try to use less because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The product started to work within seven days and took care of some of the dark spots around my face due to pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I am now using it on other spots or dark patches as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to resort to some other skin lightening product that has less than the 1.9% hydroquinone that this cream has in it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I can say i started seing fading with my dark spots within 2 weeks</li>
            <li> My marks were so dark that I still have scarring</li>
            <li> I also use this on my knees which are dark and scarred.  </li>
            <li> It ligthens the dark  spots on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brown-skinned African-American lady with extremely dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time and money.  </li>
            <li> Its a total WASTE of money!!</li>
            <li> the cream was delivered earlier than expected ..and it works so well, my scars lightened noticeably within a weak..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my experience is typical.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it could have not happen to me because I have used other skin lightners in the past.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my skin a little darker, but after the fifth day my skin where I was using this product looked dark brown</li>
            <li> i saw a few dark spots turn lighter.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight sting when applied for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Some of the spots on my face are fading a little.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy</li>
            <li> My elbows are very dark</li>
            <li> I have been using it dor over a month now and also on small dark spots on my legs which I got from mosquitos bites and once healed darkened the skin.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money in purchasing this item as I am allergic to this drug.</li>
            <li> I have ordered it from this company on a few occasions and had no problem with receiving my product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks on my face, arms, and underarms.  </li>
            <li> I thought I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the feeling this thing gave my face was too scary</li>
            <li> I will update you all in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was at work, so I wen to the pharmacy and picked up a tube of Cotizone 10 Plus, and it took a few hours, but the stinging stopped.   </li>
            <li> and i have several aged marks left by moquitoe bites &#x3D;(  </li>
            <li> But after I rubbed the it hard and removed the dead skin, it was lighter.</li>
            <li> and the tubes are rather small.</li>
            <li> no more blemishes</li>
            <li> I did not experience any redness there, instead it smoothed out some of the milia and dried out a small pimple that I could not get rid of before!</li>
            <li> I was vry suprised at all the negative comments about this product my friends</li>
            <li> it doesnt work at all or at least for me</li>
            <li> i was quite skeptical in the beginning but my overly dark underarms had me</li>
            <li> I will stick with this less expensive product from now on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put any at the back of my kness but that is where i had a bad reaction and the skin did not take a liking to the 1.9% hydroquinone.    </li>
            <li> the following morning after I received this terrible product I applied two dabs on the sides of my cheek where I had two dark spots.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s texture has not come back, and  my skin still looks completely horrible, and is dried up and feels like sandpaper, despite the fact that I&#x27;m drenching it with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It made my dark spots darker. :(</li>
            <li> now it can hardly be seenn!!</li>
            <li> My skin became extremely dry, and I had a very bad allergic reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> However despite the fail on my face and arms, the product did work on my underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a terrible bout with poison ivy last summer.  </li>
            <li> Very poor customer service, lacked kindness and understanding and did not care at all.    </li>
            <li> So, I decided to give this cream a try because it has hydroquinone (people who are mad about this containing hydroquinone should have read the ingredient list before buying it)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d be very wary of putting this product on your face.  </li>
            <li> I am very unhappy camper, and will not buy from this company again....</li>
            <li> What a horrible mistake that was.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and it broke my face out horribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> At this point it is an okay product.  It does have a slight sting when applied for a few seconds. I am of Afican descent with light skin so I think it will take a couple more of this product to really see result.  Some of the spots on my face are fading a little. I like the feel of this, not greasy, and there is on order. Will tell more in a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I can say i started seing fading with my dark spots within 2 weeks but, then its like after that more dark spots started coming. Its been a month now and thier hasn&#x27;t been any progress since.</li>
            <li> My elbows are very dark and I noticed one in particular is very dark so, I started to use this product on just 1 elbow. I have been using it dor over a month now and also on small dark spots on my legs which I got from mosquitos bites and once healed darkened the skin. I did not see a change in pigmentation in either area. Only thing I noticed is it would make the skin on my elbows peel. I though this might be a step to getting it lighter but, so far it still looks the same.</li>
            <li> OMG! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this stuff! I purchased 6 tubes (I think, give or take one) in conjunction with the Fair and White exfoliating soap.  The soap was great but not for me so I stopped using it due to eye irritation though I am still using the creme.  I just ordered more of the creme because I just ran out.  This is my story....&lt;br /&gt;I was suffering from severe acne breakouts and tried everything.  I began using the soap and the bleach creme to clear my face up. The creme peeled my skin to reveal fresh new skin.  My marks were so dark that I still have scarring but it is almost totally faded away.  I also use this on my knees which are dark and scarred.  I now was my face with Dudu Osun African Black Soap, use Nutiva Extra Virgin Coconut Oil as my moisturizer, then use the Fair and White Bleaching Treatment (creme) on my dark spots.  This has been working for me for over a month now and I have had wonderful results.  I am an African American woman who is prone to hyperpigmentation.  This has been the best regimen to date! I just got another shipment of the creme because I go through it quickly and the tubes are rather small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 1 week and already my dark spots are almost gone.  Some of the spots have disappeared completely and others are obviously lighter.  I was using Fashion Fair vanishing cream, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as this.  This product works fast and a little goes a long way.  Thanks for a wonderful product.  I will be a repeat customer!!</li>
            <li> This cream has been the only thing to help the dark spots under my arms. For the longest time i&#x27;ve been looking for something with this strength. Another bright side is it is not harsh on my skin at all, it is very gentle. Buying another tube for other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> This product contains hydroquinone. I wasted my money in purchasing this item as I am allergic to this drug. My eyes get all swollen the next morning after I use this product, as it penetrates the skin and I guess attacks my nerves/blood vessels directly under the skin. It should be posted with the description that the active ingredient is HYDROQUINONE.</li>
            <li> the following morning after I received this terrible product I applied two dabs on the sides of my cheek where I had two dark spots. Later on at work I noticed my cheeks started turning red, I immediately knew I had some sort of reaction to the the cream but didn&#x27;t expect for it to get worse..... Well it did. Later on in the evening my red cheeks became swollen , the following morning I developed a hard bump on each cheek where I had applied the cream it itches and burns like crazy.   I am now currently on day three experiencing the aftermath it is 6:21 am and i cant sleep. Please please think three times before buying this garbage.</li>
            <li> Significant improvement to my skin....It does NOT work within a week... you need to stick with it.  I have gotten rid of age spots on my face I have had for 10 years.....I look MUCH better.  It does however, react funny with sunscreen.  Wherever I had the bleach on my face, I got burned....so I don&#x27;t recommend using it and then going outside.  Much cheaper than laser treatments!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I used it and after 2 weeks I notice some dark spots getting lighter. This product goes on oily but wait 10 minutes and it will absorb in the skin. Your skin will peel a little, but a toner on a cotton ball will wipe away the peels to reveal smooth clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I was vry suprised at all the negative comments about this product my friends and I have been using it for over two years and have had nothing but excellent results. It ligthens the dark  spots on my face I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. I have ordered it from this company on a few occasions and had no problem with receiving my product. It came on time and I have nothing but good to say about the product and this company</li>
            <li> I am of east Indian descent and have a brown skin. I have been using this cream for almost 2 months now and i can see a huge difference to my face. It has become fairer. I love this product and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product I read from one customer that the cream worked better in the winter. She was right. While using this cream in the winter my skin started to glow and my skinned actually lightened but as summer approached the cream made my skin feel sticky, slimy and I soon turned a little dark. (This is a French product; I&#x27;m guessing it worked better in France because its mostly a cool seasoned country). Nevertheless, the product worked well, you just got to be careful about the climate and make sure you don&#x27;t get in the sun much. Try using an alternative in the summer!</li>
            <li> Glad to get into know this product. Been using 1 and 1/2 months and see the difference. As somebody mentioned, it interacts with sunblock cream and stretches your skin. I&#x27;m enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I never take the time to leave reviews but after using so many products to get rid of dark spots left by acne I considered it was worth it to do it with this. I applied this product at night before going to bed and i noticed the spots were lighter the morning after. I can definitely recommend it. SO HAPPY!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks on my face, arms, and underarms.  I didn&#x27;t use it every day - only every other day when I took a shower in the evening.  So i&#x27;d put it on that night and again in the morning.  At first, I thought the product was working on my face because it would feel warm, tingly, and look red.  Then I realized all those signs &#x3D; irritation.  My arms are a good 4 shades darker than the rest of my body so I used it on the darker side of my arms.  And I&#x27;m not too sure I&#x27;m seeing a difference.  However despite the fail on my face and arms, the product did work on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be very wary of putting this product on your face.  I thought I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the feeling this thing gave my face was too scary so I stopped after the 2nd time.</li>
            <li> so, i ordered this with very high hopes.. but i ended up with a very discolored face. so i used it as the directions said but my forehead didnt bleach as much as my face did and now i have a very dark forehead and everything else is light, but i have ordered some lactic acid and my doctor said it should make me look way better. well, thats pretty much it. if you want to see how my face looks i have a youtube channel. just look up trvaisloveseffingham and i should be the first video. please subscribe and share my videos with your friends and comment and tell me how you like em so i can know if i should make more or not. thanks! and if you want follow me on twitter @travisisbeast23 :)</li>
            <li> I just purchased this at my local beauty supply for $8. After reading all the great reviews I am hoping to see some really good results in the next few weeks. I am African American my skin is a med pecan color so when I have acne scars (as I do now) they really stand out.     I will update you all in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the best product there is. So happy I found something that can clear my dark spots in just two weeks.AAAAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> This works,and so fast ,I was just amazed at how fast It works ,my skin was in bad shape and in less than two-weeks you should see my face now ,it&#x27;s lighter brither ,and smoother,and all the dark spots are fading fast,I love this ,I&#x27;m buying even more of it ,please dont stop selling this product for it is everything it claims to be and much much more,I&#x27;m sold,Thank-You very much.</li>
            <li> I had some trepidation when I ordered this product. I read negative reviews but since it is topical and did not cost that much, I tried it anyway. Two days after the first application (a small area, lower check), there was a bit of redness that reminded me of a chemical peel. I did not apply to the same spot for two days and the redness disappeared. That spot is now showing some dry skin so I just apply regular (Olay) moisturizer. I then decided to be bold and place it on my forehead. I did not experience any redness there, instead it smoothed out some of the milia and dried out a small pimple that I could not get rid of before! I don&#x27;t think my experience is typical. The cream&#x27;s reaction is probably unique to one&#x27;s skin type and hormones. If you&#x27;d like to give it a try, apply sparingly and be patient - it might work you!</li>
            <li> have used this product now for 4 weeks, a noticable improvement age spots on my face, very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Let me say I have the DARKEST of dark circles, so I thought I would be perfect to use this product. If you have read my reviews, you know I keep it real.     So I got this product and thought, if this stuff works I will tell everyone who will listen. It has been about a week, so I will come back in a few weeks and share the results. Had my daughter to take pix so I can do before and after shots.    Stay tuned.</li>
            <li> I would say that this did not do much for me. I did see a decrease in the appearance of dark/acne spots but they are still visible. I also broke out from this product but I have acne prone skin. I would not recommend this because I used it for a month 2xs a day, and only saw average improvement. I also believe that \\&quot;strong bleaching treatment\\&quot; in the title is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, but the product was not good. It made my skin even darker and drier. Good thing that I found a way to bring back the natural color of my skin, but it took a lot of work. I stopped using this and its just sitting in my house. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Dont buy this cause it doesnt work at all or at least for me it didnt I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone. Its a total WASTE of money!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks, but I skipped several days. I can&#x27;t say it works or not, but I see the area I applied become so dry and my skin start to peel off. I guess that&#x27;s the function of it? Or Cause I didn&#x27;t use enough sun-screen? I&#x27;ll keep testing this out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brown-skinned African-American lady with extremely dark circles around my eyes. I purchased this item about 2 weeks ago and started using it immediately... I have eczema and was worried that i would have a reaction glad to say i have not!!!... in the last 2 weeks using this product 2 twice a day as instructed i see great results... i have used other item before with no results -wasted money :( - ... i highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product only has 1% of the whitening agent. Most competitors have 2% or more for about the same price.</li>
            <li> I used this \\&quot;Fair &amp; White\\&quot; product and the third day I noticed my skin a little darker, but after the fifth day my skin where I was using this product looked dark brown it looked like 3 tones darker than what it looked in the first place &#x3D;&#x27;(     I NOW HAVE DARKER TOES AND KNEES!!!! &#x3D;&#x27;(</li>
            <li> Just received the product and hope it works.  The description needs to reveal that it is VERY GREASY, and doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using it for three weeks eccept my skin is more dry.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my legs and i have several aged marks left by moquitoe bites &#x3D;(  my legs reacted within hours of putting the cream on only on the places where it needed to be lightened.    I didn&#x27;t put any at the back of my kness but that is where i had a bad reaction and the skin did not take a liking to the 1.9% hydroquinone.    I&#x27;m going to have to resort to some other skin lightening product that has less than the 1.9% hydroquinone that this cream has in it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product after reading some of the reviews.  If you have extremely sensitive and non-oily  skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  My skin became extremely dry, and I had a very bad allergic reaction to it.  So make sure you try it on your arm before applying it your face.</li>
            <li> Used as directed but had to discontinue after it significantly irritated my skin.  The age spot is now replaced by a red spot from irritation.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time it is a gel that makes  skin start peeling which is good because under the peeling is bright new skin, wish it worked faster but I would definetly recommend as it does work.</li>
            <li> Well,i&#x27;m finaly writting a review for this product because it works! i was quite skeptical in the beginning but my overly dark underarms had me so self-conscious i decided to give it a try. i tried some more expensive products to solve my underarms problems like Makari,glutathione based products and some other stuff i can&#x27;t even remember what they were called...i started using the Likas papaya soap somewhere around February of this year;used it for about 3 months;Likas soap did exfoliate the black skin off my armpits and they were looking a little clearer.i stopped because it appeared the soap action was now unnoticable and the soap was now burning me...i&#x27;m bringing this up because i&#x27;m not sure i would have obtained the same results,using F&amp;W cream directly without the previous action( with mild result)of the Likas soap....  Anyway,after about 3 months of using F&amp;W cream on my underarms,twice a day in the begining ( now i mostly use it mainly at night;it&#x27;s so hot where i live and it makes me sweat horribly!!!)i can finally see real results,people!!my underarm skin is so much clearer!i&#x27;ve never wore tank tops so much in my adult life!!!i&#x27;m so happy!i&#x27;m more confident wearing sleevless tops now.i still have very little dark patches here and there in my armpits that are clearing up fast.i&#x27;m certain within a month or less,everything will be even. DO NOT FORGET TO USE SUNSCREEN!!! also,results WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT!!!it took long to get that dark ( at least mine took more than a decade to get that bad)so be patient and persistent.   i read the product contains hydroquinone,i don&#x27;t think much good of hydroquinone,but i could not find anything else that helped me get rid of my embarrasing problem without spending tons of $$$$;so please,before throwing the stone at people using products with hydroquinone,come up with a better product/solution and value.that will be appreciated,i&#x27;m sure.  shipping was timely.will order again.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a cream which would even out my skin tone, and when I came across this product on this website, I overlooked the negative reviews  which I never do) and when straight to purchase. What a horrible mistake that was. When the product arrived, I immediately read the packaging and set to work.  Within the first 24 hrs, I noticed that my face looked a bit ashy, by the end of the second day, my face looked and felt like sandpaper. It was also stinging me like my skin was on fire. I was at work, so I wen to the pharmacy and picked up a tube of Cotizone 10 Plus, and it took a few hours, but the stinging stopped.   I have not used this cream since, and have gotten rid of it. My skin&#x27;s texture has not come back, and  my skin still looks completely horrible, and is dried up and feels like sandpaper, despite the fact that I&#x27;m drenching it with moisturizer. It will probably take time to go away, but it&#x27;s my fault for NOT  taking heed.    I have learnt my lesson.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to clear my armpits. The problem was that since it was a dark spot instead of disappearing the spot and blend it with my own skin tone it turned the spot white... So I quit using it and bough the Fair and white Dark Spot remover and it work wonderful. If you are looking to light up dark spots this product its not for you, use the dark spot remover.</li>
            <li> Do not use this if you have acne prone skin because it is very oily. I use this on my face and it broke my face out horribly. So please be advised it has extreme amount of oil in this product and being that I already have oily skin it did a number on my face. Just a FYI</li>
            <li> i had spent hundreds of dollars trying to get rid of acne scaring and my face is finally flawlesss thanks to this...</li>
            <li> Great Produict- The product started to work within seven days and took care of some of the dark spots around my face due to pigmentation. Excellent service from the vendor- Buy with Confidence</li>
            <li> Thank you!! the cream was delivered earlier than expected ..and it works so well, my scars lightened noticeably within a weak..now it can hardly be seenn!! I will definitely buy from you again!!!</li>
            <li> First, let me just say, things happen. Its understandable. Things get lost, etc.    But I ordered not only once, but TWICE and guess what? Twice they have taken my money, with no refund and NO product. Very poor customer service, lacked kindness and understanding and did not care at all.    If it involves money, that&#x27;s all they care for. I would give it absolutly NO stars. I am very unhappy camper, and will not buy from this company again.... but its not really buying if they just rob you, is it? I do not recomend buying from here since they can&#x27;t handle     A.) Shipping the freakin&#x27; product    and    B.) Listing the ingredients in it on here. (It can be very harmful to slap things on your skin that can damage it even more.)    So don&#x27;t bother buying this. Not even worth buying twice.</li>
            <li> I stongly recommend this item, easy to use and perfect especially for my oily skin.  My skin therapist was really pleased with the change on my face as the dark spots were all diminished, she did not have to work as hard on my face as before.  Go for it, great product.</li>
            <li> I used the gel around my eyes; it does work just after 3 weeks I noticed how my skin lighted up, but very oily.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This works great! I&#x27;m very fair and every time I get a blemish, no matter how much I ignore it, I always end up with a scar. My acne was under control for a couple of years but recently started breaking out again around my chin area. I got it under control, no more blemishes BUT I was left with scars. I used Meladerm last time and it worked, but it took a long time. So, I decided to give this cream a try because it has hydroquinone (people who are mad about this containing hydroquinone should have read the ingredient list before buying it) and it&#x27;s been working amazingly. It took a week for it to start lightening my scars and now my skin looks much better. I&#x27;m one of those who suffered from shedding, but the product works so well that I&#x27;m not even going to deduct a star.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has really helped to fade the dark spots on my face and even out my skin tone.  I will buy this product in the future and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I used this product daily yet it didnt work for me at all, didn&#x27;t see any improvements</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a lip allergy to some lip balm and while healing, my lips became much darker.  Well, I started using this on my lips and within a week, my lips returned to their normal color or maybe even lighter.  Of course I used a protective lip balm with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> save your money and skip over this product. Does not work. At all. After weeks of daily use. The odor would be manageable only if the bleach actually worked.</li>
            <li> This product came in a timely manner, great shipper.  I got my product within 5-7 business days. This is a good product and it really does work.  It is a little greasy so I try to use less because a little goes a long way. I love the smell of it and it does what it is suppose to, lightens your skin.  I hear some say that their skin shedded but I didn&#x27;t have that problem.  On the other hand, it could have not happen to me because I have used other skin lightners in the past.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible bout with poison ivy last summer.  I now have spots left from the blisters that formed.  I have used the gel off and on (most days of the week but I do forget sometimes) and the spots are lightening.   They lighten from the middle toward the edge of the spot.  I know that if I continue to keep using it (regularly) the spots will be gone.  I am now using it on other spots or dark patches as well.</li>
            <li> Came early haven&#x27;t tried it yet. The tube is 2x smaller than I expected. If it works I will let you know</li>
            <li> This product can&#x27;t possibly work as well as the reviewers say it does.  First off, the main ingredient is 1.9% of hydroquinone  a carcinogen that can cause liver damage, cancer, etc).  I can&#x27;t possibly see how that small amount of hydroquinone can do anything positive in lightening the skin.  I&#x27;ve used OTC products that have 4% hydroquinone and they worked somewhat over a long period of time.  I did order this product but when it arrived I looked at the ingredients (it would do us all slot of good if the sellers would list the ingredients in their product description); after seeing that it only had a small amount of fading ingredient I immediately emailed the seller asking for a refund of the unused and unopened product.  Well that was over a week ago and I still haven&#x27;t received a reply from them.  I WILL send this back and get a refund before I even waste my time to use it.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for me but the only problem was that it made my skin peel. But after I rubbed the it hard and removed the dead skin, it was lighter. So never use it on your face! But otherwise it works</li>
            <li> Not only didn&#x27;t it work but had a funny odor and gave me a rash. Not worth the time and money.  [[ASIN:B001773ZIO Fair &amp; White Gel Cream Strong Bleaching Treatment]]&lt;br /&gt;I got opposite result. It made my dark spots darker. :(</li>
            <li> All I have to say is IT WORKS!!!!  It is kind of heavy so I put it on at night.  After the first night the lightening power was very noticeable the very next morning, it leaves the skin very even toned and radiant, got complements on my skin immediately and continue to do so.  I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive \\&quot;supposedly the best\\&quot; product for $50+ and after 2 wks of use with no results $50 went in the trash.  Fair &amp; White works and I will stick with this less expensive product from now on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll work if you give time , if you use it for a couple of monthes you&#x27;ll get results. i only used  one tube and it only lasted a week and a half if i contiued to use it my skin would of been lighter , during the one week i used it i saw a few dark spots turn lighter.</li>
