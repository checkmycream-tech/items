            <li>although that would be nice).  </li>
            <li>and it feels so velvety nice on hair and hands.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off sampling a leave in conditioner at the drug store for this price.</li>

            <li>I love all of Macadmaia&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>whenever I use this product my hair gets so shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>I love this oil although I received an expired product.</li>
            <li>Never used hair oil before but my curly frizzy hair is softer, more manageable, keeps flatironed texture longer..</li>
            <li>Smells a bit exotic.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>It smells OK too.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Well I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Could I ask for more in one product?</li>
            <li>First, The smell is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Strong smell, works fine.</li>
            <li>However the oil does feel light to the touch and absorbs easily when rubbed on the skin.</li>
            <li>So i went ahead and bought 2 different types of hair products as i heard great things about both -</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t say enough how great this stuff smells.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I never never used this product line before but the price was right</li>
            <li>Second my end are looking Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no disappointment!  </li>
            <li>so I was okay with it for now much it was.</li>
            <li>love it so much</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic &amp; really moisturizes!</li>
            <li>By the great reviews I&#x27;d heard about other products by this company, I figured that this tiny bottle would have healing powers on my heat and dye damaged hair, since it is the most concentrated version of Macadamia oil available.</li>
            <li>Great when you need to blow dry straight.  </li>
            <li>Quick E Shop, the seller, shipped the product super fast.  </li>
            <li>price is right here.  </li>
            <li>I loved how it smelled and made my hair shiny without it being greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>I had to give it a try first.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>it smells great and you only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say much yet in terms of quality.</li>
            <li>classic men&#x27;s haircut style)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and seems to be growing a lot faster too!!</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; is because it makes my hair very straight.</li>
            <li>Me and my wife have been using both for the past 2 weeks, and I gotta say i LOVE the scent of the Macadamia vs the scentless Argan oil I bought,</li>
            <li>Hair, these are people interested in your personal life.  </li>
            <li>I rub a little between my palms and apply to the ends- works great on calming my hair- not too heavy!</li>
            <li>This was apparently completely unreasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got naturally wavy hair and this works wonders.  </li>
            <li>It did make my hair feel soft however the smell was unbearable.</li>
            <li>I am completely sold.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product, the smell was a little incense-y but was not to overwhelming, for the price wished the bottle was bigger but a little of bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I got such a huge package for just a little bottle</li>
            <li>Or, half of that when it&#x27;s dry to smooth the ends out.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>I might consider adding it to a deep conditioner so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste, but I was disappointed to find that the first ingredient listed (meaning, what the product contains the most of)was dimethicone (a thickening agent added to soaps and lotions and usually as a replacement for the quality thickness in a genuinely good product).</li>
            <li>For reference: I have long, wispy naturally blond curly hair.</li>

            <li> For reference: I have long, wispy naturally blond curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that doesn&#x27;t always have the same bounce when it gets flat ironed, with the ends of my hair looking kind of dry and dull.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is really small and it came in a really large bubble box.</li>
            <li> Cost too much for that small size.</li>
            <li> As I only need a pea size for the whole head, I believe this 0.34oz bottle will last me at least 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this oil after I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me to try this as I use flat iron every morning.  </li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels soft, split ends less noticable.</li>
            <li> I have very thick frizzy hair and this helps it go down, smooth out, and smell</li>
            <li> I am in the Navy and have to wear my hair in a bun all day long and with this product, it helps keep my hair from breaking and getting that kink in it from having it in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> cannot vouch for the &amp;#34;UV Protection&amp;#34; it claims to do, but I was only looking to manage the &#x27;puffness&#x27; (not a real word) caused by humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very musky scent, so I am assuming I got a fake product like others described, but even so, it makes my skin and hair very soft.</li>
            <li> but on the other hand this doesnt deliver the same smoothness as the Argan oil did.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> so I put some in my damp hair, and sometimes when it&#x27;s dry too.</li>
            <li> Put a dime size in palm of your hand when it&#x27;s wet and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry ends</li>
            <li> Other than the cost</li>
            <li> * Gets freezie (not sure how you spell that) easily, especially after washing it&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> 1st - dispense small amount into palms and rub, 2nd - distribute, evenly through hair, to avoid clumps or oil concentrations in one area, which WILL make it oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the .34 oz a few months ago and would use it when I would blow dry my hair to go out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other oils in my hair before and unlike argan oil which sometimes weighed my hair down, this doesn&#x27;t at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way (keep in mind my hair</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair shiny and manageable while making your split ends less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Received the package as described used it all and did not see any changes to my thick and long hair</li>
            <li> My lid wasnt on tight and it ran all over the box.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money-</li>
            <li> I started using it after every time I shampooed and my hair has less frizz and is so shiny!</li>
            <li> I ordered the sample size to try because from past experience, all oil type of hair treatment make my hair sticky.  </li>
            <li> I usually use &amp;#34;Moroccan Oil&amp;#34; but decided to give this product a chance because a girlfriend of mine models for the company.</li>
            <li> I put a very small amount on my hand then run it through the end of my hair.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try this, but it seriously smells like a convent.</li>
            <li> the bottle is inconvenient, and the product itself does little but add a temporary greasy finish to hair.</li>
            <li> * Thin, but abundant&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been addicted to it since then.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought this product from a store before, so reading some of the reviews saying that they got a fake made it difficult to want to buy.</li>
            <li> sort of disappointing.</li>
            <li> but i was disappointed in the packaging.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the bottle I received expired 1/15</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I used it once and will never use it again in fear of having to smell that stench again. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best oil healing treatment I&#x27;ve used!! Looking forward to ordering more of it!</li>
            <li> By the great reviews I&#x27;d heard about other products by this company, I figured that this tiny bottle would have healing powers on my heat and dye damaged hair, since it is the most concentrated version of Macadamia oil available. This was apparently completely unreasonable. Overall, I would not purchase this product again- the bottle is inconvenient, and the product itself does little but add a temporary greasy finish to hair. This was a waste of money- I might consider adding it to a deep conditioner so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste, but I was disappointed to find that the first ingredient listed (meaning, what the product contains the most of)was dimethicone (a thickening agent added to soaps and lotions and usually as a replacement for the quality thickness in a genuinely good product). You&#x27;d be better off sampling a leave in conditioner at the drug store for this price.</li>
            <li> Strong smell, works fine. Prefer my moraccon, beauty protector, or OGX oil instead. They smell better.</li>
            <li> So i went ahead and bought 2 different types of hair products as i heard great things about both - This Macadamia Oil, and Argan Oil. Me and my wife have been using both for the past 2 weeks, and I gotta say i LOVE the scent of the Macadamia vs the scentless Argan oil I bought, but on the other hand this doesnt deliver the same smoothness as the Argan oil did. They are both great products for great prices, and would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought the .34 oz a few months ago and would use it when I would blow dry my hair to go out. I loved how it smelled and made my hair shiny without it being greasy or weighed down. When I ran out I started frantically searching for it, and bought it off of amazon.com. It was delivered in 4 days, which is amazing considering I am deployed to Guam. I started using it after every time I shampooed and my hair has less frizz and is so shiny! Even in 90% my hair stays put. I am in the Navy and have to wear my hair in a bun all day long and with this product, it helps keep my hair from breaking and getting that kink in it from having it in a pony tail. I have also found that my color stays in longer and my ends look healthier. I am hooked on this product! It will always have a place in my medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a ok product. Cost too much for that small size. Other than the cost it&#x27;s a good product lol</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic &amp; really moisturizes! For reference: I have long, wispy naturally blond curly hair. I rub a little between my palms and apply to the ends- works great on calming my hair- not too heavy!</li>
            <li> I like the oil as a product but i was disappointed in the packaging. My lid wasnt on tight and it ran all over the box. sort of disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love this oil!! My hair is so soft and seems to be growing a lot faster too!!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing I was not expecting it to smell so good. My hair is no longer dry and frizzy. I&#x27;m able to straighten it a lot easier.  I can&#x27;t believe I got such a huge package for just a little bottle</li>
            <li> Hair, these are people interested in your personal life.  People, my hair is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Thin, but abundant&lt;br /&gt;* Gets freezie (not sure how you spell that) easily, especially after washing it&lt;br /&gt;* Obviously, I am a man, thus I have medium hair (classic men&#x27;s haircut style)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The smell is pleasant to the max&lt;br /&gt;* Small amount goes a long way (keep in mind my hair length)&lt;br /&gt;* It is non greasy.  Yes, NON greasy.  Hair will not be oily if dispensed as directed: 1st - dispense small amount into palms and rub, 2nd - distribute, evenly through hair, to avoid clumps or oil concentrations in one area, which WILL make it oily.&lt;br /&gt;* Leaves hair manageable throughout the day.  In my case I haven&#x27;t the need to add in midday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot vouch for the &amp;#34;UV Protection&amp;#34; it claims to do, but I was only looking to manage the &#x27;puffness&#x27; (not a real word) caused by humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.  I will continue to buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> it smells great and you only need to use a little bit. My hair feels softer and smells really good.</li>
            <li> I have very thick frizzy hair and this helps it go down, smooth out, and smell good.&lt;br /&gt; I was disappointed that the bottle I received expired 1/15 but it still works like a charm so I was okay with it for now much it was.</li>
            <li> Great when you need to blow dry straight.  I&#x27;ve got naturally wavy hair and this works wonders.  Put a dime size in palm of your hand when it&#x27;s wet and blow dry.  Or, half of that when it&#x27;s dry to smooth the ends out.&lt;br /&gt;Best price is right here.  I&#x27;ve shopped retail and online.  Can&#x27;t beat Amazon!  My hairdresser introduced me to this product back in 2011.  I&#x27;ve been addicted to it since then.  Smells great!!!  And, my hair is in great shape thanks to this product.  (No, I&#x27;m in no way indorsed......although that would be nice).  It just really is a great product!</li>
            <li> I use this oil after I flat iron my hair. I put a very small amount on my hand then run it through the end of my hair. First, The smell is just amazing. Second my end are looking Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> I love all of Macadmaia&#x27;s products so I wanted to try this, but it seriously smells like a convent. I don&#x27;t need to smell that any longer than I did in catholic school.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me to try this as I use flat iron every morning.  I ordered the sample size to try because from past experience, all oil type of hair treatment make my hair sticky.  I had to give it a try first.  It&#x27;s no disappointment!  I used pea size of oil and applied it to the end after washing my hair.  It smells sooooooooooooooooooo good and it makes my hair silky to touch.  Really good product.  I&#x27;ll definitely order again when I use up this bottle.  As I only need a pea size for the whole head, I believe this 0.34oz bottle will last me at least 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Quick E Shop, the seller, shipped the product super fast.  I ordered yesterday and received the package today!!  Extremely satisfied for the good product, for the great price, for the quick service!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft and shiny. It also smells good. The only reason I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; is because it makes my hair very straight. If you&#x27;re into that, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I got this through a beauty subscription and now use it every time I flat iron my hair.  I have thick, curly hair that doesn&#x27;t always have the same bounce when it gets flat ironed, with the ends of my hair looking kind of dry and dull.  Whenever the case, I use a dab of this oil, rub it in my hands and distribute it evenly through the ends of my hair. The instantly look moisturized and healed!  This healing oil makes my blowout from looking OK to perfect! Will buy again and again, no doubt!</li>
            <li> Smells great,works well,my friends are jealous of me because i after that i look perfect and i glamour,best i ever used.</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft, split ends less noticable.</li>
            <li> Received the package as described used it all and did not see any changes to my thick and long hair</li>
            <li> whenever I use this product my hair gets so shiny and smooth! I have never used this product before and will defiantly be buying some when I run out!</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this product. I usually use &amp;#34;Moroccan Oil&amp;#34; but decided to give this product a chance because a girlfriend of mine models for the company. It did make my hair feel soft however the smell was unbearable. Personally not a fan of that &amp;#34;hippy&amp;#34; smell. I used it once and will never use it again in fear of having to smell that stench again. :(</li>
            <li> I love this oil although I received an expired product. It said 03/2014 expiration. Still works great!</li>
            <li> Never used hair oil before but my curly frizzy hair is softer, more manageable, keeps flatironed texture longer.. Smells a bit exotic.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. I am completely sold. Thank you</li>
            <li> Good stuff smells a bit . Smells alittle&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The bottle is really small and it came in a really large bubble box. I&#x27;ve just started using it so I can&#x27;t say much yet in terms of quality. However the oil does feel light to the touch and absorbs easily when rubbed on the skin. It smells OK too.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product, the smell was a little incense-y but was not to overwhelming, for the price wished the bottle was bigger but a little of bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I never never used this product line before but the price was right so I decided to give it a try. I love it it smells amazing and it feels so velvety nice on hair and hands. Did reduce my hair drying time and frizz. Also, i saw the product at Ulta yesterday and it was $20 so definitely buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought the smallest size because I had never used this product before and didn&#x27;t know if I would like it. Well I love it and I plan on buying the biggest one soon. This amber liquid smells amazing and leaves my hair smoother. I have very dry ends so I put some in my damp hair, and sometimes when it&#x27;s dry too. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking or feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve used other oils in my hair before and unlike argan oil which sometimes weighed my hair down, this doesn&#x27;t at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can&#x27;t say enough how great this stuff smells.</li>
            <li> I love it.  it works awesome. It met all the requirements that was expect of this product. love it so much</li>
            <li> lite but moisturizing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought this product from a store before, so reading some of the reviews saying that they got a fake made it difficult to want to buy. It was a good price though, so I went for it. It has a very musky scent, so I am assuming I got a fake product like others described, but even so, it makes my skin and hair very soft.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair products I&#x27;ve used. Keeps your hair shiny and manageable while making your split ends less noticeable. Could I ask for more in one product?</li>
