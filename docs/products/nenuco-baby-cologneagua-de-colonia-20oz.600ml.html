            <li> Parfum 1 is very reliable and trustworthy! I received my order faster than expected. I love nenuco.. This is what my parents use on me when I was a kid.. Now I&#x27;m expecting, I really looked for this product to pass it on to my little angle... Give it a try, you will love this product. My boyfriend use this too... Love the smell!!</li>

            <li> packaging was perfect and came when it said it was going to come! The bottles are huge and it still smells the same from when I was a baby! Cant wait to use it on my baby! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it as a cologne and it smells a lot like a watered down version of the classic 4711 but I use it as a room freshener in the warmer times of the year. Also mix it with some warm water in a fine mist bottle to spray my clothes when I&#x27;m ironing and as a linen spray.  Makes everything smell fresh and clean. I can see where this would be great for babies.</li>
            <li> Recieved in good conditions..I love the smell and been looking for this cologne. .thank you..will order some more..thanks again so much..</li>
            <li> Love Nenuco. It is a nice fresh, crisp, citrus scent. My son gets a tub in the evenings, but by morning has a bit of that \\&quot;not so fabulous baby smell.\\&quot; A nice splash of Nenuco refreshes him and has him smelling great for the rest of the day! I&#x27;ve been using this on him since he was 6 weeks old and he has never had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Excellent product</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have worn this scent since I was a baby, as have all of my children and used to have to order it direct from Spain. I am so glad that amazon carries it now. It is a clean citrus-y scent. Good for boys or girls.(or women) I am very sensitive to perfumes and this does not bother my allergies in the least!</li>
            <li> Because I happen to have used this Baby Cologne years back when sent directly from Spain or directly purchased there. It does smell and feels like the original Spanish formula. Seller has a first rate product for distribution in the USA. Seller also packages the plastic bottle with care since it might spill inside if not properly secured. Amazingly the cologne arrived by Priority Mail the day after the order was placed with Amazon.</li>
            <li> have &amp;#34;re-discovered&#x27; this fragrance again.  have always used this on my children when they were still &#x27;children&amp;#34; but now i bought this for my grandchild.</li>

            <li> I used this cologne when i was a teenager sneaking it out from my baby nephews.  Now i ordered it for my grandkids.  It is quite expensive.  I received my two bottles yesterday and tried it.  Not even 20 minutes, the smell on your skin disappears!!  Kinda frustrated on this cuz the scent is not like it used to be before.  Am thinking of returning these bottles.</li>
            <li> It is the BEST cologne for babies, smell so delicious, I want 1 for me also. I hope that it is always in stock.</li>
