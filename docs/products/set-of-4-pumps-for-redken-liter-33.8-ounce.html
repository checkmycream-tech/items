            <li>Very helpful, great item.</li>
            <li>and they fit nicely and</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It would make more sense for the tube to be longer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay..not great because how many times do you really need 4 pumps?</li>
            <li>Love these pumps.  </li>

            <li>Love these pumps-</li>
            <li>Love it, would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li>These pumps help you avoid all of that...:)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pumps, what more can I say, they work and do the job as described</li>
            <li>So glad I ordered these.</li>
            <li>That was easily solved by snipping the end a bit.</li>
            <li>So cost efficient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, it seems to function just fine.</li>
            <li>The pumps work fine with my Redken shampoo and conditioner bottles.</li>
            <li>oh well....they still work fine.  </li>
            <li>we now have the pumps needed to keep our Liter orders running fine..</li>
            <li>The pump works fine.  </li>
            <li>Thank you item arrived quick and love that its a set of 4</li>
            <li>Black pumps that fit the Redken 33 oz bottles perfectly!!!</li>
            <li>I dunno how I would have these huge bottles and not a pump for them.</li>
            <li>great to use with larger size shampoo</li>
            <li>Even fit the 34oz bottles i bought.</li>
            <li>barely fit on the bottle</li>
            <li>I am using these pumps to recycle a bottle as a soap dispenser for my kitchen, so the look of the product was important to me.</li>
            <li>But it barely fit.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t fit my Redken Shampoo bottles.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not my primary concern though.</li>
            <li>and I could trim it to fit whichever style bottle I was using.</li>
            <li>They fit the Redken 33.8oz bottles.</li>
            <li>Fit the Redken shampoo and conditioner bottles I purchased.</li>
            <li>Claimed this would fit a 33.8 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>They fit 33.8 oz.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Pumps are working good so far.</li>
            <li>received exactly what I expected, in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Bought a few others but this one works great and wears better.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of flimsy, but they work and they reach all the way to the bottom of the 33.8 OZ containers of the All Soft shampoo and conditioner that I use.</li>
            <li>I received everything on time and in good shape, but the tubes on the pumps are only about 6&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Great product just what I expected and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>so now I have 2 xtras lucky me.</li>
            <li>they came quickly -</li>
            <li>Item delivered quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using these with my large bottles in the shower.</li>
            <li>Great in the Shower too, keeps you from picking up heavy bottle for each wash/condition</li>
            <li>Great heavy duty pumps.</li>
            <li>but they are also useful in the kitchen, as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything exciting to write about them</li>
            <li>These pumps pump just the right amount of shampoo/conditioner so as you&#x27;re not pumping</li>
            <li>Price was right though.</li>
            <li>No clue what that other person is talking about when she says they dont cause they most certainly do fit.</li>
            <li>Ended up buying better and cheaper ones from the local salon.</li>
            <li>does exactly what I expect it to</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first one I used, I had a dickens of a time trying to get it to &#x27;pop up&#x27; and be usable.  </li>
            <li>Would buy again and definitely will when I need more.</li>
            <li>then the first ones</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>love this pumps with the bigger bottles of Redken shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Once my pumps came, however, I could easily get just the right amount of product out without lifting and squeezing the big bottles</li>
            <li>Convenience has never been better especially for those bulky, large sized bottles.</li>
            <li>first received two pumps instead of four, but the seller quickly resolved the issue and the other two came very quickly.</li>
            <li>I used two right away and only the on the shampoo leaked not the conditioner, so it may be just a condition of significantly lower nighttime temperatures.</li>
            <li>I bought these pumps to go with my large bottles of shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>So convenient for my large bottles of shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I use these on each of our large shampoo and conditioner bottles.</li>
            <li>Since the vendor would not easily give me a refund, I had to prove my case, and conducted a test: these pumps leave over 6.5oz of product in the 33.8oz Redken bottle - that&#x27;s almost 1/5 of the bottle that you won&#x27;t be able to pump!</li>
            <li>Not as much product would flow out of these.  </li>
            <li>However, I really wish I would have received what is pictured.</li>
            <li>These hand pumps make shampooing or conditioning your hair so much easier.</li>
            <li>even though i really just needed two</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really know the difference.  </li>
            <li>But compared to others that have come with the bottles these seem to wrok very well.</li>
            <li>These are the cheap over the counter replacement pumps for regular shampoos.  </li>
            <li>It makes it much easier in the shower.</li>
            <li>They are WHITE, and I don&#x27;t think they are true to 33 oz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they work but were not what I was looking for, it was not worth the time to return them as they were not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>, The pumps are high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Also received very quickly &amp; packed carefully!</li>
            <li>Well first off they&#x27;re not the same color as in the picture and there&#x27;s nothing special about these pumps that make them specific for Redken.</li>
            <li>I love not having to pick up the heavy liter bottles to get my shampoo or conditioner out anymore.  </li>
            <li>was concerned they might not thread tightly enough, but they are just right.  </li>
            <li>These DO fit the large salon sized Kerastase bottles - but they are a little long (about an inch) the first one I used I cut the bottom off a little (you need strong scissors)</li>
            <li>Bought these for the large bottle above of conditioner to make things in the shower.</li>
            <li>and I did have to snip a little off the end of the length to make it fit</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve almost gone through a whole bottle of the shampoo and conditioner with the giant redkin bottles</li>
            <li>so far haven&#x27;t clogged or gotten stuck or anything.</li>
            <li>but when i buy my next set of shampoos in about 6 months i&#x27;ll have these ready</li>
            <li>So much easier than having to pick up the big bottles all the time.</li>
            <li>also the one i got were white not black as shown( not a huge deal) but would of been nice to properly list them!</li>
            <li>When I first held a pump next to the bottle, it was obvious that the tube would not reach the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and pump a tiny bit of shampoo out so that you have to do quit a few pumps to get enough shampoo.  </li>
            <li>One pump delivers the right amount needed, so that you don&#x27;t have to pick up the heavy bottle.</li>
            <li>Tubing not deep enough by far for Redken liter bottle.</li>
            <li>You can barely pump any product out and it takes forever for the pump to come back up for you to pump again for product.</li>
            <li>The pumps are not long enough for the bottles, there is still about an inch at the bottom.</li>
            <li>I purchased these pumps for standard Redken 33.8oz bottles, but the tube that comes with the pumps isn&#x27;t near long enough to reach the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Not long enough to reach the bottom of the bottle.</li>

            <li> Great heavy duty pumps.</li>
            <li> but they are also useful in the kitchen, as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything exciting to write about them</li>
            <li> These pumps pump just the right amount of shampoo/conditioner so as you&#x27;re not pumping</li>
            <li> Price was right though.</li>
            <li> No clue what that other person is talking about when she says they dont cause they most certainly do fit.</li>
            <li> Ended up buying better and cheaper ones from the local salon.</li>
            <li> does exactly what I expect it to</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first one I used, I had a dickens of a time trying to get it to &#x27;pop up&#x27; and be usable.  </li>
            <li> Would buy again and definitely will when I need more.</li>
            <li> then the first ones</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> love this pumps with the bigger bottles of Redken shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Once my pumps came, however, I could easily get just the right amount of product out without lifting and squeezing the big bottles</li>
            <li> Convenience has never been better especially for those bulky, large sized bottles.</li>
            <li> first received two pumps instead of four, but the seller quickly resolved the issue and the other two came very quickly.</li>
            <li> I used two right away and only the on the shampoo leaked not the conditioner, so it may be just a condition of significantly lower nighttime temperatures.</li>
            <li> I bought these pumps to go with my large bottles of shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> So convenient for my large bottles of shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I use these on each of our large shampoo and conditioner bottles.</li>
            <li> Since the vendor would not easily give me a refund, I had to prove my case, and conducted a test: these pumps leave over 6.5oz of product in the 33.8oz Redken bottle - that&#x27;s almost 1/5 of the bottle that you won&#x27;t be able to pump!</li>
            <li> Not as much product would flow out of these.  </li>
            <li> However, I really wish I would have received what is pictured.</li>
            <li> These hand pumps make shampooing or conditioning your hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> even though i really just needed two</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really know the difference.  </li>
            <li> But compared to others that have come with the bottles these seem to wrok very well.</li>
            <li> These are the cheap over the counter replacement pumps for regular shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It makes it much easier in the shower.</li>
            <li> They are WHITE, and I don&#x27;t think they are true to 33 oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they work but were not what I was looking for, it was not worth the time to return them as they were not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> , The pumps are high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Also received very quickly &amp; packed carefully!</li>
            <li> Well first off they&#x27;re not the same color as in the picture and there&#x27;s nothing special about these pumps that make them specific for Redken.</li>
            <li> I love not having to pick up the heavy liter bottles to get my shampoo or conditioner out anymore.  </li>
            <li> was concerned they might not thread tightly enough, but they are just right.  </li>
            <li> These DO fit the large salon sized Kerastase bottles - but they are a little long (about an inch) the first one I used I cut the bottom off a little (you need strong scissors)</li>
            <li> Bought these for the large bottle above of conditioner to make things in the shower.</li>
            <li> and I did have to snip a little off the end of the length to make it fit</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve almost gone through a whole bottle of the shampoo and conditioner with the giant redkin bottles</li>
            <li> so far haven&#x27;t clogged or gotten stuck or anything.</li>
            <li> but when i buy my next set of shampoos in about 6 months i&#x27;ll have these ready</li>
            <li> So much easier than having to pick up the big bottles all the time.</li>
            <li> also the one i got were white not black as shown( not a huge deal) but would of been nice to properly list them!</li>
            <li> When I first held a pump next to the bottle, it was obvious that the tube would not reach the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and pump a tiny bit of shampoo out so that you have to do quit a few pumps to get enough shampoo.  </li>
            <li> One pump delivers the right amount needed, so that you don&#x27;t have to pick up the heavy bottle.</li>
            <li> Tubing not deep enough by far for Redken liter bottle.</li>
            <li> You can barely pump any product out and it takes forever for the pump to come back up for you to pump again for product.</li>
            <li> The pumps are not long enough for the bottles, there is still about an inch at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pumps for standard Redken 33.8oz bottles, but the tube that comes with the pumps isn&#x27;t near long enough to reach the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not long enough to reach the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Well worth the little bit of money I spent on them!</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t actually long enough for liter bottles.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t anticipate they will last very long.  </li>
            <li> ; long.  </li>
            <li> I have several sets of pumps these are by far the shortest only go a little over halfway down into the bottle.... there for you will be stuck turning bottle upside down for last 1/3 or so of it!!</li>
            <li> I ordered two other things on the same day which both took twice as long as these pumps.</li>
            <li> The real pump only leaves 1.3oz behind.</li>
            <li> Therefore, when you get close to the bottom, but still have quite a few shampoos and conditioning left, you have to use the regular lids.  </li>
            <li> Its  also so much easier to just pump a little shampoo and two pumps of conditioner then wasting product or worrying about dropping a wet heavy bottle in the shower and injuring yourself or having the bottle fall.</li>
            <li> Can possibly be hard to open initially, but once you&#x27;ve got it open</li>
            <li> the second one I just pushed it down so the tube part curled around in the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Not only are they big and bulky, they aren&#x27;t black!!</li>
            <li> I expected to receive black pumps, but received white instead.</li>
            <li> The pump works fine, it&#x27;s just a little cheesy to have to buy seperately and not in a two pack but a three pack.</li>
            <li> Were a little larger than the bottle I wanted them for.  </li>
            <li> They are ugly, and huge!</li>
            <li> I like it - there&#x27;s really not much else to say.</li>
            <li> These pumps DO NOT fit the 33.8oz Redken shampoo and conditioner bottles properly.</li>
            <li> They work as expected.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Spring is too short and tube is too narrow.</li>
            <li> The image shows a clean, white pump, but the pumps I received in the mail are this ugly tan-ish color.</li>
            <li> After trying what was available in a local beauty store I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what finally did it, but it&#x27;s working now,</li>
            <li> two may never need to use the other two.</li>
            <li> so I can use some for other bottles.</li>
            <li> When you are in the shower and the big bottles get wet, they tend to get slippery and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> In the shower, they make handling the wet, heavy bottles safer and  easier.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be black pumps, but they showed up cream colored.</li>
            <li> These pumps aren&#x27;t black as pictured, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> it just sits on the shelve and I pump out what I need instead of having to pick up a bottle with wet slick hands.</li>
            <li> The tube is not long enough to reach the bottom of a standard shampoo liter bottle. :(</li>
            <li> it pumped a little easier.</li>
            <li> One of the pumps oozes little bits of shampoo up and out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> These pumps did not fit the liter shampoo bottles.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur $$.</li>
            <li> I got these for my liter-size Nioxin bottles, as those suckers are WAY too heavy and stiff to be turning upside down and shaking/</li>
            <li> Ordered these not sure they would work for my 32 fl oz bottles of shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> No longer do you have to risk dropping a slippery-wet heavy shampoo bottle on your toes!</li>
            <li> Really hard to figure out to unscrew them to start with.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard to pump and I would never buy these again.</li>
            <li> They are hard to get to pop up.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a Pureology bottle and there is still at least 3 inches at the bottom of the bottle that can&#x27;t be reached by the pump.</li>
            <li> I bought the giant bottles of shampoo and conditioner but never thought about how awkward it was going to be to get the product out of the bottles.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that the description and picture indicated that these were black/dark and when they showed up they were white.</li>
            <li> Tough luck I guess.</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> Too bad they do not come with the product at the price they sell it for.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in seller and in the product.</li>
            <li> So, it was worthless and I am returning them.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality pumps.</li>
            <li> I hate these pumps!</li>

            <li> One of the pumps oozes little bits of shampoo up and out of the bottle. I used two right away and only the on the shampoo leaked not the conditioner, so it may be just a condition of significantly lower nighttime temperatures. Otherwise these pumps look good and work well, I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Not as much product would flow out of these.  Ended up buying better and cheaper ones from the local salon.</li>
            <li> Wife used them for her hair products she said this worked perfect</li>
            <li> great to use with larger size shampoo</li>
            <li> Fit any bottle I put it on, great product. Even fit the 34oz bottles i bought. I do with it pumped a little easier.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, as decribed. Good price!</li>
            <li> Great product just what I expected and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> does exactly what I expect it to</li>
            <li> Very good . Fit perfectly</li>
            <li> just 2 Pumps have worked out</li>
            <li> 2 of the 4 won&#x27;t work. Luckily I only needed 2.</li>
            <li> The pumps are not long enough for the bottles, there is still about an inch at the bottom.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome deal! I used these for two Redken 33.8 oz bottles, and they were a perfect fit!</li>
            <li> Always wanted to have this product at home, and now I do.  This is great.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Redken line is the lid on the bottle, well, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that!</li>
            <li> One of the pumps doesn&#x27;t work.  Other than that, I had no problem with the seller.</li>
            <li> barely fit on the bottle</li>
            <li> great product, received right away.</li>
            <li> Really hard to figure out to unscrew them to start with.</li>
            <li> Make the big Redkin bottles of shampoo and conditioner a lot easier to use!</li>
            <li> It is so nice to use this in the shower and not have to pick up the shampoo and conditioner..it just sits on the shelve and I pump out what I need instead of having to pick up a bottle with wet slick hands.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my shampoo bottles!</li>
            <li> Item not as described! The image shows a clean, white pump, but the pumps I received in the mail are this ugly tan-ish color. I am using these pumps to recycle a bottle as a soap dispenser for my kitchen, so the look of the product was important to me. However, it seems to function just fine.</li>
            <li> Having the pump makes it so much easier so you don&#x27;t have lift the liter bottles which are big , cumbersome and heavy They fit the Redken color extend bottles and my Biolage bottles perfectly. No clue what that other person is talking about when she says they dont cause they most certainly do fit. Its  also so much easier to just pump a little shampoo and two pumps of conditioner then wasting product or worrying about dropping a wet heavy bottle in the shower and injuring yourself or having the bottle fall. Just love the pumps and that they came in a pack of 4 as I change up brands sometimes so I needed a set of pumps for both brands. Just perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li> Definitely need this when you purchase a 33.8 oz. bottle. Great in the Shower too, keeps you from picking up heavy bottle for each wash/condition</li>
            <li> I bought these pumps to go with my large bottles of shampoo and conditioner but they are also useful in the kitchen, as well.</li>
            <li> The pumps work fine with my Redken shampoo and conditioner bottles. However, I really wish I would have received what is pictured. I thought they would be black pumps, but they showed up cream colored. Not a big deal, just an irritant when you think you are ordering one thing and something different shows up .</li>
            <li> It seems everyone is getting a different color pump. I received white pumps even though the photo shows maroon ones. It doesn&#x27;t match my shampoo bottle and i&#x27;m considering returning because they are not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the large bottle above of conditioner to make things in the shower. But it barely fit. I had to jam it in to make it work.</li>
            <li> I got these for my liter-size Nioxin bottles, as those suckers are WAY too heavy and stiff to be turning upside down and shaking/squeezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned they might not thread tightly enough, but they are just right.  Saves my toes from my lack of coordination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I used, I had a dickens of a time trying to get it to &#x27;pop up&#x27; and be usable.  I&#x27;m not sure what finally did it, but it&#x27;s working now, so all is good.</li>
            <li> Very helpful, great item. Works perfectly with Redken 1L bottles. Would buy again and definitely will when I need more.</li>
            <li> Were a little larger than the bottle I wanted them for.  That was easily solved by snipping the end a bit.</li>
            <li> This item does not work and is ineligible for return--do not purchase!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t fit my Redken Shampoo bottles.</li>
            <li> Work great! Too bad they do not come with the product at the price they sell it for. Tough luck I guess.</li>
            <li> I like it - there&#x27;s really not much else to say. They work well and I&#x27;ve almost gone through a whole bottle of the shampoo and conditioner with the giant redkin bottles and they fit nicely and so far haven&#x27;t clogged or gotten stuck or anything. I&#x27;ll probably reuse them and I like that they came with 4 so that I have some spares.</li>
            <li> These pumps pump just the right amount of shampoo/conditioner so as you&#x27;re not pumping a dozen times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first received two pumps instead of four, but the seller quickly resolved the issue and the other two came very quickly.</li>
            <li> These pumps are great!  I love not having to pick up the heavy liter bottles to get my shampoo or conditioner out anymore.  Mine were a goldish beige color but that did not bother me.  I used mine in Matrix liter bottles and I did have to snip a little off the end of the length to make it fit but it was a simple thing to do with scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered these for a second time and this time the pumps are white.  I dunno why they are different then the first ones but oh well....they still work fine.  :)</li>
            <li> works well with my shampoo and conditioner bottles</li>
            <li> I expected to receive black pumps, but received white instead. That&#x27;s not my primary concern though. I purchased these pumps for standard Redken 33.8oz bottles, but the tube that comes with the pumps isn&#x27;t near long enough to reach the bottom of the bottle. It would make more sense for the tube to be longer and I could trim it to fit whichever style bottle I was using.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for Redken Liters!</li>
            <li> These pumps did not fit the liter shampoo bottles.  They were too short--- I&#x27;m sending them back.</li>
            <li> These pumps DO NOT fit the 33.8oz Redken shampoo and conditioner bottles properly. The pumps that arrived were white, obviously generic-made replacements that don&#x27;t even look like the pumps in the advertised photo. When I first held a pump next to the bottle, it was obvious that the tube would not reach the bottom of the bottle. Measuring it and comparing it with an actual Redken pump, I found that it was almost an inch shorter. Since the vendor would not easily give me a refund, I had to prove my case, and conducted a test: these pumps leave over 6.5oz of product in the 33.8oz Redken bottle - that&#x27;s almost 1/5 of the bottle that you won&#x27;t be able to pump! The real pump only leaves 1.3oz behind. It took three or four requests for a refund, my pseudo-scientific test, and several pictures before they would refund my money.</li>
            <li> Well first off they&#x27;re not the same color as in the picture and there&#x27;s nothing special about these pumps that make them specific for Redken. They&#x27;re kind of flimsy, but they work and they reach all the way to the bottom of the 33.8 OZ containers of the All Soft shampoo and conditioner that I use.</li>
            <li> we now have the pumps needed to keep our Liter orders running fine..</li>
            <li> The pump works fine.  The only problem I have is that the pump does NOT go all the way to the bottom of the bottle.  Therefore, when you get close to the bottom, but still have quite a few shampoos and conditioning left, you have to use the regular lids.  I still would recommend this product.  I don&#x27;t believe any pump goes all the way to the bottom, from my experience.</li>
            <li> Listing says set of (4). I thought that meant 4. However, 1 must have jumped off the boat because only received 3. The 3 work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay..not great because how many times do you really need 4 pumps? well I only needed 2 so now I have 2 xtras lucky me. They work good just wish it would have been a 2 pack.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery and was what I ordered. One pump delivers the right amount needed, so that you don&#x27;t have to pick up the heavy bottle.</li>
            <li> Very good product!  Fits my 32oz bottles perfectly.</li>
            <li> I hate these pumps! Not only are they big and bulky, they aren&#x27;t black!! They are WHITE, and I don&#x27;t think they are true to 33 oz. bottles. They are ugly, and huge! It is extremely hard to pump and I would never buy these again. I don&#x27;t even know if I can use these for my shampoo bottles because they&#x27;re so short. Disappointed in seller and in the product.</li>
            <li> I received everything on time and in good shape, but the tubes on the pumps are only about 6&amp;#34; long.  Not long enough to reach the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The tube is not long enough to reach the bottom of a standard shampoo liter bottle. :(</li>
            <li> I had bought a liter of shampoo, however, it did not come with the pump. Too big of a bottle to lift every time. These fit perfect on the bottles. I will say, I did have to work with it for a minute or two to get it to screw on. With that said, once I did get it to fit, it works perfect.</li>
            <li> Love these pumps.  I didn&#x27;t know they sold them online.  So convenient for my large bottles of shampoo/conditioner.  Great price!</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t actually long enough for liter bottles.  Completely useless.</li>
            <li> Yep they work! I don&#x27;t have anything exciting to write about them but I have been using mine for about a year now with no problem.</li>
            <li> Ordered these not sure they would work for my 32 fl oz bottles of shampoo/conditioner.  They work great now there is no messing around with trying to put my shampoo into something smaller to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great for the shampoo and condition I bought</li>
            <li> Black pumps that fit the Redken 33 oz bottles perfectly!!! Very happy with purchase &amp; recommend :)</li>
            <li> Fits perfect with my large bottles Redkin Shampoo and conditioner. Love it. Arrived quickly and in great condition. Competitive price as well.</li>
            <li> They are pumps. They fit the Redken 33.8oz bottles. They work as expected. Can possibly be hard to open initially, but once you&#x27;ve got it open it works well with no resistance. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love these pumps- they work on many bottles that I am in need of a pump! Yahoo</li>
            <li> Work perfectly with liter bottles of Redken shampoo and conditioner. So cost efficient and easy to use. Love it, would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> They did require a bit of trimming for the 32oz bottles I purchased them for.  They work great!!</li>
            <li> These hand pumps make shampooing or conditioning your hair so much easier. Convenience has never been better especially for those bulky, large sized bottles. When you are in the shower and the big bottles get wet, they tend to get slippery and hard to work with. These pumps help you avoid all of that...:) Also received very quickly &amp; packed carefully!</li>
            <li> Bought a few others but this one works great and wears better.</li>
            <li> Fit the Redken shampoo and conditioner bottles I purchased. Awesome!</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> worked just as i had hoped they would. bought them with biolage liter set</li>
            <li> Thank you item arrived quick and love that its a set of 4 even though i really just needed two but when i buy my next set of shampoos in about 6 months i&#x27;ll have these ready</li>
            <li> 0/4 pumps worked! Junk</li>
            <li> These DO fit the large salon sized Kerastase bottles - but they are a little long (about an inch) the first one I used I cut the bottom off a little (you need strong scissors) the second one I just pushed it down so the tube part curled around in the bottom.  Screw top fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Claimed this would fit a 33.8 oz bottle. I bought these for a Pureology bottle and there is still at least 3 inches at the bottom of the bottle that can&#x27;t be reached by the pump. Great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pumps, what more can I say, they work and do the job as described</li>
            <li> These are a great deal. Good value for money.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected. They work well.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product. I have used this shampoo for 9 years now, it is the finest for me at this time., The pumps are high quality.</li>
            <li> Great heavy duty pumps. I really enjoy using these with my large bottles in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality pumps.</li>
            <li> They are hard to get to pop up.</li>
            <li> These suck! You can barely pump any product out and it takes forever for the pump to come back up for you to pump again for product. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> I use these on each of our large shampoo and conditioner bottles. No longer do you have to risk dropping a slippery-wet heavy shampoo bottle on your toes!</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s for a liter bottle yet they are too short</li>
            <li> So far these work great! I needed them for my 33.8 ounce shampoo and conditioner.  Great price for four pumps.</li>
            <li> received exactly what I expected, in perfect condition. they came quickly - I ordered two other things on the same day which both took twice as long as these pumps. they work great, I&#x27;ve had no problems at all. very pleased!</li>
            <li> Did not match the Redken Color Extend Shampoo and Conditioner bottles.  So, it was worthless and I am returning them.</li>
            <li> If you have a 33.8 oz shampoo/conditioner type bottle this pump was the perfect solution. Because of the weight of these bottles I hadn&#x27;t bought them until I found these pumps.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pumps are working good so far.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Only needed two may never need to use the other two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought any before so I don&#x27;t really know the difference.  But compared to others that have come with the bottles these seem to wrok very well.</li>
            <li> These pumps are really nice and handy to have.  They fit 33.8 oz. liter bottles perfectly.  They were a good buy.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fits several brands of liter shampoos.</li>
            <li> These pumps worked perfectly.  After trying what was available in a local beauty store I was disappointed.  So glad I ordered these.</li>
            <li> These pumps aren&#x27;t black as pictured, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Tubing not deep enough by far for Redken liter bottle.</li>
            <li> Does the trick but I was disappointed that the description and picture indicated that these were black/dark and when they showed up they were white. Otherwise though, they serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Not the Redken pump.  These are the cheap over the counter replacement pumps for regular shampoos.  These are not the larger Redken pumps they claim to be.  I&#x27;m sure they work but were not what I was looking for, it was not worth the time to return them as they were not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Item delivered quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> I end up unscrewing and dumping the soap in my hand because each pump only give you a tiny squirt and it takes literally forever.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.  I don&#x27;t anticipate they will last very long.  Price was right though.</li>
            <li> They fits my Redken Shampoo and Conditioner bottles perfectly. In the shower, they make handling the wet, heavy bottles safer and  easier.</li>
            <li> love this pumps with the bigger bottles of Redken shampoo and conditioner.  It makes it much easier in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought the giant bottles of shampoo and conditioner but never thought about how awkward it was going to be to get the product out of the bottles.  Once my pumps came, however, I could easily get just the right amount of product out without lifting and squeezing the big bottles and I did it with only one pump!  Well worth the little bit of money I spent on them!</li>
            <li> Great to have for large shampoo bottles so don&#x27;t have to pour into smaller ones. Having extras is great so I can use some for other bottles.</li>
            <li> SHORT pumps... I have several sets of pumps these are by far the shortest only go a little over halfway down into the bottle.... there for you will be stuck turning bottle upside down for last 1/3 or so of it!! also the one i got were white not black as shown( not a huge deal) but would of been nice to properly list them!</li>
            <li> They work and make it very easy to utilze the Redken products I&#x27;ve purchased. Good price and they are functional.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and pump a tiny bit of shampoo out so that you have to do quit a few pumps to get enough shampoo.  Would not buy them again</li>
            <li> Work great, easy to trim to correct size</li>
            <li> Fail. These pumps will NOT work for shampoo/Conditioner. Spring is too short and tube is too narrow. Don&#x27;t waste ur $$.</li>
            <li> The tubes are too short.</li>
            <li> None of the 4 worked.</li>
            <li> When purchasing the bigger shampoo and conditioners, you&#x27;d think the pump would come with the product.  The pump works fine, it&#x27;s just a little cheesy to have to buy seperately and not in a two pack but a three pack. What&#x27;s up with that?</li>
            <li> I dunno how I would have these huge bottles and not a pump for them. These are great and help keep the usage consistent as well.</li>
            <li> These fit the Redken bottles perfectly!  So much easier than having to pick up the big bottles all the time.</li>
