            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Best Fine Line Trimmer I have ever used</li>
            <li>This product is not as good as the Remington.</li>
            <li>Besides scratching, it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>But even if they all did that, I would still buy it because it works so good.</li>
            <li>This is certainly a good price, but it does not have a lot of \\&quot;horse power\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>But when it works it does a good job.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with all the features but once using it I wasn&#x27;t so happy.</li>
            <li>These will be gifts for family &amp; friends as I have really enjoyed have one for me!</li>
            <li>&gt;  would let others make their own choice.</li>
            <li>There must be a an effective trimmer out there; buy that one instead.</li>
            <li>I LIKED THE DESIGN</li>
            <li>does what says--great hit for travelling teens/campers--any one who needs a reliable cost effective shaver</li>
            <li>Handy for shaving your nape</li>
            <li>I thought being a Conair product that it would work great and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Conair LT3WB Dual Blade Fine Line Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I blame myself for not reading the reviews first, but I got suckered in by the Conair name (it&#x27;s a well-known brand) and the attractive price.</li>
            <li>product is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It works fine, looks nice.</li>
            <li>I bought mine more than 6 years ago and now it broke.</li>
            <li>that are better.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these about five years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Perfect tool to remove facial hair</li>
            <li>i would find a better one i wish i had.</li>
            <li>Saw it advertised, worked ok for a while then would not shave , like blade was dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best natural light is in the car.</li>
            <li>I was glad to be able to purchase them from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Definitely get this, great purchase!</li>
            <li>and I was so glad to see I could still get another one like it.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver - works well - easy to use and has some good power to it!</li>
            <li>cuts nice and leaves your face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I use it on my eyebrows and face, it is gentle and does a good job.</li>
            <li>its fat and isn&#x27;t easy to use..</li>
            <li>Clogged really easily too.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Ease of use and easy to stow away,  make it a must have for use on the go.</li>
            <li>so I though it would be good to get a new one.</li>
            <li>It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do and fills its hair-removal niche just fine.</li>
            <li>Great product for facial hari</li>
            <li>In fact it worked great for a total of 6 times!!!</li>
            <li>AND IT IS REALLY CHEAP</li>
            <li>Cheap, broke after using 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li>I have used many different types of personal razors and the Conair is the best!</li>
            <li>I use this to clean up my eyebrows or on my hands.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the more positive part of this review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a super great, strong trimmer</li>
            <li>I like this product, it is what I ordered and does what it claims to do; I am pretty happy with it overall.</li>
            <li>Good product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I had purchased one several years ago and loved the results.  </li>
            <li>Nice replacement for my old one.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my last trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Changing the battery is pretty easy too.</li>
            <li>works well for shaping eyebrows etc., but you had better have a steady hand.  </li>
            <li>I put in a fresh battery, made sure the blades were clean and not jammed and tried again.</li>
            <li>I far more recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Then it was worth the price of the battery.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does it&#x27;s job very well, now only if I could keep my pesky facial hairs away, I&#x27;d be great!</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Loved that it was included with other orders to save shipping.  </li>
            <li>it just slides right off.</li>
            <li>i use this for my eye brows and to clean up my husbands eye brows sometimes.. and it pulls hair and doesn&#x27;t have much power no matter what batteries you use it</li>
            <li>This works fabulously and efficiently to easily rid my face of facial hair</li>
            <li>Dissatisfied with trimmer not as good as the Panasonic bought from a store for less than 10 dollars.  </li>
            <li>Did not work well, it snagged and pulled, it hurt very much.</li>
            <li>First off the items says it takes AA batteries when I got in here</li>
            <li>Better quality than the last trimmer that I bought.</li>
            <li>It broke after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s portable and pretty.  </li>
            <li>My niece gave me my first one</li>
            <li>When I first got the trimmer</li>
            <li>I gave it one star because it pretty much broke and fell apart as soon as I opened the packaging.</li>
            <li>We use it for trimming eyebrows and other facial areas, we love it!!  </li>
            <li>I had to repair the item, and as we all know the only way to repair it is to take it apart forcefully, because there are no screws that makes repair easy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t trim anything other than very fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I use it to remove fine facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, excellente price.</li>
            <li>Purchased the trimmer, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Did not remove any hair at all, cost me to much to return it, but I would advise against purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Love anything in pink.</li>
            <li>I am wasting so much money on trying these.</li>
            <li>In my opinion they changed this too much.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very flimsy.</li>
            <li>It scratches your skin and really doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li>The blade is too short and does  not have a smooth feel.</li>
            <li>Have no idea why it needs to much juice to be on for like 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much power, so it doesn&#x27;t remove tons of hair.</li>
            <li>It eats up batteries really fast and the lid falls off all the time.</li>
            <li>Purchased one similar at a department store and this is by far better made and has lasted longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not used it for any purpose other than trimming interior nose hair, and for this it works better than any nose trimmer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other trimmers out there</li>
            <li>The batteries last a long time in it, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>My original Conair trimmer finally quit working</li>
            <li>Works better than other trimmers Ive bought!</li>
            <li>Took it out of the box, put a new battery in, switched it on, and...nothing!</li>
            <li>I have purchased better quality for less $.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those random lip hairs and facial fuzz.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to replace an older model that I had, that was silver.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just a malfunction this particular one has.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace another older one I had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fatter instead of the older slimmer model</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you think seven months is okay.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave right to the skin but gets the hair very short, without pulling or scraping.</li>
            <li>I tried new batteries, repositioning the cover......</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my niece as well as a new one for me.  </li>
            <li>I will be looking for a new trimmer asap.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it and bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I chose to send it back, then later changed my mind due to the shipping being more than it was worth to me.</li>
            <li>You money would be better spent on something that actually works</li>
            <li>Easy to use and batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li>First I stole the customs never arrived and the second does not work.</li>
            <li>FIRST ONE I BOUGHT ONLY LASTED 3 MONTHS.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, it&#x27;s just not very good.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and works a little.</li>
            <li>I was completely unsatisfied by the product I received.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to replace my old one that I could no longer find.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised when I got my package today and opened it up.</li>
            <li>Really that is just a extra bonus for me.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve demanded a refund or replacement from Amazon, but shipping it back would&#x27;ve cost as much as the product.</li>
            <li>When you reach 60 years old, hair grows places it never did before, and where it had been growing</li>
            <li>it goes wild</li>
            <li>I used this once, and it worked, but didn&#x27;t seem to have much power, but the second time I went to use it, it would not turn on at all.</li>
            <li>only twice so don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but it did the job quickly and without faltering.</li>
            <li>The small one is very useful for shaping eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Installed a new battery and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li>I went to big box store in town and bought new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these trimmers for a a long time, and they usually work great and last several years, but this one was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a real problem with the product, but given the picture, I was a little surprised when it arrived and was hot pink.  </li>
            <li>Works barely and uses batteries a lot</li>
            <li>Love the little hidden brush- never have to worry about losing it!</li>
            <li>How I wish that I could replace my old shaver (different company) but only saw this.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old one of a different brand and thought it work in a similar fashion however it doesn&#x27;t seem to move as efficiently and the power seems to be lower.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last terribly long though--I have to get a new one about once a year.  </li>

            <li> It broke after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s portable and pretty.  </li>
            <li> My niece gave me my first one</li>
            <li> When I first got the trimmer</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because it pretty much broke and fell apart as soon as I opened the packaging.</li>
            <li> We use it for trimming eyebrows and other facial areas, we love it!!  </li>
            <li> I had to repair the item, and as we all know the only way to repair it is to take it apart forcefully, because there are no screws that makes repair easy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim anything other than very fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I use it to remove fine facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellente price.</li>
            <li> Purchased the trimmer, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Did not remove any hair at all, cost me to much to return it, but I would advise against purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Love anything in pink.</li>
            <li> I am wasting so much money on trying these.</li>
            <li> In my opinion they changed this too much.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very flimsy.</li>
            <li> It scratches your skin and really doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
            <li> The blade is too short and does  not have a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> Have no idea why it needs to much juice to be on for like 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much power, so it doesn&#x27;t remove tons of hair.</li>
            <li> It eats up batteries really fast and the lid falls off all the time.</li>
            <li> Purchased one similar at a department store and this is by far better made and has lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it for any purpose other than trimming interior nose hair, and for this it works better than any nose trimmer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other trimmers out there</li>
            <li> The batteries last a long time in it, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My original Conair trimmer finally quit working</li>
            <li> Works better than other trimmers Ive bought!</li>
            <li> Took it out of the box, put a new battery in, switched it on, and...nothing!</li>
            <li> I have purchased better quality for less $.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those random lip hairs and facial fuzz.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to replace an older model that I had, that was silver.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just a malfunction this particular one has.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace another older one I had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fatter instead of the older slimmer model</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you think seven months is okay.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave right to the skin but gets the hair very short, without pulling or scraping.</li>
            <li> I tried new batteries, repositioning the cover......</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece as well as a new one for me.  </li>
            <li> I will be looking for a new trimmer asap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it and bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I chose to send it back, then later changed my mind due to the shipping being more than it was worth to me.</li>
            <li> You money would be better spent on something that actually works</li>
            <li> Easy to use and batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li> First I stole the customs never arrived and the second does not work.</li>
            <li> FIRST ONE I BOUGHT ONLY LASTED 3 MONTHS.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, it&#x27;s just not very good.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and works a little.</li>
            <li> I was completely unsatisfied by the product I received.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my old one that I could no longer find.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I got my package today and opened it up.</li>
            <li> Really that is just a extra bonus for me.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve demanded a refund or replacement from Amazon, but shipping it back would&#x27;ve cost as much as the product.</li>
            <li> When you reach 60 years old, hair grows places it never did before, and where it had been growing</li>
            <li> it goes wild</li>
            <li> I used this once, and it worked, but didn&#x27;t seem to have much power, but the second time I went to use it, it would not turn on at all.</li>
            <li> only twice so don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but it did the job quickly and without faltering.</li>
            <li> The small one is very useful for shaping eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Installed a new battery and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> I went to big box store in town and bought new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these trimmers for a a long time, and they usually work great and last several years, but this one was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a real problem with the product, but given the picture, I was a little surprised when it arrived and was hot pink.  </li>
            <li> Works barely and uses batteries a lot</li>
            <li> Love the little hidden brush- never have to worry about losing it!</li>
            <li> How I wish that I could replace my old shaver (different company) but only saw this.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old one of a different brand and thought it work in a similar fashion however it doesn&#x27;t seem to move as efficiently and the power seems to be lower.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last terribly long though--I have to get a new one about once a year.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old trimmer that had gone dull and sad to say that it works better than this brand new trimmer.</li>
            <li> First, the casing is too big, making it clumsy to handle.</li>
            <li> This thing gets hot super fast and kinda sucks at cutting my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Although I do like the look of it in not expecting this to last for very long.</li>
            <li> It comes with the usual eyebrow trimmer than can be set to long or short, but what made this model stand out for me is that there is a full length blade on one side for larger jobs and a half sized blade on the other side for tighter jobs, like under your eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this little trimmer on my sensitive body parts to trim things up.</li>
            <li> It scratches uncomfortably, and does not give a smooth result.</li>
            <li> all nose trimmers, for me at least, it really tickles.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was pink instead of the advertised silver and not only this</li>
            <li> B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Groomer, Pink]]</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth making a big deal over.</li>
            <li> the overall construction is poor, the housing of the main unit is always falling off and the motor is way underpowered.</li>
            <li> But hurts and scrapes the face and mows down facial hair, not cut it.</li>
            <li> It is slender enough and the blade small enough to mow down hair well inside each nostril and maneuver along the inner surface.</li>
            <li> I had a similar product by Remington previously, but gave it to a friend and then wanted to replace it.</li>
            <li> The color of the case seems to be only difference between the women&#x27;s (pink) and the men&#x27;s (black).</li>
            <li> My only dislike is the little cap that comes with it won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Does work but a bit hard on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Well it arrived with a pink case not too trilled about that.</li>
            <li> Does remove hair, just not very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these for back up.</li>
            <li> it never worked for her.never expected something like this to happen when buying thing of a known brand.</li>
            <li> Also it just doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs as closely as my old one did and even though my older one is wearing out and falling apart find myself going back to using that one :-(</li>
            <li> only complaint isn&#x27;t limited to this model, it is for all of them.  </li>
            <li> but it does the small jobs nicely, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Any other stubble it can&#x27;t handle.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li> I usually purchase a trimmer in my local drugstore but due to the weather, I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> I have bought other personal trimmers in the past.</li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s a little harder to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Yes I have tried other brands and models but they just don&#x27;t hold a candle to this little trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had lost my makeup bag a few months ago and I had my other trimmer in there</li>
            <li> It worked but it did a half ass job.</li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve used a $11 one purchased from Walgreens and it lasted years before the battery died.</li>
            <li> The handle seems a bit heavier duty than others I have had, but the blade seems to cut less well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is that it can be finicky about the battery and having it in just right, that can be annoying.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because after the 3rd time it got really dull and started ripping instead of shaving!</li>
            <li> but it had little pieces of hair on it when I took it out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like these little trimmers, as we all have to deal with unwanted hair at times.  </li>
            <li> always sounds like they are going dead..</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t waste your money buy something else.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my eyebrows, and what every else give me trouble.</li>
            <li> It is totally dead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a small brush cleverly hidden in the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> Those guides are small and easily misplaced.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to be too small for the battery;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to get done any heavy duty stuff!  </li>
            <li> They usually don&#x27;t cut great,with hair getting caught and pulling, etc...</li>
            <li> After this fiasco, I went to CVS to get my usual $11 one</li>
            <li> The item was too small to use, even for a woman&#x27;s nasal hair.  </li>
            <li> I could still use it, but it hardly worked at all--the blades are postitioned badly and if it manages to cut a hair, it will not do so very closely to the skin.</li>
            <li> it is just a mess!!</li>
            <li> As a woman who needs a delicate touch, this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!!</li>
            <li> Not the battery just stopped working not a good deal at all.</li>
            <li> This product is no good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong.  </li>
            <li> Not great.  </li>
            <li> but the design is poor.  </li>
            <li> Not a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The blades are positioned very badly, barely above the base, so you cannot maneuver it close or well to where you want to trim hair.</li>
            <li> Then I bought a Remington and hated it; the Remington stops working when the hair you are trimming is too long.</li>
            <li> Boy was I WRONG.  </li>
            <li> This thing is useless.  </li>
            <li> WILL PROBABLY UPGRADE WHEN THIS ONE FAILS</li>
            <li> out of the box did not work but did not return as to expensive too do so.</li>
            <li> This product was mediocre.</li>
            <li> Haphazard cutting, flimsy quality.</li>
            <li> you want one that works disappointment</li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li> My bad luck out of country so can&#x27;t even return.</li>
            <li> This is a bad product.</li>
            <li> Just my practical disappointed opinion.  </li>
            <li> SO unhappy!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Save your money and the pain and grief: use tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed in Conair.</li>
            <li> weird!!!</li>
            <li> Taking it out of the package was a waist of time because it was always broken!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First off the items says it takes AA batteries when I got in here it takes AAA batteries I called amazon they said they where going to change the information that it was a typo. the overall construction is poor, the housing of the main unit is always falling off and the motor is way underpowered. It seems that the trend for these is to go that way toward aaa battery power which results in a smaller motor so the batteries last longer, but then they do not work as well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellente price.</li>
            <li> I had a similar product by Remington previously, but gave it to a friend and then wanted to replace it. This product is not as good as the Remington. It scratches uncomfortably, and does not give a smooth result. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> works well for shaping eyebrows etc., but you had better have a steady hand.  They don&#x27;t last terribly long though--I have to get a new one about once a year.  I consider it a must in my beauty kit.</li>
            <li> I bought mine more than 6 years ago and now it broke. Then I bought a Remington and hated it; the Remington stops working when the hair you are trimming is too long. Not to mention that it&#x27;s not well manufactured and it seems to be too small for the battery; weird!!! I&#x27;m gonna give it away and purchase the Connair again! Never had any problems with my Conair !</li>
            <li> I was completely unsatisfied by the product I received. The trimmer was pink instead of the advertised silver and not only this but it had little pieces of hair on it when I took it out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> Haphazard cutting, flimsy quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my old one that I could no longer find. It is very uncomfortable on my skin. I do not like it.</li>
            <li> Purchased the trimmer, it works very well. Perfect for those random lip hairs and facial fuzz.  Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace one that had just worn out.  It comes with the usual eyebrow trimmer than can be set to long or short, but what made this model stand out for me is that there is a full length blade on one side for larger jobs and a half sized blade on the other side for tighter jobs, like under your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has very good power and the batteries have lasted forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint isn&#x27;t limited to this model, it is for all of them.  Why do they make a cap that can&#x27;t be used unless you remove the eyebrow guide?  Those guides are small and easily misplaced.  When will the manufacturers come up with a design that will allow us to put the cap on to protect the blades but also give us a way to attach the eyebrow guide to the trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that reason I am taking away a star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Works great! Better quality than the last trimmer that I bought. Love the little hidden brush- never have to worry about losing it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as close as I would like but does the job!</li>
            <li> I have used many different types of personal razors and the Conair is the best! I use them in my laser practice every day!</li>
            <li> I have used or  tried to use the Conair trimmer for several months. It doesn&#x27;t always start. I have to remove the battery and reinsert it several times. Also, it doesn&#x27;t always trim hair in the nose. It will cut but only after you keep going over the same area again and again.</li>
            <li> I was not sastisfied at all. I bought this to replace my old trimmer that had gone dull and sad to say that it works better than this brand new trimmer. It does not get a close shave and still left fuzz. Will be replacing it.</li>
            <li> Did not remove any hair at all, cost me to much to return it, but I would advise against purchasing it.</li>
            <li> How I wish that I could replace my old shaver (different company) but only saw this. It just doesn&#x27;t cut it. Yes,pun intended. But hurts and scrapes the face and mows down facial hair, not cut it. Just my practical disappointed opinion.  SEL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it for any purpose other than trimming interior nose hair, and for this it works better than any nose trimmer I&#x27;ve tried. It is slender enough and the blade small enough to mow down hair well inside each nostril and maneuver along the inner surface. It doesn&#x27;t shave right to the skin but gets the hair very short, without pulling or scraping. It may help that I&#x27;m cautious about not applying pressure.&lt;br /&gt;There is a small brush cleverly hidden in the battery compartment. The blade assembly comes apart for cleaning but it&#x27;s tricky to reassemble. I used tweezers to pull the catch back into place.&lt;br /&gt;Like all nose trimmers, for me at least, it really tickles. I&#x27;ve used it only twice so don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but it did the job quickly and without faltering.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!! Besides scratching, it just doesn&#x27;t do a good job. I would never buy another Conair product!</li>
            <li> Being a man I use this for trimming my nose and ear hair, and for that it works great.</li>
            <li> This thing gets hot super fast and kinda sucks at cutting my eyebrows. Although I do like the look of it in not expecting this to last for very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other trimmers out there that are better. It&#x27;s not terrible, it&#x27;s just not very good.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work well at all</li>
            <li> I use this often and it works great.</li>
            <li> I received my product and it was not functional. I submited a complain to the provider by calling and asking them to replace the product, and even though I have called 4 times, the product has not been replaced. it is just a mess!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super great, strong trimmer but it does the small jobs nicely, especially for the price.  It takes care of the brow hair, upperlip hair, nostril hair, etc.  Don&#x27;t expect to get done any heavy duty stuff!  Changing the battery is pretty easy too.</li>
            <li> Works Great!!!  We use it for trimming eyebrows and other facial areas, we love it!!  cuts nice and leaves your face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I got this at a discount store and before I could even use it--I lost the tiny, tiny screw at the bottom putting the battery in. I could still use it, but it hardly worked at all--the blades are postitioned badly and if it manages to cut a hair, it will not do so very closely to the skin. Combined with the tendency to fall apart too easily--I can&#x27;t recommend this product at all. I far more recommend [[ASIN:B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Groomer, Pink]]</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great.  I bought it to replace an older model that I had, that was silver.  this one is noisier than the silver one, but it works just as well.  I use it on my face to trim the peach fuzz hair that I get along my jawline.</li>
            <li> It was defective and didn&#x27;t work, so I either had to throw it away or send it back. I chose to send it back, then later changed my mind due to the shipping being more than it was worth to me. Then I found out later that my request to send it back generated the automatic shipment of another SO I have to send back the defective one or be charged for them both!</li>
            <li> Well it arrived with a pink case not too trilled about that. Work well for a couple week changed the batteries several times. Not the battery just stopped working not a good deal at all.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about five years ago and fell in love with it. I have tried to find them again with no luck. Yes I have tried other brands and models but they just don&#x27;t hold a candle to this little trimmer. I was blown away when I found it here on Amazon. I was really surprised when I got my package today and opened it up. Not only was it the same brand and model as my old one, BUT it was also pink. It shows silver in the picture. Really that is just a extra bonus for me. Love anything in pink.</li>
            <li> when i received this product and put in the batteries correctly, it wasn&#x27;t working... I had to repair the item, and as we all know the only way to repair it is to take it apart forcefully, because there are no screws that makes repair easy. then putting it back together, was another hassle, because now it won&#x27;t close properly, it&#x27;s tied together with masking tape...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these for awhile to have \\&quot;on the go\\&quot;. I based my purchase of this item on the reviews and this time it didn&#x27;t work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very cheaply made. The cap falls off constantly and I have to shake it to get it to work. It doesn&#x27;t trim anything other than very fine hairs. Any other stubble it can&#x27;t handle.  I&#x27;ll never buy again.</li>
            <li> It has been said that \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot; The manufacturer would have to pay ME to use another one of these. It barely held together long enough to get a battery installed! Then it was worth the price of the battery. Save your money and the pain and grief: use tweezers. They are an improvement over this battery-powered hair plucker.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool to remove facial hair</li>
            <li> its fat and isn&#x27;t easy to use.. i use this for my eye brows and to clean up my husbands eye brows sometimes.. and it pulls hair and doesn&#x27;t have much power no matter what batteries you use it always sounds like they are going dead.. i would find a better one i wish i had.</li>
            <li> It broke after the first time I used it. The motor just went out. Won&#x27;t waste your money buy something else.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a real problem with the product, but given the picture, I was a little surprised when it arrived and was hot pink.  Not exactly what I was looking for... but it&#x27;s not worth making a big deal over.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase a trimmer in my local drugstore but due to the weather, I decided to try this one.  I thought being a Conair product that it would work great and the price was right.  Boy was I WRONG.  It has not worked well since purchase.  It pulls the hair instead of doing a neat trim or simply doesn&#x27;t cut the hair at all.  I will not make the mistake of buying a product like this online again.  Very, very disappointed in Conair.</li>
            <li> Not great.  I prefer to use a razor still.  But sufficient if you don&#x27;t have time to shave.</li>
            <li> Good product especially for the price. Purchased one similar at a department store and this is by far better made and has lasted longer.</li>
            <li> It worked but it did a half ass job. Misses a lot of hairs in the process. You money would be better spent on something that actually works</li>
            <li> This trimmer performed well for me and did not disappoint.  I use it to remove fine facial hair.  It&#x27;s not a razor, folks, so recognize it&#x27;s limitations and it&#x27;s strengths.  It does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do and fills its hair-removal niche just fine. It&#x27;s portable and pretty.  My niece gave me my first one and I gave my sister one, which she loves.  So what if they don&#x27;t last forever; at this price, who cares!  The color of the case seems to be only difference between the women&#x27;s (pink) and the men&#x27;s (black).</li>
            <li> The razor works well but the design is poor.  The lid will not click into place and will not stay on.  I do like that there are three sizes of razors.  The small one is very useful for shaping eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Did not work well, it snagged and pulled, it hurt very much. Shame I am wasting so much money on trying these.</li>
            <li> Waist of money. It never worked. Taking it out of the package was a waist of time because it was always broken!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong.  It definitely does not work like my mom&#x27;s.  Does remove hair, just not very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great! You can&#x27;t beat the price either, cheaper than local drugstore prices and this trimmer comes with 2 blade sizes. Def recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works just great for eyebrows.  Loved that it was included with other orders to save shipping.  Just what I wanted for not a lot of money.</li>
            <li> l found it didn&#x27;t work at all so l was very up happy about this product</li>
            <li> Broke after only a couple of uses. Clogged really easily too.</li>
            <li> The equipment does not work I put the battery and ignition and does not work. q is the second time I buy it and I could not use any. First I stole the customs never arrived and the second does not work. you want one that works disappointment</li>
            <li> Saw it advertised, worked ok for a while then would not shave , like blade was dull.&lt;br /&gt;  would let others make their own choice.</li>
            <li> This is great and I use it whenever I have the need. The batteries last a long time in it, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked for seven months and then just died.  I tried new batteries, repositioning the cover......nope, nothing.  I am going to try a different brand.  Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you think seven months is okay.</li>
            <li> This is the only face shaver that evenly removes facial hair. Perfect for shaping brows too. I bought a few of these for back up.</li>
            <li> I had a different brand before and lost it...couldn&#x27;t find the same one so I bought this. SO unhappy! It makes your hair feel like stubble! It just doesn&#x27;t get close enough. It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver - works well - easy to use and has some good power to it!</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my noise hair. Yes, occasionally women need to landscape that area too! Works better than other trimmers Ive bought!</li>
            <li> Great product for facial hari</li>
            <li> I had one of these before so I though it would be good to get a new one. I put batteries in it and it didn&#x27;t work. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great to keep in the purse. The best natural light is in the car. See a hair that shouldn&#x27;t be there &amp; it wasn&#x27;t even visible in the mirror over the sink? It works great.</li>
            <li> This things is great! I have bought other personal trimmers in the past. They usually don&#x27;t cut great,with hair getting caught and pulling, etc... but this one works wonderfully! If it ever quits working, I will buy another just like it. My only dislike is the little cap that comes with it won&#x27;t stay on. It doesn&#x27;t snap locked into place. Maybe it&#x27;s just a malfunction this particular one has. But even if they all did that, I would still buy it because it works so good. It&#x27;s very quiet while running too.</li>
            <li> Ignored others who said not to buy this! Yes, it works for first few times! In fact it worked great for a total of 6 times!!! Will not be buying again!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and batteries last a long time.  Does work but a bit hard on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.  I bought it to replace another older one I had.  This thing is useless.  It doesn&#x27;t cut/shave facial hair at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. There must be a an effective trimmer out there; buy that one instead.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Conair LT3WB Dual Blade Fine Line Trimmer.  I had purchased one several years ago and loved the results.  This was a gift for my niece as well as a new one for me.  I was glad to be able to purchase them from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> FIRST ONE I BOUGHT ONLY LASTED 3 MONTHS.  I LIKED THE DESIGN AND IT IS REALLY CHEAP SO I ORDERED ANOTHER.  WILL PROBABLY UPGRADE WHEN THIS ONE FAILS</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because it pretty much broke and fell apart as soon as I opened the packaging. I would&#x27;ve demanded a refund or replacement from Amazon, but shipping it back would&#x27;ve cost as much as the product. Previously, I&#x27;ve used a $11 one purchased from Walgreens and it lasted years before the battery died. After this fiasco, I went to CVS to get my usual $11 one and it works great.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does it&#x27;s job very well, now only if I could keep my pesky facial hairs away, I&#x27;d be great!</li>
            <li> In my opinion they changed this too much. It&#x27;s fatter instead of the older slimmer model and so it&#x27;s a little harder to maneuver. Also it just doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs as closely as my old one did and even though my older one is wearing out and falling apart find myself going back to using that one :-(</li>
            <li> I had lost my makeup bag a few months ago and I had my other trimmer in there so I had to get me another one bc they are so great! Definitely get this, great purchase!</li>
            <li> does what says--great hit for travelling teens/campers--any one who needs a reliable cost effective shaver</li>
            <li> I returned this product. I installed the battery and started using the trimmer and after about 2 min. of use it died. Installed a new battery and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  Works like a charm,  i like it alot and and and and and and and and adn</li>
            <li> Cheap, broke after using 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> Ordered the item for a gifting and it was such a big embarrassment it never worked for her.never expected something like this to happen when buying thing of a known brand.My bad luck out of country so can&#x27;t even return.</li>
            <li> When I first got the trimmer I was really pleased with all the features but once using it I wasn&#x27;t so happy. It does not do a close shave at ALL!!! I will be looking for a new trimmer asap.</li>
            <li> The item was too small to use, even for a woman&#x27;s nasal hair.  I found it to be very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Dissatisfied with trimmer not as good as the Panasonic bought from a store for less than 10 dollars.  Works barely and uses batteries a lot</li>
            <li> The handle seems a bit heavier duty than others I have had, but the blade seems to cut less well.&lt;br /&gt;I have only had it a couple of months, so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. It scratches your skin and really doesn&#x27;t cut very well. Used it once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Handy for shaving your nape</li>
            <li> Not a great trimmer.  I bought this to replace an old one of a different brand and thought it work in a similar fashion however it doesn&#x27;t seem to move as efficiently and the power seems to be lower.  I didn&#x27;t like it and bought a new one.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, arrived timely and in excellent condition.  Ease of use and easy to stow away,  make it a must have for use on the go.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work when Power &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34;. I think to buy and wait for it is to waist time and money!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is what I ordered and does what it claims to do; I am pretty happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works,to a point.The blade is too short and does  not have a smooth feel.I have purchased better quality for less $.</li>
            <li> out of the box did not work but did not return as to expensive too do so.I went to big box store in town and bought new one. If I had to return it would not have been a problem,</li>
            <li> This is certainly a good price, but it does not have a lot of \\&quot;horse power\\&quot;. You have to go over areas a couple of times. It works fine, looks nice. It&#x27;s just not an \\&quot;A\\&quot;. It is what it is for the value.</li>
            <li> This works well but it goes thru 2 batteries like after 4-5 uses. Have no idea why it needs to much juice to be on for like 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li> This product was mediocre. It doesn&#x27;t have much power, so it doesn&#x27;t remove tons of hair. I use this to clean up my eyebrows or on my hands. It&#x27;s pretty small, so you can put it in your purse or something for emergencies.</li>
            <li> This works fabulously and efficiently to easily rid my face of facial hair and I also use it to trim the hair on the back of my neck. As a woman who needs a delicate touch, this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I use this little trimmer on my sensitive body parts to trim things up. Another great product for a great price. These trimmers are just for women and work great. Another great Amazon deal.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I thought it would be. Have to go over the unwanted hair area 2/3 times to remove the unwanted hair. But it serves the purpose for unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I like this. I use it on my eyebrows and face, it is gentle and does a good job. The only issue I have with it is that it can be finicky about the battery and having it in just right, that can be annoying. But when it works it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I like these little trimmers, as we all have to deal with unwanted hair at times.  These will be gifts for family &amp; friends as I have really enjoyed have one for me!</li>
            <li> It is light weight and works a little. It eats up batteries really fast and the lid falls off all the time. I stopped using it because after the 3rd time it got really dull and started ripping instead of shaving!</li>
            <li> Nice replacement for my old one. My original Conair trimmer finally quit working and I was so glad to see I could still get another one like it. I use it to trim my eyebrows, and what every else give me trouble. When you reach 60 years old, hair grows places it never did before, and where it had been growing it goes wild (eyebrows would look like Andy Rooney&#x27;s if I don&#x27;t trim them)</li>
            <li> I blame myself for not reading the reviews first, but I got suckered in by the Conair name (it&#x27;s a well-known brand) and the attractive price. Well, you get what you pay for, despite the name. This is a bad product. First, the casing is too big, making it clumsy to handle. The blades are positioned very badly, barely above the base, so you cannot maneuver it close or well to where you want to trim hair. That&#x27;s the more positive part of this review. I used this once, and it worked, but didn&#x27;t seem to have much power, but the second time I went to use it, it would not turn on at all. I put in a fresh battery, made sure the blades were clean and not jammed and tried again. It is totally dead. I&#x27;ve been using these trimmers for a a long time, and they usually work great and last several years, but this one was a complete waste of money. Unfortunately, it would cost more in time and dollars to send it back for a replacement. I will never buy another one of their products.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have no complaints about this product. Had one and wanted another so this one did the job.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my last trimmer.  Constantly having to jiggle this one.</li>
            <li> This product is no good.I Guess you get what you pay for.This item does not do the job at all.Wouldn&#x27;t recomend.</li>
            <li> Took it out of the box, put a new battery in, switched it on, and...nothing! The product never worked. Even if it had, the cap doesn&#x27;t even stay on...it just slides right off.</li>
            <li> Best Fine Line Trimmer I have ever used</li>
            <li> Great product. Once I found out that waxing will actually age my skin, this product was a life savor. Or skin savor I should say.</li>
