            <li>Thanks, Coppola, for making my hair days good days.</li>

            <li>I also love the smell that is a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>How refreshing to buy something for the first time, and it lives up to it&#x27;s name.</li>

            <li>Nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it takes care of my hair and makes it feel alive, smooth and adds body.  </li>
            <li>Provides just the right amount of conditioning without weighing down my abundant but very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying in the salon, and it&#x27;s the same great product that leaves my dyed, processed hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>I use it along with the shampoo and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice; sort of clean and nondescript (almost like laundry soap),but not strong, which I like.</li>

            <li>I really like it and has helped my hair.</li>
            <li>It made my hair much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I do like the feel of my hair since purchasing this product, it seems softer, easier to untangle, and since using it, I do not have to dye my hair as much.</li>
            <li>Very sleazy practice.</li>
            <li>Works well with other shampoos, but best results with Coppola Keratin Complex Shampoo.</li>
            <li>But, as long as the product keeps my hair looking young and full of life, I will keep on using it.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair shiny and soft too!</li>
            <li>Hair soft, color stays.</li>
            <li>Recently, I have begun using the Coppola Keratin Complex Intense Rx, and that is a fabulous addition to my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the same product I have used for the last two years, at a much, much lower price than I was paying at my salon or other retail outlets.</li>

            <li> this will too but only using a tiny amount it does not make it flat.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this shampoo/conditoner combo would do much, but it really did!</li>
            <li> the bottles are clearly not the same as picture on site</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and gets frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It can also be dry.  </li>
            <li> I use this after using the Keratin Coppola Shampoo, as it is less expensive than Aveda, does not contain sulfates, and is easily ordered online.</li>

            <li> Works just like any other.</li>
            <li> I imagine it would protect one&#x27;s hair from the typical summer abuses, like chlorine, sun and salt water.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair</li>

            <li> Cheaper than buying in the salon, and it&#x27;s the same great product that leaves my dyed, processed hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and gets frizzy.  This doesn&#x27;t take away all the frizziness but does make it managable.  I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years after a Keratin treatment.  This was a great price and easy delivery!</li>
            <li> After completing an at home keratin treatment, this is the only product I will use on my hair!  It&#x27;s a must have for Keratin treatments!</li>
            <li> I used to use Pureology Nanoworks.......then I realized I was not financially inclined to be doing so! This stuff makes my thick/course/tangly/highlighted/dry end/oily roots hair manageable. Amen.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is easily weighed down.  It can also be dry.  This conditioner leaves my hair well hydrated and silky smooth.  I also love the smell that is a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Always use the conditioner and shampoo by Keratin.  Buying it at the hair salon was not the same.  Ingredients seemed different: watery.</li>
            <li> I use this after using the Keratin Coppola Shampoo, as it is less expensive than Aveda, does not contain sulfates, and is easily ordered online.</li>
            <li> I use it along with the shampoo and so far I love it. It is pricey but cheaper than other stores. I really like it and has helped my hair. I use it along with Coppola Keratin serum.</li>
            <li> I get 2 or 3 keratin treatments a year and keep my hair highlighted fairly blond.  I have been using the Keratin Complex Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner for a few years now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> After using both shampoo and condition, I&#x27;ve started to see a big difference in the body of my hair. It stopped breaking and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary. Works just like any other. Shipping cost $6. It was placed inside a brown envelope lined with bubbles. Arrived broken and leaking.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, and has helped keep my color from fading as quickly. To caveat - I add a bit of demi-permanent color into the conditioner at each wash and leave it on for 20 minutes. Hair soft, color stays.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It made my hair much softer and smoother. I imagine it would protect one&#x27;s hair from the typical summer abuses, like chlorine, sun and salt water.</li>
            <li> Provides just the right amount of conditioning without weighing down my abundant but very fine hair.  Works well with other shampoos, but best results with Coppola Keratin Complex Shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best detangler of any conditioner on the market! It works great on normal , colored or even bleached hair! I buy it constantly !</li>
            <li> This is the same product I have used for the last two years, at a much, much lower price than I was paying at my salon or other retail outlets.</li>
            <li> the best, My hair looks beutiful and shine!!!</li>
            <li> I was not too sure about this product when I bought it  because my hair is very fine and products make it flat this will too but only using a tiny amount it does not make it flat. Lots of nice shine and makes it grab the curl when you curl it.</li>
            <li> a must for curly/frizzy hair and for all keratin treated hair.  Can&#x27;t do without + my hair always looks good.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo - it&#x27;s a necessity for those of us whose hair is treated with keratin. i swear by it.</li>
            <li> Not the Coppola name as advertised......the bottles are clearly not the same as picture on site</li>
            <li> I have been using the Coppola Keratin Complex color care conditioner and the matching shampoo for at least a year now.  I have thin, dry hair and I love the way it takes care of my hair and makes it feel alive, smooth and adds body.  Recently, I have begun using the Coppola Keratin Complex Intense Rx, and that is a fabulous addition to my hair.  I have just ordered my third bottle of the serum, even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey.  But, as long as the product keeps my hair looking young and full of life, I will keep on using it.  Thanks, Coppola, for making my hair days good days.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Not what I received.&lt;br /&gt;There is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I received the blue bottle, don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this shampoo/conditoner combo would do much, but it really did! My hair is frizzy/curly, but when I used this, it definitely lessened the amount of frizz going on. It also helped to keep my straightened hair straighter, longer. It smells nice; sort of clean and nondescript (almost like laundry soap),but not strong, which I like. It made my hair shiny and soft too!</li>
            <li> great product, great service</li>
            <li> Great Price!For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</li>
            <li> I do like the feel of my hair since purchasing this product, it seems softer, easier to untangle, and since using it, I do not have to dye my hair as much.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture this company doesn&#x27;t send you the Coppola brand pictured they send you \\&quot;smoothing therapy keratin complex\\&quot;.  Mine is being returned.  Very sleazy practice.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is perfect for calming frizz</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different hair care products, and this one is the best!!!! How refreshing to buy something for the first time, and it lives up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
