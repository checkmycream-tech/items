            <li>Anyway I read that the Sebastian products were amazing.</li>
            <li>Today, after I did this I had amazing curls, etc..  </li>
            <li>so we have gummy yucky bottles with a nice product inside -cept</li>
            <li>Great sspray, fast service!</li>
            <li>But normally, this hair spray looks good and smells good.</li>
            <li>However I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really do love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Much prefer Sebastian zero gravity hairspray - great hold without ruining hair.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite styling products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product and have used it for sometime</li>
            <li>Usually I love using Sebastian Re-Shaper.</li>
            <li>I found so many of the brushable sprays just don&#x27;t hold anymore.  </li>
            <li>I use this for special occasions when I want the best hold possible.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the day my hair holds, but still blows in the wind, is soft to the touch, stays put, and the product smells great.</li>
            <li>I loved this product when I lived in the mid-west, but here in florida my hair feels real sticky after applying this product.  </li>
            <li>Great if you want a strong but not stiff hold.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is very important to her, so I&#x27;m very glad we found this product which was recommended in a popular big name magazine.  </li>
            <li>Not that easy to brush out,  </li>
            <li>She loves it because it holds every hair in place, yet it is easy to comb out.  </li>
            <li>it was such a great price...</li>
            <li>It also make arranging my clean hair easy, and keeps it in place.  </li>
            <li>Originally got it in an Allure Beauty Box ages ago.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it smells like baby powder certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt :)</li>
            <li>I recently decided to start wearing side-swept bangs and needed a good hairspray to hold them.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, holds my style great, easy to comb thru, does not leave hair stiff.</li>
            <li>Great hair spray and a large size to last longer.  </li>
            <li>Order shipped quickly, product as described.</li>
            <li>It gives you more volume &amp; the look of having more hair then you actually have.</li>
            <li>At first, I picked up Garnier Fructis Volumizing hairspray with the bamboo extract because it was cheap</li>
            <li>Sebastian, on the other hand, has come up with an amazing product, which is probably why so many people have claimed loyalty to it.     </li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>Now they&#x27;re back and better than ever!</li>
            <li>I first rate 1 star for products in Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have short hair, and I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I barely spray my hair and this gives my hair a more polished look.</li>
            <li>When I go to the gym to work out it seems to absorb excess oils to keep my hair looking as good as possible after a workout, my hair is not stiff or sticky either after my workout, so if I have to I can run into the grocery store, etc.</li>
            <li>Smell was also too strong and stuck to counter and anything else near it.</li>
            <li>I even tried running some hot water on the sprayer, however, that did not help.  </li>
            <li>but most likely wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>I have switched to a different brand that has better made spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I love the hairspray, but the sprayer quits working shortly after you purchase.</li>
            <li>Impressive yet scary.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown away many bottles half full because the spary is a dribble.</li>
            <li>At the very end, she used Sebastian Re-Shaper as a finisher.</li>
            <li>I threw away the three cans I orderd and used a genuine Sebastian Re Shaper spray and after the first day, my eyes are back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I have never used hair spray so much and it did nothing.      </li>
            <li>My hair was straight permed a month ago, so keeping anything</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think there was really a difference in hairsprays.     </li>
            <li>So I decided if I was gonna wear side bangs, I needed to find something that really works.     </li>
            <li>I heard they revamped the whole line and from what I saw at Ulta, it looks like it.</li>
            <li>Is it even real Sebastian product?</li>
            <li>Great hairspray for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Really keeps style in place.</li>
            <li>I have board straight hair and use a curling iron to give it body.  </li>
            <li>Hairspray doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t spray out of the can very well.</li>
            <li>it was gum wrapped in sticky stuff so even when you get it off the whole bottle has like glue on it.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast and holds forever.</li>
            <li>It probably has much to do with the high humidty here.</li>
            <li>I can use it second day to reshape my hair, and it looks as good as the previous day.  </li>
            <li>Whereas before I left a lot of residue on my hair from having to use so much Garnier, barely one spritz of Sebastian whipped my bangs into place with a very obedient hold, yet miraculously NOT STIFF, NOT FLAKY, and NOT LOOKING LIKE PLASTIC.</li>
            <li>I even went as far as spraying each section before I hot rolled it for the layered in hold.  </li>
            <li>In future, I will purchase this item elsewhere, so, I am able to return it, if the same thing happens.</li>
            <li>This particular bottle arrived basically de-pressurized.</li>
            <li>So with high hopes I purcahsed the re-shaper with the mindset you could finger thorugh, etc.    </li>
            <li>Im not sure why the other poster said it stayed great even after finger combing.  </li>
            <li>and I passed by the mirror and the hair has completely FALLEN!  </li>
            <li>I went home and tried the same with my old hairspray (a cheap $4 bottle) and discovered that at the end of the day, my hair was flat and flaky.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and will continue as it is easy to manage after spraying, does not make it stiff</li>
            <li>What I love about it is if I mess up after spraying, I can  comb it out and start again without the need to constantly respray.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s humid out though, use a little more because my hair didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>I am a die hard Sebastian Shaper fan and have been for many years.  </li>
            <li>The can was wrapped in a light green sticky type bag which I assume was to keep the product from leaking.  </li>
            <li>the plus side, I side-parted my hair and put it in a pony tail on a very windy day, and I came home looking exactly as I left.</li>
            <li>After I changed my mascara, eye shadow and sponges, I realized that possibly, it was the new hair spray I ordered!  </li>
            <li>So I went to my local Ulta and saw the revamped version, Re-shaper, and decided to try it instead of the older Shaper.</li>
            <li>At  major beauty supply stores this product is $18.  </li>
            <li>The can will last you a long time because you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>When I removed the sticky plastic bag it left the can completely sticky.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to find it here at a much less expensive price.</li>
            <li>After days of looking through reviews on makeupalley, buzzilions, and other googled websites, I noticed Sebastian Shaper seemed to be a real winner.</li>
            <li>Right after I spray my hair, I will brush it out to remove any sticky or stiff feeling.</li>
            <li>I have such an itchy scalp and this is the only product I use after flat ironing or saving my natural wave.</li>
            <li>Gives that extra hold &amp; control for fine thin hair.</li>

            <li> Gives that extra hold &amp; control for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> A long time ago, when I couldn&#x27;t be bothered by drugstore brands, I remember going through the same process of researching and comparing mid-range brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very fine mist and holds like crazy.  </li>
            <li> It holds all day without getting hard and if you don&#x27;t lay it on too much, you can comb through.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that my hair could be teased an inch and a half from my crown and stay in place for over 8 hours!</li>
            <li> I was a bit wary about it, because my hair had been previously so damaged that I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would hold evenly.  </li>
            <li> Extremely still and leaves a gritty feel to your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it several other places, just never on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After a long stint as a bleach blonde, I decided to go dark again and had a friend from class do it.</li>
            <li> The Sebastian RE-SHAPER, is an entirely different story and in my humble opinion, the folks at Sebastian should be ashamed for trying to pawn this stuff off on folks for around $16.00 a can when the THIRD INGREDIENT IS WATER!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I use hot rollers and my hair is thin</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, mainly due to the whopping $16-18.00 a can price tag, but I always come back.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with products left on hair weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the cans are not made better.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble with several cans not spraying.</li>
            <li> Makes hair look wet.</li>
            <li> Lastly, my fingers did snag quite considerably when I tried to comb my hair with my fingers behind my ear.</li>
            <li> This is the only spray I have found that will hold the curl all day and not feel stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> Spray left my hair stiff and then sticky.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump together like other spray, and it lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Didnt even leave the house just \\&quot;went into the other room\\&quot; which is my office.  </li>
            <li> So tell me why not WRAP THE BOTTLES IN BUBBLE OR TISSUE LIKE OTHER PLACES BEFORE YOU STICK THEM IN A GLUE TRAVEL SACK.  </li>
            <li> Do not order this item or other hairspray items from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper here then any other website.</li>
            <li> Throwing out all three cans - not worth my time or energy to repackage and make a trip to the Post Office.</li>
            <li> And by lunchtime, my bangs were drooping down in my eyes again.</li>
            <li> The door bell rang less than 20minutes</li>
            <li> You pay less than half of what salons charge, even with shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Really helps in humid weather to keep hair from going crazy.</li>
            <li> I have never used hair spray but a few spritz on hair after I roll it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe because it was just a few hairs on her head (bangs).    </li>
            <li> It holds, but is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Given any hairspray will make some hairs stick together to achieve the hold, but with other hairsprays I couldn&#x27;t brush through my hair it was so hard.</li>
            <li> Holds but is not too stiff that you can&#x27;t put your fingers through it to loosen the curls.</li>
            <li> What a mess!  </li>
            <li> So, not sure what the hype was all about.</li>
            <li> I started using this item I received from Amazon yesterday (May 14) and there is something wrong with the sprayer, so that, instead of a fine mist coming out, my hair was loaded with lacquer that harkened to the 1960s, which, of course, made my hair impossible to re-shape.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Sebastian Shaper or Shaper Plus but decided to try this for a change.</li>
            <li> Since the curls fell, I tried to put my hair behind my ears so it wouldnt be in my face and my fingers got caught in all the sticky mess.    </li>
            <li> But after a while, they became quite hard to find.</li>
            <li> I tried using this while my hair was damp as the directions advised, and I had a really hard time combing my hair.</li>
            <li> This sucks.</li>
            <li> The product was late (even though I have prime</li>
            <li> What a scam - it isn&#x27;t the regular - it is a fake!  </li>
            <li> The hair spray comes out in a dribble, with no aerosol action :(</li>
            <li> Worst of all, even though the can said \\&quot;extra strong\\&quot; hold, I had to use 3 or 4 long sprays to get my bangs into shape.</li>
            <li> Its to expensive to keep paying for nothing</li>
            <li> Needless to say, by the end of the week, I had bought a can of Re-Shaper for myself.</li>
            <li> side-swept was annoyingly difficult.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was unable to get it to spray at all.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong!</li>
            <li> I started buying this from my hair stylist at a very expensive price.  </li>
            <li> Grrr</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t return or ask for a credit for just one can of hair spray but was disappointed to pay for nothing.</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are relying on the Sebastian name to sell this crap.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because I would have to wash my hands each and every time I held the can</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> I just received my package of Sebastian Re-Shaper Hairspray and it is disgusting!  </li>
            <li> Really bad!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have had trouble with several cans not spraying. However I love this product. The last 2 cans wouldn&#x27;t spray at all. The company was no help when trying to get a refund. I will never buy this again. Its to expensive to keep paying for nothing</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist student with medium texture and density in my hair. After a long stint as a bleach blonde, I decided to go dark again and had a friend from class do it. Since she needed the practice, she asked to style my hair, and I agreed. At the very end, she used Sebastian Re-Shaper as a finisher. I was a bit wary about it, because my hair had been previously so damaged that I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would hold evenly.  I was pleasantly surprised that my hair could be teased an inch and a half from my crown and stay in place for over 8 hours! I went home and tried the same with my old hairspray (a cheap $4 bottle) and discovered that at the end of the day, my hair was flat and flaky. Needless to say, by the end of the week, I had bought a can of Re-Shaper for myself. What I love about it is if I mess up after spraying, I can  comb it out and start again without the need to constantly respray. It doesn&#x27;t clump together like other spray, and it lasts a lot longer. The fact that it smells like baby powder certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt :)</li>
            <li> Great hairspray! It is not sticky, holds my style great, easy to comb thru, does not leave hair stiff.</li>
            <li> I use Shaper Plus every day.  I bought this thinking it was such a great price...what a mistake!  I had swolen, irritated eyes for five days.  After I changed my mascara, eye shadow and sponges, I realized that possibly, it was the new hair spray I ordered!  What a scam - it isn&#x27;t the regular - it is a fake!  I threw away the three cans I orderd and used a genuine Sebastian Re Shaper spray and after the first day, my eyes are back to normal.  Avoid at all costs!!</li>
            <li> I have never used hair spray but a few spritz on hair after I roll it.  I use hot rollers and my hair is thin so I have to be careful with products left on hair weighing it down.  Even with the regular hair spray my hair would look like helmot head..and would fall before I even went outside.  Outside, in the sun, would cake.    Anyway I read that the Sebastian products were amazing. So with high hopes I purcahsed the re-shaper with the mindset you could finger thorugh, etc.    I even went as far as spraying each section before I hot rolled it for the layered in hold.  Then spritzed all over when done.  Today, after I did this I had amazing curls, etc..  Didnt even leave the house just \\&quot;went into the other room\\&quot; which is my office.  IT is air conditioned so have not been outside yet.  The door bell rang less than 20minutes and I passed by the mirror and the hair has completely FALLEN!  This is after I layered every curl and sprayed entire head with re-shaper as a finisher.    What a disappointment.  My hair is sticky too.  Im not sure why the other poster said it stayed great even after finger combing.  Maybe because it was just a few hairs on her head (bangs).    My hair has fallen and left with the feeling of hair spray on my hair.      So, not sure what the hype was all about. I have never used hair spray so much and it did nothing.      Lastly, my fingers did snag quite considerably when I tried to comb my hair with my fingers behind my ear. Since the curls fell, I tried to put my hair behind my ears so it wouldnt be in my face and my fingers got caught in all the sticky mess.    What a disappointment</li>
            <li> product was as advertised</li>
            <li> Order shipped quickly, product as described.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Keeps my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to start wearing side-swept bangs and needed a good hairspray to hold them. My hair was straight permed a month ago, so keeping anything side-swept was annoyingly difficult. At first, I picked up Garnier Fructis Volumizing hairspray with the bamboo extract because it was cheap and I didn&#x27;t think there was really a difference in hairsprays.     Boy, was I wrong! The Garnier left my hair crunchy, flaky, and with the unnatural \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look. Worst of all, even though the can said \\&quot;extra strong\\&quot; hold, I had to use 3 or 4 long sprays to get my bangs into shape. And by lunchtime, my bangs were drooping down in my eyes again. Very annoying. So I decided if I was gonna wear side bangs, I needed to find something that really works.     After days of looking through reviews on makeupalley, buzzilions, and other googled websites, I noticed Sebastian Shaper seemed to be a real winner. It was more expensive but seemed to do everything I was looking for. So I went to my local Ulta and saw the revamped version, Re-shaper, and decided to try it instead of the older Shaper. I got home, tried it, and immediately I was impressed!     Whereas before I left a lot of residue on my hair from having to use so much Garnier, barely one spritz of Sebastian whipped my bangs into place with a very obedient hold, yet miraculously NOT STIFF, NOT FLAKY, and NOT LOOKING LIKE PLASTIC. During the day I would finger through my hair and I could! Given any hairspray will make some hairs stick together to achieve the hold, but with other hairsprays I couldn&#x27;t brush through my hair it was so hard. Sebastian, on the other hand, has come up with an amazing product, which is probably why so many people have claimed loyalty to it.     Side note: I think Sebastian makes some of the best mid-range hair products. A long time ago, when I couldn&#x27;t be bothered by drugstore brands, I remember going through the same process of researching and comparing mid-range brands. In the end, I chose Sebastian shampoo and conditioner as a staple. But after a while, they became quite hard to find. I heard they revamped the whole line and from what I saw at Ulta, it looks like it. Now they&#x27;re back and better than ever!</li>
            <li> This sucks. Is it even real Sebastian product? I have such an itchy scalp and this is the only product I use after flat ironing or saving my natural wave. Grrr</li>
            <li> Extremely still and leaves a gritty feel to your hair. I prefer the regular shaper to this re-shaper.</li>
            <li> I am a die hard Sebastian Shaper fan and have been for many years.  I have tried other brands, mainly due to the whopping $16-18.00 a can price tag, but I always come back.  It works because it is not formulated with water.  In fact, water is the 13th listed ingredient in Sebastian Shaper.  The Sebastian RE-SHAPER, is an entirely different story and in my humble opinion, the folks at Sebastian should be ashamed for trying to pawn this stuff off on folks for around $16.00 a can when the THIRD INGREDIENT IS WATER!!!!!  You can expect this from any of your drugstore brands that are a couple of dollars a bottle but you should not have to pay $16.00 for a can of water!!!  Does it work?  It works about as well as a $2.00 bottle of hairspray!  They are relying on the Sebastian name to sell this crap.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray for thin hair. Really keeps style in place. Not that easy to brush out,  pulls a bit.  If you don&#x27;t touch your hair throughout the day, then a great spray.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years without issue.  I started using this item I received from Amazon yesterday (May 14) and there is something wrong with the sprayer, so that, instead of a fine mist coming out, my hair was loaded with lacquer that harkened to the 1960s, which, of course, made my hair impossible to re-shape.  I even tried running some hot water on the sprayer, however, that did not help.  In future, I will purchase this item elsewhere, so, I am able to return it, if the same thing happens.</li>
            <li> The bottle was delivered all sticky and I tried to wash it off and it won&#x27;t come off.  Plus it&#x27;s not what I wanted and they don&#x27;t take returns.</li>
            <li> Received it in excellent condition.  Great hair spray and a large size to last longer.  Love this product.  Recommend it to anyone needing a great hairspray.</li>
            <li> I started buying this from my hair stylist at a very expensive price.  I have board straight hair and use a curling iron to give it body.  This is the only spray I have found that will hold the curl all day and not feel stiff or sticky.  I am so happy to find it here at a much less expensive price.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great and best of all it smells great! If it&#x27;s humid out though, use a little more because my hair didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and will continue as it is easy to manage after spraying, does not make it stiff</li>
            <li> Hairspray looked can looked scuffed up on the outside. Hairspray doesn&#x27;t work very well, it doesn&#x27;t spray out of the can very well. Makes hair look wet.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. The product was late (even though I have prime so it missed our trip). then...... Boooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it was gum wrapped in sticky stuff so even when you get it off the whole bottle has like glue on it. (I order 80% of everything online so I know this did NOT need to happen) so we have gummy yucky bottles with a nice product inside -cept to use it we have to touch the gummy bottles. I even used goo-be-gone to fix it. Would not come off. So tell me why not WRAP THE BOTTLES IN BUBBLE OR TISSUE LIKE OTHER PLACES BEFORE YOU STICK THEM IN A GLUE TRAVEL SACK.  Will not order from here again.</li>
            <li> This hair spray was packaged well but the nozzle on this wouldn&#x27;t work so I was unable to get it to spray at all.  Didn&#x27;t return or ask for a credit for just one can of hair spray but was disappointed to pay for nothing.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray.  Used by my hairstylist and I have used it for years.  Really helps in humid weather to keep hair from going crazy.</li>
            <li> Heads-up everyone.  Do not order this item or other hairspray items from Amazon.  Did you know they are not returnable?  I will never order anything from Amazon again. When third party venders are involved there is supreme loss of quality control and service. Amazon takes no responsibility for their vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, back to this product.  The vendor (BeautyAnd) wrapped this bottle in a sticky (on the inside) plastic bag/wrap before mailing it. After unwrapping, I found that the can is cover with sticky glue from the bag.  I&#x27;ve tried goof off, glue off and it will not come off. When I pick up the can it sticks to my fingers. I am throwing it away wasting $14.87.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray!  It holds, but is not too heavy.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!  You pay less than half of what salons charge, even with shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I had one can that I bought from a local salon quit spraying with quite a bit of product left.  When I questioned the stylist she asked if I replaced the lid between uses (which I hadn&#x27;t been doing) ~ since then I always replace the lid after use and I&#x27;ve never had an issue.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Originally got it in an Allure Beauty Box ages ago.  The can will last you a long time because you don&#x27;t need to use much.  It&#x27;s a very fine mist and holds like crazy.  I use this for special occasions when I want the best hold possible.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great sspray, fast service!</li>
            <li> Good spray but most likely wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these, none work!!!  You can&#x27;t return them as they are hazardous materials!!  What the heck?  I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this Sebastan Re-Shaper Hair Spray for my mom.  It&#x27;s the only one she will use.  She loves it because it holds every hair in place, yet it is easy to comb out.  Her hair is very important to her, so I&#x27;m very glad we found this product which was recommended in a popular big name magazine.  I cannot recall the name of the magazine though.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Too bad the cans are not made better.  I have problems with the spray cans as they seem to stop working for no reason so I am left with product I cannot use.  I have switched to a different brand that has better made spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I like using this product but the last 2 that I bought on line ran out of pressure with lots of product still in the can. I followed the instrucions for cleaning a clogged tip but that did not work. I had the same thing happen with the same product purchased at our local grocery store and they replaced it. Would not recommend purchasing this product on line.</li>
            <li> Received product in damaged package that had been opened by the US postal service and taped back together  with their logo all over.  The cap of the hair spray was broke and the nozzle was off and bent, but it still works and I love the hair spray!</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian hairspray for the last 20 years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  It is that great! Holds but is not too stiff that you can&#x27;t put your fingers through it to loosen the curls. It&#x27;s not sticky but has a great hold.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell! Cheaper here then any other website. Customer for life.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT CAME IN A TIMELY FASHION AND UNDAMAGED....  IT IS ONE OF THE BEST HAIRSPRAYS ON THE MARKET IN MY OPINION...</li>
            <li> every thing was wonderful !!!</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price. Love it.</li>
            <li> I really do love this hairspray.  The scent fades quickly enough to not cause headaches.  It holds all day without getting hard and if you don&#x27;t lay it on too much, you can comb through.  I use it to style and set after styling.</li>
            <li> Sebastian Re-Shaper Hair Spray made my hair crispy and brittle.  Caused hair to break.  Also,  the product received had leaked all over during shipping.  What a mess!  Tried washing hairspray cans but remained sticky to the touch.  Throwing out all three cans - not worth my time or energy to repackage and make a trip to the Post Office. Much prefer Sebastian zero gravity hairspray - great hold without ruining hair.  Will order from a different vendor.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite styling products. Gives that extra hold &amp; control for fine thin hair. It gives you more volume &amp; the look of having more hair then you actually have. I have a 3 can back up so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Spray left my hair stiff and then sticky.  Smell was also too strong and stuck to counter and anything else near it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives a shine to your hair and holds all day. Right after I spray my hair, I will brush it out to remove any sticky or stiff feeling. The rest of the day my hair holds, but still blows in the wind, is soft to the touch, stays put, and the product smells great. When I go to the gym to work out it seems to absorb excess oils to keep my hair looking as good as possible after a workout, my hair is not stiff or sticky either after my workout, so if I have to I can run into the grocery store, etc. on my way home from the gym.</li>
            <li> I love the hairspray, but the sprayer quits working shortly after you purchase. I&#x27;ve thrown away many bottles half full because the spary is a dribble. I switched to Nexus. I&#x27;ve only used one bottle so the jury is still out. Sent an email to sebastian that I quit using their product after five years, heard nothing back.</li>
            <li> I just received my package of Sebastian Re-Shaper Hairspray and it is disgusting!  I love the product and have used it for sometime so I chanced ordering it online this time.  The can was wrapped in a light green sticky type bag which I assume was to keep the product from leaking.  When I removed the sticky plastic bag it left the can completely sticky.  Very disappointed because I would have to wash my hands each and every time I held the can and it is an item that can not be returned.  Think twice about ordering from this company.</li>
            <li> I usually use Sebastian Shaper or Shaper Plus but decided to try this for a change. This is like spray on glue. It left my hair tacky, clumpy, and darker looking. Strands actually broke when I tried to brush this out. I tried using this while my hair was damp as the directions advised, and I had a really hard time combing my hair. I have a simple style and don&#x27;t use a lot of product. I don&#x27;t have a problem brushing Shaper out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I side-parted my hair and put it in a pony tail on a very windy day, and I came home looking exactly as I left. Impressive yet scary.</li>
            <li> Usually I love using Sebastian Re-Shaper. I&#x27;ve bought it several other places, just never on Amazon. This particular bottle arrived basically de-pressurized. The hair spray comes out in a dribble, with no aerosol action :( But normally, this hair spray looks good and smells good.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.  I really like this hairspray.  My hair actually stays in place even if there is wind.  I found so many of the brushable sprays just don&#x27;t hold anymore.  I bought this one in bulk.  My new favorite.</li>
            <li> I barely spray my hair and this gives my hair a more polished look. This bottle will last me for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Great if you want a strong but not stiff hold.  Easy to style with and a great price if you are looking for a hair spray.</li>
            <li> Really bad!!! I first rate 1 star for products in Amazon! Can&#x27;t use it ! ！Can&#x27;t return it！！</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I lived in the mid-west, but here in florida my hair feels real sticky after applying this product.  It probably has much to do with the high humidty here.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, and I love this product!  It is exactly what it says...Reshaper.  I can use it second day to reshape my hair, and it looks as good as the previous day.  It also make arranging my clean hair easy, and keeps it in place.  This was also a great price.  At  major beauty supply stores this product is $18.  At Amazon it can be found for around $9.  Arrived in 4 days.  I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> ever! I&#x27;m not a hair guru but this hairspray works for every style i put my mind to. Dries fast and holds forever. 5 starts</li>
