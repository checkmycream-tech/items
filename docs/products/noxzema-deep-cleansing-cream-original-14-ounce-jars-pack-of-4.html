            <li>I just found out the best thing to use Noxzema for - Shaving!  </li>
            <li>Moisturizer is optional after using this great stuff!</li>

            <li>Excellent product - good price from amazon</li>
            <li>This works quite well and smells great.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great for rubbing on a sunburn as well.</li>
            <li>This is a great price on my favorite cleanser of all time!</li>
            <li>Well known product , Price is good from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Hey guys i&#x27;m writting this review just to tell you what everyone else said, amazing product, except i didn&#x27;t buy it online</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and a cooling</li>
            <li>This is a great price, and if you use it every day, like I do, you&#x27;ll go through the product quickly.</li>
            <li>Love how refreshing it feels!</li>
            <li>I used noxzema many years ago, I remember I loved the cool feeling</li>
            <li>Not dry, not oily just perfect.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Noxzema.  </li>
            <li>I love its scent (although I know some people don&#x27;t find it appealing)</li>
            <li>and I love how it feels on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if they start putting those sealed foil covers to keep the cream out of the covers :)</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>The ladies love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it WORKS. :-)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and it keeps the oil at bay. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so glad this product is still available.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the old products really ARE the best.     </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Noxzema</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive to try and so worth it!</li>
            <li>Realy value for money....as you get 4 big containers of Noxema, one of the best face cream/wash as it help retain the oil in your skin and leaving it fresh, clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to Noxema.</li>
            <li>I use sunscreen religiously, but I&#x27;m fair</li>
            <li>Leaves the sink/basin clean, your woman happier and you&#x27;ll get a closer, far more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Same great product, the look of the jar and labeling has changed so much</li>
            <li>And its super softer.</li>
            <li>I love Noxzema and I have been using it since I discovered it in high school.</li>
            <li>Worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>When we came backstage after the last show of the day I would run to my dressing station and get my Noxzema out, slather it on my face, leave it on for about 10 minutes and then wipe it off with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li>than trying something new, I remembered how well this always soothed my sunburn and again it worked like a hero, keeping me comfortable with my lobster-red</li>
            <li>I love how it dries to a matt but does not dry out at all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that gets red and irritated or breaks out when I use most cleansers, but not this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the ladies out there would have similar results!  </li>
            <li>Then I use a hot washcloth to remove all my make-up and the cream.</li>
            <li>If I had tried it first, I would have saved $100s and months of misery.    </li>
            <li>So when you receive your own jar, please make sure you open it slowly to avoid spillage (although it&#x27;s not too watery to spill easily as well).  </li>
            <li>It works leaving the skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li>WALMART, they have two huge jars, bigger</li>
            <li>much cheaper then this after you add taxes and whatnot.</li>
            <li>There are no substitutes for the real thing.  </li>
            <li>This face wash was SUCH a surprise for me because for one it&#x27;s a lot of product, two its extremely cheap, and</li>
            <li>We use it mainly for face washing.</li>
            <li>Classic product.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is now totally normal.</li>
            <li>Guys, I switched to this product about 10 years ago when normal shaving gels/creams with aerosol propellents were drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything that works as well for make-up removal than this old stand-by.</li>
            <li>I was a performer at an amusement park when i was in my early twenties.</li>
            <li>Now, I have a three-year old daughter</li>
            <li>It not only breaks up the dirt and oils in my skin, but actually softens my beard, making it much easier for my razor to get a super-close shave - and it leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, moisturized (and not dry!)</li>
            <li>I kept purchasing new face washes and sooner or later they had some effect</li>
            <li>Even if you prefer the pump dispenser (which is a watery-er version of regular Noxzema) then you should still have the old fashioned tubs if you travel, because the pump will explode on the plane (as I found out).     </li>

            <li> Years of bad acne has left my skin very dry and troubled.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I must confess, I&#x27;m addicted to this smell.  I love the smell of Noxzema.  I often use this in the shower at night.  I rub it in through my beard and then scrub through my beard with a fingernail brush before moving on to washing the rest of my face.  This works quite well and smells great.</li>
            <li> Yes, I practically grew up using Noxzema.  I love its scent (although I know some people don&#x27;t find it appealing) and I love how it feels on your skin.  It leaves my skin soft, moisturized (and not dry!) and MINTY!  My only &#x27;complaint&#x27; on these jars is that it doesn&#x27;t have a protective foil inside once you open the cover of the jar.  So when you receive your own jar, please make sure you open it slowly to avoid spillage (although it&#x27;s not too watery to spill easily as well).  It would be better if they start putting those sealed foil covers to keep the cream out of the covers :)</li>
            <li> Realy value for money....as you get 4 big containers of Noxema, one of the best face cream/wash as it help retain the oil in your skin and leaving it fresh, clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using other cleansers and moisturizers and now I just use this. I put it on 5-10 minutes before I take a shower and let it set on my face. I then rinse it off in the shower. My face feels refreshed and I&#x27;ll never go back to those goopy feeling cleansers and moisturizers that stick to the face.</li>
            <li> I used noxzema many years ago, I remember I loved the cool feeling I felt each time it was applied to my skin but I don&#x27;t recall it improving my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Noxzema and I always use it. A few years back they developed a Noxzema cream without any smell at all, which they ended up discontinuing. I hope they bring it back. Nevertheless, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I just found out the best thing to use Noxzema for - Shaving!  Up until now, I used a shave gel or foam.  I had a buddy that said he used it to shave with.  After trying it myself, I will never go back to a gel or foam.  You owe it to yourself to try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I&#x27;m sure the ladies out there would have similar results!  Amazon shipped me the \\&quot;Pack of 4\\&quot; overseas without hassle.</li>
            <li> Hey guys i&#x27;m writting this review just to tell you what everyone else said, amazing product, except i didn&#x27;t buy it online or amazon, i bought it in my neighborhood walmart, yes i said it WALMART, they have two huge jars, bigger then this one on sale in a bundle package, 2 for $6.00, much cheaper then this after you add taxes and whatnot. Check it out! (:</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that gets red and irritated or breaks out when I use most cleansers, but not this one! It has a nice smell and a cooling, tingly feel when you wash your face with it that&#x27;s great. I have combination skin, and it seems to suck up oil where I need it to (forehead, nose), but not in spots where I need the moisture. It&#x27;s really great for rubbing on a sunburn as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using noxzema on and off for the past five years. Years of bad acne has left my skin very dry and troubled. After using other cleansers with no luck for a few months I decided to return to using noxzema. I don&#x27;t know why I ever stopped! It has only been about a month but my skin is now totally normal. Not dry, not oily just perfect. It is definitely the only cleanser that I have ever tried which never makes my skin dry or funky feeling. Moisturizer is optional after using this great stuff!</li>
            <li> There are no substitutes for the real thing.  Because washing your face with soap is for children, adults use NOXEMA.</li>
            <li> Well known product , Price is good from Amazon. We use it mainly for face washing. Excellent product - good price from amazon</li>
            <li> Same great product, the look of the jar and labeling has changed so much I didn&#x27;t recognize it on the shelf. I haven&#x27;t used or even thought about Noxema for 15 years or so, until I got a very bad sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than trying something new, I remembered how well this always soothed my sunburn and again it worked like a hero, keeping me comfortable with my lobster-red skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad this product is still available.Many thanks to Noxema.</li>
            <li> This is a great price on my favorite cleanser of all time! I love Noxzema and I have been using it since I discovered it in high school. This is the best cleanser I have ever used and I have tried all types, (from meltdowns to scrubs). The only other face cleanser I ever use is Proactiv when I have breakouts, but even then I still use Noxzema to remove all my make-up. I&#x27;ve never found anything that works as well for make-up removal than this old stand-by. I rub the cream all over my face, and then let it sit for about 10-20 seconds. Then I use a hot washcloth to remove all my make-up and the cream. Sometimes the old products really ARE the best.     This is a great price, and if you use it every day, like I do, you&#x27;ll go through the product quickly. I have one in every bathroom and also in my travel bag. Even if you prefer the pump dispenser (which is a watery-er version of regular Noxzema) then you should still have the old fashioned tubs if you travel, because the pump will explode on the plane (as I found out).     Conclusion: If you haven&#x27;t tried this yet, take the leap! It&#x27;s inexpensive to try and so worth it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Lasts a really long time and i made with quality ingredients. My all time favorite face wash. Lots of product for the price.</li>
            <li> Noxzema is the best face wash ever.  I am 28 and have been having some trouble with breakouts and oiliness.  I tried all sorts of expensive products and systems, then I thought of trying Noxzema because I used it in high school.  It totally cleared up my skin without making it feel tight, dry or irritated.  If I had tried it first, I would have saved $100s and months of misery.    Even when I wasn&#x27;t using it to wash my face, I always keep a jar around for sunburn.  I use sunscreen religiously, but I&#x27;m fair so accidents happen.  For sunburn, rub Noxzema into the skin (anywhere, not just your face) and let it sit for a couple minutes, then take a shower.  It cools the burn and I think it makes it heal faster too.</li>
            <li> Guys, I switched to this product about 10 years ago when normal shaving gels/creams with aerosol propellents were drying out my skin. I used Noxema in a pinch and haven&#x27;t gone back. This stuff rocks! I use it to wash my face and shave in the shower every day. It not only breaks up the dirt and oils in my skin, but actually softens my beard, making it much easier for my razor to get a super-close shave - and it leaves my skin really soft. The ladies love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get yourself an inexpensive shower mirror and shave your face at the end of your shower routine with this stuff. Leaves the sink/basin clean, your woman happier and you&#x27;ll get a closer, far more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 12oz. jar lasts about 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to regular gel/foam again!</li>
            <li> I use to always walk by this product at my local drug store, but never paid attention to it. I spent so much money on high end products and hardly any delivered the bang for the buck. I kept purchasing new face washes and sooner or later they had some effect or I quickly became bored. This face wash was SUCH a surprise for me because for one it&#x27;s a lot of product, two its extremely cheap, and it WORKS. :-) And the fact that it doesn&#x27;t seem to bore me is a bonus! I love how it dries to a matt but does not dry out at all. And idk what it is but my skintone has cleared up, its not so uneven now. And its super softer. Worth every dollar. Plus you can use this for shaving legs,ect, without worrying about running out. Can&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li> Llegó a tiempo y es exactamente lo que quería. sirve para toda la familia y la consistencia es muy rica.</li>
            <li> I was a performer at an amusement park when i was in my early twenties. I wore a lot of stage makeup everyday and didn&#x27;t like to leave it on after caking it on and sweating all day, etc... When we came backstage after the last show of the day I would run to my dressing station and get my Noxzema out, slather it on my face, leave it on for about 10 minutes and then wipe it off with a warm washcloth. Sometimes, I just used a dry cloth and that worked, too. I always use it for sunburns. Now, I have a three-year old daughter and I use Noxzema on her in the summertime to heal sun exposed skin. I hope she continues to use it to keep her skin youthful.</li>
            <li> Used this for years and somewhere just stopped using it. Then when visiting relatives, saw it in the shower and used it. Love how refreshing it feels! And the 4 pack on line cost the same as in stores - just be careful some prices here are outrageous</li>
            <li> It works leaving the skin clean and clear. You try something new and the dark spot and acne start. So yeah when you find something that works keep using it. I love it I have oily skin and it keeps the oil at bay. :)</li>
            <li> All in order.  Very happy with it.  Classic product.  Consider looking for additional purchase of the product since I&#x27;ve given away some.</li>
            <li> This product is just like the ones that they used to sell years ago. Same smell, same texture and same blue jar!</li>
