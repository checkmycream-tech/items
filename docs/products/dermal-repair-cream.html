            <li> I have used it for years. It has always been consistently good. It smells nice.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. It goes up in price every time I need to order a replacement. I am thankful that it lasts for quite a while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 5 years now.  I only use it on my neck and upper bust area.  It has dramatically reduced the signs of aging!  I&#x27;m 48 years old and no longer does my neck give away my age.  I&#x27;ve read reviews that stated that women broke out after using dermal repair cream on their face.  I can&#x27;t speak for the face, because I have combination skin so I don&#x27;t put it on my face.  It does wonders for your neck though.  It&#x27;s worth the price tag.  I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream and I like it.  It&#x27;s not oily and it does seem to keep my face skin very nice.  It is quite expensive though.</li>
            <li> Burned skin like a retinol produce would...but my derma is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years..great price!.  LOVE it. Has made a difference in my skin!!!awesome youb will love the prduct!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, this is the best skin moisturizer I have ever used!  A little pricy but a dab goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal.  This jar locally would cost me $160!  This is such a great deal.  I love the moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface of your face and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or thick.  I am very picky about moisturizers and have tried many brands. This wins hand down!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a year - can&#x27;t go without it.  Product is perfect &amp; the customer service &amp; shipping from this seller are excellent.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mom who is 80.  She uses it as another poster has mentioned; on neck and upper bust.  It really helps to smooth the lines.  This actually was recommended by my dermatologist for me when I lived in Alaska due to my dry skin from the arid conditions.  I moved to the East coast and no longer required it.  I liked the quality so much that I bought it for her.   I hope I look that good when I&#x27;m over 65!</li>
            <li> Best one ever.  Not too greasy. Really moisturizes the skin well.  Recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have really oily skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent face cream !</li>
            <li> I would recommend anything by Skin Medica but especially the Dermal Repair Cream.  I am a &amp;#34;60ish&amp;#34; woman and this cream melts into my skin and keeps it hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li> My wife likes all Skin Medica Products</li>
            <li> My dermatologist started me with this product and have been using it for several years. It is wonderful in every respect.</li>
            <li> The Dermal Skin Repair is slow and steady replacement of skin cells.  This is a  very effective skin care product.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing!!! It hydrates your skin amazingly &amp; has little to no scent so it does not irritate you one bit. I totally see a difference in the clarity &amp; softness of my face from the past month of use!! I use it every morning &amp; night, it is a must!!</li>
            <li> Very good cream for nighttime use.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This product got me through the peeling uglies of a heavy dut, professional chemical peel! My skin looks and feels amazing, even though the peel isn&#x27;t over yet!</li>
