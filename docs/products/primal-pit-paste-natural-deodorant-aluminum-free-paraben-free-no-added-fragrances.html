            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>Great purchase!</li>
            <li>None of them have been excellent, hence my desire to try this one.</li>
            <li>Delivered on time in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Gets</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>

            <li>I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>Very nice!  </li>
            <li>It works surprisingly well!  </li>
            <li>I had great hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>This works great, even if you get sweaty after exercise or being out in the heat.</li>
            <li>I will never switch deodorants I am beyond happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>though I wasn&#x27;t planning on buying the orange, I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>Am planning to order more!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a week, no &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; smell here, seems to be very effective.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>Which is a bummer because it smells really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell was good- earthy but I didn&#x27;t smell like a hippie.</li>
            <li>I like the tub version because I like massaging my lymph area (its good for you) and its cheaper then the stick.</li>
            <li>Lavender is good</li>
            <li>I am very happy I discovered Primal Pit&#x27;s and love that it&#x27;s got more varieties.</li>
            <li>Got the orange creamsicle scent and love it!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this; it literally smells like an orange creamsicle, yum!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product does its job and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not all that effective for me.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice scent, not too girly.</li>
            <li>My son says it smells so delicious he wants to eat it.</li>
            <li>She loves as well, and has had no issues, with the light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Works the best out of all natural deodorants I have tried.</li>
            <li>It lasts about 24 hours most days and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>idk what others are talking about with the smell, the orange is very light scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because I really liked it before my skin reacted to it and think it would be a great choice if your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Maybe an hour at most (Orange cream).</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of the orange creamsicle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a hassle to have to use your hands to put it on</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>It works just as well as or better than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I. LOVE.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days now, but I&#x27;m really happy!</li>
            <li>The orange creamsicle scent is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I will for sure buy this product again.  </li>
            <li>but honestly, this product is well worth it!</li>
            <li>and I was happy to use something natural, so</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is not so strong that you smell it all day.</li>
            <li>So far Primal pit paste works just as good or better.</li>
            <li>It smells great, not perfume-y, which is important because I also bought the same (Orange creamsicle) scent, for a scent-triggered migraine sufferer.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy the paste, and will continue to purchase indefinitely.</li>
            <li>and I have been odor free even after working out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy customer and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>Get 1 Free-</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that I am no longer applying chemicals that could potentially have harmful effects for me and also my very young baby when I hold her close.</li>
            <li>Remember every one that this is originally for kids</li>
            <li>I decided to order a full sized jar.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not oily, and have had no issues thus far, with staining, nor with with rashes or reactions of any kind.</li>
            <li>The packaging may not be ideal but nothing goes to waste as opposed to stick deodorants.</li>
            <li>The orange smell dissapears but it keeps you smelling good all day till the next day.</li>
            <li>Item delivered on time, was as described, works great, smells great a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have tried many all natural, aluminum free deoderants that just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and I think this was a good starting off point for a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>Most likely a great product for those NOT sensitive to baking soda.</li>
            <li>Love using a natural product...</li>
            <li>Then my sister mentioned that she was looking for a more natural deodorant, so I told her what my friend had told me about this.</li>
            <li>This stuff is now my favorite natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>My favorite natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and a &amp;#34;pea-sized amount&amp;#34; seems just right.  </li>
            <li>My arm pits smell nice after a long day.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a natural deodorant that WORKS!</li>
            <li>She later called me with raving reviews and said that she and her husband were both in love with it.</li>
            <li>I apply it once when I get out the shower go an entire day or more without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak about the irritation rash some people have experienced, since I haven&#x27;t been using the Pit Paste very long, but I will update later if I experience the rash.</li>
            <li>It works really well even on days he is working in the hot sun and sweating all day.</li>
            <li>good for sensitive skin but leaves you smelly (orange clay smell mixed with armpit natural odor).</li>
            <li>It worked really well</li>
            <li>I do sweat way too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants, always seemed to have been better off using nothing at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly heavy duty, but a good substitute that is no doubt healthier for you in the long run than commercial deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try the kids deodorant first since I&#x27;m so sensitive</li>
            <li>After just a few days using it, I have noticed that my armpits are softer and smoother and it makes shaving so easy!  </li>
            <li>If I had a very sedentary day, it was sufficient; but if I did any activity at all, I was reminded of why I don&#x27;t use natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>So far this deodorant has passed the no BO test through:&lt;br /&gt;- a moderately intense gym workout</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying new scents.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, there is no yucky buildup</li>
            <li>That it does, but if you have sensitive skin beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of deodorants, and only two have really worked.</li>
            <li>It smells good in the container, but does not mix well if you sweat some - just smells like BO plus an added weird smell.  </li>
            <li>I like to wear it for lazy days around the house, and it works fine for that.</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely, however as other reviewers stated, it doesn&#x27;t last all that long.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone searching for an alternative deodorant that works as well as a traditional one.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for the first two days, but then on the third day a big, red, uncomfortable rash appeared under both armpits, along with the same darkening that others had mentioned.  </li>
            <li>This product is rather smooth to the touch, not overly chalky, rubs on consistently (only slightly less than a dime-sized amount is needed, per underarm).</li>
            <li>and it was able to keep me almost dry everyday in 90 degree weather.</li>
            <li>I have tried at least 10 other brands and this is the only one that keeps me dry and smelling good all day!</li>
            <li>so cute and tiny that it is hard to believe.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had reactions to other natural deodorants (I have, but they always appeared within a couple of days), you may want to pass on this one, or else just use it very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased the kids, because I preferred the scent, and read on manufacturers website that the formulation is the same as adult.</li>
            <li>On a hot day, my armpits started to smell after just a few hours, and I am not a heavy sweater at all.</li>
            <li>So I finally ordered me some, and I&#x27;m never going back to my old deodorant!</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to use a natural deodorant for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend getting a different scent if you want to mask odors - I have a really hard time finding anything aluminum-free that actually works, and the lavender worked better than any other brand I have tried.  </li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m 26 years old and it works extremely well for me.</li>
            <li> I used the Thai Crystal spray, which initially caused irritation similar to what other reviewers mentioned when initially using Primal Pit Paste.  </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> a frantic experience running around the grocery store after almost losing my iPhone&lt;br /&gt;- chasing around a toddler at a large park on a late summer day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably 5 different natural deodorants over the past year.</li>
            <li> I also have used EO spray, and while they both sort of worked, I found I had to use them in combination to stay stink-free and dry.  </li>
            <li> The skin turned red, and then just completely sloughed off so each armpit was basically a giant patch of broken skin.  </li>

            <li> Since you should wait a few hours after shaving to apply commercial deodorant, I&#x27;d suggest using this.</li>
            <li> There was some irritation after initial use, but it went away after a few days.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about these products that said you may develop a rash.</li>
            <li> I will be using the other orange on my son this summer, hes 7, almost at that age.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my tween age daughter after learning the dangers of conventional antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have a whole tub of this one to go through</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s weird is that it only appeared on my left armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Green Tidings and Primal Paste.</li>
            <li> I switched over from Green Tidings, because it was getting too expensive for the amount it would last.</li>
            <li> It takes just a small amount to use.</li>
            <li> and then it is hardly detectable.</li>
            <li> No more armpit razor burn!  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well and definitely leaves a bad scent after being worn for a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> so I feel bad for those  around me until I can buy a different scent.</li>
            <li> I have used everything from the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; stuff at target to prescription strength ones with poor results.</li>
            <li> Both of my soccer playing kids could peel paint off walls post game, but using this on their feet and shins reduces funk to &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has the worst smells coming from under her arms.  </li>
            <li> Though it didn&#x27;t happen to me as bad as I&#x27;ve heard with others, you can expect an armpit detox period where you may be stinkier then usual for days, or even weeks.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that wouldn&#x27;t have happened to me, but unfortunately I did get the dreaded rash.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work well for me.</li>

            <li> and I have not had a rash or bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a day or so after I placed my order, both armpits had an awful reaction.  </li>
            <li> Did not work for me :(</li>
            <li> It was very painful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I received a tiny jar of this deodorant as a sample and used it every day for about 3 weeks.  It worked really well and I was happy to use something natural, so I decided to order a full sized jar.  Unfortunately, a day or so after I placed my order, both armpits had an awful reaction.  The skin turned red, and then just completely sloughed off so each armpit was basically a giant patch of broken skin.  It was very painful.  The website recommends to keep using the deodorant if you have a reaction because the reaction could dissipate, but that was definitely not an option in my case- I had to smear antibiotic ointment all over them out of fear of getting an infection.  If you&#x27;ve had reactions to other natural deodorants (I have, but they always appeared within a couple of days), you may want to pass on this one, or else just use it very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because I really liked it before my skin reacted to it and think it would be a great choice if your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive.</li>
            <li> Works the best out of all natural deodorants I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works great! Got the orange creamsicle scent and love it!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! It smells great, not perfume-y, which is important because I also bought the same (Orange creamsicle) scent, for a scent-triggered migraine sufferer. She loves as well, and has had no issues, with the light, pleasant scent. This product is rather smooth to the touch, not overly chalky, rubs on consistently (only slightly less than a dime-sized amount is needed, per underarm). It protects from odor all day, with no need to re-apply during regular activity. It&#x27;s also not oily, and have had no issues thus far, with staining, nor with with rashes or reactions of any kind. I thoroughly enjoy the paste, and will continue to purchase indefinitely. Highly highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long. Maybe an hour at most (Orange cream). Which is a bummer because it smells really good. It works just as well as the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried. Easy to apply. I&#x27;ll probably buy again in a different scent!</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with this. It works well and I love the smell of the orange creamsicle. It is not so strong that you smell it all day. You only smell when you apply and then it is hardly detectable. I will buy this product again! Love using a natural product...</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of review and talked to friend who use this product.  I decided to go ahead and try it, knowing that I could possibly have a reaction to it.  It worked great for the first two days, but then on the third day a big, red, uncomfortable rash appeared under both armpits, along with the same darkening that others had mentioned.  I immediately quit using the product.  The rash and the darkening both faded after another three days.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that actually works! I have tried at least 10 other brands and this is the only one that keeps me dry and smelling good all day!</li>
            <li> I have finally found a deo that works for me!!!! I have been on a crazy search. I have used everything from the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; stuff at target to prescription strength ones with poor results. I also tried kiss my face roll on from sprouts and it did not work. This is the answer to my prayers!! It&#x27;s natural, there is no yucky buildup and I have been odor free even after working out. The best thing is that I am no longer applying chemicals that could potentially have harmful effects for me and also my very young baby when I hold her close.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week and so far so good. I have very sensitive skin and I have not had a rash or bad reaction. I love the smell of this; it literally smells like an orange creamsicle, yum! I do sweat way too much and it was able to keep me almost dry everyday in 90 degree weather. I wanted to try the kids deodorant first since I&#x27;m so sensitive and I think this was a good starting off point for a more natural deodorant. I will say, yeah it&#x27;s more of a hassle to have to use your hands to put it on but honestly, this product is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Very nice!  I&#x27;ve been using alternative deodorants for years.  They have worked *OK*.  I used the Thai Crystal spray, which initially caused irritation similar to what other reviewers mentioned when initially using Primal Pit Paste.  At that time, I didn&#x27;t know it was a pH issue.  I also have used EO spray, and while they both sort of worked, I found I had to use them in combination to stay stink-free and dry.  It got pricey as I was purchasing them BOTH on a monthly basis.  Although this is pricey, as deodorant goes, I can see that it will last longer than than the sprays.  As for how this works:  I could not be happier.  It works just as well as or better than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deodorant.  Though this is not an antiperspirant, it seems to keep me from sweating just as well as &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deodorant/antiperspirant.  After just a few days using it, I have noticed that my armpits are softer and smoother and it makes shaving so easy!  No more armpit razor burn!  Yay!  The smell is lovely, however as other reviewers stated, it doesn&#x27;t last all that long.  I&#x27;m not bothered by that as I like wearing scented lotions and perfume.  This definitely will not compete with any lotion or perfume.  I highly recommend for anyone searching for an alternative deodorant that works as well as a traditional one.  I&#x27;m a happy customer and will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I. LOVE. PIT PASTE!!! I heard about it from a friend but never purchased it. Then my sister mentioned that she was looking for a more natural deodorant, so I told her what my friend had told me about this. She later called me with raving reviews and said that she and her husband were both in love with it. So I finally ordered me some, and I&#x27;m never going back to my old deodorant! This doesn&#x27;t leave white on shirts, it doesn&#x27;t leave a smell, and it doesn&#x27;t stink when you sweat. I wore it all day at a theme park when it was 100 degrees and didn&#x27;t suffer from any sweat circles. Awesome product! Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about these products that said you may develop a rash. I was hoping that wouldn&#x27;t have happened to me, but unfortunately I did get the dreaded rash. What&#x27;s weird is that it only appeared on my left armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was good- earthy but I didn&#x27;t smell like a hippie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants, always seemed to have been better off using nothing at all. I&#x27;ve used this for a week, no &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; smell here, seems to be very effective. I purchased the kids, because I preferred the scent, and read on manufacturers website that the formulation is the same as adult.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this product. I have been wanting to use a natural deodorant for a long time. Unfortunately, this did not work well for me. If I had a very sedentary day, it was sufficient; but if I did any activity at all, I was reminded of why I don&#x27;t use natural deodorant. On a hot day, my armpits started to smell after just a few hours, and I am not a heavy sweater at all. I will not be buying again or even finishing the jar.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me :(</li>
            <li> ...but I couldn&#x27;t. It WORKS. That it does, but if you have sensitive skin beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product does its job and it smells amazing. I got the orange. However on day 3 my pits started do hurt and burn. I skipped a day and tried again. Rash and a LUMP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s a few days later and I&#x27;m still rashy and the lump is still there. Just not for me. Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has the worst smells coming from under her arms.  so cute and tiny that it is hard to believe.  When she uses this we have no issues.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of deodorants, and only two have really worked. Green Tidings and Primal Paste. I switched over from Green Tidings, because it was getting too expensive for the amount it would last. So far Primal pit paste works just as good or better. My arm pits smell nice after a long day. I am very happy I discovered Primal Pit&#x27;s and love that it&#x27;s got more varieties. The packaging may not be ideal but nothing goes to waste as opposed to stick deodorants.</li>
            <li> I sweat quite a lot, so because this product isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant it&#x27;s not all that effective for me.  When I use it I do end up with that &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; smell, but only when I&#x27;m undergoing physical exertion.  I like to wear it for lazy days around the house, and it works fine for that. I like the smell and a &amp;#34;pea-sized amount&amp;#34; seems just right.  It&#x27;s not exactly heavy duty, but a good substitute that is no doubt healthier for you in the long run than commercial deodorants.  Since you should wait a few hours after shaving to apply commercial deodorant, I&#x27;d suggest using this.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, works great, smells great a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is now my favorite natural deodorant. It lasts about 24 hours most days and smells really nice. Will purchase again :)</li>
            <li> My favorite natural deodorant. It works too, and this is coming from a smelly guy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often take the time to write reviews, but felt I should for this deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried probably 5 different natural deodorants over the past year. None of them have been excellent, hence my desire to try this one. I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days now, but I&#x27;m really happy! So far this deodorant has passed the no BO test through:&lt;br /&gt;- a moderately intense gym workout&lt;br /&gt;- a frantic experience running around the grocery store after almost losing my iPhone&lt;br /&gt;- chasing around a toddler at a large park on a late summer day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak about the irritation rash some people have experienced, since I haven&#x27;t been using the Pit Paste very long, but I will update later if I experience the rash. So far, I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a natural deodorant that WORKS!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done; Prevents odor.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended primal pit paste to me and I thought I would give it a try. I have tried many all natural, aluminum free deoderants that just didn&#x27;t work. This works great, even if you get sweaty after exercise or being out in the heat. The orange creamsicle scent is my favorite. There was some irritation after initial use, but it went away after a few days. There are instructions on the manufacturer&#x27;s website about irritation and how to handle it. Basically you are changing the pH level on your skin and it takes some adjustment sometimes. It takes just a small amount to use. I cannot recommend this product enough! Feel like this is just another step in being healthier.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and doesn&#x27;t want to use anything else.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this deodorant. It works really well even on days he is working in the hot sun and sweating all day. Has a nice scent, not too girly. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> good for sensitive skin but leaves you smelly (orange clay smell mixed with armpit natural odor). Do not recommend if you sweat a lot or have problems hiding odors. Definitely do not use while doing physical activities because you will smell as if you didn&#x27;t wear anything.</li>
            <li> I had been using the lavender scented one, which I like, but thought I would try this one since I read that it was the same ingredients (just the smell was marketed to kids).  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well and definitely leaves a bad scent after being worn for a couple of hours.  It smells good in the container, but does not mix well if you sweat some - just smells like BO plus an added weird smell.  I was hoping for a citrus-y smell but it just is not the case, sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting a different scent if you want to mask odors - I have a really hard time finding anything aluminum-free that actually works, and the lavender worked better than any other brand I have tried.  Unfortunately, I have a whole tub of this one to go through so I feel bad for those  around me until I can buy a different scent.</li>
            <li> Most likely a great product for those NOT sensitive to baking soda. If you are, forget it! Unless you desire to be insanely itchy.</li>
            <li> Unsure of the seller, because I go through the primalpitpaste.com website and this is my HOLY GRAIL deodorant. It says its for kids but I&#x27;m 26 years old and it works extremely well for me. I apply it once when I get out the shower go an entire day or more without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;For those who say it doesn&#x27;t work, you are still going through an &amp;#34;armpit detox&amp;#34;. Though it didn&#x27;t happen to me as bad as I&#x27;ve heard with others, you can expect an armpit detox period where you may be stinkier then usual for days, or even weeks. It is pulling the sludge and toxins out of your body. Stick with it! I assure you it WORKS! I will never switch deodorants I am beyond happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;And idk what others are talking about with the smell, the orange is very light scent and it doesn&#x27;t stick to you. The orange smell dissapears but it keeps you smelling good all day till the next day. Remember every one that this is originally for kids so it works for me, but they do offer &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; versions. I like the tub version because I like massaging my lymph area (its good for you) and its cheaper then the stick. I bought 2 orange creamsicles through their website Buy 1 Get 1 Free- though I wasn&#x27;t planning on buying the orange, I am so happy I did. My son says it smells so delicious he wants to eat it. Jacked up Jasmine smells terrible ( I recieved samples they have those on the website) Lavender is good and so is Primal Spice. I will be using the other orange on my son this summer, hes 7, almost at that age.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my tween age daughter after learning the dangers of conventional antiperspirants. I tried it and find it works well for me, too. Am planning to order more!!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! Will only by this brand of deodorant.  Works great even though I am not a kid!</li>
            <li> It works surprisingly well!  I am impressed.  It feels gritty and not oily.  Does not leave residue on clothing.  I will for sure buy this product again.  Looking forward to trying new scents.</li>
            <li> As I read in another review, it works wonders in smelly feet! Both of my soccer playing kids could peel paint off walls post game, but using this on their feet and shins reduces funk to &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;.</li>
