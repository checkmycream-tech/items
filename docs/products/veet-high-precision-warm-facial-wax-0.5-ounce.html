            <li>, I gave it to my sister and told her &#x27;best of luck\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li>This seemed like the ideal solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t been able to get it perfect every time.</li>
            <li>That was good.</li>
            <li>stars, just because I have no basis of comparison and it seems like a good kit for what it is.</li>
            <li>But repeated applications did a good job at removing almost all.</li>
            <li>because it required repeated applications for good results my wife said it is not something she would use all the time.</li>
            <li>The tube seemed so convenient and I loved that the strips were durable  </li>
            <li>That was the good news.  </li>
            <li>I am not convinced that this is a good value for your money.</li>
            <li>I love both!</li>
            <li>I held an eyebrow shaping party with 6 women (including myself) and the first person&#x27;s eye brows came out GREAT!</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great opportunity to try it because it came in a nice neat dispenser and looked reasonably easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I microwaved a cup of water and put the wax in the water to warm.</li>
            <li>This product is a nice concept, but doesn&#x27;t work so well in</li>
            <li>This product is a nice concept, but doesn&#x27;t work so well in practice.</li>
            <li>but she states that you use a warmer water temperature than is recommended and warm it for longer than recommended as well.</li>
            <li>I tend to use the unbleached kind.</li>
            <li>Thought this would be a nice alternative.  </li>
            <li>I warm them with my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Plus, the consistency of the wax changes greatly so you have to go in quickly.  </li>
            <li>In theory and in practice it is easy to use in theory, but what good is ease of use with no end results?</li>
            <li>It is SO very easy to use</li>
            <li>and I also love the warm wax.</li>
            <li>But that it is a good item to have available when she felt up to the &#x27;work&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the old fashioned way is the best way</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would probably work even better if you heated it in a microwave or something; but that really isn&#x27;t the intended use for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools that they include are not at all impressive and do not help you to more precisely spread the wax.</li>
            <li>and I liked how easy the wax was to wash off.  </li>
            <li>it was a \\&quot;hot mess,\\&quot; and not in any good kind of way at all.  </li>
            <li>First, let me preface by saying that if you have any spare \\&quot;linen\\&quot; laying around then that is the best material to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; hair with after applying wax, not measly strips.</li>
            <li>And realistically, this product is more of an in-between touch up</li>
            <li>Save money with Veet but spend a lot of time - or go to the salon and save time but spend more money.et but spend a lot of time - or go to the salon and save time but spend more money.</li>
            <li>i wish they would give you more strips, i&#x27;ve used all mine</li>
            <li>I in reading the precautions, I realized that I might have too many imperfections on my skin to be able to safely use the product.  </li>
            <li>Bandaids take more hair off than this product.</li>
            <li>and we all know that is even more unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I wanted this to remove the hair from my top lip.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a cheaper solution to get rid of hair instead of going to a salon and paying more money.</li>
            <li>was make my top lip tender.</li>
            <li>Then you find your fingers are gummy, you have wax residue on your face, everything you touchy gets gummy, and surprise, most of the hairs are still there.</li>
            <li>and I think I ripped off the top layer of skin, but ALL of the hair remained.  </li>
            <li>I am admittedly very nervous about home waxing, although it would be great if I could get comfortable doing it at home.  </li>
            <li>You have to use very, very hot tap water to warm up the wax though.  </li>
            <li>I called the toll free number on the package (1-866-252-5327) and learned that there was no definition of elderly, but it would be safe to use if my skin was \\&quot;healthy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting my eyebrows professional waxed for years and thought it would be great to try to do them myself.</li>
            <li>Wax came out easy on the plastic applicator, but spreading it over my lip was impossible/difficult to do.</li>
            <li>instructions for this Veet wax are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>I did like that the cloths strips are easy to wash a reuse</li>
            <li>Wax washes off easily</li>
            <li>Cloth strips are easy to wash and reuse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife says this was fairly easy to use</li>
            <li>Also she found it easy to wash</li>
            <li>Having followed the directions, I found the wax hair remover not that easy to warm up in a cup of hot water.</li>
            <li>Baby fine hair...</li>
            <li>Overall she wasn&#x27;t happy with the product.</li>
            <li>The only person that was happy was the first person that tried the product (because the wax was warmed in the water before the top was opened).</li>

            <li>Parissa Quick And Easy Wax Strips]] or using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this through the Amazon Vine program and was excited to try this out.  </li>
            <li>Having used strips and sugar waxes before, I was familiar with how to use this product.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I have used veet products in the past and was very happy with the results, not so with this product.</li>
            <li>Once warm enough the waxing kit worked ok, removing around 75% of hair, not removing all.</li>
            <li>When you heat it up hot enough it spreads fairly well and does an okay job of removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy to unpack my Veet High Precision Warm Facial Wax kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>Easy, right?</li>
            <li>i actually bought mine at walmart thinking it would be a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>First, prep was easy.</li>
            <li>I was finding that the wax is almost taffy-like unless heated very hot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps more skilled women would have success with Veet Facial Wax.</li>
            <li>So I was all too happy to try this less expensive option out in the privacy of my own home and loved it!</li>
            <li>I figured I wouldn&#x27;t mess around with the eyebrows until I was experienced with this stuff, so I thought I would do the lip.</li>
            <li>You float the tube in a cup of hot water and hope you got it just right to dab on your face at just the precise thickness.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have even minded the mess, if it had been more effective, but it just didn&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li>where it needed to be, making me aware that this would be better suited for a broad area than a precise one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience using warm facial wax, but I decided to give it a try to control my wayward eyebrows.</li>
            <li>have a lot of experience waxing; I wax my own legs using traditional wax and muslin strips.</li>
            <li>I was excited about receiving this product because I really thought it would do the trick...</li>
            <li>Right now I use[[ASIN</li>
            <li>its a balance between the wax being warm and how long to let the strip sit, before you pull....i think.</li>
            <li>For this reason, I recommend getting your brows done professionally first and then taking a picture right afterwards and printing it.</li>
            <li>Nice small container of wax that is easy to manage&lt;br</li>
            <li>My female companion loves it, so do I. Very smooth skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>The Veet High Precision Warm Facial Wax works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ended up using an inexpensive mug-sized water heater ($10) to keep the water perpetually hot</li>
            <li>Although the process would be a time-consuming one, I believe I could have completely hair-free forearms pain free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Unless you&#x27;re willing to let your hair grow to Wolfman lengths before you start, don&#x27;t expect to get anything out of this product.</li>
            <li>The directions said to submerge the tube in hot water for one minute, so I did.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product as I do not find it to work at all, no matter how hot the water.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m male.</li>
            <li>placed the wax tube into hot water, waited for it to heat up and used the stick to apply it to my face.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my hot tap water isn&#x27;t as hot as others?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to the letter, and this wasn&#x27;t my first rodeo</li>
            <li>It took quite a while for me to be able to get the wax to the temperature that it needed to be in order to use it properly.</li>
            <li>exactly like it said</li>
            <li>The product should indicate that it&#x27;s not for all ages or most ages, or it is only for those who have softer and shallower hair roots.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted to control exactly where the wax goes.</li>
            <li>It took me a few weeks to try it as I wanted to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li>: Right off the bat, I decided to really put this wax to the test with stubborn chin hairs, which I&#x27;d allowed to grow in preparation of my trial run more than I&#x27;d ever want to be seen in public with.</li>
            <li>the kit includes an applicator stick which makes it very easy to spread the wax evenly and carefully.</li>
            <li>, I always try to find something positive to say, but I&#x27;m at a loss to recommend this in any way, shape, or form.</li>
            <li>I have a warm wax kit that is very large and messy.  </li>
            <li>I put it off for a while because the very thought of hot wax on my skin terrified me.  </li>
            <li>I let my hair grow a little longer than I would normally, but again, I wanted to give it a fair try.</li>
            <li>They work very well, taking off both fine and coarse hair.</li>
            <li>i love the idea of being able to wax my eyebrows at home, but the veet facial wax has made it a little bit of a pain to do so.</li>
            <li>I ended up applying what was probably too much</li>
            <li>: Ready to throw the tube in the garbage, on a whim I decide to give my longer arm hairs a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when it was really time to use the wax, I could not do so.  </li>
            <li>very long&lt;br</li>
            <li>which I also think works really well.  </li>
            <li>which I also think works really well.  </li>
            <li>how pain-free the whole process was.</li>
            <li>does not work the way it should ive even taken it to a real nail salon and tried it..</li>
            <li>so i really wanted it and when it came</li>
            <li>from a completely clueless male point of view, this is a good product if you want to wax off facial hair.</li>
            <li>I have used other methods that work a lot better</li>
            <li>but i have more than half the tube of wax leftover.</li>
            <li>I was looking less like a polished woman and more like my husband.</li>
            <li>Alas, the product turned out to be much, much, much too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on several factors I did not use the product, but I have no reason to believe that it may be appropriate for younger folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>big problem is that this wax cools off quickly as does the tap water you heat it in.  </li>
            <li>Another thing, is that it left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Also, it was kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li>However, my fourteen year old girl took it and use it without much problem.  </li>
            <li>I had to constantly get another cup of hot water and move it over to that to prevent it from cooling too fast.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, in my career of heavy traveling, I just don&#x27;t have the time to head off to beauty salons to get it done regularly.  </li>
            <li>gave up on my eyebrows after a couple more tries and decided to try my upper lip.</li>
            <li>You have to constantly move it to a new batch of hot water to keep it hot&lt;</li>
            <li>I have intention tremors and me and warm wax in an area that SHOULD have SOME hair is probably not a good idea.</li>
            <li>In favor of the product, you simply place the tube of wax in hot water for one or two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tap water doesn&#x27;t keep the wax hot enough for</li>
            <li>I did this exactly as the instructions said and on the 3rd</li>
            <li>After following the instructions, she found it wasn&#x27;t quitesticky enough until it got too cool to work with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Attempt #3: Not yet ready to give up, my next logical conclusion is that the hairs I&#x27;m trying to remove are too short.</li>
            <li>product seemed pretty straightforward: Tube of wax, little smear-tools, etc., and the instructions were clear enough.</li>
            <li>Okay, having failed where I&#x27;d most like to have seen success, I decided to try the hairline where the hair is a tad less coarse ...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not super user friendly, but then again i have no experience with at home waxing.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I found it to be a bit messy and it really did not do a very good job of removing the hairs.  </li>
            <li>But because of the way that the wax has to be reheated in a glass of warm water, the seal on the lid was not tight after opening the product, so each successive person to try and use the wax, had a harder and harder time because of the way that the water mixed with the wax, and by the 4th person, the product was completely unusable!</li>
            <li>The wax was not thin enough</li>
            <li>I am sticking with my tweezers and a professional waxer.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised that this product came from Veet - and equally surprised that this passed whatever tests they did before putting it on the market.</li>
            <li>I had to apply it multiple times to get the results I wanted, and I just don&#x27;t have that much time to do this again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i rather go to a salon get it dont professionally</li>
            <li>It finally works ... and to moderate success.</li>
            <li>As Jerry&#x27;s wife, I  was eager to use Veet&#x27;s new High Precision Facial Wax because facial hair runs in my family.  </li>
            <li>I have gone back to the Veet Ready to Use Wax Strips for Face, which I&#x27;d used for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, while I cannot rate the product completely, there are flaws in product advertising and possible use issues.</li>

            <li>Even with near boiling water, the consistency of the wax was such it flowed sparingly.  </li>
            <li>It Barely pulled any hair.</li>
            <li>I loved the cold wax</li>
            <li>Not a SINGLE hair was removed (and it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve gone to the salon, so there was plenty of eyebrow that needed removing!).</li>
            <li>I put the strip on and peeled it back off quickly to notice that only half of the hair was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, a small heated glass or even mug of water cools quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The one positive thing was this wax washed off so you were not left picking off shards of the dried left over wax from your face.</li>

            <li> and I think I ripped off the top layer of skin, but ALL of the hair remained.  </li>
            <li> I am admittedly very nervous about home waxing, although it would be great if I could get comfortable doing it at home.  </li>
            <li> You have to use very, very hot tap water to warm up the wax though.  </li>
            <li> I called the toll free number on the package (1-866-252-5327) and learned that there was no definition of elderly, but it would be safe to use if my skin was \\&quot;healthy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my eyebrows professional waxed for years and thought it would be great to try to do them myself.</li>
            <li> Wax came out easy on the plastic applicator, but spreading it over my lip was impossible/difficult to do.</li>
            <li> instructions for this Veet wax are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> I did like that the cloths strips are easy to wash a reuse</li>

            <li> Cloth strips are easy to wash and reuse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife says this was fairly easy to use</li>
            <li> Also she found it easy to wash</li>
            <li> Having followed the directions, I found the wax hair remover not that easy to warm up in a cup of hot water.</li>
            <li> Baby fine hair...</li>
            <li> Overall she wasn&#x27;t happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The only person that was happy was the first person that tried the product (because the wax was warmed in the water before the top was opened).</li>

            <li> I got a sample of this through the Amazon Vine program and was excited to try this out.  </li>
            <li> Having used strips and sugar waxes before, I was familiar with how to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> I have used veet products in the past and was very happy with the results, not so with this product.</li>
            <li> Once warm enough the waxing kit worked ok, removing around 75% of hair, not removing all.</li>
            <li> When you heat it up hot enough it spreads fairly well and does an okay job of removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy to unpack my Veet High Precision Warm Facial Wax kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> Easy, right?</li>
            <li> i actually bought mine at walmart thinking it would be a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> First, prep was easy.</li>
            <li> I was finding that the wax is almost taffy-like unless heated very hot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps more skilled women would have success with Veet Facial Wax.</li>
            <li> So I was all too happy to try this less expensive option out in the privacy of my own home and loved it!</li>
            <li> I figured I wouldn&#x27;t mess around with the eyebrows until I was experienced with this stuff, so I thought I would do the lip.</li>
            <li> You float the tube in a cup of hot water and hope you got it just right to dab on your face at just the precise thickness.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have even minded the mess, if it had been more effective, but it just didn&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li> where it needed to be, making me aware that this would be better suited for a broad area than a precise one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience using warm facial wax, but I decided to give it a try to control my wayward eyebrows.</li>
            <li> have a lot of experience waxing; I wax my own legs using traditional wax and muslin strips.</li>
            <li> I was excited about receiving this product because I really thought it would do the trick...</li>
            <li> Right now I use[[ASIN</li>
            <li> its a balance between the wax being warm and how long to let the strip sit, before you pull....i think.</li>
            <li> For this reason, I recommend getting your brows done professionally first and then taking a picture right afterwards and printing it.</li>
            <li> Nice small container of wax that is easy to manage&lt;br</li>
            <li> My female companion loves it, so do I. Very smooth skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> The Veet High Precision Warm Facial Wax works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up using an inexpensive mug-sized water heater ($10) to keep the water perpetually hot</li>
            <li> Although the process would be a time-consuming one, I believe I could have completely hair-free forearms pain free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: Unless you&#x27;re willing to let your hair grow to Wolfman lengths before you start, don&#x27;t expect to get anything out of this product.</li>
            <li> The directions said to submerge the tube in hot water for one minute, so I did.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product as I do not find it to work at all, no matter how hot the water.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m male.</li>
            <li> placed the wax tube into hot water, waited for it to heat up and used the stick to apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my hot tap water isn&#x27;t as hot as others?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter, and this wasn&#x27;t my first rodeo</li>
            <li> It took quite a while for me to be able to get the wax to the temperature that it needed to be in order to use it properly.</li>
            <li> exactly like it said</li>
            <li> The product should indicate that it&#x27;s not for all ages or most ages, or it is only for those who have softer and shallower hair roots.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to control exactly where the wax goes.</li>
            <li> It took me a few weeks to try it as I wanted to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li> : Right off the bat, I decided to really put this wax to the test with stubborn chin hairs, which I&#x27;d allowed to grow in preparation of my trial run more than I&#x27;d ever want to be seen in public with.</li>
            <li> the kit includes an applicator stick which makes it very easy to spread the wax evenly and carefully.</li>
            <li> , I always try to find something positive to say, but I&#x27;m at a loss to recommend this in any way, shape, or form.</li>
            <li> I have a warm wax kit that is very large and messy.  </li>
            <li> I put it off for a while because the very thought of hot wax on my skin terrified me.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair grow a little longer than I would normally, but again, I wanted to give it a fair try.</li>
            <li> They work very well, taking off both fine and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> i love the idea of being able to wax my eyebrows at home, but the veet facial wax has made it a little bit of a pain to do so.</li>
            <li> I ended up applying what was probably too much</li>
            <li> : Ready to throw the tube in the garbage, on a whim I decide to give my longer arm hairs a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when it was really time to use the wax, I could not do so.  </li>
            <li> very long&lt;br</li>
            <li> which I also think works really well.  </li>
            <li> which I also think works really well.  </li>
            <li> how pain-free the whole process was.</li>
            <li> does not work the way it should ive even taken it to a real nail salon and tried it..</li>
            <li> so i really wanted it and when it came</li>
            <li> from a completely clueless male point of view, this is a good product if you want to wax off facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have used other methods that work a lot better</li>
            <li> but i have more than half the tube of wax leftover.</li>
            <li> I was looking less like a polished woman and more like my husband.</li>
            <li> Alas, the product turned out to be much, much, much too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on several factors I did not use the product, but I have no reason to believe that it may be appropriate for younger folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> big problem is that this wax cools off quickly as does the tap water you heat it in.  </li>
            <li> Another thing, is that it left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Also, it was kind of hard to use.</li>
            <li> However, my fourteen year old girl took it and use it without much problem.  </li>
            <li> I had to constantly get another cup of hot water and move it over to that to prevent it from cooling too fast.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, in my career of heavy traveling, I just don&#x27;t have the time to head off to beauty salons to get it done regularly.  </li>
            <li> gave up on my eyebrows after a couple more tries and decided to try my upper lip.</li>
            <li> You have to constantly move it to a new batch of hot water to keep it hot&lt;</li>
            <li> I have intention tremors and me and warm wax in an area that SHOULD have SOME hair is probably not a good idea.</li>
            <li> In favor of the product, you simply place the tube of wax in hot water for one or two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tap water doesn&#x27;t keep the wax hot enough for</li>
            <li> I did this exactly as the instructions said and on the 3rd</li>
            <li> After following the instructions, she found it wasn&#x27;t quitesticky enough until it got too cool to work with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Attempt #3: Not yet ready to give up, my next logical conclusion is that the hairs I&#x27;m trying to remove are too short.</li>
            <li> product seemed pretty straightforward: Tube of wax, little smear-tools, etc., and the instructions were clear enough.</li>
            <li> Okay, having failed where I&#x27;d most like to have seen success, I decided to try the hairline where the hair is a tad less coarse ...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not super user friendly, but then again i have no experience with at home waxing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found it to be a bit messy and it really did not do a very good job of removing the hairs.  </li>
            <li> But because of the way that the wax has to be reheated in a glass of warm water, the seal on the lid was not tight after opening the product, so each successive person to try and use the wax, had a harder and harder time because of the way that the water mixed with the wax, and by the 4th person, the product was completely unusable!</li>
            <li> The wax was not thin enough</li>
            <li> I am sticking with my tweezers and a professional waxer.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised that this product came from Veet - and equally surprised that this passed whatever tests they did before putting it on the market.</li>
            <li> I had to apply it multiple times to get the results I wanted, and I just don&#x27;t have that much time to do this again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i rather go to a salon get it dont professionally</li>
            <li> It finally works ... and to moderate success.</li>
            <li> As Jerry&#x27;s wife, I  was eager to use Veet&#x27;s new High Precision Facial Wax because facial hair runs in my family.  </li>
            <li> I have gone back to the Veet Ready to Use Wax Strips for Face, which I&#x27;d used for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, while I cannot rate the product completely, there are flaws in product advertising and possible use issues.</li>

            <li> Even with near boiling water, the consistency of the wax was such it flowed sparingly.  </li>
            <li> It Barely pulled any hair.</li>
            <li> I loved the cold wax</li>
            <li> Not a SINGLE hair was removed (and it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve gone to the salon, so there was plenty of eyebrow that needed removing!).</li>
            <li> I put the strip on and peeled it back off quickly to notice that only half of the hair was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a small heated glass or even mug of water cools quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The one positive thing was this wax washed off so you were not left picking off shards of the dried left over wax from your face.</li>
            <li> it totally sucks doesnt warm up comes out thick even when follow directions</li>
            <li> It was so hard to put it right</li>
            <li> As a mature person, I was not certain how \\&quot;elderly\\&quot; was defined.  </li>
            <li> at least it was in the right place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly hairy, and I&#x27;m light-haired enough that I don&#x27;t generally wax it, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.</li>
            <li> Three strip-rippings later, not a single hair showed up on the strip, meaning every single one was still on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then you pat on a tiny piece of thick gauze and smooth it down in the direction the hair is growing.</li>
            <li> 16 Strip(s)]] on my eyebrows and upper lip and they work really well; but the residue is very hard to wash off...not to mention it is hard to be precise with the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> concept of beauty salon waxing is the same as this product: use warmed up wax, spread it on in the desired shape, put a small bit of cloth onto the cooling wax, press down and then zip off quickly.  </li>
            <li> The hairs have to be fairly long as well or there isn&#x27;t enough for the wax to grab onto in order to pull the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are too big, but I cut off the \\&quot;paper\\&quot; along one long side</li>
            <li> As soon as this product gets even a little too cool if turns into taffy and is stringy and impossible to spread accurately or thinly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No major irritation of skin noticed afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommended.</li>

            <li> ... I&#x27;m very glad I received this as a review item, because I&#x27;d be terribly disappointed if I&#x27;d paid for it.</li>
            <li> I suppose the biggest complaint with this is that it gives very spotty coverage.  </li>
            <li> have been unable to get the item removed from my account, and was excited to try it out.....</li>
            <li> In fact it was different, where the other product removed the hair, this did not.</li>
            <li> excuse me, I am ALL WOMAN!!</li>
            <li> i used, that got warmed in your hands, always left me with a little rash</li>
            <li> The wax was very thick and difficult to warm.</li>
            <li> It was messy, too, my upper lip is still sticky from the experience.</li>
            <li> Going back to my messy stuff.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully, heating up the tube of wax in some hot water, spreading it on thinly and then using the little paper strip ... and nada.</li>
            <li> Waxing burns like heck, I don&#x27;t even BOTHER to try threading, and shaving apparently makes it come back worse</li>
            <li> Still, very little hair came of my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Maybe the hair wasn&#x27;t thick enough, I don&#x27;t know, but I am not going to try it on my eyebrows just yet....</li>
            <li> I grow thick coarse hair on my chin.  </li>
            <li> Then I put the fabric over the wax, pressed down, and pulled up.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d say about half the time i spread the wax, then pull, i get the hairs.</li>
            <li> Wax only does a mediocre job of removing facial hair</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t trust myself not to rip off half a brow....</li>
            <li> , I found the amount of hair removed slight.  </li>

            <li> doesnt remove alot of hair and it leaves a sticky mess</li>

            <li> This is just too much trouble.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> Even after warming this up, I felt it was too messy and didn&#x27;t take off hair in a neat swipe.</li>
            <li> So, I used even hotter water, nope, the wax was still a little hard.</li>
            <li> I was squeezing so hard just to get a little bit</li>
            <li> In addition, the precautions state that the product is not appropriate for the elderly.  </li>
            <li> plan ahead, as you need 14 hours to test it on a small patch of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wax only does a mediocre job of removing hair though.  </li>
            <li> No magic bullet.</li>
            <li> applicator is small, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I unpacked a small bottles of wax, a handful of removal strips and a plastic application wand.</li>
            <li> so I tried for another minute; still the wax was too hard.</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to like this product because this is something that I need and want.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the wax is too hard to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> This is a negative for the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This made a wait of at least 2 minutes in between waxes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it was so hard to spread an even, thin layer, I didn&#x27;t see ANY hairs come off on the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad, such a hassle to tweeze those.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was messy, uncomfortable and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a -tad- painful, in the same way as ripping a bandage off my hairy arms is, but bearable.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the other cold wax stips brand  </li>
            <li> its dumb dont buy</li>
            <li> Getting the warmed wax out of the tube was SO difficult.</li>
            <li> I WAS SOOOO WRONG</li>
            <li> I was totally wrong.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I wanted some alternative to salon waxing as its expensive  </li>
            <li> Useless.  </li>
            <li> Well, it was a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have as bad of a reaction to it as I do to the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The bad news was that it didn&#x27;t work as planned.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so ugly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We were all very disappointed in the way that the product worked.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wanted to try this for eyebrow shaping.  Honestly, in my career of heavy traveling, I just don&#x27;t have the time to head off to beauty salons to get it done regularly.  This seemed like the ideal solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of beauty salon waxing is the same as this product: use warmed up wax, spread it on in the desired shape, put a small bit of cloth onto the cooling wax, press down and then zip off quickly.  But here are the differences between a salon product and a home product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Salon wax is heated at a constant temperature.  This product&#x27;s directions require a heated glass of water.  Unfortunately, a small heated glass or even mug of water cools quickly.  You have to heat up several times for two eyebrows.  Plus, the consistency of the wax changes greatly so you have to go in quickly.  I ended up using an inexpensive mug-sized water heater ($10) to keep the water perpetually hot (Not warm!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  There is artistry involved in shaping eyebrows. For this reason, I recommend getting your brows done professionally first and then taking a picture right afterwards and printing it. That will give you a template for future brow shaping at home.  And realistically, this product is more of an in-between touch up - I&#x27;d recommend the salon every few months just to keep the shape of your brows symmetrical and proportionate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Don&#x27;t expect to get all the hairs out at once. It will take several applications of wax (and several times heating the water up again).  The hairs have to be fairly long as well or there isn&#x27;t enough for the wax to grab onto in order to pull the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  The directions for this are the smallest I&#x27;ve seen - I couldn&#x27;t read them at all. You can read the directions online here: [...]  note that it isn&#x27;t recommended for diabetics or elderly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, it is very inexpensive and with a few precautions/work, it will get the job done. It all depends on whether you would rather spend time or money to get your brows done.  Save money with Veet but spend a lot of time - or go to the salon and save time but spend more money.et but spend a lot of time - or go to the salon and save time but spend more money.</li>
            <li> Terrible product... i will never buy it again...</li>
            <li> This is the second Veet product for facial hair removal I&#x27;ve tried. I love both! I loved the cold wax and I also love the warm wax. As you may remember, I have a hair on the face phobia. With menopause looming, I fight the battle against chin hair daily. The Veet High Precision Warm Facial Wax works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it on my brows. I have intention tremors and me and warm wax in an area that SHOULD have SOME hair is probably not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Just to clarify, I got this product in the Vine program. I regularly go to a salon to get my eyebrows wased and occasionally my upper lip. I figured I wouldn&#x27;t mess around with the eyebrows until I was experienced with this stuff, so I thought I would do the lip. Easy, right? Well, it was a bad experience. First, prep was easy. I microwaved a cup of water and put the wax in the water to warm. That was good. But then, I went to apply it to my upper lip. Wax came out easy on the plastic applicator, but spreading it over my lip was impossible/difficult to do. I ended up applying what was probably too much (I couldn&#x27;t get it to spread evenly). Then I put the fabric over the wax, pressed down, and pulled up. Nothing came off. My upper lip still had fuzzy hair on it. I did it again, and the same result. I threw this in garbage. Cheaper for you to get my upper lip done in the nail salon for $5.00 then spending money on something that doesn&#x27;t work. It was messy, too, my upper lip is still sticky from the experience. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I am admittedly very nervous about home waxing, although it would be great if I could get comfortable doing it at home.  I thought this would be a great opportunity to try it because it came in a nice neat dispenser and looked reasonably easy to use.  Unfortunately, I found it to be a bit messy and it really did not do a very good job of removing the hairs.  I have used other methods that work a lot better</li>
            <li> i love the idea of being able to wax my eyebrows at home, but the veet facial wax has made it a little bit of a pain to do so. i&#x27;d say about half the time i spread the wax, then pull, i get the hairs. i haven&#x27;t been able to get it perfect every time. its a balance between the wax being warm and how long to let the strip sit, before you pull....i think. i wish they would give you more strips, i&#x27;ve used all mine but i have more than half the tube of wax leftover. it&#x27;s not super user friendly, but then again i have no experience with at home waxing. the kit includes an applicator stick which makes it very easy to spread the wax evenly and carefully. I wish i could get it to work every time! i&#x27;d buy it over and over if i could.</li>
            <li> Removes hair but in a hit and miss manner. What should take one application, takes several and even then does not necessarily work. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> When I read the marketing material for this wax, I dreamed it would be the answer to my long-time prayers. Alas, the product turned out to be much, much, much too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempt #1: Right off the bat, I decided to really put this wax to the test with stubborn chin hairs, which I&#x27;d allowed to grow in preparation of my trial run more than I&#x27;d ever want to be seen in public with. Three strip-rippings later, not a single hair showed up on the strip, meaning every single one was still on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempt #2: Okay, having failed where I&#x27;d most like to have seen success, I decided to try the hairline where the hair is a tad less coarse ... to the same dismal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempt #3: Not yet ready to give up, my next logical conclusion is that the hairs I&#x27;m trying to remove are too short. So I move on to the eyebrows. The Veet wax is no match for even these longer, thinner strays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempt #4: Ready to throw the tube in the garbage, on a whim I decide to give my longer arm hairs a try. Mind you, the product is totally not intended for this purpose. But guess what? It finally works ... and to moderate success. Although the process would be a time-consuming one, I believe I could have completely hair-free forearms pain free. I&#x27;d also likely use up the entire tube of wax in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Unless you&#x27;re willing to let your hair grow to Wolfman lengths before you start, don&#x27;t expect to get anything out of this product. In theory and in practice it is easy to use in theory, but what good is ease of use with no end results?</li>
            <li> I requested this product to review through the Amazon Vine program and never did receive the product to review, so I cannot offer you my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been unable to get the item removed from my account, and was excited to try it out.....but I guess I will not be doing so this time around!</li>
            <li> As Jerry&#x27;s wife, I  was eager to use Veet&#x27;s new High Precision Facial Wax because facial hair runs in my family.  I put it off for a while because the very thought of hot wax on my skin terrified me.  In favor of the product, you simply place the tube of wax in hot water for one or two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when it was really time to use the wax, I could not do so.  I in reading the precautions, I realized that I might have too many imperfections on my skin to be able to safely use the product.  In addition, the precautions state that the product is not appropriate for the elderly.  As a mature person, I was not certain how \\&quot;elderly\\&quot; was defined.  I called the toll free number on the package (1-866-252-5327) and learned that there was no definition of elderly, but it would be safe to use if my skin was \\&quot;healthy\\&quot;.  This is a negative for the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on several factors I did not use the product, but I have no reason to believe that it may be appropriate for younger folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use the product, plan ahead, as you need 14 hours to test it on a small patch of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, while I cannot rate the product completely, there are flaws in product advertising and possible use issues.</li>
            <li> My female companion loves it, so do I. Very smooth skin afterwards. No major irritation of skin noticed afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this through the Amazon Vine program and was excited to try this out.  Right now I use[[ASIN:B0002PU864 Parissa Quick And Easy Wax Strips Face and Bikini 16 Strip(s)]] on my eyebrows and upper lip and they work really well; but the residue is very hard to wash off...not to mention it is hard to be precise with the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for this Veet wax are easy to follow.  You have to use very, very hot tap water to warm up the wax though.  I was finding that the wax is almost taffy-like unless heated very hot.  When you heat it up hot enough it spreads fairly well and does an okay job of removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big problem is that this wax cools off quickly as does the tap water you heat it in.  I had to constantly get another cup of hot water and move it over to that to prevent it from cooling too fast.  As soon as this product gets even a little too cool if turns into taffy and is stringy and impossible to spread accurately or thinly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would probably work even better if you heated it in a microwave or something; but that really isn&#x27;t the intended use for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools that they include are not at all impressive and do not help you to more precisely spread the wax. I did like that the cloths strips are easy to wash a reuse and I liked how easy the wax was to wash off.  I didn&#x27;t have as bad of a reaction to it as I do to the [[ASIN:B0002PU864 Parissa Quick And Easy Wax Strips]] (which sometimes causes me to break out a bit a couple days after using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax only does a mediocre job of removing hair though.  I had to go back and pluck out some hair that it had missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice small container of wax that is easy to manage&lt;br /&gt;- Wax washes off easily&lt;br /&gt;- Cloth strips are easy to wash and reuse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Tap water doesn&#x27;t keep the wax hot enough for very long&lt;br /&gt;- You have to constantly move it to a new batch of hot water to keep it hot&lt;br /&gt;- As the wax cools it becomes very stringy and taffy like making making it hard to put on evenly and precisely&lt;br /&gt;- The precision tools are no help&lt;br /&gt;- Wax only does a mediocre job of removing facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally will be sticking to my [[ASIN:B0002PU864 Parissa Quick And Easy Wax Strips]] or using [[ASIN:B002B9V8SG Sally Hansen Naturally Bare Honey Wax Hair Remover for Face]] which I also think works really well.  This product is a nice concept, but doesn&#x27;t work so well in practice.s the wax cools it becomes very stringy and taffy like making making it hard to put on evenly and precisely&lt;br /&gt;- The precision tools are no help&lt;br /&gt;- Wax only does a mediocre job of removing facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally will be sticking to my [[ASIN:B0002PU864 Parissa Quick And Easy Wax Strips]] or using [[ASIN:B002B9V8SG Sally Hansen Naturally Bare Honey Wax Hair Remover for Face]] which I also think works really well.  This product is a nice concept, but doesn&#x27;t work so well in practice.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the other cold wax stips brand  i used, that got warmed in your hands, always left me with a little rash and I hoped this product would be different. In fact it was different, where the other product removed the hair, this did not. I had to use 5 strips to remove the hair from my upper lip (which wasn&#x27;t THAT hairy to begin with) and ended up reaching for my tweezers to finish up. Maybe the hair wasn&#x27;t thick enough, I don&#x27;t know, but I am not going to try it on my eyebrows just yet.... I don&#x27;t trust myself not to rip off half a brow....</li>
            <li> Having followed the directions, I found the wax hair remover not that easy to warm up in a cup of hot water. Even with near boiling water, the consistency of the wax was such it flowed sparingly.  Once the cloth pieces place and torn off, I found the amount of hair removed slight.  I had to repeated do the same area, to get the desired results.  By then, my skin was quite irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used a wax hair remover, I had an idea what to expect. However I had never used one that needed cloth to aid removal. This of course limits the number of uses you have per bottle. Mind you, this would be less of an issue if it worked well. It doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one positive thing was this wax washed off so you were not left picking off shards of the dried left over wax from your face.</li>
            <li> I tried product on several places--eyebrow, chin, upper lip, cheek...and it did put off some hairs, esp. peachfuzz, but I had to go over areas a couple of times, and it still did not get them all, esp the wirey ones. Too bad, such a hassle to tweeze those. Also, the strips, though you get a whole lot of them, are pretty small and narrow, so you can&#x27;t do big areas at the same time. I like the fact that you can rinse the strips of paper out and re-use them. Another thing, is that it left my skin feeling soft and smooth. I am going to continue to use it every day or so, but get electolysis for the tough-guys. No magic bullet.</li>
            <li> So I received this wax a couple of months ago. It took me a few weeks to try it as I wanted to give it a fair shot. I let my hair grow a little longer than I would normally, but again, I wanted to give it a fair try. The directions said to submerge the tube in hot water for one minute, so I did. The wax was not thin enough so I tried for another minute; still the wax was too hard. So, I used even hotter water, nope, the wax was still a little hard. I tried it anyway,and placed the strip on it, let it sit as directed, then pulled. I counted four hairs on the strip!&lt;br /&gt;The next time I tried it I boiled the water, let it sit for 2 minutes and tried again. Still, very little hair came of my upper lip. I would not recommend this product as I do not find it to work at all, no matter how hot the water. I will go back to a cream lotion.</li>
            <li> Getting the warmed wax out of the tube was SO difficult. I was squeezing so hard just to get a little bit out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is small, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had wax just about everywhere I DIDN&#x27;T want it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it was so hard to spread an even, thin layer, I didn&#x27;t see ANY hairs come off on the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was messy, uncomfortable and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps more skilled women would have success with Veet Facial Wax. I&#x27;ve never tried this type of thing before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And forget trying this product on coarse hair (men, don&#x27;t even THINK of it). Baby fine hair...yeah, maybe. But then, why even bother?</li>
            <li> I was excited about receiving this product because I really thought it would do the trick...I WAS SOOOO WRONG I wasted my money it did not remove any hair at all.</li>
            <li> Bandaids take more hair off than this product. I give it NO stars! The company&#x27;s name convienced me to buy it. I will never purchase another veet product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am horribly aggrieved and offended by this MOUSTACHE that seems to like sprouting on my lip...excuse me, I am ALL WOMAN!! Gitoutteah!!!! So I have to get rid of it immediately and it HURTS. Waxing burns like heck, I don&#x27;t even BOTHER to try threading, and shaving apparently makes it come back worse and we all know that is even more unacceptable. So I was all too happy to try this less expensive option out in the privacy of my own home and loved it! It is SO very easy to use and I couldn&#x27;t get over how pain-free the whole process was. I don&#x27;t do well with pain. So I say it is a gem to have on-hand for those moments when you&#x27;re about to head out the door, give yourself a once-over and see something that must be addressed at once! LOL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my eyebrows professional waxed for years and thought it would be great to try to do them myself. Well, maybe it would ... but not with this product! I followed the instructions carefully, heating up the tube of wax in some hot water, spreading it on thinly and then using the little paper strip ... and nada. Not a SINGLE hair was removed (and it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve gone to the salon, so there was plenty of eyebrow that needed removing!). I tried again; still nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up on my eyebrows after a couple more tries and decided to try my upper lip. It&#x27;s not particularly hairy, and I&#x27;m light-haired enough that I don&#x27;t generally wax it, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. Nothing there, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ... I&#x27;m very glad I received this as a review item, because I&#x27;d be terribly disappointed if I&#x27;d paid for it.</li>
            <li> i actually bought mine at walmart thinking it would be a good purchase.  after failing twice - i just pitched it in the garbage.  i will be returning to sally hansen products.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m male. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience using warm facial wax, but I decided to give it a try to control my wayward eyebrows. My verdict? I have a lot of respect for women who do this ritually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seemed pretty straightforward: Tube of wax, little smear-tools, etc., and the instructions were clear enough. I followed them, I did the deed, and it did work. It was a -tad- painful, in the same way as ripping a bandage off my hairy arms is, but bearable. The results were acceptable. I probably won&#x27;t make a habit of this, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So from a completely clueless male point of view, this is a good product if you want to wax off facial hair. I wouldn&#x27;t dare use it on my beard or the hair above my lip, but for the edges of my eyebrows? Yeah, it&#x27;s okay. It was probably a lot easier than plucking each individual hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars, just because I have no basis of comparison and it seems like a good kit for what it is.</li>
            <li> I needed a brow wax something awful. I was looking less like a polished woman and more like my husband. I was pretty happy to unpack my Veet High Precision Warm Facial Wax kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening, I unpacked a small bottles of wax, a handful of removal strips and a plastic application wand. Having used strips and sugar waxes before, I was familiar with how to use this product. Nevertheless, I read the instructions and followed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed the wax tube into hot water, waited for it to heat up and used the stick to apply it to my face. It was so hard to put it right where it needed to be, making me aware that this would be better suited for a broad area than a precise one. I put the strip on and peeled it back off quickly to notice that only half of the hair was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before trying again, I had to heat up the wax again. This made a wait of at least 2 minutes in between waxes. Perhaps my hot tap water isn&#x27;t as hot as others?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I gave it to my sister and told her &#x27;best of luck\\&quot;! I am sticking with my tweezers and a professional waxer.</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to like this product because this is something that I need and want. I wanted this to remove the hair from my top lip. I thought this was a cheaper solution to get rid of hair instead of going to a salon and paying more money. I was totally wrong. I followed the directions and tried to do this a couple of time before giving up. This did not work all it did was make my top lip tender.</li>
            <li> My wife says this was fairly easy to use but she states that you use a warmer water temperature than is recommended and warm it for longer than recommended as well. Otherwise the wax is too hard to squeeze out. Once warm enough the waxing kit worked ok, removing around 75% of hair, not removing all. But repeated applications did a good job at removing almost all. Also she found it easy to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But because it required repeated applications for good results my wife said it is not something she would use all the time. But that it is a good item to have available when she felt up to the &#x27;work&#x27;.</li>
            <li> it totally sucks doesnt warm up comes out thick even when follow directions doesnt remove alot of hair and it leaves a sticky mess i dont recommend anyone buy this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless, unfortunately. I followed the instructions to the letter and tried over and over again, and it simply did not remove any hair. I am really surprised that this product came from Veet - and equally surprised that this passed whatever tests they did before putting it on the market.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was doing a craft project, and my fingers were all sticky with glue.  I wouldn&#x27;t have even minded the mess, if it had been more effective, but it just didn&#x27;t work well at all.  I followed the instructions to the letter, and this wasn&#x27;t my first rodeo so I knew what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was a \\&quot;hot mess,\\&quot; and not in any good kind of way at all.  I&#x27;m sorry, I always try to find something positive to say, but I&#x27;m at a loss to recommend this in any way, shape, or form.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing !! I was excited to try it.  The tube seemed so convenient and I loved that the strips were durable  But after four attempts on the same area I got nothing off my chin!!!! Ever since I had the Mirena put it I grow thick coarse hair on my chin.  It&#x27;s so ugly.  I wanted some alternative to salon waxing as its expensive  However I will just use the Veet pull apart wax strips.  Buy thOse instead. They get everything !!!</li>
            <li> You float the tube in a cup of hot water and hope you got it just right to dab on your face at just the precise thickness. Then you pat on a tiny piece of thick gauze and smooth it down in the direction the hair is growing. What if you have a cluster of hairs in the same spot growing in different directions! Then you rip the gauze off. Then you find your fingers are gummy, you have wax residue on your face, everything you touchy gets gummy, and surprise, most of the hairs are still there. This is just too much trouble. Get tweezers.</li>
            <li> I held an eyebrow shaping party with 6 women (including myself) and the first person&#x27;s eye brows came out GREAT! But because of the way that the wax has to be reheated in a glass of warm water, the seal on the lid was not tight after opening the product, so each successive person to try and use the wax, had a harder and harder time because of the way that the water mixed with the wax, and by the 4th person, the product was completely unusable! There also was not enough was papers included to do everyone (if it had worked).&lt;br /&gt;We were all very disappointed in the way that the product worked. The only person that was happy was the first person that tried the product (because the wax was warmed in the water before the top was opened).</li>
            <li> does not work the way it should ive even taken it to a real nail salon and tried it.. waste of money</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a wax to remove those unwanted hairs at her upper lip and between the eyebrows.  I told her about this one she could try and she asked me to get it for her.  That was the good news.  The bad news was that it didn&#x27;t work as planned.  After following the instructions, she found it wasn&#x27;t quitesticky enough until it got too cool to work with.  Once it cooled do a point it would work, it left red marks where her a couple of layers of skin once were.  Overall she wasn&#x27;t happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I probably would not get this product again. I am used to having facial waxes at salons and this did not compare at all. It did take off hair, but not all of it. Also, it was kind of hard to use. It took quite a while for me to be able to get the wax to the temperature that it needed to be in order to use it properly. It still never felt like the wax I get in the salon, though.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work as it was advertised to do. It Barely pulled any hair. Definitely won&#x27;t buy again.  I&#x27;ll stick with my current regimen.</li>
            <li> I suppose the biggest complaint with this is that it gives very spotty coverage.  I had to apply it multiple times to get the results I wanted, and I just don&#x27;t have that much time to do this again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they need to go back to the drawing board with this one.</li>
            <li> so i really wanted it and when it came i did everything exactly like it said and i tried several times and it didnt work its dumb dont buy i rather go to a salon get it dont professionally</li>
            <li> First, let me preface by saying that if you have any spare \\&quot;linen\\&quot; laying around then that is the best material to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; hair with after applying wax, not measly strips. You can find linen materials left over at a local craft/sewing shops. I tend to use the unbleached kind. You can use both sides. Even after warming this up, I felt it was too messy and didn&#x27;t take off hair in a neat swipe. I am not convinced that this is a good value for your money.</li>
            <li> I have a warm wax kit that is very large and messy.  Thought this would be a nice alternative.  It took off about 6 tiny hairs after 3 tried, gave me a sore, red lip.  Ouch.  Going back to my messy stuff.</li>
            <li> Useless.  Sometimes the old fashioned way is the best way</li>
            <li> As the majority of the reviewers indicated, this product doesn&#x27;t work on adults, especially men.  However, my fourteen year old girl took it and use it without much problem.  The product should indicate that it&#x27;s not for all ages or most ages, or it is only for those who have softer and shallower hair roots.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to control exactly where the wax goes. It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I even warmed up the tube by putting it in mug of steaming water, but that didn&#x27;t help. It didn&#x27;t go on neatly but I figured that didn&#x27;t matter, at least it was in the right place. No hair came off, though, when I put on the strips to pull the wax off. I tried several times over a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of experience waxing; I wax my own legs using traditional wax and muslin strips. I have gone back to the Veet Ready to Use Wax Strips for Face, which I&#x27;d used for a long time. They work very well, taking off both fine and coarse hair. I warm them with my hair dryer. They are too big, but I cut off the \\&quot;paper\\&quot; along one long side so I can see where my lips begin (yikes, I don&#x27;t want wax on my lips), and cut off some of the \\&quot;waxed\\&quot; part of the paper as well to make the wax section shorter.</li>
            <li> I did this exactly as the instructions said and on the 3rd try it had removed a total of 1 hair.  Horrible product.  Try the Avon facial hair strips.  They&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li> The wax was very thick and difficult to warm. I difficulty spreading it and then it did not remove the desired hair. I have used veet products in the past and was very happy with the results, not so with this product. Spend the money, go to the salon!</li>
            <li> I picked this up at the grocery store for hairs on my chin, neck, and face.  I followed instructions to the letter and I think I ripped off the top layer of skin, but ALL of the hair remained.  I&#x27;m so disappointed.  Do NOT buy!</li>
