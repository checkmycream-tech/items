            <li>I will definitely be ordering my own bottle!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a significant improvement in my skin and my acne.</li>
            <li>First I cleansed my face in the shower, and enjoyed the mud mask before bed.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy another product from this company and strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My face feels clean &amp; my skin feels tighter after I have used the mask.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing, after peeling it off my skin was so soft</li>
            <li>I use the mask about four days a week, but I&#x27;m sure you could use it much more and get the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife used this and was happy with how clear and soft her skin felt and look.</li>
            <li>It is a really pleasant mask to wear, and when I wash it off, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel stripped or dry.</li>
            <li>I like the mild fragrance</li>
            <li>I love that this mask is 100% Organic and Natural and it makes me more confident on using it more and applying it to other areas of my body.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll enjoy all the benefits of it within the first 3 to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>It worked better after two uses than her normal face cleanser did after two years.</li>
            <li>It washes off really easy, and your skin immediately feels much cleaner and fresher.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I am glad that it is 100% organic and natural.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and touchable my skin is after using this.  </li>
            <li>It gives it this fresh, nourished feeling.</li>
            <li>I love the product, it leaves your skin soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>

            <li>I use it right after my evening shower and my skin is now smoother than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>anything is all the craze right now, so it&#x27;s​</li>
            <li>After using it for a few weeks, my skin most not only looks must better, but feels much better too!</li>
            <li>If you ever want to splurge on yourself, make sure you pamper your skin with healthy natural ingredients only.  </li>
            <li>Over the past couple weeks, my face has greatly improved because of this product.</li>
            <li>So happy I got to try this facial mask last weekend with my girls.</li>
            <li>I just love how gentle this mask to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Once rinsed off my face felt very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks Puressant!</li>
            <li>first thing I found was the relief of psoriasis, eczema and acne.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my fine lines are much less noticeable and that over all my skin glows and feels really healthy.</li>
            <li>I’m usually pretty worried about breaking out after any skin treatment, but this one hasn’t disrupted my face at all.</li>
            <li>I love this facial mask!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new natural and all organic mud mask, be sure to give this a try.</li>
            <li>We have used other products from Puressant and have had amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Plus the mask really feels soft and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>Many products are too strong, or too weak to have any significant effect.</li>
            <li>It will pull the toxins &amp; excess oil from your skin to leave it clean &amp; soft, while stimulating &amp; improving blood circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema and we have tried many different types of products both prescription and over the counter, and since non of them gave any real benefits, she is now going to the alternative options to see if she can get her body healthier.  </li>
            <li>Price point is great compared to my other products that are similar</li>
            <li>I have mild adult acne, post acne marks, and enlarged pores.</li>
            <li>The quality of the skin on our face has a large part in our confidence.</li>
            <li>I definitely see tightening of fine lines after using this product.  </li>
            <li>The healing properties of Dead Sea Mud Mask are amazing</li>
            <li>had heard that organic dead sea skin products were amazing, and that is no joke.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really relaxing.</li>
            <li>and I do not have as much acne either.</li>
            <li>After I use this product, I always feel very refreshed and</li>
            <li>It has done absolute wonders for my face and hair.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The healing properties of this mud has really done the trick.</li>
            <li>This is a very soothing product.  </li>
            <li>I can really see that my dandruff has been reduced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can feel how much softer it is to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After trying the Puressant Cellulite Cream and absolutely loving it, I thought I would try their Dead Sea Mud Mask to improve to texture and appearance of my skin as well.</li>
            <li>I agreed on what my friend said, sometimes all you need is a nice deep cleansing facial mask.</li>
            <li>I feel like a whole new person and it is all thanks to this product!</li>
            <li>The magnesium, sodium, potassium and calcium actually remove the toxins from my skin cells and leave me feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but I&#x27;m already noticing a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was pretty amazed at the results I’ve gotten so far, and for being organic</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and definitely clearer and a more uniform tone; I definitely don&#x27;t have as much redness or inflammation.</li>
            <li>I have less acne, my skin is smoother, more elastic, and I even think the size of my pores has been reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard a lot of good things about Dead Sea Mud, and I finally decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The main reason I wanted to try it was for my face.</li>
            <li>After her satisfaction I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is a very luxurious mask and the all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>There are so many healing qualities in the Puressant Dead Sea Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head completely and since I do not like hats, the constant Florida sun takes its toll quickly.  </li>
            <li>As a 35 year old mom and business owner I am busy busy and skin care is often one of the first things that get neglected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an independent consultant for a spa company, and we have some pretty high end products.</li>
            <li>However my neighbor recently turned me on to this dead sea mud mask and the amazing restorative properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fades the area almost completely and the rough skin becomes smooth again.  </li>
            <li>Her skin is very clear and the rashes are 90% gone.  </li>
            <li>and so far I’m sold on the product!</li>
            <li>It is 100% natural!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product  that will help your skin , and while it isn&#x27;t some miracle cure, there is definitely something to the stated health benefits of dead sea mud.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t recommend this product enough, whether you have acne problems or not.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long-time user of mud masks and this Organic Dead Sea one from Puressant is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li>My wife was given this Mask to try and she raves about how it makes her skin feel so alive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had smooth facial skin, and figured it was just natural and would be this way forever, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought the Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>This is the first mud mask that I’ve tried and the third or fourth Puressant product I’ve tried</li>
            <li>This is a true Dead Sea miracle.</li>
            <li>I think sometimes all we need to go back to basic cleansing that absolutely solved my skin problem.</li>
            <li>The product was initially purchased to clear the eczema on my skin and barely two weeks of use there was noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The number of red spots have reduced significantly and I believed it can be totally removed in due time with regular application.</li>
            <li>I bought this mask along with a few other products and was certainly NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li>This dead sea mud mask was super rejuvenating and made my skin feel softer instantly.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re trying hard to improve the quality of your skin, especially on your face, there are many different types of products and techniques you may want to consider adding to your specific regimen.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and anything that is not natural</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and anything that is not natural</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a new mask to try, or if you&#x27;re looking for dead sea mud in particular, you have to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pretty basic and do not have any irritating preservatives in them , which to me gives this brand a huge leg up when looking for dead sea mud.</li>
            <li>This product has helped reduce some of my fine lines and has definitely helped with my poor size.</li>

            <li> I have noticed that my fine lines are much less noticeable and that over all my skin glows and feels really healthy.</li>
            <li> I’m usually pretty worried about breaking out after any skin treatment, but this one hasn’t disrupted my face at all.</li>
            <li> I love this facial mask!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new natural and all organic mud mask, be sure to give this a try.</li>
            <li> We have used other products from Puressant and have had amazing results.  </li>
            <li> Plus the mask really feels soft and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> Many products are too strong, or too weak to have any significant effect.</li>
            <li> It will pull the toxins &amp; excess oil from your skin to leave it clean &amp; soft, while stimulating &amp; improving blood circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and we have tried many different types of products both prescription and over the counter, and since non of them gave any real benefits, she is now going to the alternative options to see if she can get her body healthier.  </li>
            <li> Price point is great compared to my other products that are similar</li>
            <li> I have mild adult acne, post acne marks, and enlarged pores.</li>

            <li> I definitely see tightening of fine lines after using this product.  </li>

            <li> However my neighbor recently turned me on to this dead sea mud mask and the amazing restorative properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fades the area almost completely and the rough skin becomes smooth again.  </li>

            <li> and so far I’m sold on the product!</li>

            <li> This has been a great mask on both me and my 14 year old daughter. I enjoy using it or the mommy spa time. The mud pulls and tightens the face, gives you a fresh base to start with.

Price point is great compared to my other products that are similar</li>

            <li> I friend of mine uses the Puressant Dead Sea mud mask and raves about its natural health properties so I decided to give it a try on my face while I was there. It was easy to apply, just massage it onto your skin. I felt it working, tightening on my face, as soon as it started to dry. Once rinsed off my face felt very soft and smooth. I will definitely be ordering my own bottle!</li>
            <li> After trying the Puressant Cellulite Cream and absolutely loving it, I thought I would try their Dead Sea Mud Mask to improve to texture and appearance of my skin as well.

            <li> My daughter has eczema and we have tried many different types of products both prescription and over the counter, and since non of them gave any real benefits, she is now going to the alternative options to see if she can get her body healthier.  We have used other products from Puressant and have had amazing results.  She has been rubbing the dead sea mud mask on her arms for about three weeks now.  Her skin is very clear and the rashes are 90% gone.  And the best part is it is all natural and organic, so she is not putting medicines with side effects into her body any longer.</li>
            <li> As a person with sensitive skin, finding reliable products to help with my acne and overall facial skin problems is quite difficult. Many products are too strong, or too weak to have any significant effect. Not to mention the disasters from when products supposed to help with my acne actually made me break out way worse. I&#x27;d heard a lot of good things about Dead Sea Mud, and I finally decided to give it a try. I am very happy with this product. I&#x27;ve seen a significant improvement in my skin and my acne. I have less acne, my skin is smoother, more elastic, and I even think the size of my pores has been reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is really easy to use. I only leave in on for about 7-10 minutes. It&#x27;s really relaxing. I just walk around or do little chores while I have it on, it doesn&#x27;t feel gross or thick when you&#x27;re wearing it. It washes off really easy, and your skin immediately feels much cleaner and fresher. I use the mask about four days a week, but I&#x27;m sure you could use it much more and get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t recommend this product enough, whether you have acne problems or not. It&#x27;s just great for cleaning your skin from time to time too. So if you&#x27;re looking for a new mask to try, or if you&#x27;re looking for dead sea mud in particular, you have to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> If you ever want to splurge on yourself, make sure you pamper your skin with healthy natural ingredients only.

After using it for a few weeks, my skin most not only looks must better, but feels much better too!</li>
            <li> My wife recently had small mid-life crises and I was trying anything to cheer her up. One of my ideas was an at home spa day. I didn&#x27;t know what to buy so I turned to the internet for help. After doing some research I realized just how much people loved Puressant products and decided to give them a shot. I bought this mask along with a few other products and was certainly NOT disappointed! My wife used this and was happy with how clear and soft her skin felt and look. It worked better after two uses than her normal face cleanser did after two years. She also said it had a relaxing quality to it that other face masks she had tried didn&#x27;t have. After her satisfaction I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was referred to mud masks from my friend, who claimed that it helped his skin became healthier and more radiant. So I gave it a try, and I have not been disappointed by the results! Over the past couple weeks, my face has greatly improved because of this product. Firstly, I am glad that it is 100% organic and natural. My face has less wrinkles and I do not have as much acne either. I have also used this Dead Sea Mud Mask in my hair, and it has made it richer and stronger. After I use this product, I always feel very refreshed and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I am very satisfied with this product. It has done absolute wonders for my face and hair. Many people have commented that I look both healthier and more handsome. This organic Dead Sea mud mask is an amazing product at a great price. Thanks Puressant!</li>
            <li> I have been using an expensive mud mask for several months now and haven’t seen a lot of difference in my face. Then I heard about this ‘Dead Sea Mud Mask’ and thought I’d give It a try. I have to say that I was pretty amazed at the results I’ve gotten so far, and for being organic, that’s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I found was the relief of psoriasis, eczema and acne. It doesn’t heal it but if you use it regularly it helps to keep it under control. It also helps prevent hair loss if you massage it into your scalp. The main reason I wanted to try it was for my face. The mud mask made my skin feel firmer and smoother after only a few uses. The magnesium, sodium, potassium and calcium actually remove the toxins from my skin cells and leave me feeling clean and refreshed. I also have seen where it helps remove the toxins and ugly cellulite by promoting blood circulation and relaxes nerves. I plan on trying those areas next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another amazing fact I just heard is that researchers have found that the mud compresses helps reduce knee pain from osteoarthritis. Since I have had scope surgery on both my knees I am definitely going to try it! It’s a lot less expensive than what I have been using and so far I’m sold on the product!</li>
            <li> When it comes to my skin care I like products that are gentle but effective which is why I absolutely love this product.  As a 35 year old mom and business owner I am busy busy and skin care is often one of the first things that get neglected.  However my neighbor recently turned me on to this dead sea mud mask and the amazing restorative properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this mud mask feels on my skin.  I love how soft and touchable my skin is after using this.  I have noticed a decrease in not only acne but also redness.  I have noticed that my fine lines are much less noticeable and that over all my skin glows and feels really healthy.</li>
            <li> I love doing and trying all sorts of mud masks and spa products in the comfort of my home. This dead sea mud mask was super rejuvenating and made my skin feel softer instantly. Its all organic so I felt really good about putting natural ingredients on my face. First I cleansed my face in the shower, and enjoyed the mud mask before bed. I’m usually pretty worried about breaking out after any skin treatment, but this one hasn’t disrupted my face at all. It left my face feeling smooth and hydrated. Cant wait to do it again!</li>
            <li> I love this facial mask! Your skin deserves pampering from time to time. My skin tends to get patchy or looks dull from time to time. The healing properties of this mud has really done the trick. It will pull the toxins &amp; excess oil from your skin to leave it clean &amp; soft, while stimulating &amp; improving blood circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually do it at bedtime, when I have that extra me time. I watch TV while I have on the mask. The application is so easy. Apply to your face and let it do the work. This usually takes about 10 minutes or so. Then all I have to do is massage my face with warm water to wash it all off. My face feels clean &amp; my skin feels tighter after I have used the mask. It leaves my skin feeling so smooth. It gives it this fresh, nourished feeling.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin.  My forehead and nose are always shiny.  This naturally leads to zits and other blemishes which are bad enough when you are a teenager, but downright humiliating when you are 52,  On the opposite side of the spectrum, my scalp is very dry.  I shave my head completely and since I do not like hats, the constant Florida sun takes its toll quickly.  I cam across this Dead Sea Mud Mask, and I figured I might as well give it a try.  Nothing else has taken care of my problems, so if It ends up not working I won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, instead of disappointment, I found myself amazed!  After just one use, a complete coverage of face and scalp, I found the results amazing.  My scalp was smooth and not flaky and my forehead did not feel like the inside of a frying pan that was sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  Even better, when I woke up in the morning, my forehead and nose still felt great.  I have been using this every night for 2 weeks and I could not be happier with the way I look and feel.  This is a true Dead Sea miracle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple mud masks and none have worked as well as this one. The healing properties of this is amazing. My skin has looked unhealthy and rough which is why I&#x27;ve been trying a multitude of mud masks. This one does its job wonderfully and I&#x27;ll continue to order</li>
            <li> I have mild adult acne, post acne marks, and enlarged pores. I have used other face masks before with harsh ingredients like sulfur and other drying acne treatment chemicals, and I prefer things that lean a little bit more on the natural side. Reading about dead sea minerals, I figured that a mask like this would help draw things out of my pores while giving me the benefits of the soothing, therapeutic mineral content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this mask twice a week for a few weeks now, and I have noticed results with clearing the skin, fading acne marks and active breakouts, and clearing my congested pores. My skin is softer and definitely clearer and a more uniform tone; I definitely don&#x27;t have as much redness or inflammation. It is a really pleasant mask to wear, and when I wash it off, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel stripped or dry. I&#x27;ll definitely continue using this.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of mud masks for many years.  They do a great job of leaving drawing out debris from pores and leaving my skin smooth and soft.  The Puressant Dead Sea Mud Mask is one of the best med masks I&#x27;ve ever used.  I definitely see tightening of fine lines after using this product.  I really do think the use of Dead Sea mud makes a difference and sets this above the rest.  I haven&#x27;t yet tried it for hair loss, but I intend to do so - I have what I think is hereditary female balding and I hope it will help!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got skin that is both oily and dry at the same time, so I&#x27;ve been looking for solutions to help with my complexion and general appearance. I purchased this product to mitigate these issues, and have been pleased with the results.  I&#x27;ve been consistently using this dead sea mud mask for a few weeks now and have noticed a measurable difference in how my skin looks and feels. The ingredients are pretty basic and do not have any irritating preservatives in them , which to me gives this brand a huge leg up when looking for dead sea mud. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product  that will help your skin , and while it isn&#x27;t some miracle cure, there is definitely something to the stated health benefits of dead sea mud.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re trying hard to improve the quality of your skin, especially on your face, there are many different types of products and techniques you may want to consider adding to your specific regimen. A mud mask happens to be one of the most important, in my opinion. I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s optimal to use a mud mask at least once a week. This helps to unclog your pores (which can often get blocked) causing unwanted acne and other facial impurities. The quality of the skin on our face has a large part in our confidence. Give mud masks a try.</li>
            <li> Purchasing the ‘Dead Sea Mud Mask’ sure came as a blessing to me since I noticed great changes on my skin. The product was initially purchased to clear the eczema on my skin and barely two weeks of use there was noticeable difference in my skin. Least of all is that my skin is incredibly sensitive, and I am allergic to sulfates, so finding products that works without irritating my skin has been difficult.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing because I discovered that it cures psoriasis, acne and can be used for my hair as well too. The mud mask also made my skin feel firmer and smoother. Need I say more, but to strongly recommend that anyone wanting to improve their skin to try it.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. My husband got it for me for mothers day. With a newborn at home, it is so nice to treat myself to a relaxing afternoon. I feel absolutely amazing after using this mud mask. My skin feels rejuvenated and healthy. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time user of mud masks and this Organic Dead Sea one from Puressant is fabulous. I usually use masks in the shower after the pores of my face have opened from the steam. I allow it to sit while I continue to bathe. After about 5 or so minutes, I rinse and my skin feels energized and refreshed. I love that this mask is 100% Organic and Natural and it makes me more confident on using it more and applying it to other areas of my body. Just recommended this one to my sister and cousin! Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely fantastic product. I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but I&#x27;m already noticing a huge difference. It&#x27;s also quite relaxing to use in a strange way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an independent consultant for a spa company, and we have some pretty high end products. But this product compares to or is better than the product that I sell! I love the product, it leaves your skin soft and rejuvenated. Great product and I recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried this mud mask when I was staying with a friend.  She has been using it regularly and made me try it out.  It is a very luxurious mask and the all natural ingredients makes it even more pleasant to use.  It is nice to know that you are applying soemthing to your skin that is pure goodness, expecialy when you are using it to relax and replenish your skin.  This is a very soothing product.  I hope it comes into stock soon, so I can get some for myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had smooth facial skin, and figured it was just natural and would be this way forever, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought the Dead Sea Mud Mask. Boy was I in for a surprise! I use it right after my evening shower and my skin is now smoother than it has ever been. Best of all, it is Organic. I feel like a whole new person and it is all thanks to this product!</li>
            <li> My sister and I decided to buy this Dead Sea Mask. It has a 100% guarantee so we risked nothing to try this amazing product. It works! My skin rash is gone. My sister&#x27;s eczema is gone. We both feel better, and look better since our skin troubles are no longer visible. I am amazed. Additives in some skin relief concoctions have created more rashes then they resolved. I love the fact that this product is additive free. It is 100% natural! It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea anything is all the craze right now, so it&#x27;s​ no surprise that there is a mud mask, but this mask is different than all those others. It is so luxurious! The texture feels amazing on your skin. I have VERY sensitive skin and anything that is not natural just makes me break out and get red or makes me get acne, but this product is 100% organic. So I don’t mind putting it on and leaving it for more than 10 minutes. This product has helped reduce some of my fine lines and has definitely helped with my poor size. I also think that I can see some improvement in my skin&#x27;s elasticity although I haven’t been using it very long. I have VERY sensitive skin and anything that is not natural just makes me break out, get red or makes me get acne. Not this product, I haven’t had any issues with that at all, but if you did they do offer a 100% guarantee, which is awesome. If you are looking for a new natural and all organic mud mask, be sure to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I got this a few weeks ago and I LOVE it!  It made my skin feel really soft. I also used it on my leg.  I put a generous amount on my eczema on my leg and it soothed the itch and it looks a little less irritated since I haven&#x27;t been scratching as much.</li>
            <li> This 100% Organic Dead Sea Mud Mask has hone wonders for my eczema.  No I am not saying it has cured it but it&#x27;s the only thing I have found that will keep it under control.  It fades the area almost completely and the rough skin becomes smooth again.  There are so many healing qualities in the Puressant Dead Sea Mud Mask.  I suffer from a dry scalp and since it worked on my elbows I thought I should dry it there.  After only one treatment of using it as a hair mask I can really see that my dandruff has been reduced.&lt;br /&gt;The Ouressany 109% Organic Dead Sea Mud Mask has really been a game changer in my life. I encourage everyone to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> My skin is incredibly sensitive, and I just found out that I am allergic to sulfates, so finding products that work without irritating my skin has been difficult. When my sister found out about my allergy she put together a care package for me and this mud mask was one of the products I got to try out. This stuff is amazing, after peeling it off my skin was so soft and I had no irritation! This is the first mud mask that I’ve tried and the third or fourth Puressant product I’ve tried and I’ve loved every one of them – such a great company.</li>
            <li> I got this face mask for my regular face treatment. I like the mild fragrance and it is easy to wash off. I am able to maintain my regular smooth face complexion. However I realised that this can be used for hair scalp as well. I was having sensitive scalps with regular red spots, making my scalp feeling uncomfortable. I tried applying this on my scalp for a few sessions and I am starting to see improvement in my irritation. The number of red spots have reduced significantly and I believed it can be totally removed in due time with regular application. A wonderful product that works for me!</li>
            <li> My wife was given this Mask to try and she raves about how it makes her skin feel so alive. I can see the difference myself in how her face seems to glow and I can feel how much softer it is to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard that organic dead sea skin products were amazing, and that is no joke. I am even going to try it on myself because of the cleansing effects to help unclog my pores on my forehead and the bridge of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a premium product and we will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> So happy I got to try this facial mask last weekend with my girls. My skin situation wasn’t good at all, acnes outbreak and more. It was just horrible. I agreed on what my friend said, sometimes all you need is a nice deep cleansing facial mask. And I tried what she had and Wa La! I just love how gentle this mask to my sensitive skin. Once I rinsed the mud off, my face was a lot cleaner and pores were finer as well. I used it 3 times per week, and this week, I see the great result. The acne is officially under control and going away.  I think sometimes all we need to go back to basic cleansing that absolutely solved my skin problem. Plus this Dead Sea mud is organic without harmful chemicals. I am definitely going to buy myself one and keep using.</li>
