            <li>This perfume smells amazing and the lasts all day.</li>
            <li>but then again, I also liked the cologne in CVS that had the guy on the horse in the snow.  </li>

            <li>handy size.</li>
            <li>so when I smelt the perfume it was very strong for my taste, but the person I gave it to was in love!</li>
            <li>Many perfumes smell wonderful, but I know of no other that is also absolutely unforgettable and bewilders people by being quite unclassifiable.</li>

            <li>Amazing perfume i love it</li>
            <li>It really, honestly is the most offensive scent I&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li>tend to believe that we settle on what works for us, mostly, thru trial and error.</li>
            <li>Its my favorite, all purpose scent.</li>
            <li>but it works for more people, than not work.</li>
            <li>Im sure he knew it was a woman&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if I spend more</li>

            <li>It has very good staying power, in fact it can be too strong and one can easily use too much.</li>
            <li>jUST LOVE THE LIGHT FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li>Very good as usual: my sister was very pleased with her gift</li>
            <li>Go easy with it</li>
            <li>and I liked it very much that I asked her what it was  and bought it for my wife.</li>
            <li>This is the best scent I have ever worn, it lasts long and smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I get a free umbrella or bath loofa</li>
            <li>Then I found this Lovely Company and they were able to provide me with what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and long-lasting, and should be used accordingly.</li>
            <li>But as Ive gotten older, I understand more and more, you are supposed to wear what smells good/great, TO YOU...</li>
            <li>Very strong, doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li>This man had bought it for his wife originally, so he thought we&#x27;d all like to have it.  </li>
            <li>Does not smell like the original aromatic elixir clinque perfume???</li>
            <li>This fragrance is unique and there&#x27;s nothing else comparable.</li>
            <li>The original stopped people in their tracks.</li>
            <li>This is a unique fragrance I&#x27;ve been wearing for years.</li>
            <li>This perfume is not the original scent.</li>
            <li>and everybody notice the rich parfum.</li>
            <li>and it smells great all day long.</li>
            <li>It smells soap and water clean and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Hard to put words to how delightful this is to wear.</li>
            <li>Now at 46, I no longer like the proverbial sweet &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; that everyone and their Mom, likes.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite fragrance, and I&#x27;ve tried hundreds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s much Cheaper to make, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s changed.</li>
            <li>but the fact I do not have to buy it often it is worth the price not to smell cheap.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for a friend who couldn&#x27;t get find this perfume at such a good price as this.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and it came fairly fast.</li>
            <li>Not only was the price good, but it arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>There is a clean, fresh, smell about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many, many people tell me they like the scent that I&#x27;m wearing when I use Aromatic Elixir, it lasts all day and it is the only scent I use.</li>
            <li>this was delivered right to my door and the fragrance was as fresh as ever!</li>
            <li>all of the hysteria, as she jumped up and down, lol...</li>
            <li>but many, many yrs later, I went on vacation in Europe, for the first time..</li>
            <li>The nose for the original, forgot his exact name, Chant?</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try something new.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Never a disappointment when ordered.  </li>
            <li>it is worth it</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>although it is nice, it just wasn&#x27;t dynamic.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;it is clean, fresh and with excellent odor&lt;br /&gt;all of their products are high quality and last long</li>
            <li>I love this perfume more than any other.  </li>
            <li>This can only be described as a clean scent &amp; I have got compliments from others for many years.  </li>
            <li>and she was right.  </li>
            <li>Have used his for many years and plan to continue as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also add that, like most really divine things (good caviar, great wines) there are people who absolutely hate this scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the chypre frangrances, but I should have known that I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy this because they listed &amp;#34;patchouli&amp;#34; as one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>a man, who obviously very secure with himself, wearing a proper ladies perfume.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast too.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>This new formula is so INFERIOR in comparison to the original.</li>
            <li>I have and most likely will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>But I take them at their word and so suggest that you sample this at a cosmetics counter first, in case you turn out to be one of them.</li>
            <li>I love perfumes that linger and this one definitely lingers.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to do so as long as this seller keeps selling it at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Crisp but not austere,, &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>But this bottle I bought from this vendor was the first time I&#x27;ve had the spray function  </li>
            <li>Much more convenient simply hitting one-click for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>I have worn this parfum since I had my first daugther.</li>
            <li>The complaints I&#x27;ve read had to do with exactly this drawback.</li>
            <li>Elixer is almost religious and I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>Arrived much more quickly than I expected!</li>
            <li>Always have a positive feedback when wearing it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle refreshing scent which I love.</li>
            <li>I was given a small bottle of this from a very good friend and when I ran out went to buy a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>When I started using fragrances, many yrs ago, in the military, I basically wore what all the other guys wore and thought was trendy.</li>
            <li>There are certain things you have no business wearing with certain scents.</li>
            <li>This has long been a favorite perfume of mine,  and it is very costly at the mall, as it is real perfume.</li>
            <li>You can find them reviewing the product here, although I&#x27;ve never found one in real life.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This product is much cheaper online than in stores.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even think this was real perfume?</li>
            <li>well very pricey for me</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Thank you for helping me locate it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Gave this perfume as a gift for Christmas and it was very well received.</li>
            <li>Just be VERY SPARING</li>
            <li>Always receive very nice&lt;br /&gt;Compliments.</li>
            <li>Fast ship.  </li>
            <li>For me, its one of those designer scents that is practically &#x27;niche&#x27; in nature...its incredibly potent and heavy...and one bottle (even tho, I have two, now) can last you damn near a lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>to say, its my favorite fragrance, next to Prada Amber Pour Homme and Amouage Gold Pour Homme...I have, near 40 bottles of fragrances.</li>
            <li>It has such a spa clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>I normally buy this perfume from Macy&#x27;s but they didnt have any in stock in the large bottle.</li>
            <li>I still remember, very vividly, how excited my Mom was, when she received two bottles of perfume, from him, for Xmas..one, a bottle of Boucheron for Women, and a big bottle of Aromatics  </li>
            <li>I will just pay full price at the department store next time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He also wore Dunhill for Men (another classic).</li>
            <li>That was 12 yrs ago, and I still have that same bottle (and still 3/4ths full, no kidding), as well as a new bottle that I havent even opened, yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this purchase, especially the price..a lot less than in the store.</li>
            <li>This is the scent for you if you are an old women who wants to be avoided at any cost.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found it, otherwise, It did not fit into my budget.</li>
            <li>My favorite everyday fragrance.  </li>
            <li>she was a very elegant woman who wore tweed dresses, very smart, expensive looking heels and silk blouses.</li>
            <li>The scent is soft, warm, not sweet and very different than anything else I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li>A very classy perfume.  </li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my sister in law, it is the same exact spray that you get at Macy&#x27;s, just a tad cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Old women around the world stand up and revolt!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for a few years and 2 sprays last all day, the price is right, free shipping, and I don&#x27;t have to go to the mall.</li>
            <li>The slight saving in cost over my local store has been eaten away by not being able to evenly spray.</li>
            <li>It last me a very long time &amp; still keeps its clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Is it an old ladies perfume?  </li>
            <li>Probably, since I know an old lady that wears it.  </li>
            <li>It smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume that&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for years, fermenting.</li>
            <li>a way that suggests refreshing wind blowing through a woodsy forest at night, vintage in feel but timeless and not the least bit stuffy or old-fashioned.</li>
            <li>I had stopped wearing it for a while in early 2000</li>
            <li>I receive frequent compliments and even people who do not like fragrances have like it.</li>
            <li>and then the old lady appears.  </li>
            <li>The box and bottle came early with no damage.  </li>
            <li>My mom&#x27;s favorite perfume, purchased with one click without the hassle of the mall and the painted old cologne ninjas looking to spray you when you are least expecting it.  </li>
            <li>Altho, even then, it didnt smell feminine, per say, at all, to me....and last but not least, my Mom&#x27;s godfather, a Dr Bernard Coleman, wore it...</li>
            <li>THIS is a beautiful Fragrace - I am very Careful about Cologne/perfumes - Can&#x27;t stand the ones that are SWEET - like Red Door - they make me sick -</li>
            <li>Even before I was remotely interested in buying/wearing it, I smelled it on mnay different people, down thru the yrs.</li>
            <li>what are you wearing even the Dr come out his office because he love it the small I was setting down in the waiting room</li>
            <li>The perfume is fine but the sprayer was broken on arrival.  </li>
            <li>And he was a smart man (dead now)..</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;earthy, herbaceous, dry, tangy/spicy, pleasantly sharp, elegant but also edgy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This perfume smells amazing and the lasts all day.</li>
            <li> but then again, I also liked the cologne in CVS that had the guy on the horse in the snow.  </li>
            <li> Aromatic elixir is so exhilarating and sexy and</li>
            <li> Found out what a lady liked that she was out of, and ordered it.</li>
            <li> Even after showering, the scent still kind of remains.</li>
            <li> _ NICE</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Clinique Elixir for many years and loved the scent.</li>
            <li> handy size.</li>
            <li> so when I smelt the perfume it was very strong for my taste, but the person I gave it to was in love!</li>
            <li> Many perfumes smell wonderful, but I know of no other that is also absolutely unforgettable and bewilders people by being quite unclassifiable.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s if you like a clean, exhilarating, sexy, and noticed for your good taste in fragrances.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it (wears it rather frequently), I love it ... and life is better!</li>

            <li> My wife loves Clinique Elixir Parfum Spray for women she sprays it on as many times a possible and she smells so good that is why i continue to purchase Clinique for her and for me too because it makes her smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume i love it</li>
            <li> It really, honestly is the most offensive scent I&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li> tend to believe that we settle on what works for us, mostly, thru trial and error.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite, all purpose scent.</li>
            <li> but it works for more people, than not work.</li>
            <li> Im sure he knew it was a woman&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if I spend more</li>
            <li> if you know a grand dame, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Buy it and you will love it too.</li>

            <li> I love wearing it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relaxing, refreshing, and sensual.</li>
            <li> Men comment more on this one than anything else I wear.</li>

            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> It has very good staying power, in fact it can be too strong and one can easily use too much.</li>
            <li> jUST LOVE THE LIGHT FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li> Very good as usual: my sister was very pleased with her gift</li>
            <li> Go easy with it</li>
            <li> and I liked it very much that I asked her what it was  and bought it for my wife.</li>
            <li> This is the best scent I have ever worn, it lasts long and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I get a free umbrella or bath loofa</li>
            <li> Then I found this Lovely Company and they were able to provide me with what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and long-lasting, and should be used accordingly.</li>
            <li> But as Ive gotten older, I understand more and more, you are supposed to wear what smells good/great, TO YOU...</li>
            <li> Very strong, doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li> This man had bought it for his wife originally, so he thought we&#x27;d all like to have it.  </li>
            <li> Does not smell like the original aromatic elixir clinque perfume???</li>
            <li> This fragrance is unique and there&#x27;s nothing else comparable.</li>
            <li> The original stopped people in their tracks.</li>
            <li> This is a unique fragrance I&#x27;ve been wearing for years.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not the original scent.</li>
            <li> and everybody notice the rich parfum.</li>
            <li> and it smells great all day long.</li>
            <li> It smells soap and water clean and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Hard to put words to how delightful this is to wear.</li>
            <li> Now at 46, I no longer like the proverbial sweet &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; that everyone and their Mom, likes.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite fragrance, and I&#x27;ve tried hundreds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s much Cheaper to make, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s changed.</li>
            <li> but the fact I do not have to buy it often it is worth the price not to smell cheap.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend who couldn&#x27;t get find this perfume at such a good price as this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and it came fairly fast.</li>
            <li> Not only was the price good, but it arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> There is a clean, fresh, smell about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many, many people tell me they like the scent that I&#x27;m wearing when I use Aromatic Elixir, it lasts all day and it is the only scent I use.</li>
            <li> this was delivered right to my door and the fragrance was as fresh as ever!</li>
            <li> all of the hysteria, as she jumped up and down, lol...</li>
            <li> but many, many yrs later, I went on vacation in Europe, for the first time..</li>
            <li> The nose for the original, forgot his exact name, Chant?</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try something new.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Never a disappointment when ordered.  </li>
            <li> it is worth it</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> although it is nice, it just wasn&#x27;t dynamic.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;it is clean, fresh and with excellent odor&lt;br /&gt;all of their products are high quality and last long</li>
            <li> I love this perfume more than any other.  </li>
            <li> This can only be described as a clean scent &amp; I have got compliments from others for many years.  </li>
            <li> and she was right.  </li>
            <li> Have used his for many years and plan to continue as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also add that, like most really divine things (good caviar, great wines) there are people who absolutely hate this scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the chypre frangrances, but I should have known that I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy this because they listed &amp;#34;patchouli&amp;#34; as one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> a man, who obviously very secure with himself, wearing a proper ladies perfume.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast too.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This new formula is so INFERIOR in comparison to the original.</li>
            <li> I have and most likely will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> But I take them at their word and so suggest that you sample this at a cosmetics counter first, in case you turn out to be one of them.</li>
            <li> I love perfumes that linger and this one definitely lingers.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to do so as long as this seller keeps selling it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Crisp but not austere,, &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> But this bottle I bought from this vendor was the first time I&#x27;ve had the spray function  </li>
            <li> Much more convenient simply hitting one-click for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> I have worn this parfum since I had my first daugther.</li>
            <li> The complaints I&#x27;ve read had to do with exactly this drawback.</li>
            <li> Elixer is almost religious and I love this scent.  </li>
            <li> Arrived much more quickly than I expected!</li>
            <li> Always have a positive feedback when wearing it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle refreshing scent which I love.</li>
            <li> I was given a small bottle of this from a very good friend and when I ran out went to buy a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> When I started using fragrances, many yrs ago, in the military, I basically wore what all the other guys wore and thought was trendy.</li>
            <li> There are certain things you have no business wearing with certain scents.</li>
            <li> This has long been a favorite perfume of mine,  and it is very costly at the mall, as it is real perfume.</li>
            <li> You can find them reviewing the product here, although I&#x27;ve never found one in real life.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This product is much cheaper online than in stores.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even think this was real perfume?</li>
            <li> well very pricey for me</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Thank you for helping me locate it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Gave this perfume as a gift for Christmas and it was very well received.</li>
            <li> Just be VERY SPARING</li>
            <li> Always receive very nice&lt;br /&gt;Compliments.</li>
            <li> Fast ship.  </li>
            <li> For me, its one of those designer scents that is practically &#x27;niche&#x27; in nature...its incredibly potent and heavy...and one bottle (even tho, I have two, now) can last you damn near a lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> to say, its my favorite fragrance, next to Prada Amber Pour Homme and Amouage Gold Pour Homme...I have, near 40 bottles of fragrances.</li>
            <li> It has such a spa clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> I normally buy this perfume from Macy&#x27;s but they didnt have any in stock in the large bottle.</li>
            <li> I still remember, very vividly, how excited my Mom was, when she received two bottles of perfume, from him, for Xmas..one, a bottle of Boucheron for Women, and a big bottle of Aromatics  </li>
            <li> I will just pay full price at the department store next time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He also wore Dunhill for Men (another classic).</li>
            <li> That was 12 yrs ago, and I still have that same bottle (and still 3/4ths full, no kidding), as well as a new bottle that I havent even opened, yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase, especially the price..a lot less than in the store.</li>
            <li> This is the scent for you if you are an old women who wants to be avoided at any cost.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I found it, otherwise, It did not fit into my budget.</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday fragrance.  </li>
            <li> she was a very elegant woman who wore tweed dresses, very smart, expensive looking heels and silk blouses.</li>
            <li> The scent is soft, warm, not sweet and very different than anything else I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> A very classy perfume.  </li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my sister in law, it is the same exact spray that you get at Macy&#x27;s, just a tad cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Old women around the world stand up and revolt!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for a few years and 2 sprays last all day, the price is right, free shipping, and I don&#x27;t have to go to the mall.</li>
            <li> The slight saving in cost over my local store has been eaten away by not being able to evenly spray.</li>
            <li> It last me a very long time &amp; still keeps its clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Is it an old ladies perfume?  </li>
            <li> Probably, since I know an old lady that wears it.  </li>
            <li> It smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume that&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for years, fermenting.</li>
            <li> a way that suggests refreshing wind blowing through a woodsy forest at night, vintage in feel but timeless and not the least bit stuffy or old-fashioned.</li>
            <li> I had stopped wearing it for a while in early 2000</li>
            <li> I receive frequent compliments and even people who do not like fragrances have like it.</li>
            <li> and then the old lady appears.  </li>
            <li> The box and bottle came early with no damage.  </li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite perfume, purchased with one click without the hassle of the mall and the painted old cologne ninjas looking to spray you when you are least expecting it.  </li>
            <li> Altho, even then, it didnt smell feminine, per say, at all, to me....and last but not least, my Mom&#x27;s godfather, a Dr Bernard Coleman, wore it...</li>
            <li> THIS is a beautiful Fragrace - I am very Careful about Cologne/perfumes - Can&#x27;t stand the ones that are SWEET - like Red Door - they make me sick -</li>
            <li> Even before I was remotely interested in buying/wearing it, I smelled it on mnay different people, down thru the yrs.</li>
            <li> what are you wearing even the Dr come out his office because he love it the small I was setting down in the waiting room</li>
            <li> The perfume is fine but the sprayer was broken on arrival.  </li>
            <li> And he was a smart man (dead now)..</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;earthy, herbaceous, dry, tangy/spicy, pleasantly sharp, elegant but also edgy.</li>
            <li> It is not the same color as the bottles i normally buy, it looks like it is watered down.</li>
            <li> I have bought this in the past in large chain stores...</li>
            <li> Created in 1971, this is a very dry chypre fragrance, heavy on the patchouli and oak moss, but expertly blended with more delicate florals to produce an alluring, aromatherapeutic experience for the wearer and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting &amp; people are always asking what is that you&#x27;re wearing?</li>
            <li> this perfume was old less in macys.</li>
            <li> Its almost like wearing white sneakers with a yellow sock and a pink sock, on either foot...</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Aromatics Elixir-it is one Super Scent!</li>
            <li> It is the most inexplicable divine scent that lasts, and men like it, too.</li>
            <li> - and I have used this for YEARS - and will for as long as Clinque Continues to sell</li>
            <li> This fragrance stays all day long</li>
            <li> Aromatics Elixir was given to me and some other women by a male co-worker Christmas 1990.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for a very long time....</li>
            <li> I recently married, and the first thing my husband said after meeting my mom&#x27;s friend was how bad she smelled.</li>
            <li> i recieved it in a very short time but it is not fresh</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t loose this Company because there is no one out there that can out price them and get you your product promptly.</li>
            <li> I have never worn this fragrance without having at least one person approach and ask me what that mesmerizing scent was, and this is usually followed by \\&quot;it&#x27;s not like anything</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is one of only a few things in life I indulge in for myself.  </li>
            <li> It is everything I expected from this company.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> you CANNOT DROWN yourself in it like a standard parfume or you will leave a trail of dead people in your wake.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and anytime I wear this</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing the Clinique Aromatic Elixir Parfum for the past 20 years &amp; it is the only perfume I wear.  </li>
            <li> other than than- garbage!</li>
            <li> fail me when it was only one fourth used.  </li>
            <li> I have reviewed this previously and my opinion has not and will never change.</li>
            <li> The scent remains, rather than morphing into some odd smell or dissipating altogether.</li>
            <li> gave to mother.she said it smelled nothing like her previous bottle.</li>
            <li> My pediatrician, when I was a little guy, wore it as well...</li>
            <li> They ask me to write down the name of it as they want to buy it for their wife or girlfriend!</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It is a heavy scent</li>
            <li> It is so offensive that it almost drives me to violence ... and it is so wrong to do this to old women.  </li>
            <li> This is heavy in the beginning but immediately softens.  </li>
            <li> Please wait a few minutes once you try this.  </li>
            <li> It has gotten so bad that the scent arrives first</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and apparently not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> yea, Im serious.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not inexpensive and having to pour some in my hand to apply it makes it impossible to get a proper application.  </li>
            <li> This was over $5.00 less expensive than anywhere else</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase because the perfume didn&#x27;t smell the same as the one purchased at Dillards</li>
            <li> I want to get my girlfriend some.&amp;#34; This is my 12 year for this signature fragrance so this question is very common.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price and in packed a box.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad that the gift wrap option was not available - it would have won another star!</li>
            <li> While expensive, I needed a travel size.</li>
            <li> Maybe one day I may try it again, but it was just too strong,too cold, and too patchouli&#x27;ish.</li>
            <li> I am so mad about this bottle that i piurchased from this website.</li>
            <li> I t might make a bad men&#x27;s cologne but</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for years and have never been disappointed with it.,</li>
            <li> Very awkwardly he asked my husband, &amp;#34;Sir, may I ask your wife what perfume she has on</li>
            <li> Omg it&#x27;s the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled!!</li>
            <li> Seriously awful!!</li>
            <li> my siblings and I pulled straws to see whose room she had to stay in because the scent was so horrible and lingered for weeks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite...always get compliments ....I&#x27;ve used this spray for several years, wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else.  The best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> When I started using fragrances, many yrs ago, in the military, I basically wore what all the other guys wore and thought was trendy. But as Ive gotten older, I understand more and more, you are supposed to wear what smells good/great, TO YOU...NOT FOR ANYONE ELSE, NECESSARILY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to believe that we settle on what works for us, mostly, thru trial and error. I did, anyway. Now at 46, I no longer like the proverbial sweet &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; that everyone and their Mom, likes. I also take into consideration what fragrances, &amp;#34;go well&amp;#34; with the things that I like to wear..yea, Im serious. There are certain things you have no business wearing with certain scents. Its almost like wearing white sneakers with a yellow sock and a pink sock, on either foot...doesnt fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;saying all that to say, Aromatics Elixir, suits my age, my confidence level, and my &#x27;style&#x27;. For me, its one of those designer scents that is practically &#x27;niche&#x27; in nature...its incredibly potent and heavy...and one bottle (even tho, I have two, now) can last you damn near a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;earthy, herbaceous, dry, tangy/spicy, pleasantly sharp, elegant but also edgy. Its my favorite, all purpose scent. Granted, its an acquired taste...but it works for more people, than not work. Even before I was remotely interested in buying/wearing it, I smelled it on mnay different people, down thru the yrs. I recall, my HS Frenh teacher wearing it..Madame Schlagel..she was a very elegant woman who wore tweed dresses, very smart, expensive looking heels and silk blouses. My pediatrician, when I was a little guy, wore it as well...a man, who obviously very secure with himself, wearing a proper ladies perfume. Altho, even then, it didnt smell feminine, per say, at all, to me....and last but not least, my Mom&#x27;s godfather, a Dr Bernard Coleman, wore it...he was a minority recruiter, with the State Dept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also wore Dunhill for Men (another classic). Again, it never smelled lady-like, on him. And he was a smart man (dead now)..Im sure he knew it was a woman&#x27;s scent. But he rocked it, perfectly. I still remember, very vividly, how excited my Mom was, when she received two bottles of perfume, from him, for Xmas..one, a bottle of Boucheron for Women, and a big bottle of Aromatics  Elixir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt get it, then...all of the hysteria, as she jumped up and down, lol...but many, many yrs later, I went on vacation in Europe, for the first time..and I ducked into a scent shop in Denmark, where a bottle of AE, sat on a display..the entire store, smelled like it, along with some Nag Champa incense. I fell under a spell, immediately...the combo of that incense and AE, just hooked me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stood there talking to the salesperson, as I reflected on all the great chldhood memories, attached to AE, and all the people I knew, who wore it. i bought it. That was 12 yrs ago, and I still have that same bottle (and still 3/4ths full, no kidding), as well as a new bottle that I havent even opened, yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needless to say, its my favorite fragrance, next to Prada Amber Pour Homme and Amouage Gold Pour Homme...I have, near 40 bottles of fragrances. And these 3 are my signature scents.</li>
            <li> Have used it for several years.  Even when you can&#x27;t smell it anymore, everyone else can and they all comment on the wonderful fragrance.  While expensive, I needed a travel size.</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite perfume, purchased with one click without the hassle of the mall and the painted old cologne ninjas looking to spray you when you are least expecting it.  I don&#x27;t care if I spend more I get a free umbrella or bath loofa, this is a no fuss no muss way to get the perfume I know I need at a great price.  Is it an old ladies perfume?  Probably, since I know an old lady that wears it.  I know I never would, but then again, I also liked the cologne in CVS that had the guy on the horse in the snow.  Good brand, good scent, so if you know a grand dame, give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is the best scent I have ever worn, it lasts long and smells fresh. Love it and will wear it for years to come!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume more than any other.  It has such a spa clean fragrance. Some now smell like bubble gum or fruit . Why would anyone want to smell like something you eat?  Aromatic elixir is so exhilarating and sexy and wherever I go everyone asks me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.  Buy it and you will love it too. ...that&#x27;s if you like a clean, exhilarating, sexy, and noticed for your good taste in fragrances.</li>
            <li> Aromatic Elixir has been my signature parfum for years-  I love it and people often ask what scent I am wearing.</li>
            <li> I normally buy this perfume from Macy&#x27;s but they didnt have any in stock in the large bottle. I am so mad about this bottle that i piurchased from this website. It is not the same color as the bottles i normally buy, it looks like it is watered down. The scent doesnt even last!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume for years.  Get many compliments</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume -- do not spray more than 2 squirts or it&#x27;ll be overwhelming. It&#x27;ll last forever this bottle. A little goes a long way and anytime I wear this I get a load of compliments.</li>
            <li> This item was purchase as a request from my aunt that lives in Mexico. She loves it and ask for it one a year or so when we go visit her. I have and most likely will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> Actually she loves it. Found out what a lady liked that she was out of, and ordered it. Delivery was prompt, the perfume was one she had used, so was sure it would be liked.</li>
            <li> The perfume is fine but the sprayer was broken on arrival.  This perfume is not inexpensive and having to pour some in my hand to apply it makes it impossible to get a proper application.  I probably will not order it online again. The slight saving in cost over my local store has been eaten away by not being able to evenly spray.</li>
            <li> Others have pointed out that this is an indescribable fragrance, so I won&#x27;t try to describe it except to say that everyone who loves it agrees that it doesn&#x27;t just smell delicious. Many perfumes smell wonderful, but I know of no other that is also absolutely unforgettable and bewilders people by being quite unclassifiable. It is very powerful and long-lasting, and should be used accordingly. I have never worn this fragrance without having at least one person approach and ask me what that mesmerizing scent was, and this is usually followed by \\&quot;it&#x27;s not like anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled\\&quot;. I&#x27;d also add that, like most really divine things (good caviar, great wines) there are people who absolutely hate this scent. You can find them reviewing the product here, although I&#x27;ve never found one in real life. But I take them at their word and so suggest that you sample this at a cosmetics counter first, in case you turn out to be one of them.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing and the lasts all day. Even after showering, the scent still kind of remains. I love perfumes that linger and this one definitely lingers. Great signature scent for a good price. Shipping was very fast too.</li>
            <li> This is my all time fave perfume.  I use it almost everyday. I am constantly stopped by men and women asking what is the fragrance I am wearing. I only buy it twice a year and from the looks of things I will be buying it again from this seller.  The price is right and the shipping was quick. I love wearing it and I will continue to do so as long as this seller keeps selling it at such a great price. I will never go to the mall again to buy it.  I give the seller/shipper 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I almost forgot about this scent. Aromatics Elixir was given to me and some other women by a male co-worker Christmas 1990.  We all swooned over it. This man had bought it for his wife originally, so he thought we&#x27;d all like to have it.  It is the most inexplicable divine scent that lasts, and men like it, too. I was so happy to see it offered on Amazon so I bought it in a smaller size, to start. If if still has the same fragrance and is long-lasting, I will purchase the larger sizes. Clinique, please don&#x27;t discontinue.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase, especially the price..a lot less than in the store.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sent! I was given a small bottle of this from a very good friend and when I ran out went to buy a larger bottle. OMG the price was ridicules. There was No Way I was going to pay 100.00 for this product. Then I found this Lovely Company and they were able to provide me with what I wanted at a reasonable price. I have told friends and now I&#x27;m telling you. Don&#x27;t loose this Company because there is no one out there that can out price them and get you your product promptly. Enjoy!! 😊</li>
            <li> My wife loves Clinique Elixir Parfum Spray for women she sprays it on as many times a possible and she smells so good that is why i continue to purchase Clinique for her and for me too because it makes her smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this perfume with my recent clinique order. Omg it&#x27;s the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever smelled!! It took my breath away, and I had to go wash my wrist off. It smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume that&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for years, fermenting. Seriously awful!!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance &amp; have been using it for years! Each time I try something else I always come back.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the original aromatic elixir clinque perfume???</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my sister in law, it is the same exact spray that you get at Macy&#x27;s, just a tad cheaper.  I am glad I found it, otherwise, It did not fit into my budget.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite fragrance, and I&#x27;ve tried hundreds. Created in 1971, this is a very dry chypre fragrance, heavy on the patchouli and oak moss, but expertly blended with more delicate florals to produce an alluring, aromatherapeutic experience for the wearer and those she encounters! Crisp but not austere,, &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;in a way that suggests refreshing wind blowing through a woodsy forest at night, vintage in feel but timeless and not the least bit stuffy or old-fashioned. Hard to put words to how delightful this is to wear. It&#x27;s relaxing, refreshing, and sensual. Men comment more on this one than anything else I wear.</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrances ever made, so unique!</li>
            <li> I really love this! It doesnt seem to cause smell sensitivity issues and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Ohhhh this is soooo awesome !!!!! very good.......</li>
            <li> A female was coming to the office sometimes wearing this perfume and I liked it very much that I asked her what it was  and bought it for my wife. Wife loves it (wears it rather frequently), I love it ... and life is better!</li>
            <li> This was over $5.00 less expensive than anywhere else I checked.  It is a heavy scent so be sure to use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Great product - my wife has used for decades with no issues.</li>
            <li> Favorite fragrance forever.  Never a disappointment when ordered.  Have used his for many years and plan to continue as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for over 20 years. I had stopped wearing it for a while in early 2000 and then I smelled it on someone and remembered how great it is. I receive frequent compliments and even people who do not like fragrances have like it. It has very good staying power, in fact it can be too strong and one can easily use too much. A bottle last quite a while if used correctly. The scent is soft, warm, not sweet and very different than anything else I have ever smelled. (and I have smelled MANY perfumes as I love scent)</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years and am always asked what I am wearing as it  smells so good.  You only need to use a little and it lasts all day.  I would recommend this product to all women.</li>
            <li> Met every expectation.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This product is much cheaper online than in stores.  My favorite everyday fragrance.  I get many compliments with this fragrance.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great price for a wonderful fragrance!</li>
            <li> Omgoodness just love this perfume. Great to know i don&#x27;t have to go to a mall to get it :)</li>
            <li> this perfume was old less in macys. you are able to also get a gift set in store. i will not order online for perfume again</li>
            <li> This is the scent for you if you are an old women who wants to be avoided at any cost.  It has gotten so bad that the scent arrives first and then the old lady appears.  It is so offensive that it almost drives me to violence ... and it is so wrong to do this to old women.  Old women around the world stand up and revolt!  Change your perfume!  PS - I am a heterosexual male who would never date a smoker or a woman who wore Clinique Aromatics Elixir.  Both are just about the same game-stopper.</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume i love it 💖</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I get lots of compliments on it. It smells soap and water clean and lasts all day. I would recommend it to every woman.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a very long time....one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. I have bought this in the past in large chain stores...this was delivered right to my door and the fragrance was as fresh as ever!</li>
            <li> My signature fragrance!</li>
            <li> THIS is a beautiful Fragrace - I am very Careful about Cologne/perfumes - Can&#x27;t stand the ones that are SWEET - like Red Door - they make me sick - this is very WARM _ NICE - and I have used this for YEARS - and will for as long as Clinque Continues to sell</li>
            <li> I have used Aromatics for years and absolutely love it.  When people stop you on the street and ask you what it is that you&#x27;re wearing, you know it&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and with the timely manner that I received my product.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years.  Always have a positive feedback when wearing it.  It&#x27;s such a fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li> Love it, ... It&#x27;s long lasting &amp; people are always asking what is that you&#x27;re wearing? This fragrance is unique and there&#x27;s nothing else comparable.</li>
            <li> TOPS ON CHRISTMAS LIST. MY  WIFE LOVES IT.</li>
            <li> I only use name brand perfumes and colognes.I have been using aromatics for years now.it is excellent!.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s best parfum.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even think this was real perfume? Smell-les.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No I would not recommend this product. By it in a store!~</li>
            <li> I turn heads when I wear this perfume! I get so many compliments for Men and Women. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the perfume bottle! A fragrance this good and I like the fact that it&#x27;s strong needs a beautiful bottle! I collect rare beautiful perfume bottles, I would love it more if the bottle was as beautiful as the perfume!</li>
            <li> I love the perfume and wear it all the time.  But this bottle I bought from this vendor was the first time I&#x27;ve had the spray function  fail me when it was only one fourth used.  Won&#x27;t buy it online anymore.</li>
            <li> This new formula is so INFERIOR in comparison to the original. Will never purchase again. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s much Cheaper to make, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s changed. The original stopped people in their tracks. There will never be another fragrance as the original, it was beautiful. The nose for the original, forgot his exact name, Chant?, why did you  sell  out.</li>
            <li> Arrived in excellent condition</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  Used to have to make a semi-annual trek to the mall for it.  Much more convenient simply hitting one-click for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a unique fragrance I&#x27;ve been wearing for years. I&#x27;m asked all of time what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. It is very subtle and apparently not overpowering at all. I even have men come up and ask what I&#x27;m wearing! They ask me to write down the name of it as they want to buy it for their wife or girlfriend!</li>
            <li> love watching the expression on people&#x27;s when i walk buy and they catch the scent !</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase. I love the perfume. And it arrived so quickly!!! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s friend always wears this perfume, and when I was younger and she visited, my siblings and I pulled straws to see whose room she had to stay in because the scent was so horrible and lingered for weeks. One year, my mom&#x27;s friend flew into town to surprise my mom. My dad picked up this friend from the airport, then went to pick up my mom from work. As soon as my mom got in the car, she said, \\&quot;It smells like [so and so] in here.\\&quot; Haha! It really, honestly is the most offensive scent I&#x27;ve smelled. I would choose the smell of dog doodoo over this perfume--really. I recently married, and the first thing my husband said after meeting my mom&#x27;s friend was how bad she smelled. It smells like...expired, rancid, poisonous skunk juice. Every now and then, I smell it on someone in a public place. Yikes. Please. PLEASE. Please stop wearing this scent, ladies! There&#x27;s a reason why it made TotalBeauty&#x27;s worst perfumes of all time list!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my mother this Christmas. She loves it. It is a beautiful scent; many people ask her what she is wearing and comment on how nice it smells. This bottle will last her about 2 or 3 years, then I&#x27;ll get her another. It&#x27;s a tradition, I guess.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing the Clinique Aromatic Elixir Parfum for the past 20 years &amp; it is the only perfume I wear.  It last me a very long time &amp; still keeps its clean scent.  I do not go for floral nor musk scents.  This can only be described as a clean scent &amp; I have got compliments from others for many years.  It is quite a bit pricey...well very pricey for me but the fact I do not have to buy it often it is worth the price not to smell cheap.  It is one of only a few things in life I indulge in for myself.  It&#x27;s my splurge.</li>
            <li> The box and bottle came early with no damage.  My mother loves this scent.  For the money it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Clinique Elixir for many years and loved the scent. This perfume is not the original scent. I tried to return it and was told that it is not returnable. I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have worn this parfum since I had my first daugther. Always, people ask me what fragance I&#x27;m wearing. I love my Aromatic Elixir because I can wear it day and night and everybody notice the rich parfum. It&#x27;s definitely my signature!</li>
            <li> Used for years, I love it!</li>
            <li> My wife likes that perfume for many years&lt;br /&gt;it is clean, fresh and with excellent odor&lt;br /&gt;all of their products are high quality and last long</li>
            <li> I love the perfume. It is everything I expected from this company. Thank you for helping me locate it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I made plenty of points with this Christmas Gift</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend who couldn&#x27;t get find this perfume at such a good price as this. She&#x27;s very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many, many people tell me they like the scent that I&#x27;m wearing when I use Aromatic Elixir, it lasts all day and it is the only scent I use.</li>
            <li> Gave this perfume as a gift for Christmas and it was very well received. Fragrance was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Very good as usual: my sister was very pleased with her gift</li>
            <li> I have reviewed this previously and my opinion has not and will never change. I LOVE THIS --I have used it every day for 31 years and&lt;br /&gt;will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used it exclusively for years. The scent remains, rather than morphing into some odd smell or dissipating altogether. Many compliments on it over the years.</li>
            <li> I love Aromatis Elixir.  Go easy with it and it smells great all day long. I have been wearing this scent for years and have never been disappointed with it.,</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PARFUME!!! My mom wore this when I was a kid and I was always impressed by the uniqueness of the fragrance. Also by its lasting power. I have had many many people, including men, ask me what I was wearing.  But 1 CAVEAT...you CANNOT DROWN yourself in it like a standard parfume or you will leave a trail of dead people in your wake. My adcice is to spray it overhead and walk into it. If thats not enough, do it again. Just be VERY SPARING and you will love it too. The complaints I&#x27;ve read had to do with exactly this drawback. Use it correctly and you to will be enamored.</li>
            <li> Great Parfum  Got it for Mom she just loves it!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try something new. I&#x27;m new to the chypre frangrances, but I should have known that I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy this because they listed &amp;#34;patchouli&amp;#34; as one of the ingredients. The patchouli takes OVER. Maybe one day I may try it again, but it was just too strong,too cold, and too patchouli&#x27;ish. My fiance doesn&#x27;t like it. Oh well. I tried.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance... Have used for about 40 years. Always receive very nice&lt;br /&gt;Compliments.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and it came fairly fast.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were at Evergreen Garden Shop being waited on my one of the yardmen.  Very awkwardly he asked my husband, &amp;#34;Sir, may I ask your wife what perfume she has on I want to get my girlfriend some.&amp;#34; This is my 12 year for this signature fragrance so this question is very common.  It happens in elevators, in line at the grocery store, waiting to see a patient.  This is a fragrance you can spray into the air and walk into if you are going to a dinner party.  For the &#x27;all day&#x27; smell, spray your hair and skin; you cannot smell it yourself but it lingers.  My head/ hair laid on a pillow at our daughter&#x27;s home in Charleston.  They were still in FL. They came back the following night, my son-in-law laid on his pillow and the next day said, &amp;#34;I could tell your mom was here; there is just that mysterious fragrance that follows her.....&amp;#34; It&#x27;s a keeper!!!</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Aromatics Elixir-it is one Super Scent!</li>
            <li> Smelling Good!  There is a clean, fresh, smell about it.</li>
            <li> This smells like pine air freshener to me. I t might make a bad men&#x27;s cologne but other than than- garbage!</li>
            <li> jUST LOVE THE LIGHT FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li> i recieved it in a very short time but it is not fresh and i do not have the energy to send it back. I will just pay full price at the department store next time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price and in packed a box.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad that the gift wrap option was not available - it would have won another star!</li>
            <li> People&#x27;s answer me what are you wearing even the Dr come out his office because he love it the small I was setting down in the waiting room ever wear the same thing I would say get one it is worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for a few years and 2 sprays last all day, the price is right, free shipping, and I don&#x27;t have to go to the mall.</li>
            <li> Arrived much more quickly than I expected! I bought this as a gift so when I smelt the perfume it was very strong for my taste, but the person I gave it to was in love!</li>
            <li> Very strong, doesn&#x27;t take much but I love the smell. It&#x27;s has a woodsy, spicy scent.</li>
            <li> A very classy perfume.  My wife always  has it at the dressing table.  I like the perfume as well.  handy size. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I went to purchase a scent today, actually I went to buy Sensuous by Estee Lauder and It wasn&#x27;t quite doing anything for me -- although it is nice, it just wasn&#x27;t dynamic.  Elixer is almost religious and I love this scent.  My husband commented immediately when I got home.  This is heavy in the beginning but immediately softens.  Please wait a few minutes once you try this.  Elixer is classified a a chypre,  If you like a chypre scent. This is lovely.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years and get numerous compliments and inquiry as to what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> gave to mother.she said it smelled nothing like her previous bottle. amazon made good though!!</li>
            <li> I her compliments All the time, &amp; because the fragrance is from bk in the day.....people don t know what it is, I love that added bonus! This fragrance stays all day long</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend and she just loved it.. It is her favorite. It arrived on time and my girlfriend was over joyed when she saw it sitting at her front door..</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T CARE FOR THE SCENT</li>
            <li> This has long been a favorite perfume of mine,  and it is very costly at the mall, as it is real perfume. Not only was the price good, but it arrived in a timely fashion. I will definitely order through here again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this purchase because the perfume didn&#x27;t smell the same as the one purchased at Dillards and it was a gift for my mom and she bought it to my attention and she was right.  I will probably never purchase cologne again</li>
            <li> Hints of patchouli. I bought this because I loved the scent on someone else. This is a heavenly scent. Lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I always buy this perfume as a gift. She loves it, all her friends love it; men love it, all their friends love it.</li>
            <li> Good.  Fast ship.  Ty</li>
            <li> i wear since 1985 evrywhere i got compliment love it the best ever if  i like  it paid for also my friends wear too</li>
