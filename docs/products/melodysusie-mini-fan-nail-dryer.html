            <li>This is a nice nail dryer for the bucks.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to take to sleepovers, friends houses, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nail dryer takes two batteries (not included, but very easy to install on the underside).  </li>
            <li>but I got this one, which works ok</li>
            <li>It is battery operated, super light weight and the fingers activate the fan!!  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for my friend and she really liked it, she said that it is very easy to use, and even though the fan could be more powerful, the overall end result is great.</li>
            <li>On top of being compact and stylish, it dries the nails very fast, is super handy and a very easy to use at home.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re careful though, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>and I get to enjoy doing my nails again :)</li>
            <li>Extremely portable, and a wonderful thing to take along when I am doing nails!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and my grandaughter liked it very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li>For the short time it functioned, it worked great.</li>
            <li>You can fit four fingers in it at once, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a UV light dryer</li>
            <li>Light weight.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about it.</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and was so excited.</li>
            <li>This was purchased for my nail polish loving 10 year old.</li>
            <li>My kid thinks it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>My daughters love the nail dryer so much I had to buy another.</li>
            <li>For this price it is good, but I was expecting something a little better.</li>
            <li>so I got it so quick.</li>
            <li>As soon as I pushed the button it quick.</li>
            <li>They have been to many sleepovers where the girls do their nails and have a nail dryer, so it is many years overdue that we finally got one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a great little nail dryer for her.</li>
            <li>After about three uses worth, it died without warning.</li>
            <li>I would have returned, but the postage, packing and time would not have been worth it.</li>
            <li>You know, a tiny handy nail dryer.</li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have a full review on my YouTube channel next week :)</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve been able to have smear free nails for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li>It is slightly more convenient and effective than holding your wet nails in front of a regular desk fan.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick, works, the fan is a bit loud</li>
            <li>Two of these may be more convienent so you can dry both hands at once.</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS.SHE</li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for an honest review, and I will be purchasing at least another one or more so that my kids can use them at the same time or with friends.  </li>
            <li>Was very pleased.with</li>
            <li>It was a replacement to a similar item that finally dies after many years.</li>
            <li>I thought it wouldn&#x27;t blow out enough air at first, but it blow very well!</li>
            <li>Decent quality and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>If you paint a LOT then you  might want to invest a little more.</li>
            <li>THE NAILS.SHE FEELS LIKE A REAL PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute; however, the batteries does not last long</li>
            <li>Not very powerful, but probably shouldn&#x27;t expect it to be very powerful for the price.</li>
            <li>However, the pressure release was to hard to push to make it an effective tool for young girls</li>
            <li>MelodySusie Nail Dryer is small and lightweight, so it is easy to use but also very portable.  </li>
            <li>In theory this was a fun item for young girls to dry their nails.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for those little impatient little girls.</li>
            <li>Could stick my hand in front of my fan and it would dry at the same speed...not worth the price at all!</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to someone and buying a professional nail dryer from thermal spa.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always busy with my 2 jobs, so I never had the time to paint my nails.</li>
            <li>To be concise: you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Dedicate and dry nails quick enough, does the job well.</li>
            <li>Can hold in one hand with 4 fingers in and thumb underneath to hold it and not mess up the polish.  </li>
            <li>To remedy this, I thought I&#x27;d buy her a cute little nail dryer to cut down on some time.</li>
            <li>and we really like that it has jut a simple fan to dry the nails, no UV lamps.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basicly a small fan but drys nails quick because it encloses over your hand.</li>
            <li>I expected this to blow out hot air, it didn&#x27;t seem to even dry my nails.</li>
            <li>Fan noise is loud but it does dry your nails.</li>
            <li>I really like this little dryer.</li>
            <li>My mother loves to paint her nails, but is a very busy woman and often doesn&#x27;t have time to paint them, let alone give them time to dry completely so as not to get smudged.</li>

            <li> I really like this little dryer.</li>
            <li> My mother loves to paint her nails, but is a very busy woman and often doesn&#x27;t have time to paint them, let alone give them time to dry completely so as not to get smudged.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but thought it would last a little longer.</li>
            <li> The kids had no trouble using the nail dryer - you simply activate the fan by putting your fingertips inside and pushing down on the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like enough air comes out to dry your nails properly.</li>
            <li> It is strange that the company would sell this thing without the necessary power cord.</li>
            <li> I prefer to wait for my nails to &#x27;air dry&#x27; than listen to white noise.</li>
            <li> First, it has a small opening so can&#x27;t put my small hand in completely.  </li>
            <li> but I waited too long before I tried it.</li>
            <li> It dries my nails, but it takes too long.  </li>
            <li> the kids did their nails and didn&#x27;t have to wait too long for them to dry.  </li>
            <li> This is really just a very small fan.</li>
            <li> and I wish I had gotten one long ago!</li>
            <li> (I still had to wait around 1+ hours though before they were fully dry.</li>
            <li> does not work and there was no heat to dry my nail.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes to use it to dry her nails.</li>
            <li> Does it dry nails faster?</li>
            <li> I just needed something to help my nails dry a bit faster.</li>
            <li> and it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t dry my nails even if I keep for 10 mins</li>
            <li> I think I can dry my fingers and toes 7-10 times before the battery dies.</li>
            <li> Her only complaint is that it is noisier than her old one.</li>
            <li> Also, for as small as it is, it is fairly loud.</li>
            <li> A mom of two can&#x27;t hang out with wet nails for too long.</li>
            <li> SHE GOES ALL OUT,WHEN A GLASS OF WATER AS YOU SIT BACK AND ALLOW YOUR NAILS TO DRY.YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR HAND DOWN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DRYER AND THE AIR BLOWS</li>
            <li> Not much faster.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Doing nails with younger kids can be very frustrating because they tend not to sit still very well and are impatient to add a second coat or run off and play.  </li>
            <li> you almost had to hold down the pressure plate with one hand while trying to dry the other hands nails.  </li>
            <li> not powerful, not worth it, its just a tiny little fan</li>
            <li> This product is small and takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> The only problem is because it is so small</li>
            <li> I am going to keep it because of the hassle of returning and it did help dry my nails a little bit</li>
            <li> Wish the air was a little warmer to dry nails faster.</li>
            <li> Can not fit thumb into it, so have to dry thumbs separately.</li>
            <li> It is not powerful at all and is battery operated.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the fan seems a little weak - but it is not a professional dryer -</li>
            <li> You have to press it down while drying.  </li>
            <li> Take your hand and place it in the drying area, press down, and allow the fan to work its &amp;#34;magic.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These wascute and inexpensive little gifts for for the girls who came over for our daughters birthday party.</li>
            <li> I have two little girls, and for years my kids have been begging for a nail dryer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I painted my nails and when I stuck them under the dryer, it smeared my polish in ripples across my nail completely ruining them!</li>
            <li> And third, it does not blow very hard.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a school for autistic kids...</li>
            <li> At a reasonable price two dryers isn&#x27;t a bad idea.</li>
            <li> I ordered as a gift to my small cousin.</li>
            <li> It is small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why put they over nighted this</li>
            <li> Small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
            <li> It really sucks that it does not come with an AC Adapter.</li>
            <li> duh ..</li>
            <li> The product is very small.</li>
            <li> They need to make a serious design change to improve this feature.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this fan stopped working after 2 uses, not sure why.</li>
            <li> not happy</li>
            <li> However it was not a great decision.</li>
            <li> but it was broken and</li>
            <li> plus u need to buy batteries and not strong at all :(</li>
            <li> Not impressed with product.</li>
            <li> Some people might like to use it and also dip their nails in cold water because she says that helps them set and then use the dryer.</li>
            <li> She doesnt realise how bad it is, and just uses it as a pretend nail salon item.</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> I let it sick for a while and still.. nothing.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this nail dryer.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed it never worked and had to keep it because I threw the box away</li>

            <li> bought for a gift and they loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I expected this to blow out hot air, it didn&#x27;t seem to even dry my nails. I ordered as a gift to my small cousin. She doesnt realise how bad it is, and just uses it as a pretend nail salon item. So I guess it works for her.</li>
            <li> I really like this little dryer. The only problem is because it is so small, I hit my nails on it sometimes. If you&#x27;re careful though, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> For the short time it functioned, it worked great. After about three uses worth, it died without warning. Replaced batteries, tried a cord in electric option. Didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but thought it would last a little longer. I would have returned, but the postage, packing and time would not have been worth it.</li>
            <li> This is really just a very small fan. For this price it is good, but I was expecting something a little better. I am going to keep it because of the hassle of returning and it did help dry my nails a little bit (I still had to wait around 1+ hours though before they were fully dry. Also it did not come with an AC adapter or batteries.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my nail polish loving 10 year old. It is a great little nail dryer for her. I don&#x27;t think it compares to a nail salon dryer, but it is perfect for what she uses it for. When she does my nails, this does the job on my own nails.</li>
            <li> It is small. You can fit four fingers in it at once, but that&#x27;s it. It does work surprisingly well though. And the batteries last forever in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this but my wife does routinely and she likes it. It was a replacement to a similar item that finally dies after many years. Her only complaint is that it is noisier than her old one.</li>
            <li> This is a nice nail dryer for the bucks. My only issue is that the fan seems a little weak - but it is not a professional dryer - so no biggie. It does the job and it is portable. I like it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this fan stopped working after 2 uses, not sure why. Bad quality.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with product. Could stick my hand in front of my fan and it would dry at the same speed...not worth the price at all!</li>
            <li> It is strange that the company would sell this thing without the necessary power cord. Where would i buy one?</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this nail dryer.  First, it has a small opening so can&#x27;t put my small hand in completely.  Have to put four fingers I. And then put thumb in separately.  Second, you can&#x27;t just turn it on.  You have to press it down while drying.  And third, it does not blow very hard.</li>
            <li> These wascute and inexpensive little gifts for for the girls who came over for our daughters birthday party. Despite the afforable price, the dryer is made of good quality materials which is a must for teenagers. On top of being compact and stylish, it dries the nails very fast, is super handy and a very easy to use at home.</li>
            <li> does not work and there was no heat to dry my nail. I should have returned it but I waited too long before I tried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why put they over nighted this so I got it so quick. Basically this product is what it is</li>
            <li> Not very powerful, but probably shouldn&#x27;t expect it to be very powerful for the price. My daughter likes to use it to dry her nails.</li>
            <li> Small. Portable. Not quiet. No surprise there. It&#x27;s a fan. Does it dry nails faster? Not much faster.  My opinion? Price was right. My kid thinks it&#x27;s cool. I prefer to wait for my nails to &#x27;air dry&#x27; than listen to white noise.</li>
            <li> In theory this was a fun item for young girls to dry their nails.  However, the pressure release was to hard to push to make it an effective tool for young girls you almost had to hold down the pressure plate with one hand while trying to dry the other hands nails.  They need to make a serious design change to improve this feature.</li>
            <li> I just needed something to help my nails dry a bit faster. A mom of two can&#x27;t hang out with wet nails for too long. Shipped quick, works, the fan is a bit loud but well, it&#x27;s a fan so what do you expect? It does it&#x27;s job and i&#x27;ve been able to have smear free nails for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute; however, the batteries does not last long and it takes forever to dry. It really sucks that it does not come with an AC Adapter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money! It won&#x27;t dry my nails even if I keep for 10 mins</li>
            <li> I love this nail dryer! I thought it wouldn&#x27;t blow out enough air at first, but it blow very well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, nothing special. Doesn&#x27;t feel like enough air comes out to dry your nails properly. Plus it eats batteries for breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> My daughters love the nail dryer so much I had to buy another.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my friend and she really liked it, she said that it is very easy to use, and even though the fan could be more powerful, the overall end result is great. Some people might like to use it and also dip their nails in cold water because she says that helps them set and then use the dryer.</li>
            <li> The product is very small. Can not fit thumb into it, so have to dry thumbs separately. It is not powerful at all and is battery operated. It is slightly more convenient and effective than holding your wet nails in front of a regular desk fan. Also, for as small as it is, it is fairly loud. Upside, is there is no cord, so you can walk around holding it.</li>
            <li> This works great and we really like that it has jut a simple fan to dry the nails, no UV lamps.  Very satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li> MY GRANDDAUGHTER USES THIS WHEN SHE PLAYS NAIL SPA....IT REALLY WORKS.SHE USES THE NAIL SOAK BOWEL AND THEN SHE WILL PLACE YOUR HAND IN THE NAIL DRYER. SHE GOES ALL OUT,WHEN A GLASS OF WATER AS YOU SIT BACK AND ALLOW YOUR NAILS TO DRY.YOU HAVE TO HOLD YOUR HAND DOWN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DRYER AND THE AIR BLOWS ON THE NAILS.SHE FEELS LIKE A REAL PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li> not powerful, not worth it, its just a tiny little fan and it doesn&#x27;t recharge. not happy and now I can not return the product because the &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; of return time has expired.</li>
            <li> Just gave it to my granddaughter for a gift she has not opened it yet however it seems very nice and priced very well!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product because it was a good price and some of the reviews were good. However it was not a great decision. This product is small and takes a long time to dry. This product is good if you don&#x27;t paint your nails often. I ended up giving it to someone and buying a professional nail dryer from thermal spa.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about it. You know, a tiny handy nail dryer. When I got it I opened up the box and put batteries in it and went to work on my nails. As soon as I pushed the button it quick. I let it sick for a while and still.. nothing. Don&#x27;t but it.</li>
            <li> Fan noise is loud but it does dry your nails.</li>
            <li> I have two little girls, and for years my kids have been begging for a nail dryer.  They have been to many sleepovers where the girls do their nails and have a nail dryer, so it is many years overdue that we finally got one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This MelodySusie Nail Dryer is small and lightweight, so it is easy to use but also very portable.  This is very easy to take to sleepovers, friends houses, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nail dryer takes two batteries (not included, but very easy to install on the underside).  The kids had no trouble using the nail dryer - you simply activate the fan by putting your fingertips inside and pushing down on the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing nails with younger kids can be very frustrating because they tend not to sit still very well and are impatient to add a second coat or run off and play.  This nail dryer has been a really great tool to have on hand, for both the kids and myself (I use it too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and I will be purchasing at least another one or more so that my kids can use them at the same time or with friends.  Great product and I wish I had gotten one long ago!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! It&#x27;s just a life saver! I&#x27;m always busy with my 2 jobs, so I never had the time to paint my nails. I&#x27;d just go to the nail salon to get them done! But now that I have time device I&#x27;m saving myself money and I get to enjoy doing my nails again :) I&#x27;ll have a full review on my YouTube channel next week :) YouTube: LifeAsAmy1</li>
            <li> Decent quality and gets the job done. It&#x27;s basicly a small fan but drys nails quick because it encloses over your hand. Two of these may be more convienent so you can dry both hands at once. At a reasonable price two dryers isn&#x27;t a bad idea.</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a school for autistic kids...the kids did their nails and didn&#x27;t have to wait too long for them to dry.  Nice.</li>
            <li> I think I can dry my fingers and toes 7-10 times before the battery dies. For something to keep around the house if you don&#x27;t paint that often, I would recommend it. If you paint a LOT then you  might want to invest a little more. Or keep batteries around!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and was so excited. Unfortunately, I painted my nails and when I stuck them under the dryer, it smeared my polish in ripples across my nail completely ruining them! My son uses it as a toy now...</li>
            <li> It dries my nails, but it takes too long.  I would have preferred a UV light dryer but I got this one, which works ok</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it never worked and had to keep it because I threw the box away but it was broken and it wasn&#x27;t the batteries so never worked from when I received so I never got to use it!</li>
            <li> Dedicate and dry nails quick enough, does the job well.</li>
            <li> Great product! Definatley a go to for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom as a birthday gift. My mother loves to paint her nails, but is a very busy woman and often doesn&#x27;t have time to paint them, let alone give them time to dry completely so as not to get smudged. To remedy this, I thought I&#x27;d buy her a cute little nail dryer to cut down on some time. Now, I didn&#x27;t have the highest expectation for this, as it was fairly cheap and not of the best quality. To be concise: you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s not the fastest or the does the best job, but it works well for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works: Take your hand and place it in the drying area, press down, and allow the fan to work its &amp;#34;magic.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i thought was bigger ! i think is a kid size ....duh ..plus u need to buy batteries and not strong at all :(</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those little impatient little girls.</li>
            <li> this was a very nice dryer for the price.  Was very pleased.with this one and my grandaughter liked it very much.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Can hold in one hand with 4 fingers in and thumb underneath to hold it and not mess up the polish.  Then switch with thumb in and fingers in.  Light weight.  Wish the air was a little warmer to dry nails faster.</li>
            <li> It is battery operated, super light weight and the fingers activate the fan!!  Extremely portable, and a wonderful thing to take along when I am doing nails!!</li>
