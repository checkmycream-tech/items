            <li>Good quality lambswool; just wish there were more of it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to do business with all of your team.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, and it arrived quickly!  </li>
            <li>I like the kind from my dance supplier better but</li>
            <li>but it is very light weight.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Top quality.</li>
            <li>Makes my toes feel better when I need it.</li>
            <li>The product has worked perfectly for me to keep the proper spacing as well as reduce the rubbing that causes sores &amp; lots of pain.  </li>
            <li>Still, my toe needed something more.  </li>
            <li>I have bought Premier lambs wool before, and the quality was much better.  </li>
            <li>But won&#x27;t be able to use it on my 500 miles Pilgrimage (would have to buy a lot of this product)</li>
            <li>, this is more of once a week hiking product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>I wish there was more in the package...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>So glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>My concers were alleviated.</li>
            <li>If you have a pair of shoes that are a tad too big, stuff the toes with lambs wool for a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>But worth the money for sure, considering the price you pay for the shoes, even the cheapest ones!</li>
            <li>The lambs wool made it very comfortable and secure.</li>
            <li>but I needed to add one more thing to get free shipping at the time so this worked...</li>
            <li>I do a great deal of walking and the wool protects the sensitive parts of my feet.  </li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>This size package worked great for one pair of heels and my feet have thanked me numerous times!</li>
            <li>Great product, but tiny packaging.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>Now, they no longer carry this very useful  item.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cleanly manufactured.  </li>
            <li>This one is really soft, easy to pull them part, very comfortable in the shoes (used about 2/3 in one pair).</li>
            <li>Other than that its great to use</li>
            <li>The package has enough for many more uses.</li>
            <li>Service was fast, accurate and on time.  </li>
            <li>3/8 oz doesn&#x27;t sound like much</li>
            <li>said it was just the right product.</li>
            <li>It is so very soft and does a fine job of separating toes.</li>
            <li>These packages of clean and combed white Lamb&#x27;s wool can be hard to find, I was glad to find it for a fair price.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I had not been able to find it in local stores for years.</li>
            <li>I am using double socks, and have super GO WALK Sketchers, which are light and cushioning -- walking on marshmallows comes to mind.  </li>
            <li>It is a very small amount of the stuff though; there&#x27;s places that sell more for a more palatable price.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>I went through months of rehab and healing, but real shoes hurt my foot.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Works very well for that.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Fast ship and what I needed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, soft lambs wool, not much to say.</li>
            <li>I truly believe that there is a medicinal aid in the lambs wool, but beside that, it cushions your toe from abrasion, pressure and injury by insusting it with soft, gentle, real wool!</li>
            <li>One thing I don&#x27;t know yet is how long it&#x27;ll keep feeling comfortable when stuffed in a shoe.</li>
            <li>The previous lambswool was also much better quality --- much denser and more likely to last well when subjected to pressure.</li>
            <li>So while little ballerinas will love this, it does have other, more practical, uses.  </li>
            <li>Great option for shoes that are too big for you or have hard toes.  </li>
            <li>I use this in the toe box of my hiking boots to prevent my toes from banging around, particularly downhill hiking.</li>
            <li>I heard a tip to use lamb&#x27;s wool inside the toe area of high heels for comfort.  </li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Used to soften those high rub areas old feet experience in new shoes.  </li>
            <li>This is available cheaper from some stores near me, but I have been homebound due to a bunion surgery.  </li>
            <li>never felt anything so soft!</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this on-line as it is not available in the stores--at least I didn&#x27;t find any there.  </li>
            <li>wow, I like it.</li>
            <li>I think my feet are just getting old</li>
            <li>The picture seems larger than what it really is.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look like they were finished packaging it, it was only so much in there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft.  </li>
            <li>The bunion on my right foot is pushing big piggy toe over to this little piggy stayed home.  </li>
            <li>The price is higher, but the shipping cost is MUCH lower, so your total amount will be less using this other vendor.</li>

            <li> The price is higher, but the shipping cost is MUCH lower, so your total amount will be less using this other vendor.</li>
            <li> Using it to ease fit of shoes which were a little small.  </li>
            <li> Lambs wool is a soft little miracle.</li>
            <li> :  Don&#x27;t buy from THIS vendor -- their shipping cost for this item is at least as much as the item -- even if ordering a dozen.  </li>
            <li> Though long healed now, I noticed some of the scar tissue hurts when I do my walks.  </li>
            <li> The stuff lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Just wrap some around the toes and keep them dry while the problem resolves.</li>
            <li> For some reason, it&#x27;s difficult to get plain lambswool instead of a fancy bandage, so I bought ths and am pleased.</li>
            <li> Used this to put in the toe box of a pair of shoes that were a little too big.  </li>
            <li> Not much at all for $6.</li>
            <li> The lambswool in this package weighed 25% less than previously (from .4 of an ounce to .3 of an ounce) and it is not remotely equal to the weight that is given on the package, which would be roughly .37 of an ounce.  </li>
            <li> I had to get this due to suffering from severe corns.  </li>
            <li> Saved a few pairs of shoes of mine which are either too big or too small (bought online, of course).</li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> And if I&#x27;m real careful I can get 2-3 days out of one dsg.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; or pack down.</li>
            <li> Also the weight has gone way down.  </li>
            <li> maybe if it were knocked down a buck.</li>
            <li> Yes the bag is small but half empty.</li>
            <li> I have been afraid to try the toe warmers that can get too hot for fear of worsening my condition.  </li>
            <li> I use this to provide padding between my little toe and the one adjacent, and to wick moisture away.  </li>
            <li> I just pull off a little length of it and wrap it around the toe once or twice (depending on the length of the strip).  </li>
            <li> I wrap about three inches around the toe, covering the corn, it looks like a little turban, pull on the hose or socks</li>
            <li> I use a little in my heeled booties.  </li>
            <li> Thus, rubbing the most painful corn on that poor little stay at home piggy.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble finding lamb&#x27;s wool in stores.</li>
            <li> It does the trick of padding my toes from rubbing against shoes that are too round for my foot.</li>
            <li> The color cartridge did not fit my printer.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my feet and lambs wool</li>
            <li> Although I knew how small of a bag it would come in, being that it says 3/8 OZ, I assumed that they would fill the bag to the capacity.</li>
            <li> Do you know how damn hard it is to find lambs wool.  </li>
            <li> I had been in pain to the point of consider surgery, but using a little lamb&#x27;s wool between the toes has made that unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product, but it is a little thin for my purpose, which was putting in the front of my hiking boots to cushion my toes on the downhill.</li>
            <li> If your shoe is rubbing you the wrong way, just put a little piece of lambs wool in the shoe where it&#x27;s hurting you and voila!</li>
            <li> He walks, but his feet turn inward, which is very hard on his outer toes.  </li>
            <li> For sore toes, cracked or broken skin on feet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect and you have to figure out how it will work with your choice of socks/stockings &amp; footwear.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical that it would cushion my toe and not bother my walking.</li>
            <li> and I went crazy all over town - Amazon</li>
            <li> This survey word requirement is annoying</li>
            <li> They are awful and have the worst customer service.</li>

            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and as promised. Would order again.</li>
            <li> Excellent price.  Top quality. Fast service. Used to soften those high rub areas old feet experience in new shoes.  Reuseable.</li>
            <li> I use this in the toe box of my hiking boots to prevent my toes from banging around, particularly downhill hiking. Also great in pointe shoes. Prevents lots of toenail issues and foot pain.</li>
            <li> I ordered a $30 item from this company and they sent me $3 ear plugs, not what I ordered and then told me it was USPS&#x27;s fault and will not refund my money. DO NOT ORDER from this company. They are awful and have the worst customer service.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding lamb&#x27;s wool in stores. (I use it help cushion my arthritic feet.)  Ordering it on line has worked well.  Good quality, and it arrived quickly!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in any store and I went crazy all over town - Amazon was my answer - I should have started with Amazon to begin by search.    I&#x27;ve learned my lesson - Amazon all the way!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my toes feel better when I need it.</li>
            <li> This is available cheaper from some stores near me, but I have been homebound due to a bunion surgery.  The product has worked perfectly for me to keep the proper spacing as well as reduce the rubbing that causes sores &amp; lots of pain.  It&#x27;s not perfect and you have to figure out how it will work with your choice of socks/stockings &amp; footwear.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product, but it is a little thin for my purpose, which was putting in the front of my hiking boots to cushion my toes on the downhill.</li>
            <li> I burned the bottom of my foot in the house fire.  Though long healed now, I noticed some of the scar tissue hurts when I do my walks.  I tend to do 4-7 miles almost daily, so this was a problem.  I am using double socks, and have super GO WALK Sketchers, which are light and cushioning -- walking on marshmallows comes to mind.  Still, my toe needed something more.  I thought back on my ballet days, when we used lambs wool to cushion and protect our toes in Pointe Shoes.  Bingo.  I just make a &amp;#34;nest&amp;#34; for my toe and problem solved.  So while little ballerinas will love this, it does have other, more practical, uses.  It doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; or pack down. Perfect!</li>
            <li> For years I purchased lamb&#x27;s wool in my local drugstores.  Now, they no longer carry this very useful  item.  I was delighted to see that I could buy it through Amazon.com and we will be repeat customers for some time to come.</li>
            <li> Its just as I remember it -when I used to put it in my toe shoes----Now I used it for my sore foot and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this for her point shoes &amp; it is the best stuff around.  I would recommend for all ballerinas!  Use with the gel toe inserts &amp; Have ease with ballet!</li>
            <li> I had to get this due to suffering from severe corns.  The lambs wool helped wick away moisture and cushioned my toes enough that I could function as I worked my warehouse job.  I will buy this again in the future!  This was also a great bargain!</li>
            <li> I have bought Premier lambs wool before, and the quality was much better.  Also the weight has gone way down.  The lambswool in this package weighed 25% less than previously (from .4 of an ounce to .3 of an ounce) and it is not remotely equal to the weight that is given on the package, which would be roughly .37 of an ounce.  The previous lambswool was also much better quality --- much denser and more likely to last well when subjected to pressure.</li>
            <li> It used to be you could find this in any shoe store.  Now, if you ask for it the clerks have no idea what you are even talking about.  Thank goodness for AMAZON.  The only people who will read this are like minds who use this product.  We know it works and this brand is a quality product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had surgery on my feet in May.  I went through months of rehab and healing, but real shoes hurt my foot.  I needed some lambs wool to ease the pain.  Amazon had what I could not find at the drug store - wonderful lambs wool!!  Thanks</li>
            <li> Different but it works!  But won&#x27;t be able to use it on my 500 miles Pilgrimage (would have to buy a lot of this product), this is more of once a week hiking product...</li>
            <li> Lambs wool is a soft little miracle. If your shoe is rubbing you the wrong way, just put a little piece of lambs wool in the shoe where it&#x27;s hurting you and voila! It quits hurting. If you have a pair of shoes that are a tad too big, stuff the toes with lambs wool for a perfect fit. I&#x27;m a ballroom dancer and always carry this in my shoe bag.</li>
            <li> wow, I like it. This one is really soft, easy to pull them part, very comfortable in the shoes (used about 2/3 in one pair). I&#x27;ll be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> For sore toes, cracked or broken skin on feet.  Pad your shoes, wind around your toes, place against your heel.  Wherever you place the lambs wool - your skin will be soothed.  I pad my foot, put on a sock, and can walk for hours without any discomfort.  A wonderful product.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I was expecting.  I use it to add comfort to shoes.  The product was in excellent condition when it was received, and received in a timely manner.  I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I wish there was more in the package... This seemed kinda pricy for me for dance purposes... but I needed to add one more thing to get free shipping at the time so this worked... it&#x27;s okay... I like the kind from my dance supplier better but this works</li>
            <li> What can you say about a clump of lambs wool?  It&#x27;s white.  It&#x27;s cleanly manufactured.  It does the trick of padding my toes from rubbing against shoes that are too round for my foot.</li>
            <li> The color cartridge did not fit my printer.</li>
            <li> After years of between the toes athletes foot, finally realized it was the moisture between the toes that was preventing a resolution.&lt;br /&gt;This lambs wool did the job. Just wrap some around the toes and keep them dry while the problem resolves.</li>
            <li> It is so very soft and does a fine job of separating toes.I would recommend it to people with toe problems.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to help with an orthotic that was rubbing my toes. Of course as soon as I ordered it, I saw it somewhere else.  Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Perfect for protecting toes when used in hiking boots.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I heard a tip to use lamb&#x27;s wool inside the toe area of high heels for comfort.  This size package worked great for one pair of heels and my feet have thanked me numerous times!</li>
            <li> Using it to ease fit of shoes which were a little small.  Helps some.  I think my feet are just getting old--Inwill be 92 on Christmas Day.m Bobette.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to relieve some looseness in a shoe. Works great!</li>
            <li> Saved a few pairs of shoes of mine which are either too big or too small (bought online, of course). One thing I don&#x27;t know yet is how long it&#x27;ll keep feeling comfortable when stuffed in a shoe. But worth the money for sure, considering the price you pay for the shoes, even the cheapest ones!</li>
            <li> Another customer recommended this wool to me after reading one of my reviews.  The wool did the trick in preventing my gout-prone toe from rubbing against the toe seam in shoes, which would always trigger an attack.  Thank you for taking the time to let me know.</li>
            <li> Used it to fill some extra space in the toe area of heels.  Works very well for that.  It is a very small amount of the stuff though; there&#x27;s places that sell more for a more palatable price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for nurturing your injured toe. I truly believe that there is a medicinal aid in the lambs wool, but beside that, it cushions your toe from abrasion, pressure and injury by insusting it with soft, gentle, real wool!</li>
            <li> These packages of clean and combed white Lamb&#x27;s wool can be hard to find, I was glad to find it for a fair price. It arrived as described and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I use this to provide padding between my little toe and the one adjacent, and to wick moisture away.  I had been in pain to the point of consider surgery, but using a little lamb&#x27;s wool between the toes has made that unnecessary.  I just pull off a little length of it and wrap it around the toe once or twice (depending on the length of the strip).  Socks hold it in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT:  Don&#x27;t buy from THIS vendor -- their shipping cost for this item is at least as much as the item -- even if ordering a dozen.  There is another vendor on Amazon that sells this product.  The price is higher, but the shipping cost is MUCH lower, so your total amount will be less using this other vendor.</li>
            <li> Service was fast, accurate and on time.  Very easy to do business with all of your team.  Will refer others to you!  Saved my feet on a 85 mile hike last summer in Philmont Scout Ranch.</li>
            <li> Works well as cushioning around and above toes.</li>
            <li> never felt anything so soft!</li>
            <li> Does what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> Lamb&#x27;s wool is a simple way to separate toes and avoid irritation and moisture problems.  Local stores no longer sell it so purchasing online was the way to go.</li>
            <li> Yep!  I said it and I&#x27;m glad -thrilled, in fact.  The bunion on my right foot is pushing big piggy toe over to this little piggy stayed home.  Thus, rubbing the most painful corn on that poor little stay at home piggy.  I thought I had cancer of the toe.  My daughter suggested I stop whining and wrap some lambs wool around it.  Do you know how damn hard it is to find lambs wool.  WalMart, CVS, RiteAid, Walgreens.....nobody had it. Not even Tarzhay.  Well thank you Amazon.  I wrap about three inches around the toe, covering the corn, it looks like a little turban, pull on the hose or socks and that&#x27;s it.  Good to go!  3/8 oz doesn&#x27;t sound like much but it is very light weight.  And if I&#x27;m real careful I can get 2-3 days out of one dsg.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> The picture seems larger than what it really is. Although I knew how small of a bag it would come in, being that it says 3/8 OZ, I assumed that they would fill the bag to the capacity. It didn&#x27;t look like they were finished packaging it, it was only so much in there. I would recommend to anyone with feet problems but beware that there&#x27;s not a lot that comes in it. Yes the bag is small but half empty. Not worth the price maybe if it were knocked down a buck. Gave it a 3 because of the price and the quantity. Other than that its great to use</li>
            <li> Absolute best!!!! So glad I found this product. I needed to add cushion inside my hand brace. I recently had hand surgery. The lambs wool made it very comfortable and secure.</li>
            <li> Great product, but tiny packaging. I guess I should have paid attention to the 3/8 oz. This measures around 3x4&amp;#34; FYI. Not much at all for $6.</li>
            <li> Good quality lambswool; just wish there were more of it. For some reason, it&#x27;s difficult to get plain lambswool instead of a fancy bandage, so I bought ths and am pleased.</li>
            <li> The wool was of an excellent quality. Very pleased that I can order it on line.</li>
            <li> Comfortable. Was skeptical that it would cushion my toe and not bother my walking. My concers were alleviated. Great product.</li>
            <li> Fast ship and what I needed.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bag of this for my brother, who has cerebral palsy.  He walks, but his feet turn inward, which is very hard on his outer toes.  He tried placing some lambs wool in his shoes and it solved his pain issues wonderfully!  The thought occurred to me, as ballerinas use this for their toe shoes.  Great item!</li>
            <li> Great option for shoes that are too big for you or have hard toes.  I use a little in my heeled booties.  Wish there was a way to glue this stuff to the sole! It&#x27;s so soft.  The package has enough for many more uses.</li>
            <li> Since I have chilblains I have found this helps some in insulating my toes.  I have been afraid to try the toe warmers that can get too hot for fear of worsening my condition.  Found this to be a good alternative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, soft lambs wool, not much to say. Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Used this to put in the toe box of a pair of shoes that were a little too big.  Makes such a difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for an elderly friend who has problems with her feet  She described what she needed and I came up with this idea.&lt;br /&gt;She said it was just the right product.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this on-line as it is not available in the stores--at least I didn&#x27;t find any there.  I have trouble with my feet and lambs wool&lt;br /&gt;gives relief.</li>
            <li> A foot DR. had reccomended using lamb&#x27;s wool to protect and sooth areas of ingrown toe nails. I had not been able to find it in local stores for years. Now I have it.</li>
            <li> Worked as needed/wanted.  I bought this for use after bone-spur foot surgery, to separate my big toe from 2nd toe and align the big toe with my foot.  Very comfortable. The stuff lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> yes.  blisters are gone.</li>
            <li> This wool is wonderful.  I do a great deal of walking and the wool protects the sensitive parts of my feet.  I can highly recommend it.  Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> the lambs wool provides perfect winter toe protection in boots. I will buy again. This survey word requirement is annoying</li>
