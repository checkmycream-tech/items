            <li>very cute</li>
            <li>I make jewelry, so I am sure I can fix this so it won&#x27;t happen anymore, but I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Ultra cute!</li>
            <li>Looked nice but got tangled in my hair every time I moved it or took it off.</li>
            <li>and I really liked that about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and cute</li>
            <li>Gives a very Greecian Goddess look, very cute!</li>
            <li>I was able to fix it myself, but it is something to think about.</li>
            <li>Stumbled upon this piece, glad I did bc</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to fix it.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>These are very nicely detailed leaves.</li>
            <li>Also gave a comfortable fit for all day wear and goes well with gold earrings.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and goes great with different hair styles.</li>
            <li>Geat price, very good steal, received quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li>the first day I wore it, it was all good, until the second day it broke...</li>
            <li>Other than that this is nice!</li>
            <li>this headband is gorgeous and has different leaf designs on either side, so it makes it really versatile.</li>
            <li>like it, the leafs are a tittle big, but still nice.</li>
            <li>This was pretty, but it broke fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>This is super cute but it faded to fast for my liking especially being the fact that I had not wore it yet!</li>
            <li>O ;)</li>
            <li>Pretty head band, durable materials</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for one of these for ages, and once I finally found this one, I was so excited to order it!</li>
            <li>I really like this piece.</li>
            <li>Very decorative and festive to wear</li>
            <li>It fits my head fine, but every time I put it on, the jump rings pop loose and the whole thing falls apart.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did not like is that it did break when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I have a small head and this fits it well, but it has the ability to stretch a lot more.</li>
            <li>Good for a little head or a little girl.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the piece of junk on anyways, only to have the METAL jewelry part, to my surprise, snap in half the very first time I put</li>
            <li>love it but kept having to pull/stretch it out since it was a little tight</li>

            <li> Came must faster than predicted.  A+</li>
            <li> Looked nice but got tangled in my hair every time I moved it or took it off. I need practicality as well as beauty.</li>
            <li> Gives a very Greecian Goddess look, very cute! Get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> one of the gold pieces busted as I was wearing it. Not cool! Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Thank you,the gold leaf Grecian Garland is nice and arrived and is adorable, very nice for parties and celebrations, thank you ! O ;)</li>
            <li> Pretty head band, durable materials</li>
            <li> Breaks all the time and constantly trying to put it back together... Also when I do out it back together it slides off my heAd</li>
            <li> Cannot be worn on head as advertised! Not stretchy enough for my grandchilds head, even! Sharp edges! Trashed it!</li>
            <li> I really like this piece. It&#x27;s very pretty and goes great with different hair styles. The only thing I did not like is that it did break when I first got it. Luckily I was able to fix it.I just have to be careful with it when putting it on</li>
            <li> These are very nicely detailed leaves. I have a small head and this fits it well, but it has the ability to stretch a lot more. It stays in place even when you wear it all day. The only problem is the leave are metal and have pointy ends so it does get stuck in my hair sometimes.</li>
            <li> I loved this headband! Very decorative and festive to wear and I really liked that about it. Also gave a comfortable fit for all day wear and goes well with gold earrings.</li>
            <li> The headband was beautiful, arrived on time, but you get what you pay for....the first day I wore it, it was all good, until the second day it broke...where one of the stems were, but I krazy glued it and it hasn&#x27;t gave up on me yet.</li>

            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s nice and cute</li>
            <li> This is super cute but it faded to fast for my liking especially being the fact that I had not wore it yet! Other than that this is nice!</li>
            <li> Can wear it with any thing! And it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like some of them do!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick so this didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Came apart the second time worn (though it does pull hair when worn!). I was able to fix it myself, but it is something to think about.</li>
            <li> Item actually broke as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> like it, the leafs are a tittle big, but still nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for one of these for ages, and once I finally found this one, I was so excited to order it! When I got it in the mail OVER A MONTH later, I saw that the jewelry part of the headband wasn&#x27;t even secured onto the elastic headband piece, just clamped on, as if that was supposed to stay together while I put it on my head. I decided to try the piece of junk on anyways, only to have the METAL jewelry part, to my surprise, snap in half the very first time I put I tried to pull it over my head. Even after it broke, it continued to crumble off. This is an absolute waste of money, and I&#x27;m warning you all not to buy it.</li>
            <li> took a while to ship and easilly gets stuck in my hair</li>
            <li> Stumbled upon this piece, glad I did bc I love it! Geat price, very good steal, received quite a few compliments. I would definitely reorder this for a gift.</li>
            <li> good quality. very cute</li>
            <li> Good for a little head or a little girl.</li>
            <li> I supposed to get this like almost a week ago and nothing</li>
            <li> love it but kept having to pull/stretch it out since it was a little tight i couldn&#x27;t wear it for too long... lol I promise i have a medium size head</li>
            <li> This was pretty, but it broke fairly quickly. Also, it is not super dainty--better to use for a halloween costume than day to day.</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than I expected! Ultra cute!</li>
            <li> Loops aren&#x27;t closed so it keeps falling apart</li>
