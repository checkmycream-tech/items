            <li>The face wash is great too.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;ve mentioned how happy I am with the non-toxic products and</li>

            <li>/&gt;these are all very amazing products.</li>
            <li>amazing!</li>
            <li>This cream is wonderful, light but providing plenty of moisture, with a pleasant, anise or licorice like smell.</li>
            <li>The gloves were good but the soap was just...unpleasant.</li>
            <li>and like I said above--to be fair and give it a chance.</li>
            <li>I saw results immediately; I loved the way my skin and hair looked and felt from day 1.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner have been really good too.</li>
            <li>and I feel good that I am not using chemical laden products.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s normally very healthy</li>
            <li>I already bought 2 more kirs for my son and daughter !</li>
            <li>Day one, my hair looked better!  </li>
            <li>I just love all these products!</li>
            <li>Love these products!  </li>
            <li>Love these products!</li>
            <li>These products are amazingly nourishing.</li>
            <li>Hair products are amazing too.</li>
            <li>They emailed after about a week of receiving this basket to see how I liked it</li>
            <li>I am happy I found it and thanks for making some truly great products without chemicals.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating gloves were a nice addition in the package too.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to do any good conditioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice addition to get the exfoliating items .</li>
            <li>absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love all of them!!</li>
            <li>Shampoo &amp; conditioner leave your hair feeling clean &amp; healthy!!</li>
            <li>whatever, feels good, lathers and cleans well, rinse easily.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer contains anise and this gives it a very strong licorice smell which is not acceptable for me as I head into work</li>
            <li>It smells very light and pleasant and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love not putting chemicals on my skin so the purity of these products is really nice.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite item is the glycerin soap - love that it is kind to my skin and has no scent.</li>
            <li>I can describe Christina&#x27;s products in one word, &amp;#34;Miraculous&amp;#34;  I ordered the kit with all her products and love each and everyone on of the them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many like this</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is much better than the shampoo I find.</li>
            <li>I did this so that I would know for sure</li>
            <li>Love the products.  </li>
            <li>These are great for anyone who wants to have healthy, shiny hair as well as skin that glows because it is being nourished with organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have already reviewed the wonderful organic facial moisturizer, please look for it.  </li>
            <li>The package is a great bargain, and the all-organic ingredients list with no fillers or unsavory additives is real peace of mind.</li>
            <li>because virtually ALL of the products that we buy in stores (and online) have petroleum based chemicals in them--even the &amp;#34;good ones&amp;#34; that cost even more than all the rest.  </li>
            <li>I love the lavendar face wash.  </li>
            <li>so i could test many products at once and save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have tried many products and these are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the moisturizer - is my favorite.</li>
            <li>better than anything you will find at walmart, thats for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; you only need a drop the size of a pea to get great lather!  </li>
            <li>Love everything that came with the set</li>
            <li>I love her products.</li>
            <li>I am beyond satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The longer I use the products the better</li>
            <li>These products are clean, safe and effective.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair feeling very clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bar soap lathered up nicely with my scrubby, and rinsed off easily and cleanly with no residue.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t always have time to create my own, it is nice to find a reasonably priced product.  </li>
            <li>Great products that work wonders on my very sensitive skin and scalp.</li>
            <li>Having healthy, shiny hair &amp; glowing skin have always been important to me.</li>
            <li>it is better for shampoo and conditioner to be free of sulfate and parabens.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find this product made with all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>They really are working for the good of their customers.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair silky and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>the communication with the company is super!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin to chemicals and this line of products has been really good for me.</li>
            <li>Awesome products, a little goes along way so don&#x27;t be put off by the cost.</li>
            <li>Both of them wash out very quickly and cleanly which I like.</li>
            <li>Cleanses your hair in a unique way, takes a bit to get used to.</li>
            <li>started using the facial moisturizer and loved how great my face felt, so I thought I would give the shampoo, conditioner, facial wash,  and body bar</li>
            <li>They feel and smell so fresh and natural; so silky smooth and good.</li>
            <li>This is my second order of the face wash, I&#x27;m very happy with the way it cleans without drying my &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li>so it rinsed off clean.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such superb products @ a reasonable price too!</li>
            <li>Thank you for your special care &amp; for making a difference.</li>
            <li>I felt like I have to apply quite a bit just to know that I&#x27;m washing my full head of hair.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Overall I think these products are of good quality</li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally found something so natural and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I bought more packages today for gifts (and for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have straight hair,  curly hair &amp; colored hair in our family.</li>
            <li>These products are exactly as described and are very mild.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think at first, but now that I&#x27;m almost through my first bottles, I know my hair is fuller and shinier.</li>
            <li>(super concentrated)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>(super concentrated)&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>My skin wasn&#x27;t smooth and it just was one of those things that I didn&#x27;t want to use again after the first time.</li>
            <li>favorite products are the facial wash and facial moisturizer - I find that I take better care of my skin when I love the products, so, Thank you for making these!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have tried so many products I cannot use.</li>
            <li>Also, just knowing that what I&#x27;m cleaning my body with (which absorbs into your bloodstream, by the way) is not only NOT bad for my body, but it&#x27;s actually GOOD to have this stuff absorbing into my bloodstream through the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m trying to get away from all the chemicals i have been using and start over with more natural and organic products.</li>
            <li>conditioner - even better than the shampoo, leaves hair feeling soft and flowing.</li>
            <li>I am more conscious of the products and food going into/on my body - chemicals are no longer acceptable.  </li>
            <li>it sent out a replacement right away.  </li>
            <li>It smells decent and I do love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>First let me start off with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put my finger on exactly what it smells</li>
            <li>After the first use, I was amazed at how well it took off all of my make up</li>
            <li>Finally a healthy skin and hair line that actually works!</li>
            <li>Instantly my hair and skin feel better.</li>
            <li>My face, body, and hair feel clean, but soft as well!</li>
            <li>Leaves his hair clean and soft!</li>
            <li>These products feel great on my body -- especially knowing they are devoid of all chemicals --- and still perform to my expectation.  </li>
            <li>If you have done this before, you will most likely like the gloves and the whole routine.</li>
            <li>The facial wash leaves my skin clean but not dry like most cleansers that contain chemicals.</li>
            <li>The more I researched I soon realized using baking soda over time can dry hair!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The package is a great bargain, and the all-organic ingredients list with no fillers or unsavory additives is real peace of mind.fter towel drying my hair, I ran a comb through it and amazingly, no tangles!</li>
            <li>The hair products are fine but the conditioner is not quite enough for my dryness.</li>
            <li>The ends looked split and it was much frizzier.</li>
            <li>No chems and the products work really well.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer seems to hydrate my skin really well</li>
            <li>really beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also really like the face cream.  </li>
            <li>All of that sulfur and toxic chemicals that those products are made out of are absorbing into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li>this line of products is an absolute winner.</li>
            <li>I really like how it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>I would encourage people to try them as I think they are good products and the company&#x27;s attention to product quality and follow-up with customers is above and beyond any other company I have ever dealt with.</li>
            <li>and it left my skin feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The cream is the exact right item to use after the Facial Wash.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using these CMN packages, I&#x27;ve noticed that my own skin is naturally moisturizing itself, meaning I need way LESS lotion that I used to in order to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products, and basically the results are the same.  </li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for Christina Moss products</li>
            <li>i highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Unlike other conditioners that take several minutes to rinse off, this one rinsed off nicely with no residue.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t reply because I had only used everything once at that particular time and didn&#x27;t think it was right to say I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without these products.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have always used Johnson and Johnson baby cream on my face and body.</li>
            <li>It has a mild smell that is neither good nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Let me jump ahead quickly and say that once my hair dried, it wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li>only fear is what I will do if she stops making it or she&#x27;s out of stock when I&#x27;m ready to order!</li>
            <li>First of all the products are organic and this in my opinion is a big bonus.</li>
            <li>First, the facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Completely exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals are in these products that bother me!</li>
            <li>Leaving hair extremely soft and smelling like heaven!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and it isn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft in fact you could go without a moisturizer if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see an improvement in my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Christina Moss Naturals helps me achieve this naturally.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and  read</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, and I will definitely keep buying these products!</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo and conditioner on my 21month old son&#x27;s curly  hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never thought it fair to give a poor review without explaining the pros and cons because there is a product from this line that I likely will reorder.</li>
            <li>It was not heavy, thick or slimy as so many others are.</li>
            <li>I love every single product in this kit except the moisturizer because it smells like black licorice with makes me gag....  </li>
            <li>Our skin and hair feel clean and soft, not stripped or slick</li>
            <li>I have used a facial buffer pad before, so this was nothing new.</li>
            <li>There is no discernible benefit to using the products -- they don&#x27;t live up to the vendor&#x27;s claim and are hardly anything special.</li>
            <li>I have had terribly dry hair and skin for years now, and absolutely nothing has helped me.  </li>
            <li>The facial moisturizer is light and has helped lower the redness from Roseacia, it has a licorice smell but is unnoticeable after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried when I first bought them as I&#x27;ve used a lot of other organic products</li>
            <li>Left my relaxed hair so soft !</li>
            <li>No other products compare.  </li>
            <li>Still so very dry and my hair gets really frizzy, too, which I think is because of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If, and only if, you can get past the overwhelming smell of black licorice, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Most store bought conditioners are tough to fully rinse out but this one was not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo was not overly foamy, and I had not expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I will say, my daughter showers before bed and then in the morning she just brushes it and puts in a head band in the morning, and after the second day of her using this, her looked so wavy and natural and</li>
            <li>Finally, a company that uses fewer ingredients that is truly organic and natural.</li>
            <li>Last but not least, I used the facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>They took some getting used to, but I use them in the shower and they really scrub down and make my skin feel soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>The shampoo/conditioner works in my long hair ends very well &amp; is more moisturizing than any other products, &amp; only small amounts.</li>
            <li>Smells like licorice and seems to really help my mature skin be smoother and less wrinkly.</li>
            <li>My hair is neither thick nor thin, it&#x27;s a happy medium</li>
            <li>This is a partial review since I&#x27;m finishing some other products first and have only tried the moisturizing cream so far.</li>
            <li>That was the reason for my decision to find a new product because my skin was left so dry after washing.  </li>
            <li>And my 9 year old daughter says she won&#x27;t ever use anything else for as long as she lives!  </li>

            <li> in all, this was a great way to test all the products,  which I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> in all, this was a great way to test all the products,  which I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> shampoo - is also great.</li>
            <li> The face wash is great too.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve mentioned how happy I am with the non-toxic products and</li>
            <li> Great stuff</li>
            <li> The lotion is great too - absorbs well and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Great transaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;these are all very amazing products.</li>
            <li> amazing!</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful, light but providing plenty of moisture, with a pleasant, anise or licorice like smell.</li>
            <li> The gloves were good but the soap was just...unpleasant.</li>
            <li> and like I said above--to be fair and give it a chance.</li>
            <li> I saw results immediately; I loved the way my skin and hair looked and felt from day 1.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner have been really good too.</li>
            <li> and I feel good that I am not using chemical laden products.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s normally very healthy</li>
            <li> I already bought 2 more kirs for my son and daughter !</li>
            <li> Day one, my hair looked better!  </li>
            <li> I just love all these products!</li>
            <li> Love these products!  </li>
            <li> Love these products!</li>
            <li> These products are amazingly nourishing.</li>
            <li> Hair products are amazing too.</li>
            <li> They emailed after about a week of receiving this basket to see how I liked it</li>
            <li> I am happy I found it and thanks for making some truly great products without chemicals.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating gloves were a nice addition in the package too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to do any good conditioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice addition to get the exfoliating items .</li>
            <li> absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love all of them!!</li>
            <li> Shampoo &amp; conditioner leave your hair feeling clean &amp; healthy!!</li>
            <li> whatever, feels good, lathers and cleans well, rinse easily.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer contains anise and this gives it a very strong licorice smell which is not acceptable for me as I head into work</li>
            <li> It smells very light and pleasant and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love not putting chemicals on my skin so the purity of these products is really nice.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite item is the glycerin soap - love that it is kind to my skin and has no scent.</li>
            <li> I can describe Christina&#x27;s products in one word, &amp;#34;Miraculous&amp;#34;  I ordered the kit with all her products and love each and everyone on of the them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many like this</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is much better than the shampoo I find.</li>
            <li> I did this so that I would know for sure</li>
            <li> Love the products.  </li>
            <li> These are great for anyone who wants to have healthy, shiny hair as well as skin that glows because it is being nourished with organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have already reviewed the wonderful organic facial moisturizer, please look for it.  </li>
            <li> The package is a great bargain, and the all-organic ingredients list with no fillers or unsavory additives is real peace of mind.</li>
            <li> because virtually ALL of the products that we buy in stores (and online) have petroleum based chemicals in them--even the &amp;#34;good ones&amp;#34; that cost even more than all the rest.  </li>
            <li> I love the lavendar face wash.  </li>
            <li> so i could test many products at once and save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have tried many products and these are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the moisturizer - is my favorite.</li>
            <li> better than anything you will find at walmart, thats for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; you only need a drop the size of a pea to get great lather!  </li>
            <li> Love everything that came with the set</li>
            <li> I love her products.</li>
            <li> I am beyond satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The longer I use the products the better</li>
            <li> These products are clean, safe and effective.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair feeling very clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bar soap lathered up nicely with my scrubby, and rinsed off easily and cleanly with no residue.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t always have time to create my own, it is nice to find a reasonably priced product.  </li>
            <li> Great products that work wonders on my very sensitive skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> Having healthy, shiny hair &amp; glowing skin have always been important to me.</li>
            <li> it is better for shampoo and conditioner to be free of sulfate and parabens.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product made with all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> They really are working for the good of their customers.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair silky and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> the communication with the company is super!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin to chemicals and this line of products has been really good for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome products, a little goes along way so don&#x27;t be put off by the cost.</li>
            <li> Both of them wash out very quickly and cleanly which I like.</li>
            <li> Cleanses your hair in a unique way, takes a bit to get used to.</li>
            <li> started using the facial moisturizer and loved how great my face felt, so I thought I would give the shampoo, conditioner, facial wash,  and body bar</li>
            <li> They feel and smell so fresh and natural; so silky smooth and good.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of the face wash, I&#x27;m very happy with the way it cleans without drying my &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> so it rinsed off clean.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such superb products @ a reasonable price too!</li>
            <li> Thank you for your special care &amp; for making a difference.</li>
            <li> I felt like I have to apply quite a bit just to know that I&#x27;m washing my full head of hair.</li>
            <li> It rinsed out quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Overall I think these products are of good quality</li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally found something so natural and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I bought more packages today for gifts (and for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have straight hair,  curly hair &amp; colored hair in our family.</li>
            <li> These products are exactly as described and are very mild.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think at first, but now that I&#x27;m almost through my first bottles, I know my hair is fuller and shinier.</li>
            <li> (super concentrated)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> (super concentrated)&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t smooth and it just was one of those things that I didn&#x27;t want to use again after the first time.</li>
            <li> favorite products are the facial wash and facial moisturizer - I find that I take better care of my skin when I love the products, so, Thank you for making these!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried so many products I cannot use.</li>
            <li> Also, just knowing that what I&#x27;m cleaning my body with (which absorbs into your bloodstream, by the way) is not only NOT bad for my body, but it&#x27;s actually GOOD to have this stuff absorbing into my bloodstream through the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to get away from all the chemicals i have been using and start over with more natural and organic products.</li>
            <li> conditioner - even better than the shampoo, leaves hair feeling soft and flowing.</li>
            <li> I am more conscious of the products and food going into/on my body - chemicals are no longer acceptable.  </li>
            <li> it sent out a replacement right away.  </li>
            <li> It smells decent and I do love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> First let me start off with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my finger on exactly what it smells</li>
            <li> After the first use, I was amazed at how well it took off all of my make up</li>
            <li> Finally a healthy skin and hair line that actually works!</li>
            <li> Instantly my hair and skin feel better.</li>
            <li> My face, body, and hair feel clean, but soft as well!</li>
            <li> Leaves his hair clean and soft!</li>
            <li> These products feel great on my body -- especially knowing they are devoid of all chemicals --- and still perform to my expectation.  </li>
            <li> If you have done this before, you will most likely like the gloves and the whole routine.</li>
            <li> The facial wash leaves my skin clean but not dry like most cleansers that contain chemicals.</li>
            <li> The more I researched I soon realized using baking soda over time can dry hair!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The package is a great bargain, and the all-organic ingredients list with no fillers or unsavory additives is real peace of mind.fter towel drying my hair, I ran a comb through it and amazingly, no tangles!</li>
            <li> The hair products are fine but the conditioner is not quite enough for my dryness.</li>
            <li> The ends looked split and it was much frizzier.</li>
            <li> No chems and the products work really well.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer seems to hydrate my skin really well</li>
            <li> really beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also really like the face cream.  </li>
            <li> All of that sulfur and toxic chemicals that those products are made out of are absorbing into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> this line of products is an absolute winner.</li>
            <li> I really like how it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> I would encourage people to try them as I think they are good products and the company&#x27;s attention to product quality and follow-up with customers is above and beyond any other company I have ever dealt with.</li>
            <li> and it left my skin feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The cream is the exact right item to use after the Facial Wash.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using these CMN packages, I&#x27;ve noticed that my own skin is naturally moisturizing itself, meaning I need way LESS lotion that I used to in order to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products, and basically the results are the same.  </li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for Christina Moss products</li>
            <li> i highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unlike other conditioners that take several minutes to rinse off, this one rinsed off nicely with no residue.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t reply because I had only used everything once at that particular time and didn&#x27;t think it was right to say I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without these products.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have always used Johnson and Johnson baby cream on my face and body.</li>
            <li> It has a mild smell that is neither good nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Let me jump ahead quickly and say that once my hair dried, it wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li> only fear is what I will do if she stops making it or she&#x27;s out of stock when I&#x27;m ready to order!</li>
            <li> First of all the products are organic and this in my opinion is a big bonus.</li>
            <li> First, the facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Completely exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals are in these products that bother me!</li>
            <li> Leaving hair extremely soft and smelling like heaven!</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and it isn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft in fact you could go without a moisturizer if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see an improvement in my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Christina Moss Naturals helps me achieve this naturally.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and  read</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, and I will definitely keep buying these products!</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner on my 21month old son&#x27;s curly  hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never thought it fair to give a poor review without explaining the pros and cons because there is a product from this line that I likely will reorder.</li>
            <li> It was not heavy, thick or slimy as so many others are.</li>
            <li> I love every single product in this kit except the moisturizer because it smells like black licorice with makes me gag....  </li>
            <li> Our skin and hair feel clean and soft, not stripped or slick</li>
            <li> I have used a facial buffer pad before, so this was nothing new.</li>
            <li> There is no discernible benefit to using the products -- they don&#x27;t live up to the vendor&#x27;s claim and are hardly anything special.</li>
            <li> I have had terribly dry hair and skin for years now, and absolutely nothing has helped me.  </li>
            <li> The facial moisturizer is light and has helped lower the redness from Roseacia, it has a licorice smell but is unnoticeable after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried when I first bought them as I&#x27;ve used a lot of other organic products</li>
            <li> Left my relaxed hair so soft !</li>
            <li> No other products compare.  </li>
            <li> Still so very dry and my hair gets really frizzy, too, which I think is because of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If, and only if, you can get past the overwhelming smell of black licorice, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Most store bought conditioners are tough to fully rinse out but this one was not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo was not overly foamy, and I had not expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I will say, my daughter showers before bed and then in the morning she just brushes it and puts in a head band in the morning, and after the second day of her using this, her looked so wavy and natural and</li>
            <li> Finally, a company that uses fewer ingredients that is truly organic and natural.</li>
            <li> Last but not least, I used the facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> They took some getting used to, but I use them in the shower and they really scrub down and make my skin feel soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> The shampoo/conditioner works in my long hair ends very well &amp; is more moisturizing than any other products, &amp; only small amounts.</li>
            <li> Smells like licorice and seems to really help my mature skin be smoother and less wrinkly.</li>
            <li> My hair is neither thick nor thin, it&#x27;s a happy medium</li>
            <li> This is a partial review since I&#x27;m finishing some other products first and have only tried the moisturizing cream so far.</li>
            <li> That was the reason for my decision to find a new product because my skin was left so dry after washing.  </li>
            <li> And my 9 year old daughter says she won&#x27;t ever use anything else for as long as she lives!  </li>
            <li> One difference between this cream and its much higher-priced predecessors is that my skin absorbs the cream and is actually nourished, whereas with the other ones I always felt that the benefit came off with the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review as I start using the other products (soap, shampoo,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the false healthy hair and skin that you get from it.</li>
            <li> To think you are left with such soft skin using only natural products in unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> I never noticed a difference in my face but in all fairness, I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to tell.</li>
            <li> They last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Just a reminder not to scrub hard, just buff your face softly to remove old skin cells.</li>
            <li> I had a dry skin problem before which is not non-existent and the only difference</li>
            <li> Shampoo &amp; conditioner leave my hair soft and shinny, after a few weeks my color shows no sign of fading.</li>
            <li> One minor irritation...</li>
            <li> One minor irritation...</li>
            <li> My skin feels majorly different since using them, no longer dried out and when I use the facial wash, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like it&#x27;s been stretched around my face.</li>
            <li> I prefer my dry brush that I use before my shower to stimulate circulation on my arms, legs and back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The body soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave a residue</li>
            <li> My hair always felt dry and wirey.  </li>
            <li> Also, the company cares about our planet and wanted to make packaging as modest as possible, leaving less waste for our landfills.  </li>
            <li> By the 3rd day using the facial wash and lotion, the trouble areas of my face were no longer there and wrinkles were visibly lessening; the areas on my eye lids and cheeks and oily break out</li>
            <li> My guess is that it will last as long as the previous cream I used, which was almost twice the size.</li>
            <li> I mean, the biggest thing for me is probably that I actually found a 100% natural conditioner that ACTUALLY conditions my hair and also works as a detangler when you apply a little once you&#x27;re out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I began with the small size and would like to use the larger size net time.</li>
            <li> Discovering this product after long research &amp; experimentation with other products is a victory for me</li>
            <li> There was none of that thick/slick/heavy feeling that I was used to, and again I wondered if this conditioner had really \\&quot;done anything\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After towel drying my hair, I ran a comb through it and amazingly, no tangles!</li>
            <li> That is because they are concentrated so you only need to use a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I feel my skin has made a dramatic change since using the soaps and facial cleanser, specifically in the general outlook of my skin and overall problems</li>
            <li> It dried it out quite badly actually.</li>
            <li> It cleans make-up off as expected.</li>
            <li> I learned that if a product is going to be all natural, then it cannot have any preservatives in it, so that would mean that it couldn&#x27;t be sold in stores unless it had a freshness date on the label.  </li>
            <li> I guess all those added ingredients in other products really are unnecessary after all.</li>
            <li> I guess all those added ingredients in other products really are unnecessary after all.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> remember, a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I simply couldn&#x27;t get past the smell nor could my husband.</li>
            <li> The bath soap bar isn&#x27;t melting away as some other reviewers reported,</li>
            <li> but they just are not exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottles are small, only 4 oz.  </li>
            <li> Even without harsh chemicals or drying alcohols, my face felt a bit tight after using, so I reached for the facial moisturizer which was cooling and soothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I was initially disappointed by the small size of the jar, I soon learned that a little goes a long way and you really don&#x27;t need to apply much.</li>
            <li> So here is a run down on the other products.</li>
            <li> It came packaged as a loose jumble of products in a padded bag -- hardly anything to look at.</li>
            <li> A little pricey.</li>
            <li> I set my hair without any of the other products I usually use like silicone based spray/leave-on setting lotions.  </li>
            <li> I set my hair without any of the other products I usually use like silicone based spray/leave-on setting lotions.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the reviews I was a bit leery about the licorice sent in the moisturizer, but if you don&#x27;t like the sent of licorice, no worries,  it dissipates within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can describe Christina&#x27;s products in one word, &amp;#34;Miraculous&amp;#34;  I ordered the kit with all her products and love each and everyone on of the them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial cleanser is indescribable and your skin is left like a baby&#x27;s bottom after washing.  To think you are left with such soft skin using only natural products in unbelievable!  That was the reason for my decision to find a new product because my skin was left so dry after washing.  It&#x27;s so soft in fact you could go without a moisturizer if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I was a bit leery about the licorice sent in the moisturizer, but if you don&#x27;t like the sent of licorice, no worries,  it dissipates within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only fear is what I will do if she stops making it or she&#x27;s out of stock when I&#x27;m ready to order!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the shampoo, conditioner &amp; face wash.  These products feel great on my body -- especially knowing they are devoid of all chemicals --- and still perform to my expectation.  Also-- the communication with the company is super! They really are working for the good of their customers.  Thanks for such superb products @ a reasonable price too!</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a gift. It came packaged as a loose jumble of products in a padded bag -- hardly anything to look at. The bottles are small. There is no discernible benefit to using the products -- they don&#x27;t live up to the vendor&#x27;s claim and are hardly anything special. All in all, ordinary, drugstore-variety products that you pay a premium for.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for Christina Moss products but unfortunately they didn&#x27;t work well for me at all. I do want to go into detail though of what did work and what didn&#x27;t though. I&#x27;ve never thought it fair to give a poor review without explaining the pros and cons because there is a product from this line that I likely will reorder. First let me start off with the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t foam up and I believe that it isn&#x27;t supposed to because it truly is organic. Many like this and I understand why but personally, I didn&#x27;t.. I felt like I have to apply quite a bit just to know that I&#x27;m washing my full head of hair. It has a mild smell that is neither good nor unpleasant. I can&#x27;t put my finger on exactly what it smells like but it&#x27;s okay. The conditioner is much better than the shampoo I find. It smells very light and pleasant and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I let it sit for about 5 minutes then washed it out. Both of them wash out very quickly and cleanly which I like. Most store bought conditioners are tough to fully rinse out but this one was not. Let me jump ahead quickly and say that once my hair dried, it wasn&#x27;t pretty. It dried it out quite badly actually. The ends looked split and it was much frizzier. My hair is neither thick nor thin, it&#x27;s a happy medium and I&#x27;ve never colored my hair in my life nor do I use a lot of heat so it&#x27;s normally very healthy so I was shocked that it looked so badly afterwards. Next I used the gloves and soap. The gloves were good but the soap was just...unpleasant. I know I&#x27;ve used this word a lot but that&#x27;s the best way to explain it. My skin wasn&#x27;t smooth and it just was one of those things that I didn&#x27;t want to use again after the first time. Next, I used the facial cleanser. This the only product that I would consider reordering. After the first use, I was amazed at how well it took off all of my make up and it left my skin feeling clean and hydrated. After the third day, I noticed the skin tight/dry feeling appear BUT it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried. It smells decent and I do love that it&#x27;s natural ingredients. Last but not least, I used the facial moisturizer. I&#x27;ve actually left a review on it already so I&#x27;ll keep it short here. If, and only if, you can get past the overwhelming smell of black licorice, it works very well. It goes on very smoothly and it isn&#x27;t thick. I never noticed a difference in my face but in all fairness, I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to tell. I simply couldn&#x27;t get past the smell nor could my husband. He couldn&#x27;t stand when I would come to bed with it on. I will say though that Christina Moss Naturals seems to be a very good company. They emailed after about a week of receiving this basket to see how I liked it and I didn&#x27;t reply because I had only used everything once at that particular time and didn&#x27;t think it was right to say I didn&#x27;t like it. Since then I&#x27;ve used everything three times except for the bar of soap. I did this so that I would know for sure and like I said above--to be fair and give it a chance. I don&#x27;t regret spending the money because I understand that every one is different. For some, I know these products worked wonders, it just unfortunately did not for me.</li>
            <li> I love every single product in this kit except the moisturizer because it smells like black licorice with makes me gag....  however my husband loves it!  I am sold on the bar soap, shampoo, conditioner and facial wash big time.  I am officially a fan and a repeat customer!  Great products that work wonders on my very sensitive skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  A little pricey. Cleanses your hair in a unique way, takes a bit to get used to. No residue with a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is a partial review since I&#x27;m finishing some other products first and have only tried the moisturizing cream so far. This cream is wonderful, light but providing plenty of moisture, with a pleasant, anise or licorice like smell. While I was initially disappointed by the small size of the jar, I soon learned that a little goes a long way and you really don&#x27;t need to apply much. My guess is that it will last as long as the previous cream I used, which was almost twice the size. One difference between this cream and its much higher-priced predecessors is that my skin absorbs the cream and is actually nourished, whereas with the other ones I always felt that the benefit came off with the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review as I start using the other products (soap, shampoo, conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;The service from this company is wonderful, by the way.</li>
            <li> Awesome products, a little goes along way so don&#x27;t be put off by the cost. This is my second order of the face wash, I&#x27;m very happy with the way it cleans without drying my &#x27;mature&#x27; skin. The facial moisturizer is light and has helped lower the redness from Roseacia, it has a licorice smell but is unnoticeable after a few minutes. Shampoo &amp; conditioner leave my hair soft and shinny, after a few weeks my color shows no sign of fading. The bath soap bar isn&#x27;t melting away as some other reviewers reported, I keep it on a wire shelf away fron water spray so this may help</li>
            <li> Love the products.  Only had 1 time I needed to return a product but they were great about it sent out a replacement right away.  The company is great and the products are awesome.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often leave reviews, but I felt like doing so with this set of products. Let me be specific. First of all the products are organic and this in my opinion is a big bonus. I was a bit worried when I first bought them as I&#x27;ve used a lot of other organic products and they just didn&#x27;t work well, or ended up having chemical preservatives in them. I read the money back guarantee so I figured nothing to lose.  No chems and the products work really well. The facial wash and moisturizer are my favorites out of the 5 products in this collection. My skin feels majorly different since using them, no longer dried out and when I use the facial wash, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like it&#x27;s been stretched around my face. The moisturizer seems to hydrate my skin really well and it stays like that through-out the day. I have very sensitive skin to chemicals and this line of products has been really good for me. I am happy I found it and thanks for making some truly great products without chemicals. The exfoliating gloves were a nice addition in the package too. They took some getting used to, but I use them in the shower and they really scrub down and make my skin feel soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner espically great! Face wash I see an improvement in my sensitive skin and I will be buying again ! I already bought 2 more kirs for my son and daughter ! Conditioner excellent as a leave in ! Make it bigger size 16 oz. Please of the shampoo and conditioner !!! Will buy again. Left my relaxed hair so soft ! Haven&#x27;t used the soap and gloves yet !</li>
            <li> These products are amazingly nourishing. I like that there are no harmful products in them. These are great for anyone who wants to have healthy, shiny hair as well as skin that glows because it is being nourished with organic ingredients. Having healthy, shiny hair &amp; glowing skin have always been important to me. Christina Moss Naturals helps me achieve this naturally.</li>
            <li> I have already reviewed the wonderful organic facial moisturizer, please look for it.  So here is a run down on the other products. First, the facial cleanser. It cleans make-up off as expected. I have used a facial buffer pad before, so this was nothing new. It was quite sturdy, there was nothing wimpy about it. Just a reminder not to scrub hard, just buff your face softly to remove old skin cells. This face cleanser was not overly foamy, nor slimy as some are so it rinsed off clean. Even without harsh chemicals or drying alcohols, my face felt a bit tight after using, so I reached for the facial moisturizer which was cooling and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was not overly foamy, and I had not expected it to be. We are all trying to get away from the artificial foaming agents like sodium lauryl sulfate aren&#x27;t we? It rinsed out quickly and cleanly. At this point my hair is usually very stiff and tangled. Not so with this shampoo. I then used some of the conditioner. It was not heavy, thick or slimy as so many others are. I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to do any good conditioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I let the conditioner sit on my hair for a few minutes, I put on the exfoliating gloves. I&#x27;m not a fan. I am a \\&quot;petite\\&quot; woman with small hands, and these were a bit tight. They did stretch, but I couldn&#x27;t get used to the exfoliating of arms and legs with a glove, even with soap. If you have done this before, you will most likely like the gloves and the whole routine. I prefer my dry brush that I use before my shower to stimulate circulation on my arms, legs and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar soap lathered up nicely with my scrubby, and rinsed off easily and cleanly with no residue. I then rinsed off the conditioner. Unlike other conditioners that take several minutes to rinse off, this one rinsed off nicely with no residue. There was none of that thick/slick/heavy feeling that I was used to, and again I wondered if this conditioner had really \\&quot;done anything\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After towel drying my hair, I ran a comb through it and amazingly, no tangles! I set my hair without any of the other products I usually use like silicone based spray/leave-on setting lotions.  After it dried,  my hair was soft, silky and completely manageable. I was really surprised. I guess all those added ingredients in other products really are unnecessary after all. None of the products had any noticeable scent except the face moisturizer which has the star anise (licorice) preservative scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this was a great way to test all the products,  which I will be purchasing again. One minor irritation...I didn&#x27;t know the shampoo, moisturizer and face wash had foil on the inside of the cap and I had a bit of a hard time prying it out. The package is a great bargain, and the all-organic ingredients list with no fillers or unsavory additives is real peace of mind.fter towel drying my hair, I ran a comb through it and amazingly, no tangles!

            <li> These products are exactly as described and are very mild. It&#x27;s a nice addition to get the exfoliating items . I think my favorite item is the glycerin soap - love that it is kind to my skin and has no scent. The hair products are fine but the conditioner is not quite enough for my dryness. The moisturizer contains anise and this gives it a very strong licorice smell which is not acceptable for me as I head into work but it definitely moisturizes well so I only use it at night. Overall I think these products are of good quality but they just are not exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. I would encourage people to try them as I think they are good products and the company&#x27;s attention to product quality and follow-up with customers is above and beyond any other company I have ever dealt with.</li>
            <li> It has been ten days since I started using this set, and I am sold for life!  I have had terribly dry hair and skin for years now, and absolutely nothing has helped me.  I have tried so many different products, and basically the results are the same.  My hair and my skin both are just unchanged.  Still so very dry and my hair gets really frizzy, too, which I think is because of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried these products from Christina Moss Naturals.  Turns out, the reason I have been having such a difficult time with dryness is because virtually ALL of the products that we buy in stores (and online) have petroleum based chemicals in them--even the &amp;#34;good ones&amp;#34; that cost even more than all the rest.  I learned that if a product is going to be all natural, then it cannot have any preservatives in it, so that would mean that it couldn&#x27;t be sold in stores unless it had a freshness date on the label.  Definitely never seen that before on any of the products I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christina Moss Naturals is different.  They actually do not have any preservatives in their products whatsoever.  When I started using all of the products together, my skin and hair immediately started improving!  Day one, my hair looked better!  And my 9 year old daughter says she won&#x27;t ever use anything else for as long as she lives!  I will say, my daughter showers before bed and then in the morning she just brushes it and puts in a head band in the morning, and after the second day of her using this, her looked so wavy and natural and really beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are small, only 4 oz.  That is because they are concentrated so you only need to use a little bit.  Also, the company cares about our planet and wanted to make packaging as modest as possible, leaving less waste for our landfills.  However, I have learned that they are going to be selling the shampoo and conditioner in larger quantities very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am a very happy customer of Christina Moss Naturals products!  Keep up the good work!!</li>
            <li> I love the lavendar face wash.  It&#x27;s so soothing.  I also really like the face cream.  Smells like licorice and seems to really help my mature skin be smoother and less wrinkly.</li>
            <li> This is Camelia, but I&#x27;m using my husbands Amazon account... I&#x27;ve been using this package of CMN shampoo, conditioner, face wash, moisturizer and bar soap for a while now and there&#x27;s really only one word that describes how I feel about these products... OBSESSED. I mean, the biggest thing for me is probably that I actually found a 100% natural conditioner that ACTUALLY conditions my hair and also works as a detangler when you apply a little once you&#x27;re out of the shower. It&#x27;s the best thing ever! Also, just knowing that what I&#x27;m cleaning my body with (which absorbs into your bloodstream, by the way) is not only NOT bad for my body, but it&#x27;s actually GOOD to have this stuff absorbing into my bloodstream through the skin. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s so creepy about the horrible, toxic products that you &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; are amazing like Aussie, Organix, Burts Bees, etc. All of that sulfur and toxic chemicals that those products are made out of are absorbing into your bloodstream. EW!!! It&#x27;s not worth the false healthy hair and skin that you get from it. Since I&#x27;ve been using these CMN packages, I&#x27;ve noticed that my own skin is naturally moisturizing itself, meaning I need way LESS lotion that I used to in order to moisturize my skin. I had a dry skin problem before which is not non-existent and the only difference is that I&#x27;m now using the CMN products.</li>
            <li> Theses products are AMAZING!! Finally a healthy skin and hair line that actually works! Completely exceeded my expectations! I saw results immediately; I loved the way my skin and hair looked and felt from day 1. By the 3rd day using the facial wash and lotion, the trouble areas of my face were no longer there and wrinkles were visibly lessening; the areas on my eye lids and cheeks and oily break out areas have gone away! Even my skin tone has evened out (redness on my cheeks by my nose and mouth) and wrinkles are lessening!! The body soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave a residue and my skin is so soft! The alligator skin on my legs is gone! And my hair has volume again! No longer oily at the roots and brittle at the ends! A little bit goes a long way. Plus, they all smell SO good! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I feel my skin has made a dramatic change since using the soaps and facial cleanser, specifically in the general outlook of my skin and overall problems I was having. The shampoo and conditioner have been really good too. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think at first, but now that I&#x27;m almost through my first bottles, I know my hair is fuller and shinier.</li>
            <li> These products are clean, safe and effective. I am very happy with them!</li>
            <li> i got the package deal so i could test many products at once and save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to get away from all the chemicals i have been using and start over with more natural and organic products. i have tried many products and these are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the face cleaner - cleans my face perfectly. I&#x27;ve honestly never felt so clean.&lt;br /&gt;2. the moisturizer - is my favorite. a little goes a loooong way. absorbs nicely. feels very great. remember, a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;3. shampoo - is also great. leaves my hair feeling very clean and healthy. (super concentrated)&lt;br /&gt;4. conditioner - even better than the shampoo, leaves hair feeling soft and flowing. (super concentrated)&lt;br /&gt;5. soap - whatever, feels good, lathers and cleans well, rinse easily. better than anything you will find at walmart, thats for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are all very amazing products. i highly recommend them. do yourself a favor....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. i have shopped at amazon for years and have never felt compelled to leave a review until now. this line of products is an absolute winner. people should know.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried so many products I cannot use. However, this one is a gem. I love not putting chemicals on my skin so the purity of these products is really nice. I go the organic route as much as possible. I especially like the moisturizer and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Christina Moss Naturals leaves a smoother appearance in the eye area after using the facial moisturizer. The shampoo/conditioner works in my long hair ends very well &amp; is more moisturizing than any other products, &amp; only small amounts. I began with the small size and would like to use the larger size net time. I can go longer periods of time between washing my hair. The facial wash leaves my skin clean but not dry like most cleansers that contain chemicals. Discovering this product after long research &amp; experimentation with other products is a victory for me so I do appreciate the health consciousness in these products. Finally, a company that uses fewer ingredients that is truly organic and natural. Thank you for your special care &amp; for making a difference.</li>
            <li> I just love all these products! About a month ago I started using baking soda and apple cider vinegar for my hair.  I have naturally curly hair, and  read it is better for shampoo and conditioner to be free of sulfate and parabens.  The more I researched I soon realized using baking soda over time can dry hair!!&lt;br /&gt;I started using the facial moisturizer and loved how great my face felt, so I thought I would give the shampoo, conditioner, facial wash,  and body bar a try! I love, love, love all of them!! My face, body, and hair feel clean, but soft as well! No harsh chemicals are in these products that bother me! I have severe allergies also and these products have helped in that area too! I am so happy I finally found something so natural and refreshing.  Thank you so much, and I will definitely keep buying these products!</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner on my 21month old son&#x27;s curly  hair. Leaves his hair clean and soft!</li>
            <li> Love these products!  The moisturizer is wonderful. I really like how it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. It absorbs into your skin &amp; leaves it looking &amp; feeling great!  The face wash is great too. Works really well &amp; you only need a drop the size of a pea to get great lather!  Leaves your skin feeling awesome!  Shampoo &amp; conditioner leave your hair feeling clean &amp; healthy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written earlier reviews, which I don&#x27;t see here.  Because I&#x27;ve mentioned how happy I am with the non-toxic products and how well they work and keep talking about them, I&#x27;ve convinced my husband to try this for his rosacea.  Now he&#x27;s stolen/borrowed my Facial Wash on a permanent basis and I have to purchase another set for ME!  The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair silky and easy to manage.  The cream is the exact right item to use after the Facial Wash.  I couldn&#x27;t live without these products.  No other products compare.  Keep them coming and I hope you expand your inventory.</li>
            <li> Awesome products. I noticed a change in my hair and skin within a week!</li>
            <li> Very good products. Love everything that came with the set</li>
            <li> Cant lie...I love her products. They last a long time too. They&#x27;re all excellent. Face cream healed a blister I got from waxing within 4 days max. Plus no scar either. Great stuff</li>
            <li> not worth the money!!! waste! haven&#x27;t used it since i bought it!!</li>
            <li> We love these face &amp; hair care products!!! They feel and smell so fresh and natural; so silky smooth and good. I bought more packages today for gifts (and for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have straight hair,  curly hair &amp; colored hair in our family. The shampoo &amp; conditioner work well for all of our hair types. Our skin and hair feel clean and soft, not stripped or slick feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite products are the facial wash and facial moisturizer - I find that I take better care of my skin when I love the products, so, Thank you for making these!</li>
            <li> I am more conscious of the products and food going into/on my body - chemicals are no longer acceptable.  I was happy to find this product made with all natural ingredients.  Since I don&#x27;t always have time to create my own, it is nice to find a reasonably priced product.  I tried the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method - it didn&#x27;t work for me.  My hair always felt dry and wirey.  This shampoo and conditioner work well and I feel good that I am not using chemical laden products. The lotion is great too - absorbs well and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Love these products! Every one of them met my expectations in just the second day!! I have very sensitive skin and have always used Johnson and Johnson baby cream on my face and body. I  tell everyone I know about it. I am beyond satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great transaction.</li>
            <li> Instantly my hair and skin feel better. The moisturizer smells like licorice, which I could do without, but it&#x27;s working wonders on my skin and I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days.</li>
            <li> The longer I use the products the better I like it. My skin has been the healthiest it has ever been!</li>
            <li> Best product out there!!!!!!! I highly recommend it. Facial cream and cleaner work amazing! My face feels like baby&#x27;s bottom. Super-soft and beautiful. My face dorsn&#x27;t break out and looks so much younger only after 3 days. Hair products are amazing too. Leaving hair extremely soft and smelling like heaven! Best organic product on the planet!</li>
