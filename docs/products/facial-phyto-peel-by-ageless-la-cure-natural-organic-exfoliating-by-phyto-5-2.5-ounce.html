    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For best results, apply twice a week, or as needed, after the cleanser and toner.</li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to do and does it beautifully.</li>
            <li>My wife who has more use of these products said it was the best exfoliating product she had ever used.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fruity smell which is predominantly banana.</li>
            <li>It is made with fruit oils and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>: The product has a wonderful, herbal scent with strong notes of peppermint that evoke a relaxing</li>
            <li>it for keeping your skin in good condition, but don&#x27;t expect it to take 20 years of your looks.  </li>
            <li>It did leave my skin feeling softer and, surprisingly, moisturized.</li>
            <li>So, so glad I got to try this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I tried this exfoliate, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Much more pleasant on my skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;It&#x27;s awesome!&amp;#34; she said and showed me how nice her face skin feels (always feels nice to me, to be honest).  </li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleanser that pairs wonderfully with Phyto&#x27;s nourishing</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can also find a recipe online to make your own scrub…for pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, yes, yes and quite nicely too (BTW, I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with aging skin).</li>
            <li>I liked the list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, when I saw the price of thisAgeless</li>
            <li>This is a highly effective, once to twice weekly scrub.</li>
            <li>I ended up loving it.</li>
            <li>In this case, the product is more of a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; or intensive cleanser through removal of the very top surface of the skin.</li>
            <li>, I consider it to be a great success.</li>
            <li>that my wife was pleased with this product, and I&#x27;m very pleased that my wife is pleased, so I&#x27;m pleased to give this product a five star rating.</li>
            <li>But the true result were friends going out of their way to tell me how good my skin looks and asking me what I did etc.  </li>
            <li>Love this exfoliating</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many in a variety of price ranges.</li>
            <li>I am currently using a product marketed for men by Baxter, that has a wonderful scent, for my bi-weekly exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the price, if it works well, people will gladly pay for it.</li>
            <li>I also learned that many of these products could help you survive if you’re ever stuck on an island or in a desert without food.</li>
            <li>wind up purchasing many of the products I have received for review from Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice, but not $73.00 worth of nice.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be more like a glycolic peel, but it&#x27;s like the apricot scrubs I used to use years ago.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it at this price because the price point is out of my range.</li>
            <li>One of my wife&#x27;s all time favorite beauty products, I like it as well.</li>
            <li>But with more time to sit, it really felt great.  </li>
            <li>skin appeared to me a bit more even toned and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>would never spend so much on a skin treatment product, but happy to try my review sample</li>
            <li>I refuse to use items that are tested on animals and Phyto 5 is not tested on animals, so it&#x27;s safe for me to use.  </li>
            <li>A much better experience, yet</li>
            <li>This exfoliator reminds me more of a clay type mask that has grains that are more like oat pieces.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it feels more like a scrub than a chemical peel.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on (and how easy it comes off).</li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth surface of clean feeling skin that is worth the investment to those who are looking for a great renewal</li>
            <li>Still they are an important part of a healthy skin care regiment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pleasant to use and certainly does leave the skin feeling clean and taut and fresh-looking.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to use because it is just like a face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still able to use it, but I don&#x27;t enjoy it nearly as much as I would if I liked the way it smelled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ideal for aging and sensitive skin as it provides intense moisture and reveals softer, more glowing skin</li>
            <li>This product smells great and made my skin super soft for days.</li>
            <li>For me that is a huge success, since I cannot use many over the counter cosmetic products without a reaction.</li>
            <li>Massage lightly in a circular motion, adding water if needed.</li>
            <li>This seems to do a great job and feels like it does actually exfoliate, while also cleansing and freshening.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>If you like quality skin care products, I think you will enjoy this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll enjoy this bottle but won&#x27;t purchase myself.</li>
            <li>It has a light minty-Shea scent  that reminds me of in an Aveda facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this with a Pilips rotary scrubber with its exfoliating brush, and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>and wow, did everything feel so good afterwards -</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin rosy, smooth, scrubbed clean, but moisturized.  </li>
            <li>but surprisingly, I had no burning, no pain and no other issues.</li>
            <li>, she reported back that it was one of the best new cosmetics products she had tried in years.</li>
            <li>Good so far as a mild 1-2x/week scrub.  </li>
            <li>Packaged with environmentally friendly patented airless</li>
            <li>Also my face feels really clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This is a great summer product, because summer days can get sweaty and dusty, and this is a good solution for the skin.</li>
            <li>Has just the right level of abrasion to really clean and leave your face feeling like it&#x27;s been polished smooth.</li>
            <li>Really loving the Ageless La Cure Natural product line and this exfoliator is not exception.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh, utilizes organic ingredients, has a pleasant smell, and does not require more than a dime sized dab to cover the entire face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice herbal scent and really makes you face feel soft, smooth, plump and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get to the important question first:</li>
            <li>cloth.&lt;br /&gt;• Certified organic by Ecocert Greenlife, which was the very first certification body to develop standards for &amp;#34;natural and organic cosmetics.&amp;#34; A minimum of 95% of all plant-based ingredients in the formula.</li>
            <li>Phyto-peel has a gentle, pleasant smell -- it reminds me of a cross between cocoa butter and mint.  </li>
            <li>First off most of the ingredients look high quality and non-harmful.</li>
            <li>Others have reported that it has a light, gentle scent.</li>
            <li>huge benefit of La Cure Natural&#x27;s Exfoliating Product is the ecological though that went into it - from the product itself to the packaging.</li>
            <li>This is one of the rare products that works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I deal with sensitive skin so anytime that I&#x27;m able to use a product</li>
            <li>biggest issue with this is that I don&#x27;t spend more than $25 on this type of product from the natural product company from which I order.</li>
            <li>I would estimate its worth to be 2x-3x a baseline product equivalent.</li>
            <li>it has more of a natural scent to it, if that makes any sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different exfoliation products, and this one stands out as providing the most significant balance of exfoliation and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Overall, easily one of the best exfoliating products I&#x27;ve found...only complaint is the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>abrasive shea shell grains, lotus seed powder, and microcrystalline cellulose beads are carried by a viscous cream with the pleasant and slightly medicinal fragrance of cinnamon and cloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrance (from the shea butter and peppermint oil) that I found slightly invigorating.  </li>
            <li>It has that slight grainy texture that makes you feel like you are doing something good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>It left my face smooth and clean, and despite the abrasion and herbal ingredients, did not cause any redness.</li>
            <li>Here is a list of all of the ingredients for those who might be interested: Flower Water, Water, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Shea Nut Shell, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, Microcrystalline Cellulouse &amp; Cellulose Gum, Cetearyl Glucoside, Benzyl Alcohol, Mango Pulp Extract, Spondias Monbin Pulp Extract, Banana Pulp, Tocepherol (Vitamin E), Xanthan Gum, Thyme Oil, Cinnamon Bark Oil, Lotus Seed Powder, Dehydroacetic Acid, Cypress Oil, Cinnamal, Limonene, Lemon Oil, Peppermint Oil, Juniperberry Oil, Romarin Oil, Sage Oil, Linalool, and Eugenol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This mostly botanical facial peel is from the Ageless La cure line by Laboratoire Gibro in Fleurier, Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I did learn there are more than 19 facial scrubs and peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like the simple and elegant packaging.</li>
            <li>Even its airless packaging, which is 100% recyclable, is something to marvel; it really works in sucking all of the product out!</li>
            <li>can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the outcome, which left my skin feeling soft and moist without feeling oily through the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I have no idea what it does, because I do not want to squeeze the contents out more than necessary</li>
            <li>It has a soft, pleasing, organic smell, and it felt my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My face feels as clean and soft as a newborn</li>
            <li>I felt it only fair to do some research on facial peels and scrubs which start in price from $3.00 so that I can help you decide which products to purchase.</li>
            <li>Pleasant but very mild fragrance, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>So for the price, it is most certainly a splurge or luxury product, but even if used prior to special events or occasionally, it would be worth giving a try and having on hand.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that the natural exfoliates or Shea shells are not exactly round, so they may scratch your face over time which may not be good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m uncertain as to whether the product is worth the additional dollars that it costs over the more generic products available widely.</li>
            <li>so the price is more reasonable when you think of how long the product lasts.  </li>
            <li>So excited I won&#x27;t have to cut this one open near the end to eek out every last bit, even though I would have since this is amazing</li>
            <li>So while it feels great, use as directed only use 1-2 times a week or maybe less.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no question that this has the feel of a high-end product and that the comfort level is very high...</li>
            <li>much as I like this product, I certainly wouldn’t pay this price for it.</li>
            <li>The brand&#x27;s product site - Ageless La Cure, says \\&quot;Not recommended on sensitive skin\\&quot;, but my usually quite sensitive skin experienced no ill effects or irritation while using this.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but really don’t like the price tag.</li>
            <li>like I had just been to a really snooty high-end spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I squeezed out a peanut size drop and that did my whole hand and part of my arm.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the fragrance is very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much with each usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would never spend $70 for this product, even though I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>I lightly washed my face prior to use.  </li>
            <li>Gently massage in circular motion for 2 to 3 minutes, adding water as needed.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it and think it will last a while</li>
            <li>This was greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>The scrub/peel definitely made my skin feel softer, firmer, and gave me that nice post facial glow.  </li>
            <li>It says that it is for face care, but I have very sensitive skin, so I first tried it on my hand.  </li>
            <li>I could tell it helped really deep clean my skin.</li>
            <li>The entire package is quite a bit more expensive than the many options available at CVS or Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I apply it by rubbing it on very gently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware that organic and natural products cost money, but this is just not affordable for me.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>, the click will become apparent; for now, I&#x27;m treating this stuff like gold, and it&#x27;s well worth its weight of it.</li>
            <li>I confess I was expecting to write a sarcastic review of this product purely based on its cost, but my wife tried it and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>It visually removed my forhead wrinkles enough that I was impressed that a scrub could have such an effect; I could still see them, but much less prominently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally, it is recommended that you have perfectly round exfoliates for more gentle cleaning.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty huge since I could care less and never asked them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So, when offered this product, I figured this one would surely be problematic - not only does it have shea shells and lotus seeds (potentially aggravating my sensitive skin), it also has cinnamon oil (which I can smell straight out of the tube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use natural products, and there are certain ingredients I avoid.</li>
            <li>That time my face was wet, and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Rinsed off and applied my normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Unique blend of pure shea shells, lotus seeds, essential oils and AHA exfoliate and increase pro-collagen gene expression, beneficial for anti-aging for organic and lasting beauty</li>
            <li>My wife was pleased to see that this was in a tube that’s easy to regulate how much you squeeze out, and she likes to cut open the tube when it’s nearly empty and scrape out the remainder so as not to waste any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>-I have a new moisturized face for hours after.  </li>
            <li>The cream based medium smells slightly earthy (in a really good way) and definitely left my skin feeling softer, smoother, but definitely not oily.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I wanted to try this out.</li>
            <li>The tenfold difference that is actually present would be worthwhile if, over time, this product actually leads to superior facial appearance when compared to results secondary to the generic products.</li>
            <li>No surprise then that she was equally excited to try this facial exfoliating product from the same Ageless product line of this Swiss</li>
            <li>First, there were actual instructions this time!</li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t find it to be special enough to justify the price., and Eugenol.  </li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t find it to be special enough to justify the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just abrasive enough to get a deep clean, but it&#x27;s not harsh.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, faintly medicinal scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, for you guys out there, my better half used this product too and gave it the big thumbs up!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the facial cream&#x27;s main ingredients are arctic berries, the peel is mainly tropical fruit extracts (AHA from banana, mango, and mombin -</li>
            <li>It looked like the fine grains of the shea shell cleared up all dead cells from the pores and my skin was noticeably softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>Helps clear pigmentation spots, reduce wrinkles and fine lines, and firm and plump your skin</li>
            <li>The exfoliation action is effective, but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling raw, exposed and dry.</li>
            <li>However, when I took a wet cloth to it, washing what was on my face off, it left it feeling incredibly smooth, shinny, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that comes from one of the natural oils.</li>
            <li>Not recommended on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thus far, there is no visible difference</li>
            <li>Phyto 5 Phyto-Peel has natural AHA.</li>
            <li>My skin has a glow to it now that all the old skin has been sloughed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;NATURAL: Everything about this product just FEELS organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>So the real question is what you get for your extra $65 or so for this</li>
            <li>La Cure Natural, Organic Exfoliating cream, I thought, &amp;#34;NO WAY!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It smells a lot like cinnamon and is made with all natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am assuming the organic and natural ingredients were the reason I had no issue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the scrub my skin feels energized, alive, it is not harsh...</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and it has not bothered my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling incredibly soft, shinny, and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I was extremely surprised with the product.</li>
            <li>Within the instructions, basically, it says to massage on your skin based on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>Frankly, this surprised the heck out of</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to have REALLY sensitive skin to be bothered by this.</li>
            <li>But for some of us who have had lifelong struggles with overly sensitive skin, just about any price might be worth paying.</li>
            <li>I first used AGELESS LA CURE, I applied it on my face in a dry state.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found that this peel has actually reduced fine lines or dark spots though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, sensitive skin, so I was very hesitant when I tried it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly sensitive to scents, perfumes and fragrance in general and the product did not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>I have used other herbal products and am aware that those ingredients always have natural odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did nothing different except use this exfoliate along with my normal lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>AGELESS LA CURE NATURAL, ORGANIC EXFOLIATING FACIAL</li>
            <li>simply because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price when I can purchase similar products for far less.  </li>
            <li>you can get past the cost, this is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a spluge for a product I know works versus one that is slightly cheaper and may not live up to the expectations.</li>
            <li>If the price were to come down a lot, I would then buy this in the future because I do really like the product.</li>
            <li>It rinsed easily and left no residue behind.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> For best results, apply twice a week, or as needed, after the cleanser and toner.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do and does it beautifully.</li>
            <li> My wife who has more use of these products said it was the best exfoliating product she had ever used.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fruity smell which is predominantly banana.</li>
            <li> It is made with fruit oils and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> : The product has a wonderful, herbal scent with strong notes of peppermint that evoke a relaxing</li>
            <li> it for keeping your skin in good condition, but don&#x27;t expect it to take 20 years of your looks.  </li>
            <li> It did leave my skin feeling softer and, surprisingly, moisturized.</li>
            <li> So, so glad I got to try this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I tried this exfoliate, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.  </li>
            <li> Much more pleasant on my skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s awesome!&amp;#34; she said and showed me how nice her face skin feels (always feels nice to me, to be honest).  </li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser that pairs wonderfully with Phyto&#x27;s nourishing</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can also find a recipe online to make your own scrub…for pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, yes, yes and quite nicely too (BTW, I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with aging skin).</li>
            <li> I liked the list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, when I saw the price of thisAgeless</li>
            <li> This is a highly effective, once to twice weekly scrub.</li>
            <li> I ended up loving it.</li>
            <li> In this case, the product is more of a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; or intensive cleanser through removal of the very top surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> , I consider it to be a great success.</li>
            <li> that my wife was pleased with this product, and I&#x27;m very pleased that my wife is pleased, so I&#x27;m pleased to give this product a five star rating.</li>
            <li> But the true result were friends going out of their way to tell me how good my skin looks and asking me what I did etc.  </li>
            <li> Love this exfoliating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many in a variety of price ranges.</li>
            <li> I am currently using a product marketed for men by Baxter, that has a wonderful scent, for my bi-weekly exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the price, if it works well, people will gladly pay for it.</li>
            <li> I also learned that many of these products could help you survive if you’re ever stuck on an island or in a desert without food.</li>
            <li> wind up purchasing many of the products I have received for review from Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nice, but not $73.00 worth of nice.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be more like a glycolic peel, but it&#x27;s like the apricot scrubs I used to use years ago.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it at this price because the price point is out of my range.</li>
            <li> One of my wife&#x27;s all time favorite beauty products, I like it as well.</li>
            <li> But with more time to sit, it really felt great.  </li>
            <li> skin appeared to me a bit more even toned and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> would never spend so much on a skin treatment product, but happy to try my review sample</li>
            <li> I refuse to use items that are tested on animals and Phyto 5 is not tested on animals, so it&#x27;s safe for me to use.  </li>
            <li> A much better experience, yet</li>
            <li> This exfoliator reminds me more of a clay type mask that has grains that are more like oat pieces.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it feels more like a scrub than a chemical peel.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on (and how easy it comes off).</li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth surface of clean feeling skin that is worth the investment to those who are looking for a great renewal</li>
            <li> Still they are an important part of a healthy skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pleasant to use and certainly does leave the skin feeling clean and taut and fresh-looking.  </li>
            <li> It is really easy to use because it is just like a face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still able to use it, but I don&#x27;t enjoy it nearly as much as I would if I liked the way it smelled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ideal for aging and sensitive skin as it provides intense moisture and reveals softer, more glowing skin</li>
            <li> This product smells great and made my skin super soft for days.</li>
            <li> For me that is a huge success, since I cannot use many over the counter cosmetic products without a reaction.</li>
            <li> Massage lightly in a circular motion, adding water if needed.</li>
            <li> This seems to do a great job and feels like it does actually exfoliate, while also cleansing and freshening.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> If you like quality skin care products, I think you will enjoy this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll enjoy this bottle but won&#x27;t purchase myself.</li>
            <li> It has a light minty-Shea scent  that reminds me of in an Aveda facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this with a Pilips rotary scrubber with its exfoliating brush, and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> and wow, did everything feel so good afterwards -</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin rosy, smooth, scrubbed clean, but moisturized.  </li>
            <li> but surprisingly, I had no burning, no pain and no other issues.</li>
            <li> , she reported back that it was one of the best new cosmetics products she had tried in years.</li>
            <li> Good so far as a mild 1-2x/week scrub.  </li>
            <li> Packaged with environmentally friendly patented airless</li>
            <li> Also my face feels really clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> This is a great summer product, because summer days can get sweaty and dusty, and this is a good solution for the skin.</li>
            <li> Has just the right level of abrasion to really clean and leave your face feeling like it&#x27;s been polished smooth.</li>
            <li> Really loving the Ageless La Cure Natural product line and this exfoliator is not exception.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh, utilizes organic ingredients, has a pleasant smell, and does not require more than a dime sized dab to cover the entire face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice herbal scent and really makes you face feel soft, smooth, plump and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get to the important question first:</li>
            <li> cloth.&lt;br /&gt;• Certified organic by Ecocert Greenlife, which was the very first certification body to develop standards for &amp;#34;natural and organic cosmetics.&amp;#34; A minimum of 95% of all plant-based ingredients in the formula.</li>
            <li> Phyto-peel has a gentle, pleasant smell -- it reminds me of a cross between cocoa butter and mint.  </li>
            <li> First off most of the ingredients look high quality and non-harmful.</li>
            <li> Others have reported that it has a light, gentle scent.</li>
            <li> huge benefit of La Cure Natural&#x27;s Exfoliating Product is the ecological though that went into it - from the product itself to the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is one of the rare products that works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I deal with sensitive skin so anytime that I&#x27;m able to use a product</li>
            <li> biggest issue with this is that I don&#x27;t spend more than $25 on this type of product from the natural product company from which I order.</li>
            <li> I would estimate its worth to be 2x-3x a baseline product equivalent.</li>
            <li> it has more of a natural scent to it, if that makes any sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different exfoliation products, and this one stands out as providing the most significant balance of exfoliation and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Overall, easily one of the best exfoliating products I&#x27;ve found...only complaint is the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> abrasive shea shell grains, lotus seed powder, and microcrystalline cellulose beads are carried by a viscous cream with the pleasant and slightly medicinal fragrance of cinnamon and cloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice light fragrance (from the shea butter and peppermint oil) that I found slightly invigorating.  </li>
            <li> It has that slight grainy texture that makes you feel like you are doing something good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> It left my face smooth and clean, and despite the abrasion and herbal ingredients, did not cause any redness.</li>
            <li> Here is a list of all of the ingredients for those who might be interested: Flower Water, Water, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Shea Nut Shell, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, Microcrystalline Cellulouse &amp; Cellulose Gum, Cetearyl Glucoside, Benzyl Alcohol, Mango Pulp Extract, Spondias Monbin Pulp Extract, Banana Pulp, Tocepherol (Vitamin E), Xanthan Gum, Thyme Oil, Cinnamon Bark Oil, Lotus Seed Powder, Dehydroacetic Acid, Cypress Oil, Cinnamal, Limonene, Lemon Oil, Peppermint Oil, Juniperberry Oil, Romarin Oil, Sage Oil, Linalool, and Eugenol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This mostly botanical facial peel is from the Ageless La cure line by Laboratoire Gibro in Fleurier, Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I did learn there are more than 19 facial scrubs and peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like the simple and elegant packaging.</li>
            <li> Even its airless packaging, which is 100% recyclable, is something to marvel; it really works in sucking all of the product out!</li>
            <li> can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the outcome, which left my skin feeling soft and moist without feeling oily through the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what it does, because I do not want to squeeze the contents out more than necessary</li>
            <li> It has a soft, pleasing, organic smell, and it felt my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My face feels as clean and soft as a newborn</li>
            <li> I felt it only fair to do some research on facial peels and scrubs which start in price from $3.00 so that I can help you decide which products to purchase.</li>
            <li> Pleasant but very mild fragrance, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So for the price, it is most certainly a splurge or luxury product, but even if used prior to special events or occasionally, it would be worth giving a try and having on hand.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the natural exfoliates or Shea shells are not exactly round, so they may scratch your face over time which may not be good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m uncertain as to whether the product is worth the additional dollars that it costs over the more generic products available widely.</li>
            <li> so the price is more reasonable when you think of how long the product lasts.  </li>
            <li> So excited I won&#x27;t have to cut this one open near the end to eek out every last bit, even though I would have since this is amazing</li>
            <li> So while it feels great, use as directed only use 1-2 times a week or maybe less.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no question that this has the feel of a high-end product and that the comfort level is very high...</li>
            <li> much as I like this product, I certainly wouldn’t pay this price for it.</li>
            <li> The brand&#x27;s product site - Ageless La Cure, says \\&quot;Not recommended on sensitive skin\\&quot;, but my usually quite sensitive skin experienced no ill effects or irritation while using this.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but really don’t like the price tag.</li>
            <li> like I had just been to a really snooty high-end spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I squeezed out a peanut size drop and that did my whole hand and part of my arm.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the fragrance is very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much with each usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would never spend $70 for this product, even though I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> I lightly washed my face prior to use.  </li>
            <li> Gently massage in circular motion for 2 to 3 minutes, adding water as needed.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it and think it will last a while</li>
            <li> This was greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> The scrub/peel definitely made my skin feel softer, firmer, and gave me that nice post facial glow.  </li>
            <li> It says that it is for face care, but I have very sensitive skin, so I first tried it on my hand.  </li>
            <li> I could tell it helped really deep clean my skin.</li>
            <li> The entire package is quite a bit more expensive than the many options available at CVS or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I apply it by rubbing it on very gently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m aware that organic and natural products cost money, but this is just not affordable for me.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> , the click will become apparent; for now, I&#x27;m treating this stuff like gold, and it&#x27;s well worth its weight of it.</li>
            <li> I confess I was expecting to write a sarcastic review of this product purely based on its cost, but my wife tried it and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> It visually removed my forhead wrinkles enough that I was impressed that a scrub could have such an effect; I could still see them, but much less prominently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally, it is recommended that you have perfectly round exfoliates for more gentle cleaning.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty huge since I could care less and never asked them.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So, when offered this product, I figured this one would surely be problematic - not only does it have shea shells and lotus seeds (potentially aggravating my sensitive skin), it also has cinnamon oil (which I can smell straight out of the tube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use natural products, and there are certain ingredients I avoid.</li>
            <li> That time my face was wet, and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Rinsed off and applied my normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Unique blend of pure shea shells, lotus seeds, essential oils and AHA exfoliate and increase pro-collagen gene expression, beneficial for anti-aging for organic and lasting beauty</li>
            <li> My wife was pleased to see that this was in a tube that’s easy to regulate how much you squeeze out, and she likes to cut open the tube when it’s nearly empty and scrape out the remainder so as not to waste any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -I have a new moisturized face for hours after.  </li>
            <li> The cream based medium smells slightly earthy (in a really good way) and definitely left my skin feeling softer, smoother, but definitely not oily.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I wanted to try this out.</li>
            <li> The tenfold difference that is actually present would be worthwhile if, over time, this product actually leads to superior facial appearance when compared to results secondary to the generic products.</li>
            <li> No surprise then that she was equally excited to try this facial exfoliating product from the same Ageless product line of this Swiss</li>
            <li> First, there were actual instructions this time!</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t find it to be special enough to justify the price., and Eugenol.  </li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t find it to be special enough to justify the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just abrasive enough to get a deep clean, but it&#x27;s not harsh.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, faintly medicinal scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, for you guys out there, my better half used this product too and gave it the big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the facial cream&#x27;s main ingredients are arctic berries, the peel is mainly tropical fruit extracts (AHA from banana, mango, and mombin -</li>
            <li> It looked like the fine grains of the shea shell cleared up all dead cells from the pores and my skin was noticeably softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Helps clear pigmentation spots, reduce wrinkles and fine lines, and firm and plump your skin</li>
            <li> The exfoliation action is effective, but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling raw, exposed and dry.</li>
            <li> However, when I took a wet cloth to it, washing what was on my face off, it left it feeling incredibly smooth, shinny, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that comes from one of the natural oils.</li>
            <li> Not recommended on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thus far, there is no visible difference</li>
            <li> Phyto 5 Phyto-Peel has natural AHA.</li>
            <li> My skin has a glow to it now that all the old skin has been sloughed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;NATURAL: Everything about this product just FEELS organic and all natural.</li>
            <li> So the real question is what you get for your extra $65 or so for this</li>
            <li> La Cure Natural, Organic Exfoliating cream, I thought, &amp;#34;NO WAY!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It smells a lot like cinnamon and is made with all natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am assuming the organic and natural ingredients were the reason I had no issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the scrub my skin feels energized, alive, it is not harsh...</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and it has not bothered my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling incredibly soft, shinny, and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I was extremely surprised with the product.</li>
            <li> Within the instructions, basically, it says to massage on your skin based on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> Frankly, this surprised the heck out of</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to have REALLY sensitive skin to be bothered by this.</li>
            <li> But for some of us who have had lifelong struggles with overly sensitive skin, just about any price might be worth paying.</li>
            <li> I first used AGELESS LA CURE, I applied it on my face in a dry state.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found that this peel has actually reduced fine lines or dark spots though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, sensitive skin, so I was very hesitant when I tried it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly sensitive to scents, perfumes and fragrance in general and the product did not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> I have used other herbal products and am aware that those ingredients always have natural odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did nothing different except use this exfoliate along with my normal lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AGELESS LA CURE NATURAL, ORGANIC EXFOLIATING FACIAL</li>
            <li> simply because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price when I can purchase similar products for far less.  </li>
            <li> you can get past the cost, this is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth a spluge for a product I know works versus one that is slightly cheaper and may not live up to the expectations.</li>
            <li> If the price were to come down a lot, I would then buy this in the future because I do really like the product.</li>
            <li> It rinsed easily and left no residue behind.  </li>
            <li> B008F7PAWS Phyto 5 Natural, Organic Extreme Hydrating and Nourishing Facial Cream, 1.75 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I would use a cheaper natural or organic exfoliator and spend the money on their Extreme Cream instead.</li>
            <li> The Phyto 5 mainly stands out in its use of shea shells to help remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> This scrub made my skin feel very soft, and slightly numbed my lips while I was cleansing.</li>
            <li> The first time I think I rubbed too hard and</li>
            <li> I liked the smell and did not find it unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I used a small amount of this with some water and felt a gentle tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was left on for at least twenty minutes, and I could start feeling the soft and natural oil result.  </li>
            <li> For now, I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to tell if this is the case.</li>
            <li> But the big plus for me is since I have normally dry skin</li>
            <li> The little beads that create the exfoliating action are bigger than what you might have used with other products, but this one doesn&#x27;t rip your skin up either.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only ever tried one other thing from Phyto5 - the Clay Mask.</li>
            <li> The texture is less creamy and more clumpy (a little) and it&#x27;s less of a scrub type product than a thick lotion that goes on and comes off.</li>
            <li> Ageless Phyto-Peel by Phyto 5 is a creamy, energizing and exfoliating peel that removes dead skin cells with its lotus, shea shell grains and natural AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid) ingredients from tropical fruits such as banana, mango and mombin plump and leaves the skin firm, plump and</li>
            <li> Ageless Phyto-Peel by Phyto 5 is a creamy, energizing and exfoliating peel that removes dead skin cells with its lotus, shea shell grains and natural AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid) ingredients from tropical fruits such as banana, mango and mombin plump and leaves the skin firm, plump and moist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;A small amount, about the size of a coffee bean, is enough to cover the entire face.</li>
            <li> Other peel/exfoliators tend to leave my already dry skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT ONLY TAKES A LITTLE:</li>
            <li> The trick is to use only a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face did get a little bit red</li>
            <li> If they cut the list price in half, I would use it regularly and explore their other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to mechanical exfoliators, it also contains alpha hydroxy acids derived from fruit to remove dead skin cells, as well as moisturizing and conditioning ingredients such as glycerin, jojoba oil, shea butter, and vitamin E.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful not to be overly aggressive with scrubbing, as it might leave the skin raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price does not affect my ratings, but curiosity led me to calculate the price per pound:  $467.20 when a 2.5 oz.</li>
            <li> However, a few days later, I repeated the process, but got a phone call.  </li>

            <li> I find this less irritating than microderm abrasion that includes volcanic crystals.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dull.  </li>

            <li> Still, there are less expensive products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> Not a good experience.</li>

            <li> Applying moisturizer felt like it was merely blending with my skin and not just layering on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> an expensive scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but at over $70 a tube it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s obviously crazy about it, and I have a feeling Santa is going to put some in her stocking this Christmas.</li>
            <li> The cost -  $70 is insane.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this exfoliating cream.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice herbal scent and really makes you face feel soft, smooth, plump and hydrated.  Also my face feels really clean afterwards.  But the big plus for me is since I have normally dry skin -I have a new moisturized face for hours after.  The only issue I have is that the natural exfoliates or Shea shells are not exactly round, so they may scratch your face over time which may not be good.  Normally, it is recommended that you have perfectly round exfoliates for more gentle cleaning.  So while it feels great, use as directed only use 1-2 times a week or maybe less.  Another deterrent is that it is more expensive than my regular exfoliaters.&lt;br /&gt;4  1/2 stars  I have never used a cleaner or exfoliater that has hydrated my face so well..</li>
            <li> This is one of the rare products that works as advertised. Has just the right level of abrasion to really clean and leave your face feeling like it&#x27;s been polished smooth. Pleasant but very mild fragrance, and a little goes a long way. Overall, easily one of the best exfoliating products I&#x27;ve found...only complaint is the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past the cost, this is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I confess I was expecting to write a sarcastic review of this product purely based on its cost, but my wife tried it and she absolutely loves it.  &amp;#34;It&#x27;s awesome!&amp;#34; she said and showed me how nice her face skin feels (always feels nice to me, to be honest).  &amp;#34;But do you realize what they charge for it?&amp;#34; I asked, not sure if I had told her.  &amp;#34;$71,&amp;#34; she said, &amp;#34;I know, you told me.  Can you get any more?&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Not for free,&amp;#34; I said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says you are only supposed to use it twice a month and then only sparingly.  She thinks she would never pay $71 for it but she&#x27;s obviously crazy about it, and I have a feeling Santa is going to put some in her stocking this Christmas.</li>
            <li> I deal with sensitive skin so anytime that I&#x27;m able to use a product and it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, I consider it to be a great success. This product did not cause me any problems in terms of tolerating it on my face. For that, I would give it four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrubs and exfoliating creams/gels vary in price. I&#x27;ve tried many in a variety of price ranges. This is probably the most expensive one that I have ever tested. Yes, there are differences in ingredients. Some use beads, others use walnut shells. This one uses sea shells. Still essentially they do similiar things. They scrub dead skin off the face and improve circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No exfoliant works miracles. Still they are an important part of a healthy skin care regiment. I am currently using a product marketed for men by Baxter, that has a wonderful scent, for my bi-weekly exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is where I have issues with this product. Others have reported that it has a light, gentle scent. I didn&#x27;t share their experience. I personally found the peppermint oil to be overpowering. At least I think it was the peppermint oil. I&#x27;m uncertain. This scrub has a slightly &amp;#34;menthol&amp;#34; odor that I found a bit off-putting. I&#x27;m still able to use it, but I don&#x27;t enjoy it nearly as much as I would if I liked the way it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that both the product description and website list only the essential ingredients. Here is a list of all of the ingredients for those who might be interested: Flower Water, Water, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Shea Nut Shell, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, Microcrystalline Cellulouse &amp; Cellulose Gum, Cetearyl Glucoside, Benzyl Alcohol, Mango Pulp Extract, Spondias Monbin Pulp Extract, Banana Pulp, Tocepherol (Vitamin E), Xanthan Gum, Thyme Oil, Cinnamon Bark Oil, Lotus Seed Powder, Dehydroacetic Acid, Cypress Oil, Cinnamal, Limonene, Lemon Oil, Peppermint Oil, Juniperberry Oil, Romarin Oil, Sage Oil, Linalool, and Eugenol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often purchase products after testing them. I think I&#x27;ll pass on repurchasing this when I run out. I personally didn&#x27;t find it to be special enough to justify the price., and Eugenol.  I often purchase products after testing them.

            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I wanted to try this out. I use natural products, and there are certain ingredients I avoid. I was happy to see that this product did not contain mineral oil, parabens, artificial preservatives or artificial fragrance. It left my face smooth and clean, and despite the abrasion and herbal ingredients, did not cause any redness. For me that is a huge success, since I cannot use many over the counter cosmetic products without a reaction. The abrasion comes from shea nut shells. I find this less irritating than microderm abrasion that includes volcanic crystals. Much more pleasant on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells a bit like cinnamon, and cinnamon oil is one of the ingredients. It also reminded me just a bit of the Noxema I used as a teen, which is I guess a bit of a menthol-like fragrance. I&#x27;m guessing that comes from one of the natural oils. Maybe the sage. I liked the smell and did not find it unpleasant. I have used other herbal products and am aware that those ingredients always have natural odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with this is that I don&#x27;t spend more than $25 on this type of product from the natural product company from which I order. I am not convinced to spend three times that amount on this. I&#x27;m aware that organic and natural products cost money, but this is just not affordable for me.&lt;br /&gt;If it was in my price range, I would definitely consider adding this line to my considerations when purchasing skin products.</li>
            <li> This mostly botanical facial peel is from the Ageless La cure line by Laboratoire Gibro in Fleurier, Switzerland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The abrasive shea shell grains, lotus seed powder, and microcrystalline cellulose beads are carried by a viscous cream with the pleasant and slightly medicinal fragrance of cinnamon and cloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to mechanical exfoliators, it also contains alpha hydroxy acids derived from fruit to remove dead skin cells, as well as moisturizing and conditioning ingredients such as glycerin, jojoba oil, shea butter, and vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pleasant to use and certainly does leave the skin feeling clean and taut and fresh-looking.  Be careful not to be overly aggressive with scrubbing, as it might leave the skin raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price does not affect my ratings, but curiosity led me to calculate the price per pound:  $467.20 when a 2.5 oz. tube is $73.00, as it is at this time.  Plus tax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  The Amazon page lists only the \\&quot;essential\\&quot; ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  Twice a week and after cleansing, apply a small amount on the entire face, neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; for two to three minutes. Massage lightly in a circular motion, adding water if needed. Then rinse well with water, sponges, or facial cloth. Continue with the application of Ageless Skin Toner. Not recommended on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Lippia citriodora (verbena flower water), aqua (water), octyldodecanol, caprylic/capric triglyceride, butyrospermum parkii (shea) nut shell, glycerin (vegetal), glyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearic acid, Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) oil, Butyrospermum parkii butter (shea butter), microcrystalline cellulose and cellulose gum, cetearyl glucoside, benzyl alcohol, Mangifera indica (mango) pulp extract, Spondias mombin pulp extract, Musa sapientum (banana) pulp extract, tocopherol (vitamin E), xanthan gum, Thymus mastichina (thyme) oil, Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon bark) oil, Nelumbo nucifera (lotus seed powder), dehydroacetic acid, Cupressus sempervirens (cypress) oil, cinnamal, limonene, Citrus limonum (lemon) oil, Mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, Juniperus communis (juniper berry) oil, Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) oil, Salvia officinalis (sage) oil, linalool, eugenol.era (lotus seed powder), dehydroacetic acid, Cupressus sempervirens (cypress) oil, cinnamal, limonene, Citrus limonum (lemon) oil, Mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, Juniperus communis (juniper berry) oil, Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) oil, Salvia officinalis (sage) oil, linalool, eugenol.</li>
            <li> Phyto-peel has a gentle, pleasant smell -- it reminds me of a cross between cocoa butter and mint.  And one you wash it off, the odor is barely present.  In the lotion are little dark brown specs about the size of grains of sand that act as the abrasive.  I&#x27;ve been using this facial on just one side of my face for two weeks.  Thus far, there is no visible difference but I will update this review as I go.  After using the product, my skin tingles a little likely due to working the abrasive bits into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the price, if it works well, people will gladly pay for it.</li>
            <li> When I recently gave my wife some [[ASIN:B008F7PAWS Phyto 5 Natural, Organic Extreme Hydrating and Nourishing Facial Cream, 1.75 Ounce]], she reported back that it was one of the best new cosmetics products she had tried in years. No surprise then that she was equally excited to try this facial exfoliating product from the same Ageless product line of this Swiss brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the facial cream&#x27;s main ingredients are arctic berries, the peel is mainly tropical fruit extracts (AHA from banana, mango, and mombin - whatever that is) and grains of lotus and shea shell (whatever that is). All those combine into a fragrant cream with just a hint of cinnamon. Here&#x27;s what my wife thought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A small amount, about the size of a coffee bean, is enough to cover the entire face. After following the instructions to massage in a circular motion, I rinsed my face well with water. Then voila! It looked like the fine grains of the shea shell cleared up all dead cells from the pores and my skin was noticeably softer and smoother. With other exfoliating creams, I often have a problem of the heavy grains lingering and sometimes getting in my eyes, which needless to say is quite irritating. I don&#x27;t know what is different about Phyto&#x27;s grains (other than they are shea shell), but I never experienced that issue while using this product. The brand&#x27;s product site - Ageless La Cure, says \\&quot;Not recommended on sensitive skin\\&quot;, but my usually quite sensitive skin experienced no ill effects or irritation while using this. This is a great facial cleanser that pairs wonderfully with Phyto&#x27;s nourishing cream.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s obvious that my wife was pleased with this product, and I&#x27;m very pleased that my wife is pleased, so I&#x27;m pleased to give this product a five star rating. (Now I&#x27;m going to go Google \\&quot;mombin\\&quot;, and maybe \\&quot;shea shell\\&quot; while I&#x27;m at it.)</li>
            <li> Good so far as a mild 1-2x/week scrub.  Non-irratiating.</li>
            <li> Phyto 5 Phyto-Peel has natural AHA. It comes in a 2.5 tube. It has a pleasant, faintly medicinal scent. A little goes along way. I squeezed out a blob the size of a dime and messaged it in circular motion, according to directions. My face feels as clean and soft as a newborn’s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phyto-Peel boasts of ‘gene expression,’  ‘pro collagen’ and of clearing pigmentation spots. I admit I do not know what this means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s an ingredients list that covers three fourths of the side of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I received the $73.00 Phyto-Peel in exchange for a review I felt it only fair to do some research on facial peels and scrubs which start in price from $3.00 so that I can help you decide which products to purchase. I was curious what makes a low cost vs. an expensive product. I never found out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a cursory glance online, I did learn there are more than 19 facial scrubs and peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also learned that many of these products could help you survive if you’re ever stuck on an island or in a desert without food. Their ingredients are a veritable salad bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phyto-Peel contains mango and banana. Other facial scrubs contain: grapefruit, pineapple, walnuts, rice, grains, oatmeal, apricot, oat and almond flour, green tea, strawberry seeds, cranberry, papaya, raspberry enzymes, sea salt, citrus, tea, tree oil and honey almond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a brand of scrub called &#x27;Triumph and Diaster Rock and Roll Suicide.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also find a recipe online to make your own scrub…for pennies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wind up purchasing many of the products I have received for review from Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this one. It is nice, but not $73.00 worth of nice.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but really don’t like the price tag. It has a pleasant fruity smell which is predominantly banana. This seems to do a great job and feels like it does actually exfoliate, while also cleansing and freshening. It leaves your skin feeling silky and moisturized afterwards whereas a lot of exfoliators tend to leave your skin dryer after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the simple and elegant packaging. My wife was pleased to see that this was in a tube that’s easy to regulate how much you squeeze out, and she likes to cut open the tube when it’s nearly empty and scrape out the remainder so as not to waste any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I like this product, I certainly wouldn’t pay this price for it. I would use a cheaper natural or organic exfoliator and spend the money on their Extreme Cream instead.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  I&#x27; m in my 60&#x27;s with combination skin with some beneath the surface acne.  My skin tends to be dull.  I used a small amount of this with some water and felt a gentle tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely brightened my complexion while also feeling like it added a touch of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that there were no directions in English about how to use it.  It also is expensive so it was a treat to receive it through Vine.  If you like quality skin care products, I think you will enjoy this.  I often use Skinceuticals and PCA so this is along that line in terms of quality.</li>
            <li> Really loving the Ageless La Cure Natural product line and this exfoliator is not exception. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCENT: The product has a wonderful, herbal scent with strong notes of peppermint that evoke a relaxing spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT ONLY TAKES A LITTLE: Yes it&#x27;s expensive; however, I use a portion about the size of a dime twice per week, so I expect this tube will last the better part of six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LEAVES SKIN RADIANT: My skin has a glow to it now that all the old skin has been sloughed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NATURAL: Everything about this product just FEELS organic and all natural. I love the way it goes on (and how easy it comes off).</li>
            <li> Just for the record, no one can be &amp;#34;ageless.&amp;#34;  This product seems to appeal to people who are trying to defeat the aging process - and there are a lot  of them.  There is nothing wrong with aging gracefully, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for a skin exfoliator, it works well.  It has that slight grainy texture that makes you feel like you are doing something good for your skin.  It is not a mask, it is for putting on and washing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it for keeping your skin in good condition, but don&#x27;t expect it to take 20 years of your looks.  It won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be more like a glycolic peel, but it&#x27;s like the apricot scrubs I used to use years ago. In place of the ground apricot pits are ground Shea shells. This scrub made my skin feel very soft, and slightly numbed my lips while I was cleansing. This product smells great and made my skin super soft for days. It is really easy to use because it is just like a face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, but I don&#x27;t love it at this price because the price point is out of my range. I&#x27;ll enjoy this bottle but won&#x27;t purchase myself.</li>
            <li> So, so glad I got to try this product! Let&#x27;s get to the important question first: Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, yes, yes and quite nicely too (BTW, I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with aging skin). I&#x27;ve used a lot of different exfoliation products, and this one stands out as providing the most significant balance of exfoliation and moisturizing. The exfoliation action is effective, but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling raw, exposed and dry. The cream based medium smells slightly earthy (in a really good way) and definitely left my skin feeling softer, smoother, but definitely not oily. I used this all over my body and wow, did everything feel so good afterwards - like I had just been to a really snooty high-end spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge benefit of La Cure Natural&#x27;s Exfoliating Product is the ecological though that went into it - from the product itself to the packaging. I really, really appreciate that this product doesn&#x27;t use the nasty, environmentally unfriendly little plastic bits to do the work (if it did, it would only get 1 star even it made my skin look and feel as though it were baby skin!). This product uses &amp;#34;mircocrystalline cellulose&amp;#34; which is made from wood pulp. The little beads that create the exfoliating action are bigger than what you might have used with other products, but this one doesn&#x27;t rip your skin up either. The rest of the ingredients are also high-quality, organic plant extracts, not bizarre chemically composed mystery bits. Even its airless packaging, which is 100% recyclable, is something to marvel; it really works in sucking all of the product out! So excited I won&#x27;t have to cut this one open near the end to eek out every last bit, even though I would have since this is amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, for you guys out there, my better half used this product too and gave it the big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> One of my wife&#x27;s all time favorite beauty products, I like it as well. First off most of the ingredients look high quality and non-harmful. Not an insignificant consideration for today&#x27;s cosmetics. I liked the list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second it works, no first use. I could tell it helped really deep clean my skin. My wife who has more use of these products said it was the best exfoliating product she had ever used. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is one of several high-end facial product lines that falls in the middle of a clean-tone-exfoliate-treat-hydrate process. The entire package is quite a bit more expensive than the many options available at CVS or Walgreens. So the real question is what you get for your extra $65 or so for this exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is described by the manufacturer as a &amp;#34;peel.&amp;#34; To me, that applies to products that you apply to your skin, leave on for a few minutes, and then peel off or otherwise remove. In this case, the product is more of a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; or intensive cleanser through removal of the very top surface of the skin. It is not harsh, utilizes organic ingredients, has a pleasant smell, and does not require more than a dime sized dab to cover the entire face. It did not leave my skin red, as some exfoliants do, nor did it cause any sense of discomfort, as salicylic acid cleansers can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the outcome, which left my skin feeling soft and moist without feeling oily through the rest of the day. I&#x27;m uncertain as to whether the product is worth the additional dollars that it costs over the more generic products available widely. There&#x27;s no question that this has the feel of a high-end product and that the comfort level is very high...I would estimate its worth to be 2x-3x a baseline product equivalent. The tenfold difference that is actually present would be worthwhile if, over time, this product actually leads to superior facial appearance when compared to results secondary to the generic products. For now, I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to tell if this is the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, when I saw the price of thisAgeless La Cure Natural, Organic Exfoliating cream, I thought, &amp;#34;NO WAY!&amp;#34;.  It says that it is for face care, but I have very sensitive skin, so I first tried it on my hand.  It was noticeably different which hand I used the cream on.  It made my hand feel refreshed and it made the skin softer to the touch.  With this cream, a little bit goes a long way.  I squeezed out a peanut size drop and that did my whole hand and part of my arm.  I then used a circular motion with some pressure to mix it into the skin.  I let it sit on my skin for a minute or so and rinsed it off.  It rinsed easily and left no residue behind.  Additionally, the fragrance is very pleasing.  It smells a lot like cinnamon and is made with all natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this product is expensive, I think it will last a long time.  According to the directions you apply this to your face once or twice a week and it doesn&#x27;t take much with each usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to all women, both young and aged.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, once you hit your forties, it takes a village of products to fight the aging process.  Moisturizers, wrinkle creams, eye gels, Vitamin C treatments, scrubs, peels...  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  This  exfoliating cleanser is one of my favorites. It leaves my skin rosy, smooth, scrubbed clean, but moisturized.  It has a light minty-Shea scent  that reminds me of in an Aveda facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two complaints are:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The cost -  $70 is insane.  I would never spend $70 for this product, even though I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;2.  There are no instructions printed on the back of the tube, so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m supposed to be using it in the morning at night or both times.  Should I use get once a week or every day?</li>
            <li> Yes the price points of these products are a bit obnoxious, however, once you start receiving compliments, you may rethink the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this exfoliate, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.  I lightly washed my face prior to use.  Applied a generous amount to my face, scrubbed in circular motions, and left on for about ten minutes.  Rinsed off and applied my normal moisturizer.  I didn&#x27;t feel or see anything different.  However, a few days later, I repeated the process, but got a phone call.  It was left on for at least twenty minutes, and I could start feeling the soft and natural oil result.  Before it just felt like a typical apricot scrub.  But with more time to sit, it really felt great.  It was also easier to rinse the second time.  Applying moisturizer felt like it was merely blending with my skin and not just layering on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin appeared to me a bit more even toned and refreshed.  Obviously the scrub aspect bring out your color, but there was a definite change in softness and radiance.  But the true result were friends going out of their way to tell me how good my skin looks and asking me what I did etc.  That&#x27;s pretty huge since I could care less and never asked them.  I did nothing different except use this exfoliate along with my normal lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am highly sensitive to scents, perfumes and fragrance in general and the product did not bother me at all.  I am assuming the organic and natural ingredients were the reason I had no issue.  So for the price, it is most certainly a splurge or luxury product, but even if used prior to special events or occasionally, it would be worth giving a try and having on hand.  If they cut the list price in half, I would use it regularly and explore their other products.</li>
            <li> This is a highly effective, once to twice weekly scrub. I use this with a Pilips rotary scrubber with its exfoliating brush, and the results are fantastic. It visually removed my forhead wrinkles enough that I was impressed that a scrub could have such an effect; I could still see them, but much less prominently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mixture of fruit acids, and shea shell bits is a creamy, clay brown, textured blend. A little goes a long way, and at its price point, it would have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never spend so much on a skin treatment product, but happy to try my review sample, I can attest to its effectiveness. It leaves a smooth surface of clean feeling skin that is worth the investment to those who are looking for a great renewal product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air-free tube has a dot on the back, with &amp;#34;click here&amp;#34; written over it. I have no idea what it does, because I do not want to squeeze the contents out more than necessary, so I guess it&#x27;s just a breather hole of some sort, or perhaps when the tube nears empty, the click will become apparent; for now, I&#x27;m treating this stuff like gold, and it&#x27;s well worth its weight of it.</li>
            <li> This is an organic exfoliating scrub from Switzerland...an expensive scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the scent to be pleasing, not overbearing...it has more of a natural scent to it, if that makes any sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the scrub my skin feels energized, alive, it is not harsh...I have fairly sensitive skin and it has not bothered my skin at all.  I have been using the product 2 times a week, and my skin definitely feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 3 stars...simply because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price when I can purchase similar products for far less.  If the price were to come down a lot, I would then buy this in the future because I do really like the product.</li>
            <li> This exfoliating cream is a little different than other creams I have used.  Previously I used the Juice Beauty green apple peel.  The Phyto 5 is different in that instead of just a chemical peel, it has little bits of shea shell that help scrub off dead skin.  I estimate that I use about a nickel sizes amount of this peel for each use.  I have sensitive skin, so I apply it by rubbing it on very gently.  The first time I think I rubbed too hard and my face felt like it was burning for a couple hours afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the effect this peel has on my skin.  I find that my skins feels softer and plumper after each application.  I use it about 1x per week.  I haven&#x27;t found that this peel has actually reduced fine lines or dark spots though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product is expensive, I anticipate it lasting at least 6 months if I use it once a week.  I refuse to use items that are tested on animals and Phyto 5 is not tested on animals, so it&#x27;s safe for me to use.  I know I usually have to pay a premium to get products not tested on animals.  Still, there are less expensive products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals.  The Phyto 5 mainly stands out in its use of shea shells to help remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> When it comes to looking and feeling healthier and younger, I’m all in. AGELESS LA CURE NATURAL, ORGANIC EXFOLIATING FACIAL PHYTO-PEEL BY PHYTO 5, 2.5 OZ is not cheap. Does it work? That is yet to be determined - in regards to looking noticeably younger. However, I will say this…it smells divine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used AGELESS LA CURE, I applied it on my face in a dry state. It looked and felt like sandpaper. Not a good experience. However, when I took a wet cloth to it, washing what was on my face off, it left it feeling incredibly smooth, shinny, and refreshed. The next time I went to use it I did so in the shower. That time my face was wet, and it went on smoothly. A much better experience, yet it didn’t feel as though it foliated as well. The trick is to use only a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• The smell. Divine.&lt;br /&gt;• Leaves your face feeling incredibly soft, shinny, and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;• Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• The price.&lt;br /&gt;• Not sure if makes you look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Unique blend of pure shea shells, lotus seeds, essential oils and AHA exfoliate and increase pro-collagen gene expression, beneficial for anti-aging for organic and lasting beauty&lt;br /&gt;• Helps clear pigmentation spots, reduce wrinkles and fine lines, and firm and plump your skin&lt;br /&gt;• Ideal for aging and sensitive skin as it provides intense moisture and reveals softer, more glowing skin&lt;br /&gt;• For best results, apply twice a week, or as needed, after the cleanser and toner. Apply a small amount on your face and neck. Gently massage in circular motion for 2 to 3 minutes, adding water as needed.

            <li> The scrub/peel definitely made my skin feel softer, firmer, and gave me that nice post facial glow.  I enjoy using it and think it will last a while but at over $70 a tube it is expensive.  I would estimate that this tube should last at least 4-5 months using it on the face weekly so the price is more reasonable when you think of how long the product lasts.  It has a nice light fragrance (from the shea butter and peppermint oil) that I found slightly invigorating.  I think it&#x27;s worth a spluge for a product I know works versus one that is slightly cheaper and may not live up to the expectations.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator reminds me more of a clay type mask that has grains that are more like oat pieces. The texture is less creamy and more clumpy (a little) and it&#x27;s less of a scrub type product than a thick lotion that goes on and comes off. It did leave my skin feeling softer and, surprisingly, moisturized. Other peel/exfoliators tend to leave my already dry skin feeling dry. I did not love the texture but the product does work as intended and I had no adverse reactions to it at all.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only ever tried one other thing from Phyto5 - the Clay Mask. I have extremely dry, sensitive skin, so I was very hesitant when I tried it. I ended up loving it. So, when offered this product, I figured this one would surely be problematic - not only does it have shea shells and lotus seeds (potentially aggravating my sensitive skin), it also has cinnamon oil (which I can smell straight out of the tube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I was extremely surprised with the product. First, there were actual instructions this time! This was greatly appreciated. Within the instructions, basically, it says to massage on your skin based on how sensitive your skin is. So - I did. My face did get a little bit red (not sure if it was from the exfoliating or the essential oils) but surprisingly, I had no burning, no pain and no other issues. Frankly, this surprised the heck out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, I give it 5 stars. It does what it is supposed to do and does it beautifully. Do I like the price? No. But for some of us who have had lifelong struggles with overly sensitive skin, just about any price might be worth paying.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it feels more like a scrub than a chemical peel. It is made with fruit oils and smells pleasant. It sort of reminds me of Apricot Scrub, but it&#x27;s gentler.</li>
            <li> This is a great summer product, because summer days can get sweaty and dusty, and this is a good solution for the skin. It&#x27;s just abrasive enough to get a deep clean, but it&#x27;s not harsh. You&#x27;d have to have REALLY sensitive skin to be bothered by this. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh scent, either. It has a soft, pleasing, organic smell, and it felt my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
