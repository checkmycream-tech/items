            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>My favorite tanning lotion without a bronzer, great scent, not greasy, good consistency, good price, will not turn you orange ever (only bronzers do that)</li>
            <li>This one is a top 3 lotion for me.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and it didn&#x27;t cost me the $75.00</li>
            <li>I love AG products.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of the product (reminds me of bubble gum)  </li>
            <li>cause it works but mostly because of the price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I buy this product all the time just love love love it.</li>
            <li>I would most definately recommend this tanning lotion and I intend to order this again</li>
            <li>I love my tan</li>
            <li>But while this product is good for your skin, the act of indoor tanning, sadly, is not.  </li>
            <li>I love how quickly this works in brightening my tan!</li>
            <li>Also, it gives a nice, golden tan.</li>
            <li>Have used other products and this seems to be the best for me!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love HOT!</li>
            <li>We had fantastic customer service from Sun Liquidators</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent of this product.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t tan very often.</li>
            <li>Smells great and gives a terrific tan.</li>
            <li>and I like how light it feels</li>
            <li>The packaging was secure  ...</li>
            <li>Smells nice and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It also softens my skin and gives me a good natural glow.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and just as effective as the high price lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be reordering more very soon!</li>
            <li>Already familiar with the product.</li>
            <li>Have been using Australian Gold HOT for many years and love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using Hot for many years and swears by it.</li>
            <li>and delviery was super quick!</li>
            <li>and it smells clean.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived right on time too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this same brand and product for years, very clean smell rubs on quick and delivers a good dark tan without bronzers, by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used</li>
            <li>Thanks. :)</li>
            <li>Tanning effect is okay, but not too much stronger than if I would tan without a lotion I think.</li>
            <li>Priced a lot more reasonable then in the tanning salons.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, so I think the fourth dimension variety is the one for me.</li>
            <li>The smell on this lotion is by far my favorite, it comes on smooth and silicony.</li>
            <li>Great Product- produces a dark tan and the ingredients</li>
            <li>Has less of a &#x27;tanning&#x27; smell which is GREAT</li>
            <li>Fragrance is awesome, the ladies love it, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I have ordered this brand of lotion!</li>
            <li>Was unsure is this version of Hot!</li>
            <li>Fast and secure shipping.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite tanning lotion to use ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li>so you get a more natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I ran out of this quickly when I first started tanning and my salon discontinued selling it</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft, smells great, and gets me dark fast!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and with a great price; so expensive in the tanning salons; try it....</li>
            <li>ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>would be better than the version with one with fourth dimension bronzer</li>
            <li>I first bought a tube of this from a tanning salon and it cost A LOT.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Australian Gold since 2000, and this is probably my favorite lotion ever used.</li>
            <li>Pretty average product really, I was expecting it to be amazing based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>I use fairly light Bare Minerals foundation, it my skin tone makes a difference.</li>
            <li>and I just find the other product to be far superior even without bronzers,</li>
            <li>Tropical scent, so much cheaper than in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommeded!</li>
            <li>It works mediocre at best; definitely wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>While I did maintain most of the tan, it didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the one with bronzer.</li>
            <li>ladies you have to buy  yourself a few bottles of this:)</li>
            <li>keep the skin soft while tanning.  </li>
            <li>Purchased twice for us so far.</li>
            <li>gives you a golden tan nothing extremely dark</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am not fumbling with a big round bottle trying to get my lotion on before jumping in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> The tanning salons have a wide variety of tanning lotions, but this has always worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> Smells like a dark chocolate orange.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few scents that I can tolerate.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I are really pale and we had the bronzer type.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have excessive amounts of bronzer</li>
            <li> this will give you the tan you have been trying so hard to get!</li>
            <li> however  it wasn&#x27;t terrible and I will finish the tube and use it as a back up.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this lotion.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff and it didn&#x27;t cost me the $75.00 my tanning salon sells it for!!</li>
            <li> I love AG products.  It is one of the few scents that I can tolerate.  It smells just like an orange creamsicle bar!  It can leave you with the after tan burnt skin smell, but I will take that over smelling like a perfume factory.  I also like the tube.  I am not fumbling with a big round bottle trying to get my lotion on before jumping in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Have used other products and this seems to be the best for me! Product arrived right on time too! I&#x27;ll be reordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> Good price! Already familiar with the product.</li>

            <li> Good smell, but feels kind of sticky. Smells like a dark chocolate orange. Tanning effect is okay, but not too much stronger than if I would tan without a lotion I think. Pretty average product really, I was expecting it to be amazing based on the reviews. I use fairly light Bare Minerals foundation, it my skin tone makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Great Product- produces a dark tan and the ingredients keep the skin soft while tanning.  I love the smell of the product (reminds me of bubble gum)  We had touble finding the product (our salon does not carry it any longer) so we ordered thru Amazon and it was shipped from Sun Liquidators. We had fantastic customer service from Sun Liquidators</li>
            <li> The smell on this lotion is by far my favorite, it comes on smooth and silicony. It is cheap and just as effective as the high price lotions.</li>

            <li> This is not the first time I have ordered this brand of lotion! But, I wanted to leave a review and share the fact that I buy this brand cause it works but mostly because of the price here on Amazon. You simply cannot get this price anywhere else!</li>

            <li> smells good gives you a golden tan nothing extremely dark</li>
            <li> I typically use Australian Gold Fierce D Fense Intensifier if I am going to be tanning...I honestly don&#x27;t tan very often. So when I do, I want a big impact.  The smell of this one is a bit off to me and I just find the other product to be far superior even without bronzers, however  it wasn&#x27;t terrible and I will finish the tube and use it as a back up.</li>
            <li> ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time! I work at a gym/tan salon and own my own bed, I wouldnt go anywhere but here!</li>

            <li> I have used this product for over ten years.  It is the best.  The tanning salons have a wide variety of tanning lotions, but this has always worked well for me.  \\&quot;if it aint broke, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that this is one of the most popular tanning lotions on the market, and I can see why.  It makes your skin feel so soft and it smells so wonderful!  But while this product is good for your skin, the act of indoor tanning, sadly, is not.  Even though I&#x27;ve stopped tanning, I have used the rest of this lotion and I love it!</li>
            <li> Tropical scent, so much cheaper than in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Hot for many years and swears by it.</li>

I&#x27;ve been using this tanning lotion for a couple of years and I like how light it feels and it smells clean.  It also softens my skin and gives me a good natural glow.  Going to stick with this until they stop making it.  That&#x27;s how much I like it!</li>
            <li> this will give you the tan you have been trying so hard to get! ladies you have to buy  yourself a few bottles of this:)</li>
            <li> Was not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> This was a great product at a great price. The packaging was secure  ... and delviery was super quick! Highly recommeded!</li>
            <li> The product is an amazing product.  I would most definately recommend this tanning lotion and I intend to order this again</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love this product !</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion without a bronzer, great scent, not greasy, good consistency, good price, will not turn you orange ever (only bronzers do that)</li>
            <li> Love it works great and smells so good give you a great tan I would buy it again I love my tan</li>
            <li> Smells nice and very moisturizing. Doesn&#x27;t have excessive amounts of bronzer so you get a more natural looking tan. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Australian Gold since 2000, and this is probably my favorite lotion ever used. Fragrance is awesome, the ladies love it, and a little goes a long way. You cant go wrong with this lotion. IT&#x27;s Hot!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best lotion to get a tan. No bronzer in it. My daughter and I are really pale and we had the bronzer type. I was getting a tan-not great; and my daughter was having zero progress. Got this for us and we both had progress immediately! Purchased twice for us so far.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully! Makes my skin super soft, smells great, and gets me dark fast!</li>
