            <li>Bed Head TIGI Hair Stick for Cool People</li>
            <li>A SLEEK CLASSIC PONYTAIL WITH THIS ONE HAIR PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past year and it is great for those people who don&#x27;t want to get their hands sticky after applying wax or gel to their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adds a gorgeous shine, and the smell is natural enough to not conflict with any perfumes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply with no mess on your hands.  </li>
            <li>As I don&#x27;t use more than a tiny blot per day.</li>
            <li>Just bought two more for next year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly heavy product, but it has a good smell and lots of hold.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m glad I purchased this and highly recommend it for people looking for a strong-holding hair wax.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this for years to style his short fine hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a neutral smell, which much of the time I prefer.</li>
            <li>If you wet your hair when swimming, the hair would remain in the position it was most of the time.</li>
            <li>Something to keep in mind is that this is like like a stick of deodorant, you&#x27;ll get strands of hair that stick to the head but who really cares.</li>
            <li>Sooo much cheaper to purchase on Amazon than at the Beauty Supply store....</li>
            <li>Originally when I bought it I thought of using it as a shine balm, or something similar..</li>
            <li>Better than any other wax stick on the market</li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant but i&#x27;m not crazy about it, not really an issue after 30 minutes though.</li>
            <li>All I do is swipe my fingers across the top, rub them together, then down my hair, from root to tip.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I do normally wash my hands after using it, but I don&#x27;t feel I have to.</li>
            <li>A FEW TIMES MORE TO YOUR LIKING GRAB AND ELASTIC BAND</li>
            <li>I use this with my Bed Head Manipulator everyday and absolutely love this stick.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that you might have to use a little bit more shampoo to fully wash it off.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, there is no mess with this product.</li>
            <li>only complaint would be that you will have to thoroughly shampoo your hair to make sure it all gets out of your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but the stick lasts for about a half of year and works better than any other product I have ever used before.  </li>

            <li> I like this product because it comes in a stick like a block of wax. Those tubs of wax are weird cause they&#x27;re too jelly. This is the only product I use in my hair and its the only thing I need.</li>
            <li> This product gives you slick style of a natural look.  If you want to give some substance to your hair without looking like a sleazeball, use this.  It&#x27;s easy to apply with no mess on your hands.  Great pricing and quick shipping by the seller too.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Is it weird that I&#x27;m a female and I love this product? Originally when I bought it I thought of using it as a shine balm, or something similar.. As it turns out, it does a fantastic job at taming flyaways and smoothing split ends. All I do is swipe my fingers across the top, rub them together, then down my hair, from root to tip. Very simple, and this one stick will probably last me years.. As I don&#x27;t use more than a tiny blot per day. Adds a gorgeous shine, and the smell is natural enough to not conflict with any perfumes. Love it! :)</li>
            <li> Ever since I was introduced to the hair stick, I can&#x27;t go back to dipping my hands into a jar of wax.  I have been using this product for the past year and it is great for those people who don&#x27;t want to get their hands sticky after applying wax or gel to their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that you will have to thoroughly shampoo your hair to make sure it all gets out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man who has been using hair products most of my life. I&#x27;ve been using Bed Head TIGI for about 10 years now, though not always exclusively, I always have a stick at home. And I when I travel, I leave all the other hair products at home. It is the only product I need to control my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a neutral smell, which much of the time I prefer. I do use other products sometimes when I want a coconut smell or something else. It also gives my hair the body it needs to do what I want, without making my hair appear stiff and crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there is no mess with this product. I do normally wash my hands after using it, but I don&#x27;t feel I have to.</li>
            <li> This product last very long especially if you have short hair. It can last up to 8 months for me depending on how long my hair is. With longer hair, the product helps the hair stay in place as you style it. If you wet your hair when swimming, the hair would remain in the position it was most of the time. The only problem is that you might have to use a little bit more shampoo to fully wash it off.    I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this thing, I just dab it on my head and shape my hair with my fingers. It has an excellent non-shiny hold that lasts all day even with my super-thick asian hair. Like someone else mentioned, it does require a little shampoo to remove fully but i&#x27;ve never really had any trouble.

Something to keep in mind is that this is like like a stick of deodorant, you&#x27;ll get strands of hair that stick to the head but who really cares. Overall I&#x27;m glad I purchased this and highly recommend it for people looking for a strong-holding hair wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair stick since middle school until this day, which is for about 10 years. The product is very easy to use, lasts all day, and smells great, especially for it being wax. Applying once a day, one of these sticks lasts me about half a year or longer. Great value.</li>
            <li> Among the wax for hair that are in the market is one of the best things, however does not have a proper smell, I would love it smells, with more frangancia.    Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 5 years.  I&#x27;ve tried other things, but this just works the best and is easy to use.  Its a bit pricey, but as others have said, it does last a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now.   It has a neutral smell and a strong hold without the greasy look.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but the stick lasts for about a half of year and works better than any other product I have ever used before.  Just bought two more for next year.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR THOSE DAYS WHEN YOU WANT A SLEEK LOOKING PONYTAIL. I USUALLY DO THIS HAIR STYLE A DAY OR SO BEFORE I WASH MY HAIR BECAUSE OF THE WAXY RESIDUE IT LEAVES WHICH REALLY IS NOT MUCH OF A BIG DEAL. FIRST COMB THROUGH YOUR HAIR MAKING SURE IT IS KNOTT FREE. THAN USING A BRISTLE BRUSH, BRUSH THR TOP OF YOUR HAIR STRAIGHT BACK DO NOT FORGET THE HAIR BEHIND YOUR NECK. AFTER THAT I SIMPLY SWIPE THE STICK MAKE SURE EVER FLY AWAY AND FRIZZ IS TAMED DOWN, PASS THE BRUSH A FEW TIMES MORE TO YOUR LIKING GRAB AND ELASTIC BAND MAKING AS TIGHT AS YOU LIKE AND DONE!!! A SLEEK CLASSIC PONYTAIL WITH THIS ONE HAIR PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 4 years , every once in a. While I&#x27;ll be traveling somewhere and I&#x27;ll end up buying a few different brands thinking what the hell maybe I&#x27;ll find something as good but nope never happens, I am still using this same wax stick, do yourself a favor stop looking around just get this one and stick to it , I buy a few at a time.  Every once in a while , I don&#x27;t like running out :-)</li>
            <li> Been using this stick for years. love it. Sooo much cheaper to purchase on Amazon than at the Beauty Supply store....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly heavy product, but it has a good smell and lots of hold.  Good stuff, a tad pricey....</li>
            <li> Thank you for this product Bed Head TIGI Hair Stick for Cool People I really love it Thank you again</li>
            <li> Bed Head TIGI is a Hair Stick for &amp;#34;Cool People&amp;#34; 2.7 oz (75 g) TIGI, I use it on my beard &amp; moustashe, love it!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for years to style his short fine hair.  It is great.  Sort of like a molding wax.  Gives good results that hold.</li>
            <li> This is my go to hair product. Only problem is that ... Umm... Actually it is perfect. Better than any other wax stick on the market</li>
            <li> Works but way overpriced.  Any edge control from the ethnic haircare aisle works better.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Bed Head Manipulator everyday and absolutely love this stick. Holds hair just the way you want it and it lasts all day. WIll keep buying this product!</li>
