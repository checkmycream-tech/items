            <li>Will probably not purchase again, like the strips better.</li>
            <li>It was not one of my favorite purchases.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited.</li>

            <li>I was excited to try this face mask</li>
            <li>So when I clean my face, I feel clean, but I know in like an hour it is going to be a lil oily again.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean after using this.</li>
            <li>My blackheads did not completely go away but there is about a 50% improvement which after one use is HUGE!!!</li>
            <li>I think Avon products are a good value and work as well as other top brands.</li>
            <li>Havent tried many Avon products but with the cost I figured I didnt have much to lose...</li>
            <li>I will buy this product again if I can&#x27;t find something else that won&#x27;t dry out my skin, otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any huge difference before and after with my problem areas.  </li>
            <li>While it made my skin feel clean, it didn&#x27;t really help with the blackheads at all.</li>
            <li>It does feel funny as it dries but that wouldn&#x27;t stop me from buying it again.</li>
            <li>i just received my order and used it yesterday for the first time.</li>
            <li>After im done you can really feel and see results!</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t have many, nor do i have big ones...</li>
            <li>When I use it a couple times a week my face is clear and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>after one use, my face looks clearer and my skin feels so much smoother</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Very oily.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use several times a week but at the same time does a great job of eliminating blackheads.  </li>
            <li>This definitely helps remove the residual oil in my pores allowing me clean supple skin.</li>
            <li>used it three times so far - it left my skin smooth, but the blackheads are still there...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>When i first used this item you can feel the product hardening on you and see the mask turn white as it says it does.</li>
            <li>about 10-15 min until the hot and/or steamy water has had time to open my pores.i get a loofa or with my finger nails gentlly rub some soap on my nose.</li>
            <li>After first cleansing the pores thats when you put on the product and let it sit for 5-7 min or until it hardens and turns white.</li>
            <li>I asked her because my cousin used frequently and once I tried it and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an aging menopausal woman who has developed oily pores on my face.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that amazon sells Avon products because I only need a few things</li>
            <li>I have pretty bad blackheads, but I am able to notice a difference after using this.</li>
            <li>This product does dry out my skin a lot after I use it, but it does clear up blackheads like it says it does.</li>

            <li> 3 stars because it might work, just kibd ofa harsh product</li>
            <li> but since I am at least washing my face at least twice a day for the last few months I&#x27;m shure somthing</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> plus i never heard anything negative about avon products</li>
            <li> but I was left disappointed after weeks of use without a reduction in the amount of blackheads I was experiencing.</li>
            <li> Ive used other product for acne and never had a bad skin reaction.</li>
            <li> It was very irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have awful blackheads on my nose that have been there for a few years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> To begin with I have a combination skin type. This product does dry out my skin a lot after I use it, but it does clear up blackheads like it says it does. As I wait for the mask to go from blue to white I can feel the mask drying and getting tighter on my face. It does feel funny as it dries but that wouldn&#x27;t stop me from buying it again. I will buy this product again if I can&#x27;t find something else that won&#x27;t dry out my skin, otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I have lots of blackheads on my nose, so i bought this product to try and rememdy that. I do not know if it works or not because I only used the product three times. It was very irritating to my skin. Ive used other product for acne and never had a bad skin reaction. 3 stars because it might work, just kibd ofa harsh product</li>
            <li> i just received my order and used it yesterday for the first time. after one use, my face looks clearer and my skin feels so much smoother</li>
            <li> When i first used this item you can feel the product hardening on you and see the mask turn white as it says it does. However i find this product is best to use either when u draw yourself a bath or right after a nice hot shower. I personally like to put this on my nose and some other areas when im taking a bath and have sat there long enough about 10-15 min until the hot and/or steamy water has had time to open my pores.i get a loofa or with my finger nails gentlly rub some soap on my nose. After first cleansing the pores thats when you put on the product and let it sit for 5-7 min or until it hardens and turns white. After im done you can really feel and see results! its like a cleansing strip without the pain!!</li>
            <li> I have awful blackheads on my nose that have been there for a few years. I have tried the strips, different scrubs and also the face cleanser brushes. I got this in the mail yesterday and did not expect it to work at all but........ it did!!!! I am so excited. My blackheads did not completely go away but there is about a 50% improvement which after one use is HUGE!!! For the price of this product why wouldn&#x27;t you take a chance?? and you should because IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Use it as directed and the clogged pores and blackheads are gone. Just a little drop lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Was not that impressed with it. It did not help to clear my skin, only dried it up. I am happier with my current acne soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have TONS of blackheads, so maybe that is why this product wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; for me.  I really didn&#x27;t see any huge difference before and after with my problem areas.  Will probably not purchase again, like the strips better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make a difference. I used it for over a month with no results at all. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  It was not one of my favorite purchases.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.  No difference at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Leaves face feeling soft and clean. Blackheads started to disappear after two uses. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I would have liked. While it made my skin feel clean, it didn&#x27;t really help with the blackheads at all. Got rid of oil on my skin and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Havent tried many Avon products but with the cost I figured I didnt have much to lose... plus i never heard anything negative about avon products</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin. Very oily. So when I clean my face, I feel clean, but I know in like an hour it is going to be a lil oily again. This definitely helps remove the residual oil in my pores allowing me clean supple skin.</li>
            <li> used it three times so far - it left my skin smooth, but the blackheads are still there...and i don&#x27;t have many, nor do i have big ones...oh well....</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask with the daily cleanser from the same line and after three weekly of religous use my blackheads are decreased in size but not gone by any means-yet another blackhead remover dissapointment</li>
            <li> I  have started using this cream every knight(almost)I still havent seen any change but since I am at least washing my face at least twice a day for the last few months I&#x27;m shure somthing will show up soon.</li>
            <li> This product is great, my face feels smooth and blackheads. I asked her because my cousin used frequently and once I tried it and was pleasantly surprised. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great clarifying mask.  It is gentle enough to use several times a week but at the same time does a great job of eliminating blackheads.  After just a couple uses i noticed significant improvement in the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this face mask but I was left disappointed after weeks of use without a reduction in the amount of blackheads I was experiencing. I would recommend sticking to the face peels or regular exfoliating washes instead of using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product. Compared to other scrubs, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to cover your entire face. The scrub will turn from transluscent white to baby blue when it has dried. I usually leave it on for 20 minutes. I have pretty bad blackheads, but I am able to notice a difference after using this. That being said, it doesn&#x27;t remove them and I do have to use an extractor. My face feels clean after using this.</li>
            <li> This product is really good.  I&#x27;m an aging menopausal woman who has developed oily pores on my face.  This product makes me feel good.  When I use it a couple times a week my face is clear and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for Christmas and she really liked it. I think Avon products are a good value and work as well as other top brands. It is also nice that I did have to call a representative to get this product. I am glad that amazon sells Avon products because I only need a few things and I don’t want to be bothered by phone calls from a rep. every month.</li>
