            <li>Has a great scent, and seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>What a great product-</li>
            <li>This works great, smells good and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li>Still, smells good and works great except in 90+ degree weather, then you&#x27;ll need to reapply in the afternoon probably.  </li>
            <li>Good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good ingredient</li>
            <li>very pleased with the smell on this one.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t get how people on here say its smells nice</li>
            <li>but i paid for a nice lavender floral smell and</li>
            <li>I would suggest lowering the price, because it isn&#x27;t as effective as non-organic brands.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve found so far is Arm &amp; Hammer.</li>
            <li>I will buy More of this.</li>
            <li>girls love it...</li>
            <li>I thought i would be safe since i love the smell of lavender and aloe</li>
            <li>I will try another scent by this brand and pray it smells better then this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals, all organic, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and works really well.</li>
            <li>This deodorant doesnt smell very appealing and on a hot day you will for sure have to re apply.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an all natural anti-perspirant and deodorant and am happy to have come across this product.</li>
            <li>It is only a deodorant and not an antiperspirant; it works great for what it is</li>
            <li>so thats a good thing it seems to work so far</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with how it feels, very soft, doesn&#x27;t burn my skin and smells fabulous..</li>
            <li>it smells like a fresh herb garden!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and would recommend it to others who are looking for a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Basically it&#x27;s a travel size portion in a full size dispenser.</li>
            <li>But overall a good product.</li>
            <li>This is the very FIRST deodorant that agrees with my sensitive skin AND has a scent that&#x27;s mild yet still effective.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and goes on smooth and clear, but it completely wears off after about 1-2 hours or after any sweating.</li>
            <li>Pretty mild scent, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>She really enjoys this particular product for its clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>and they said the same thing well most said it smells like a pine tree</li>
            <li>ilove the natural products, im tyring to incorperate more natural products into my lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Great smell, nice ingredients, but it&#x27;s pretty expensive and doesn&#x27;t protect for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>A little sticky, but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about these things</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to know it does not have any of the harsh chemicals that \\&quot;mainstream\\&quot; deodorants have.</li>
            <li>actually got it because it was more natural</li>
            <li>After years (decades) of using an anti-perspirant, my right underarm stopped producing perspiration completely.</li>
            <li>For an all natural deodorant, this works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>I normally change between the tangerine and this one.....</li>
            <li>If you are a profuse sweater, have a lot of your own personal smell; this is not going to work via one use per day; you will need extra scent or to use numerous times throughout day.</li>
            <li>I switched to this brand after my normal, deodorant caused me to peel...</li>
            <li>being summer in florida i have to apply more than usual</li>
            <li>Maybe trying the other fragrance from the same brand might be better smelling.</li>
            <li>the price is pretty much the same as if you bought in store; if not better (depends on where you shop and what&#x27;s available).</li>
            <li>Been using natural deo for years now and  wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>For a natural deodorant, I had been using Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials, but I can no longer find it in stores, so I decided to try this one instead.</li>
            <li>My wife likes this one better before bed if you know what i mean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this deodorant, especially for those who have problems with overly scented items and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a really smelly lady, but on hot days with this product, I have gotten BO a couple hours after taking my morning shower.</li>
            <li>My wife is integrating as much organic foods, supplements, and beauty products as possible into her daily regimen.</li>
            <li>anyways it goes on easy and it isn&#x27;t hard like the other natural deodorants i&#x27;ve tried</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just got this today; last day it was due.</li>
            <li> I thought i was the only one that thought so, so i got other people to smell it</li>
            <li> but this product was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have never had this problem with other deodorants.</li>
            <li> cause you will need to reapplying it after 30 min or less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of plastic and frankly, a little deceptive.</li>
            <li> This is my first organic deodorant, after getting very ill and toxic from eating and using non-organics.</li>
            <li> it smells like those forest green air fresheners you put in your car</li>
            <li> i think it smells just like the forest green air fresheners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> natural deodotant releases your natural scent and dont contain nasty aluminum and other chemicals that are against your body.</li>
            <li> Even on a winter day it didn&#x27;t protect, and I don&#x27;t have excessive sweating issues.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now, and I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve tried various deodorants but each of them ended up causing a very uncomfortable allergic reaction (even the so-called hypo allergenic ones).  </li>
            <li> Around my area there are just 2 places to get organic products like this, but I have to travel at least 20 - 50 miles to get things.  </li>
            <li> or so you can smell BO, not good for a female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Cap fits pretty terribly.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> but if it doesn&#x27;t protect against what it&#x27;s suppose to, sorry don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
            <li> i hate the smell, its horrible, it smells like a man&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li> the scent is horrible</li>

            <li> ilove the natural products, im tyring to incorperate more natural products into my lifestyle. being summer in florida i have to apply more than usual</li>
            <li> A little sticky, but I love this stuff! No aluminum and great lavender scent! I will buy More of this. Wish it came in lemon sage.</li>
            <li> After years (decades) of using an anti-perspirant, my right underarm stopped producing perspiration completely. Because I was somewhat alarmed at this turn of events, I decided to try a simple deodorant. In the past I&#x27;ve tried various deodorants but each of them ended up causing a very uncomfortable allergic reaction (even the so-called hypo allergenic ones).  This is the very FIRST deodorant that agrees with my sensitive skin AND has a scent that&#x27;s mild yet still effective. I highly recommend purchasing this deodorant, especially for those who have problems with overly scented items and/or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the smell on this one. I normally change between the tangerine and this one.....My wife likes this one better before bed if you know what i mean. natural deodotant releases your natural scent and dont contain nasty aluminum and other chemicals that are against your body. PLUS!! girls love it...wife cannot stop smelling me.</li>
            <li> Just got this today; last day it was due. I am thrilled with how it feels, very soft, doesn&#x27;t burn my skin and smells fabulous.. It is only a deodorant and not an antiperspirant; it works great for what it is and it&#x27;s nice to know it does not have any of the harsh chemicals that \\&quot;mainstream\\&quot; deodorants have. This is my first organic deodorant, after getting very ill and toxic from eating and using non-organics. Very happy with product and the price is pretty much the same as if you bought in store; if not better (depends on where you shop and what&#x27;s available). Good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Have been using for a week or so now. If you are a profuse sweater, have a lot of your own personal smell; this is not going to work via one use per day; you will need extra scent or to use numerous times throughout day.</li>
            <li> This deodorant doesnt smell very appealing and on a hot day you will for sure have to re apply. Maybe trying the other fragrance from the same brand might be better smelling.</li>
            <li> Been using natural deo for years now and  wanted to try something new. This just didn&#x27;t cover the smell. Best I&#x27;ve found so far is Arm &amp; Hammer.</li>
            <li> Has a great scent, and seems to work well.  I am pleased with this product and would recommend it to others who are looking for a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an all natural anti-perspirant and deodorant and am happy to have come across this product. It has a pleasant scent and works really well. I will definitely keep purchasing this!!</li>
            <li> For an all natural deodorant, this works pretty well for me. I&#x27;m very particular about these things and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of them, so on that front I give it 5 stars. My issue is that I&#x27;m paying the 2.5 ounce price for 1.7 ounces of product. Basically it&#x27;s a travel size portion in a full size dispenser. It&#x27;s a waste of plastic and frankly, a little deceptive. But overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I switched to this brand after my normal, deodorant caused me to peel... This works great, smells good and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender and aloe at all it smells like those forest green air fresheners you put in your car i hate the smell, its horrible, it smells like a man&#x27;s deodorant. I thought i would be safe since i love the smell of lavender and aloe and i don&#x27;t know how it smells like a pine tree forest. I thought i was the only one that thought so, so i got other people to smell it and they said the same thing well most said it smells like a pine tree i think it smells just like the forest green air fresheners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyways it goes on easy and it isn&#x27;t hard like the other natural deodorants i&#x27;ve tried so thats a good thing it seems to work so far and it isn&#x27;t sticky on your skin.but the scent is horrible i don&#x27;t get how people on here say its smells nice they must like a musky pine tree smell but i paid for a nice lavender floral smell and this does not smell like that at all.I will try another scent by this brand and pray it smells better then this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i like the deodorant i just don&#x27;t like the smell of this one.</li>
            <li> My wife is integrating as much organic foods, supplements, and beauty products as possible into her daily regimen. She really enjoys this particular product for its clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Good ingredient but wont keep you from smelling like a bohemith ......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So use the but keep it close cause you will need to reapplying it after 30 min or less.</li>
            <li> Around my area there are just 2 places to get organic products like this, but I have to travel at least 20 - 50 miles to get things.  My family and I have prefere or have to use organic products because of choice or because of health reasons.</li>
            <li> But this product is perfect.  Never had any issues, all day, even when working outside.  No nasty chemicals, all organic, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Sorry but this product was not what I expected.  Totally does not protect against odor.  I have gone days were I don&#x27;t wear deodorant(camping &amp; forgot it) and never had a problem with smell.  And with this product You put it on and within an hour or so you can smell BO, not good for a female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually got it because it was more natural but if it doesn&#x27;t protect against what it&#x27;s suppose to, sorry don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
            <li> What a great product- it smells like a fresh herb garden! I give it 5 stars- I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great smell, nice ingredients, but it&#x27;s pretty expensive and doesn&#x27;t protect for a long period of time. Even on a winter day it didn&#x27;t protect, and I don&#x27;t have excessive sweating issues. I would suggest lowering the price, because it isn&#x27;t as effective as non-organic brands. I do where it at night before bed though... still have to use Dove in the mornings before work... ☻</li>
            <li> Cap fits pretty terribly.  It basically falls off which makes it a pain to travel with.  Still, smells good and works great except in 90+ degree weather, then you&#x27;ll need to reapply in the afternoon probably.  Pretty mild scent, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now, and I am not satisfied. For a natural deodorant, I had been using Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials, but I can no longer find it in stores, so I decided to try this one instead. It smells nice and goes on smooth and clear, but it completely wears off after about 1-2 hours or after any sweating. I&#x27;m not a really smelly lady, but on hot days with this product, I have gotten BO a couple hours after taking my morning shower. I have never had this problem with other deodorants.</li>
