    <ol>
            <li>This shaver does an awesome job everywhere</li>
            <li>He just wasn&#x27;t that impressed.  </li>
            <li>Best shaver ever!</li>
            <li>The travel case is perfect for the getaways.</li>
            <li>Best one is the Remington F5.  </li>
            <li>This Remington has worked flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>Awesome.  </li>
            <li>I had my husband try this - he&#x27;s always looking for the ideal shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>All the features on this electric razor are great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for cleaning up sideburns (see photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really great shaver.</li>
            <li>The battery life also seems to be great since he has not had to recharge it</li>
            <li>I like the runtime usage counter, very nice.  </li>
            <li>It would make a very nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery life is amazing!</li>
            <li>There must be two camps of shaver users in the world; those who successfully use an electric shaver and those who must use a razor.  </li>
            <li>I looked at it and it feels good in my hand; I like the shape and weight.  </li>
            <li>For the price this is a good choice..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels like good quality too, which it should, considering the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a convenient size, lightweight, nice ergonomic design, feels good to hold.</li>
            <li>- the battery is very good; 60 minutes on a full charge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it claims to be, and I am impressed!</li>
            <li>So nice and close.  </li>
            <li>That is a nice service.</li>
            <li>Searching for the perfect shave that gets close like a straight edge or razorblade I guess.</li>
            <li>and they all have that newest gimmick, the cleaning &#x27;tub&#x27; and abundant accessories.  </li>
            <li>It is nice that the razor is wet/dry and usable in the shower</li>
            <li>Overall I think this shaver would be an excellent upgrade for anybody who’s successfully used electric shavers, but I wouldn’t recommend it for</li>
            <li>That worked okay for me, but since the hair on my neck go in one direction I found a straight stroke worked best.</li>
            <li>have used the gamut of electric razors over the years, cheap and good quality, and given the above caveat, this Remington stands up with the best of the lot I have tried.</li>
            <li>A full charge lasts me for a couple of weeks, so this is good if you&#x27;re going away on trips - most of the time you don&#x27;t need to take the charger.</li>
            <li>I know people who use and prefer electric shavers and their faces are clean-cut and look great, so there must be a certain type of facial hair best suited for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>However, the more I used the shaver</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try using foam because I find the gel stays on my face longer and pre-hydrates my whiskers better.</li>
            <li>unrealistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find that the shaver was already charged up and ready to go when it arrived.</li>
            <li>experience feels better during and after the shave.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be doing any beard sculpting with this trimmer that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li>Overall, the Remington SmartEdge is an excellent wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, one of the better electric razors I have used, but it still doesn&#x27;t beat a blade for closeness.</li>
            <li>I like that it works with gel and cream, I use both, but more gel when I&#x27;m on the road.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality product, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that he shaves while dressing in the bedroom, but he does.</li>
            <li>It feels good in your hand which allows you to clean up those unwanted hairs comfortably.</li>
            <li>There is a nice easy on, easy off plastic protection cover that snaps on over the shaver head.</li>
            <li>Seems like a pretty good electric shaver.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I tried this very sleek-looking shaver in the shower with my favorite shave gel, and got a very comfortable, close shave that I was very pleased with.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and is pretty easy to manipulate around the edges of my beard.</li>
            <li>A better than decent electric shaver, but let me be honest, I am happy to use a two bladed disposable razor and basic shave cream (think Barbasol), and feel that I get a good, close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Okay, after all of that, I&#x27;m here to say that this is one fabulous shaver, whether you are an electric shave guy or not.  </li>
            <li>Also, for traveling, it has an easy lock/unlock system so it will not accidentally turn on and discharge in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver is a breeze because it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs, glides over and cuts them close.</li>
            <li>It comes apart without falling apart and cleans easily with the provided brushes.</li>
            <li>, this is fine.</li>
            <li>The shaving blades are easy to remove for cleaning (see the instructions) and there is also nylon cleaning brush included in the box to ensure the shaving head is free of any hair.</li>

            <li>A Product Features section helped me to quickly get acquainted with the location and function of this shaver&#x27;s parts.</li>
            <li>I found that this Remington Smart edge is really nice.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a huge upside to</li>
            <li>This Remington XF8700 SmartEdge Advanced Foil Shaver promises to provide their \\&quot;closest one</li>
            <li>If you need the perfectly smooth shave for a special occasion, I can&#x27;t endorse this at this time.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended to use only shave foam or gel when using this with water, but this feature alone is a great time saver and helps to condition the skin for a smooth and healthy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I still haven&#x27;t been able to verify out how much replacement will cost.</li>
            <li>The shaver can run for 60 minutes on a full charge.</li>
            <li>If Remington would consider redesigning the travel/charging stand, making it more stable and thus safer, I think this shaver would be a real bell ringer.blem point for some reviewers.</li>

            <li>If Remington would consider redesigning the travel/charging stand, making it more stable and thus safer, I think this shaver would be a real bell ringer.</li>
            <li>It feels good in your hand and is lightweight and is not bulky which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>So, this shaver is marketed to men, hence its black surface and large casing that would fit most men&#x27;s hands; however, it is great for a woman, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He still does not feel like it does as good of a job as his regular blade razor but agrees that it is convenient for a quick shave.</li>
            <li>It also has a Quick Charge feature that takes 5 minutes and will provide a 3-minute runtime.</li>
            <li>It also has a Quick Charge feature that takes 5 minutes and will provide a 3-minute runtime.</li>
            <li>If you are one who maybe experiences razor burn, likes the ability to quickly touch up areas, and prefer electric shavers - then this one will serve you well.</li>
            <li>I was also very pleased with the digital time remaining counter.</li>
            <li>: you can&#x27;t easily use it while it&#x27;s plugged in (a new riff on &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;) and it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am extremely happy with this shaver and have no need for my old electric shavers or razor blades.</li>
            <li>I got close to 5 minutes of runtime the first time I used the Quick Charge feature.</li>
            <li>I got close to 5 minutes of runtime the first time I used the Quick Charge feature.</li>
            <li>It is great for longer hair that has grown out a little, or for the overnight hair that is pretty close to the skin.</li>
            <li>This thing really mows thru my facial hair and does a pretty good job without any razor burn which is a problem I also have even with a blade.</li>
            <li>(I guess right where the hyoid bone lays)</li>
            <li>The shaver has a tacky rubber coating which makes shaving in the shower very easy - it is totally waterproof - I had no razor burn or redness.  </li>
            <li>best thing about this shaver is that it can be used dry or WET - as in during the shower.</li>
            <li>First electric shaver I have used that didn&#x27;t chew up the area right where my face/head/chin angles with the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets close, is smooth and worked on my sensitive skin right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, the flip up trimmer built in to the back... While it works pretty well and flips up and closes pretty easily and while the shaver is still on!</li>
            <li>Like I said, first electric razor for me that didn&#x27;t chew up that chin to neck area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually the first thing I want to look at once the product is unboxed is the instructions.</li>
            <li>The head didn&#x27;t pivot easily at first.</li>
            <li>and I placed my index finger along the back spine of the handle instead of gripping it as you would a baseball bat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the shaver is not difficult.</li>
            <li>and I placed my index finger along the back spine of the handle instead of gripping it as you would a baseball bat.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the shaver is not difficult.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is my first electric razor I can&#x27;t speak for others</li>
            <li>It has two sets of blades that catch the longer hairs first, and then follow up with the shorter hairs.</li>
            <li>Why so many different brands?</li>
            <li>Although it missed a few sprouts in my shaving sessions, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice it does seem to provide a very smooth or comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the fact that I could take the shaver into the shower with me and shave with foam or gel; I typically use Edge Gel and was surprised how well and comfortably the Remington worked.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is adequate, though it requires repeated passes from different directions to ensure full coverage.</li>
            <li>Through the years I&#x27;ve tried using an electric shaver, but have always gone back to a blade razor; mostly because the electric shaver didn&#x27;t provide me with a close, smooth shave and almost always left me with shaver burn.</li>
            <li>Aside from the product not working well for me, I like how it is totally water proof and easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>Cleanup is easy, pop the head off and brush off the residue, pop the head back on, done.</li>
            <li>The one drawback with his shaver is it is really large.</li>
            <li>, so the shaver is either in the large cleaning tub or laying on the sink.  </li>
            <li>I will try to at least touch on most of the important features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wet my face and applied the gel just before I got into the shower; it worked better for me that way.</li>
            <li>The placement of my index finger helped control the shaver as well as determine how much pressure was applied while shaving.</li>
            <li>The Travel features are very beneficial.</li>
            <li>Another really nice feature is a digital display built into the shaver handle that lets you know how much time is left on the battery; no bars or colored lights.</li>
            <li>I really like this feature.</li>
            <li>SmartEdge Advanced Foil Shaver is a vastly improved shaver from the ones I used decades ago.</li>

            <li>I really like this feature.</li>
            <li>This Remington XF8700 SmartEdge Advanced Foil Shaver is a vastly improved shaver from the ones I used decades ago.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a criticism of the model as much as the drawbacks of electric razors in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As advertised, this cordless Remington SmartEdge shaver provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>My Husband really loves the Remington XF8700.</li>
            <li>Remington claims this shaver provides a \\&quot;one-pass shave.\\&quot; That may be true for teenagers with peach fuzz instead of whiskers, but for someone with a seasoned beard that, in my opinion, simply isn&#x27;t going to happen.</li>
            <li>but it sure beats making a mess with a razor and shaving</li>
            <li>This is a 5 star product which I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A couple of other nice features - the hair trimmer on the back side of the unit, and the remaining minutes of charge display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I rarely shave daily</li>
            <li>I tried dry shaving and definitely preferred the more comfortable wet shave.</li>
            <li>To be honest I do have to go over certain areas several times but that is to be expected because the hairs don&#x27;t all grow in the same direction.</li>
            <li>I started looking for a new shaver with a charging dock/stand.  </li>
            <li>The handle on this Remington shaver is slightly curved creating an ergonomically easy shaver to hold.</li>
            <li>gives you an option to do a quick charge for that single shaving session.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to operate, has a long lasting charge, is comfortable to handle, and leaves nothing but smooth skin behind.  </li>
            <li>I used the shaver a few times and the charge barely dropped, so you could take this shaver and a long work trip and not need to bring the charger - the shaver is light and easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about the Remington shaver was it is smaller and lighter than my son&#x27;s Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>When I first tried one 20 year ago my face was in pain the entire day.  </li>
            <li>This XF8700 seemed well made, but did not shave any better than the much cheaper 5 and left me needing to re-shave every few hours.  </li>
            <li>It is the round bottom that makes it prone to falling over easily; even with the attached rounded edge (?)</li>
            <li>It is the round bottom that makes it prone to falling over easily; even with the attached rounded edge (?)</li>
            <li>If I had a 4 day growth I find that the Remington is better than the conventional blade at chopping it down, but the conventional blade is better at the finish.  </li>
            <li>Obviously this one is much better than that previous experience.</li>
            <li>Gives a smooth, close shave with little effort.</li>
            <li>Just to be clear, the charger will stand upright; that is not the design problem.</li>

            <li>Hat tip to the side-burn trimmer that can also trim those wild hairs that grow between haircuts.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The first charge takes 24 hours, but after that, it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>The location of it is kind of a pain in the behind.</li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s better than not having it of course</li>
            <li>So, the first test we did was to use this Remington XF8700 for a dry shave without aftershave or anything.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer has included many of the features we only dreamed about when I was pinching and rubbing my face raw with the electric shavers of yesteryear.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer has included many of the features we only dreamed about when I was pinching and rubbing my face raw with the electric shavers of yesteryear.</li>
            <li>Since Remington can&#x27;t find the shaver or the parts - the following question is now posted on Remington&#x27;s main site.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any real problems with recharging because after plugging in the power cord and slipping the shaver into the charging stand I placed the shaver over in the far corner of our sink counter to ensure it wouldn&#x27;t be bumped and fall over.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find the major flaw with this thing</li>
            <li>It took me several uses before I could effectively shave some of the tough spots like up under my nose, back around my jawbone and on the bottom edge of my chin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised they made this feature without anybody testing it and making the same observation?</li>
            <li>My solution was to grow back my beard from my youth, relinquishing my old fashioned grooming technique for an  electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find an electric razor that offers the closeness or quickness of that standard - the razor being reviewed included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My husband is typically a blade shaver but has been interested in trying out an electric one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviewers mentioning that their type of facial hair doesn&#x27;t match up well with ANY type of electric shaver, I too have this problem with my neck hair, hence not owning an electric this whole time.</li>
            <li>However, when I wanted to dry trim my moustache, the shaver head got in the way of my seeing the pop-up trimmer, and I couldn&#x27;t completely see what I was doing, otherwise I would have given this shaver five stars.</li>
            <li>He had previously given up on electric razors, but he really likes this.</li>
            <li>It gives him a very close shave that definitely rivals his typical Gillette razor (which he has abandoned since this arrived).</li>
            <li>Some good - some bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Overall I think this shaver would be an excellent upgrade for anybody who’s successfully used electric shavers, but I wouldn’t recommend it for</li>
            <li> That worked okay for me, but since the hair on my neck go in one direction I found a straight stroke worked best.</li>
            <li> have used the gamut of electric razors over the years, cheap and good quality, and given the above caveat, this Remington stands up with the best of the lot I have tried.</li>
            <li> A full charge lasts me for a couple of weeks, so this is good if you&#x27;re going away on trips - most of the time you don&#x27;t need to take the charger.</li>
            <li> I know people who use and prefer electric shavers and their faces are clean-cut and look great, so there must be a certain type of facial hair best suited for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> However, the more I used the shaver</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try using foam because I find the gel stays on my face longer and pre-hydrates my whiskers better.</li>
            <li> unrealistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find that the shaver was already charged up and ready to go when it arrived.</li>
            <li> experience feels better during and after the shave.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be doing any beard sculpting with this trimmer that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li> Overall, the Remington SmartEdge is an excellent wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, one of the better electric razors I have used, but it still doesn&#x27;t beat a blade for closeness.</li>
            <li> I like that it works with gel and cream, I use both, but more gel when I&#x27;m on the road.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality product, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love that he shaves while dressing in the bedroom, but he does.</li>
            <li> It feels good in your hand which allows you to clean up those unwanted hairs comfortably.</li>
            <li> There is a nice easy on, easy off plastic protection cover that snaps on over the shaver head.</li>
            <li> Seems like a pretty good electric shaver.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I tried this very sleek-looking shaver in the shower with my favorite shave gel, and got a very comfortable, close shave that I was very pleased with.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and is pretty easy to manipulate around the edges of my beard.</li>
            <li> A better than decent electric shaver, but let me be honest, I am happy to use a two bladed disposable razor and basic shave cream (think Barbasol), and feel that I get a good, close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Okay, after all of that, I&#x27;m here to say that this is one fabulous shaver, whether you are an electric shave guy or not.  </li>
            <li> Also, for traveling, it has an easy lock/unlock system so it will not accidentally turn on and discharge in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver is a breeze because it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs, glides over and cuts them close.</li>
            <li> It comes apart without falling apart and cleans easily with the provided brushes.</li>
            <li> , this is fine.</li>
            <li> The shaving blades are easy to remove for cleaning (see the instructions) and there is also nylon cleaning brush included in the box to ensure the shaving head is free of any hair.</li>

            <li> A Product Features section helped me to quickly get acquainted with the location and function of this shaver&#x27;s parts.</li>
            <li> I found that this Remington Smart edge is really nice.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a huge upside to</li>
            <li> This Remington XF8700 SmartEdge Advanced Foil Shaver promises to provide their \\&quot;closest one</li>
            <li> If you need the perfectly smooth shave for a special occasion, I can&#x27;t endorse this at this time.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended to use only shave foam or gel when using this with water, but this feature alone is a great time saver and helps to condition the skin for a smooth and healthy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t been able to verify out how much replacement will cost.</li>
            <li> The shaver can run for 60 minutes on a full charge.</li>
            <li> If Remington would consider redesigning the travel/charging stand, making it more stable and thus safer, I think this shaver would be a real bell ringer.blem point for some reviewers.</li>

            <li> If Remington would consider redesigning the travel/charging stand, making it more stable and thus safer, I think this shaver would be a real bell ringer.</li>
            <li> It feels good in your hand and is lightweight and is not bulky which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> So, this shaver is marketed to men, hence its black surface and large casing that would fit most men&#x27;s hands; however, it is great for a woman, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He still does not feel like it does as good of a job as his regular blade razor but agrees that it is convenient for a quick shave.</li>
            <li> It also has a Quick Charge feature that takes 5 minutes and will provide a 3-minute runtime.</li>
            <li> It also has a Quick Charge feature that takes 5 minutes and will provide a 3-minute runtime.</li>
            <li> If you are one who maybe experiences razor burn, likes the ability to quickly touch up areas, and prefer electric shavers - then this one will serve you well.</li>
            <li> I was also very pleased with the digital time remaining counter.</li>
            <li> : you can&#x27;t easily use it while it&#x27;s plugged in (a new riff on &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;) and it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am extremely happy with this shaver and have no need for my old electric shavers or razor blades.</li>
            <li> I got close to 5 minutes of runtime the first time I used the Quick Charge feature.</li>
            <li> I got close to 5 minutes of runtime the first time I used the Quick Charge feature.</li>
            <li> It is great for longer hair that has grown out a little, or for the overnight hair that is pretty close to the skin.</li>
            <li> This thing really mows thru my facial hair and does a pretty good job without any razor burn which is a problem I also have even with a blade.</li>
            <li> (I guess right where the hyoid bone lays)</li>
            <li> The shaver has a tacky rubber coating which makes shaving in the shower very easy - it is totally waterproof - I had no razor burn or redness.  </li>
            <li> best thing about this shaver is that it can be used dry or WET - as in during the shower.</li>
            <li> First electric shaver I have used that didn&#x27;t chew up the area right where my face/head/chin angles with the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets close, is smooth and worked on my sensitive skin right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, the flip up trimmer built in to the back... While it works pretty well and flips up and closes pretty easily and while the shaver is still on!</li>
            <li> Like I said, first electric razor for me that didn&#x27;t chew up that chin to neck area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually the first thing I want to look at once the product is unboxed is the instructions.</li>
            <li> The head didn&#x27;t pivot easily at first.</li>
            <li> and I placed my index finger along the back spine of the handle instead of gripping it as you would a baseball bat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the shaver is not difficult.</li>
            <li> and I placed my index finger along the back spine of the handle instead of gripping it as you would a baseball bat.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the shaver is not difficult.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is my first electric razor I can&#x27;t speak for others</li>
            <li> It has two sets of blades that catch the longer hairs first, and then follow up with the shorter hairs.</li>
            <li> Why so many different brands?</li>
            <li> Although it missed a few sprouts in my shaving sessions, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice it does seem to provide a very smooth or comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the fact that I could take the shaver into the shower with me and shave with foam or gel; I typically use Edge Gel and was surprised how well and comfortably the Remington worked.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is adequate, though it requires repeated passes from different directions to ensure full coverage.</li>
            <li> Through the years I&#x27;ve tried using an electric shaver, but have always gone back to a blade razor; mostly because the electric shaver didn&#x27;t provide me with a close, smooth shave and almost always left me with shaver burn.</li>
            <li> Aside from the product not working well for me, I like how it is totally water proof and easy to grip.  </li>
            <li> Cleanup is easy, pop the head off and brush off the residue, pop the head back on, done.</li>
            <li> The one drawback with his shaver is it is really large.</li>
            <li> , so the shaver is either in the large cleaning tub or laying on the sink.  </li>
            <li> I will try to at least touch on most of the important features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wet my face and applied the gel just before I got into the shower; it worked better for me that way.</li>
            <li> The placement of my index finger helped control the shaver as well as determine how much pressure was applied while shaving.</li>
            <li> The Travel features are very beneficial.</li>
            <li> Another really nice feature is a digital display built into the shaver handle that lets you know how much time is left on the battery; no bars or colored lights.</li>
            <li> I really like this feature.</li>
            <li> SmartEdge Advanced Foil Shaver is a vastly improved shaver from the ones I used decades ago.</li>

            <li> I really like this feature.</li>
            <li> This Remington XF8700 SmartEdge Advanced Foil Shaver is a vastly improved shaver from the ones I used decades ago.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a criticism of the model as much as the drawbacks of electric razors in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As advertised, this cordless Remington SmartEdge shaver provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li> My Husband really loves the Remington XF8700.</li>
            <li> Remington claims this shaver provides a \\&quot;one-pass shave.\\&quot; That may be true for teenagers with peach fuzz instead of whiskers, but for someone with a seasoned beard that, in my opinion, simply isn&#x27;t going to happen.</li>
            <li> but it sure beats making a mess with a razor and shaving</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star product which I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A couple of other nice features - the hair trimmer on the back side of the unit, and the remaining minutes of charge display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I rarely shave daily</li>
            <li> I tried dry shaving and definitely preferred the more comfortable wet shave.</li>
            <li> To be honest I do have to go over certain areas several times but that is to be expected because the hairs don&#x27;t all grow in the same direction.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a new shaver with a charging dock/stand.  </li>
            <li> The handle on this Remington shaver is slightly curved creating an ergonomically easy shaver to hold.</li>
            <li> gives you an option to do a quick charge for that single shaving session.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to operate, has a long lasting charge, is comfortable to handle, and leaves nothing but smooth skin behind.  </li>
            <li> I used the shaver a few times and the charge barely dropped, so you could take this shaver and a long work trip and not need to bring the charger - the shaver is light and easy to grip.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about the Remington shaver was it is smaller and lighter than my son&#x27;s Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> When I first tried one 20 year ago my face was in pain the entire day.  </li>
            <li> This XF8700 seemed well made, but did not shave any better than the much cheaper 5 and left me needing to re-shave every few hours.  </li>
            <li> It is the round bottom that makes it prone to falling over easily; even with the attached rounded edge (?)</li>
            <li> It is the round bottom that makes it prone to falling over easily; even with the attached rounded edge (?)</li>
            <li> If I had a 4 day growth I find that the Remington is better than the conventional blade at chopping it down, but the conventional blade is better at the finish.  </li>
            <li> Obviously this one is much better than that previous experience.</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth, close shave with little effort.</li>
            <li> Just to be clear, the charger will stand upright; that is not the design problem.</li>
            <li> Just to be clear, the charger will stand upright; that is not the design problem.</li>
            <li> Hat tip to the side-burn trimmer that can also trim those wild hairs that grow between haircuts.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The first charge takes 24 hours, but after that, it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The location of it is kind of a pain in the behind.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s better than not having it of course</li>
            <li> So, the first test we did was to use this Remington XF8700 for a dry shave without aftershave or anything.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer has included many of the features we only dreamed about when I was pinching and rubbing my face raw with the electric shavers of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer has included many of the features we only dreamed about when I was pinching and rubbing my face raw with the electric shavers of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> Since Remington can&#x27;t find the shaver or the parts - the following question is now posted on Remington&#x27;s main site.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any real problems with recharging because after plugging in the power cord and slipping the shaver into the charging stand I placed the shaver over in the far corner of our sink counter to ensure it wouldn&#x27;t be bumped and fall over.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the major flaw with this thing</li>
            <li> It took me several uses before I could effectively shave some of the tough spots like up under my nose, back around my jawbone and on the bottom edge of my chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised they made this feature without anybody testing it and making the same observation?</li>
            <li> My solution was to grow back my beard from my youth, relinquishing my old fashioned grooming technique for an  electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find an electric razor that offers the closeness or quickness of that standard - the razor being reviewed included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My husband is typically a blade shaver but has been interested in trying out an electric one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviewers mentioning that their type of facial hair doesn&#x27;t match up well with ANY type of electric shaver, I too have this problem with my neck hair, hence not owning an electric this whole time.</li>
            <li> However, when I wanted to dry trim my moustache, the shaver head got in the way of my seeing the pop-up trimmer, and I couldn&#x27;t completely see what I was doing, otherwise I would have given this shaver five stars.</li>
            <li> He had previously given up on electric razors, but he really likes this.</li>
            <li> It gives him a very close shave that definitely rivals his typical Gillette razor (which he has abandoned since this arrived).</li>
            <li> Some good - some bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s located behind the head of the shaver and unless you get just the right angle trying to trim, you can&#x27;t see what you are doing!</li>
            <li> It measures almost 6½\\&quot; long and weighs only 7 ounces.</li>
            <li> He is in his 70s, so his skin is rather thin and loose, but he still gets a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The instructions recommended pulling the skin to get at the tough to reach areas and to generally get a cleaner, closer shave (see photo); it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The actual shaving head is 1¾\\&quot; wide and is a hybrid or dual style shaving head consisting of three independent shaving heads.</li>
            <li> the excess residue can be washed away under the heavy stream of water near the shower head.</li>
            <li> the excess residue can be washed away under the heavy stream of water near the shower head.</li>
            <li> My neck and mustache areas were not completely shaven.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m assuming it grows in strange directions and not a continuous direction/pattern like my face.</li>
            <li> but it works well for a stray long hair here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I refined my search and two Remington&#x27;s with charging stands popped up, this black one with a digital display and a blue one without the display.  </li>
            <li> You can use shaving cream or any other facial lubricant.  </li>
            <li> It seems we switch from one company to the other every few years just to try something new and based on reviews.  </li>
            <li> It felt no different than a conventional blade.  </li>
            <li> of the features that drew me to this shaver was its wet &amp; dry capability.</li>
            <li> One last feature included in the box is a black faux suede drawstring travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One last feature included in the box is a black faux suede drawstring travel bag.    </li>
            <li> It is the model that comes in black only.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something a little smaller and easier to handle.</li>
            <li> My historical experience with electric shavers is neutral to negative because they simply do not work well for me.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of bells and whistles, my rating is heavily influenced by the product’s ability to remove all of my facial hair like a razor can.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I go in a diagonal pattern in four or five different directions and about 10-12 swipes it will get 90% of the shave completed, leaving me with a few razor swipes.</li>
            <li> I became curious about the cost of the replacement blade and foils.  </li>
            <li> He has used a few electric shavers similar to this in the past (only on the lower price end) and he has always had a problem with them making him breakout.</li>
            <li> the other hand, this is an electric razor, and he has never used an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Not to be confused with the blue one XF8550, which uses a different part number.  </li>
            <li> and I had to finish with a conventional blade if I wanted a close shave.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to put it to the test on a face with a tough beard and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two outer shaving heads (SmartEdge Cutting System) are designed to cut the longer hairs and the middle shaving head (LiftLogic Inner Foil) is designed to capture and cuts the short hairs.</li>
            <li> However, the stability of the unit as a charging stand could be better if it had a wider base to rest on.</li>
            <li> However, the stability of the unit as a charging stand could be better if it had a wider base to rest on.</li>
            <li> It still takes some effort to get as close as I typically like.  </li>
            <li> I thought trying a high-tech electric shaver would produce a different outcome, but unfortunately my experience was the same.  </li>
            <li> The entire head of this Remington shaver pivots to help keep the cutting blades squarely against my face as much as possible during the shaving process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few things I like about this shaver that are a standout to me.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there are quite a few men who do read the instructions before proceeding.</li>
            <li> They had trouble inadvertently turning the shaver off while shaving.</li>
            <li> They had trouble inadvertently turning the shaver off while shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for about six weeks now, shaving almost every day but missing a few here</li>
            <li> By contrast, the shaver itself is sturdy and firm.</li>
            <li> Multiple passes on my tricky neck hair still doesn&#x27;t give me those ugly red blotches I&#x27;m used to with a razor!</li>
            <li> I have a small hand</li>
            <li> I have a small hand</li>
            <li> I used to get lazy and not shave the areas where I want no hair on my beard because of the hassle.</li>
            <li> The charging cradle is somewhat of an oddity, I&#x27;m not sure whether it is meant to simplify carrying for travel of stowage, but it just seems ill-designed.</li>
            <li> This has replaced a Braun that has slowly been lacking even though the blades have been replaced a few times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the limited test run by my husband has been a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> the easier it was to make it pivot without pressing it too hard against my face, thereby inviting razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have never had a thick beard</li>
            <li> Seriously, I looked for weeks</li>
            <li> but unfortunately once I get below my jawline</li>

            <li> Use with gel to shave.  I still have to go over with razor to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> First electric shaver I have used that didn&#x27;t chew up the area right where my face/head/chin angles with the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things I like about this shaver that are a standout to me.  I like the runtime usage counter, very nice.  I like that it&#x27;s charging design gives you an option to do a quick charge for that single shaving session.  Although it missed a few sprouts in my shaving sessions, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice it does seem to provide a very smooth or comfortable shave.  The advertised reduced noise and vibration appear to function as advertised.  Some of my facial sprouts I guess curve or angle close to the skin and seemed to give the razor a challenge, but those were minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During testing, I would do a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; outside the shower shave...then test again in the shower and when I came out.  So nice and close.  I think Remington should keep working this design.  Like I said, first electric razor for me that didn&#x27;t chew up that chin to neck area.  (I guess right where the hyoid bone lays)</li>
            <li> All the features on this electric razor are great: you can&#x27;t easily use it while it&#x27;s plugged in (a new riff on &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;) and it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the limited test run by my husband has been a little disappointing. The shave just wasn&#x27;t close enough, leaving stubble even after going after that section of his face several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, this is an electric razor, and he has never used an electric razor. So maybe there&#x27;s a technique to getting a close shave. We&#x27;ll see--my sons are going to try this, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a basic shave and you&#x27;re in a hurry, this is fine. If you need the perfectly smooth shave for a special occasion, I can&#x27;t endorse this at this time.</li>
            <li> Through the years I&#x27;ve tried using an electric shaver, but have always gone back to a blade razor; mostly because the electric shaver didn&#x27;t provide me with a close, smooth shave and almost always left me with shaver burn. My son uses a Braun and likes it a lot. The one drawback with his shaver is it is really large. I wanted to try something a little smaller and easier to handle. This Remington XF8700 SmartEdge Advanced Foil Shaver promises to provide their \\&quot;closest one pass shave ever.\\&quot; That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for so I decided to put it to the test on a face with a tough beard and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually the first thing I want to look at once the product is unboxed is the instructions. Yes, there are quite a few men who do read the instructions before proceeding. The Use and Care Guide comes in a folded map style rather than a booklet and includes pictures that actually make sense as do the written instructions. I&#x27;ve written several reviews on products this year where that wasn&#x27;t the case. A Product Features section helped me to quickly get acquainted with the location and function of this shaver&#x27;s parts. I will try to at least touch on most of the important features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the Remington shaver was it is smaller and lighter than my son&#x27;s Braun shaver. It measures almost 6½\\&quot; long and weighs only 7 ounces. The actual shaving head is 1¾\\&quot; wide and is a hybrid or dual style shaving head consisting of three independent shaving heads. There is a nice easy on, easy off plastic protection cover that snaps on over the shaver head. The two outer shaving heads (SmartEdge Cutting System) are designed to cut the longer hairs and the middle shaving head (LiftLogic Inner Foil) is designed to capture and cuts the short hairs. The entire head of this Remington shaver pivots to help keep the cutting blades squarely against my face as much as possible during the shaving process. The head didn&#x27;t pivot easily at first. However, the more I used the shaver the easier it was to make it pivot without pressing it too hard against my face, thereby inviting razor burn. There is also a nifty ComfortTrim Detailer that pops out from the back of the shaver handle. It&#x27;s great for cleaning up sideburns (see photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the features that drew me to this shaver was its wet &amp; dry capability. I really liked the fact that I could take the shaver into the shower with me and shave with foam or gel; I typically use Edge Gel and was surprised how well and comfortably the Remington worked. It took me several uses before I could effectively shave some of the tough spots like up under my nose, back around my jawbone and on the bottom edge of my chin. The instructions recommended pulling the skin to get at the tough to reach areas and to generally get a cleaner, closer shave (see photo); it works pretty well. The instructions also recommended shaving the neck in short, circular strokes. That worked okay for me, but since the hair on my neck go in one direction I found a straight stroke worked best. I tried dry shaving and definitely preferred the more comfortable wet shave. I didn&#x27;t try using foam because I find the gel stays on my face longer and pre-hydrates my whiskers better. I wet my face and applied the gel just before I got into the shower; it worked better for me that way. Remington claims this shaver provides a \\&quot;one-pass shave.\\&quot; That may be true for teenagers with peach fuzz instead of whiskers, but for someone with a seasoned beard that, in my opinion, simply isn&#x27;t going to happen. That doesn&#x27;t, in my view, detract from the performance of this Remington XF8700 SmartEdge shaver. However, the claim is just unrealistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find that the shaver was already charged up and ready to go when it arrived. That is a nice service. The handle on this Remington shaver is slightly curved creating an ergonomically easy shaver to hold. The on/off switch is located on the underside of the handle. I noticed that this was a problem point for some reviewers. They had trouble inadvertently turning the shaver off while shaving. I have a small hand and I placed my index finger along the back spine of the handle instead of gripping it as you would a baseball bat. The placement of my index finger helped control the shaver as well as determine how much pressure was applied while shaving. By holding the shaver in a different way my fingers never came in contact with the on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One surprise that stopped me in my tracks was how often Remington recommends replacing the shaver cutting heads and cutters every six months. Six months? That seemed a bit often to me and I still haven&#x27;t been able to verify out how much replacement will cost. This shaver comes with a relatively compact charging stand. The stand has three features: (1) Recharging Stand. (2) Travel Cover for protection. (3) Travel Lock ~ prevents the shaver from accidentally turning on while stored in luggage. The Travel features are very beneficial. However, the stability of the unit as a charging stand could be better if it had a wider base to rest on. I didn&#x27;t have any real problems with recharging because after plugging in the power cord and slipping the shaver into the charging stand I placed the shaver over in the far corner of our sink counter to ensure it wouldn&#x27;t be bumped and fall over. Just to be clear, the charger will stand upright; that is not the design problem. It is the round bottom that makes it prone to falling over easily; even with the attached rounded edge (?) stability leg in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington XF8700 shaver is powered by a rechargeable Lithium battery. The shaver can run for 60 minutes on a full charge. Recharging takes around 90 minutes. It also has a Quick Charge feature that takes 5 minutes and will provide a 3-minute runtime. I got close to 5 minutes of runtime the first time I used the Quick Charge feature. Another really nice feature is a digital display built into the shaver handle that lets you know how much time is left on the battery; no bars or colored lights. I really like this feature. One last feature included in the box is a black faux suede drawstring travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver is not difficult. According to the instructions the shaver should be cleaned after every shave. The shaving blades are easy to remove for cleaning (see the instructions) and there is also nylon cleaning brush included in the box to ensure the shaving head is free of any hair. If you are shaving in the shower with a shaving gel or foam the excess residue can be washed away under the heavy stream of water near the shower head. If you are not shaving in the shower the excess gel/foam can be removed under the sink faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington XF8700 SmartEdge Advanced Foil Shaver is a vastly improved shaver from the ones I used decades ago. The manufacturer has included many of the features we only dreamed about when I was pinching and rubbing my face raw with the electric shavers of yesteryear. If Remington would consider redesigning the travel/charging stand, making it more stable and thus safer, I think this shaver would be a real bell ringer.blem point for some reviewers.

            <li> I have never had a thick beard so I rarely shave daily and I always shave in the shower.  I bought a wet-dry electric shaver back in the 1990s and it would get about 90% and I had to finish with a conventional blade if I wanted a close shave.  I&#x27;m having the same experience with the Remington XF8700.  It still takes some effort to get as close as I typically like.  If I had a 4 day growth I find that the Remington is better than the conventional blade at chopping it down, but the conventional blade is better at the finish.  I don&#x27;t think this is a criticism of the model as much as the drawbacks of electric razors in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experience feels better during and after the shave.  When I first tried one 20 year ago my face was in pain the entire day.  Not so this time.  It felt no different than a conventional blade.  Hat tip to the side-burn trimmer that can also trim those wild hairs that grow between haircuts.</li>
            <li> There must be two camps of shaver users in the world; those who successfully use an electric shaver and those who must use a razor.  I fall into the latter camp by necessity because only razors seem to work for me.  I’ve owned several electric shavers over the years and thought I’d give this one a try.  My historical experience with electric shavers is neutral to negative because they simply do not work well for me.  After using this product, I am going to stick with razors because the results are the same.  Regardless of bells and whistles, my rating is heavily influenced by the product’s ability to remove all of my facial hair like a razor can.  End result: After several vigorous and thorough shaving sessions using this product, I still have hairs on my face and neck which negates its usefulness and limits my star rating to only 3 out of 5.  If my face was hair fee, then my rating would be a 5.  I know people who use and prefer electric shavers and their faces are clean-cut and look great, so there must be a certain type of facial hair best suited for an electric shaver.  Aside from the product not working well for me, I like how it is totally water proof and easy to grip.  You can use shaving cream or any other facial lubricant.  Overall I think this shaver would be an excellent upgrade for anybody who’s successfully used electric shavers, but I wouldn’t recommend it for somebody like me who’s only had luck with regular razors.  I thought trying a high-tech electric shaver would produce a different outcome, but unfortunately my experience was the same.  What I like: - the battery is very good; 60 minutes on a full charge.  I used the shaver a few times and the charge barely dropped, so you could take this shaver and a long work trip and not need to bring the charger - the shaver is light and easy to grip.  The shaver has a tacky rubber coating which makes shaving in the shower very easy - it is totally waterproof - I had no razor burn or redness.  I have sensitive skin and I’ve had rashes before when I’ve used electric shavers.  What I dislike: - the shaver doesn’t work well for me.  My neck and mustache areas were not completely shaven.</li>
            <li> Years have gone by since I&#x27;ve owned an electric shaver and I was reminded with this one why it&#x27;s been years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviewers mentioning that their type of facial hair doesn&#x27;t match up well with ANY type of electric shaver, I too have this problem with my neck hair, hence not owning an electric this whole time. This shaver does an awesome job everywhere but unfortunately once I get below my jawline that&#x27;s where things change. This thing really mows thru my facial hair and does a pretty good job without any razor burn which is a problem I also have even with a blade. The tricky part is my neck hair, I&#x27;m assuming it grows in strange directions and not a continuous direction/pattern like my face. I&#x27;ve found that if I go in a diagonal pattern in four or five different directions and about 10-12 swipes it will get 90% of the shave completed, leaving me with a few razor swipes. Definitely not perfect but it sure beats making a mess with a razor and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first electric razor I can&#x27;t speak for others but I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed! The battery life is amazing! I&#x27;ve had this thing for about six weeks now, shaving almost every day but missing a few here and there and I&#x27;ve only needed to charge it once! That&#x27;s a huge upside to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the flip up trimmer built in to the back... While it works pretty well and flips up and closes pretty easily and while the shaver is still on! The location of it is kind of a pain in the behind. It&#x27;s located behind the head of the shaver and unless you get just the right angle trying to trim, you can&#x27;t see what you are doing! I&#x27;m actually surprised they made this feature without anybody testing it and making the same observation? I mean it&#x27;s better than not having it of course but it seems like something the company added as an afterthought. You won&#x27;t be doing any beard sculpting with this trimmer that&#x27;s for sure but it works well for a stray long hair here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver and would recommend it to anyone! If you have razor burn problems like I do, you won&#x27;t regret it. Multiple passes on my tricky neck hair still doesn&#x27;t give me those ugly red blotches I&#x27;m used to with a razor!</li>
            <li> Seems like a pretty good electric shaver. My husband is typically a blade shaver but has been interested in trying out an electric one. The last one he tried was probably 20+ years ago. Obviously this one is much better than that previous experience. He still does not feel like it does as good of a job as his regular blade razor but agrees that it is convenient for a quick shave.</li>
            <li> I had my husband try this - he&#x27;s always looking for the ideal shaver.  He thought this one worked well, but he was irritated by the fact that the on/off button was in his way and he hit it by accident a couple of times.  He just wasn&#x27;t that impressed.  I looked at it and it feels good in my hand; I like the shape and weight.  It holds a charge very well.  Some good - some bad.  I guess it depends on what you are looking for and/or expecting.</li>
            <li> I tried this very sleek-looking shaver in the shower with my favorite shave gel, and got a very comfortable, close shave that I was very pleased with. I was also very pleased with the digital time remaining counter. However, when I wanted to dry trim my moustache, the shaver head got in the way of my seeing the pop-up trimmer, and I couldn&#x27;t completely see what I was doing, otherwise I would have given this shaver five stars.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever! So, this shaver is marketed to men, hence its black surface and large casing that would fit most men&#x27;s hands; however, it is great for a woman, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, this cordless Remington SmartEdge shaver provides a very close shave. It is great for longer hair that has grown out a little, or for the overnight hair that is pretty close to the skin. It has two sets of blades that catch the longer hairs first, and then follow up with the shorter hairs. It has a stand and a rechargeable lithium battery. The first charge takes 24 hours, but after that, it holds a charge for a long time. This device can sit on the counter in its charger, or be stored in a drawer or cabinet and charged when needed. Also, for traveling, it has an easy lock/unlock system so it will not accidentally turn on and discharge in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this shaver is that it can be used dry or WET - as in during the shower. It is highly recommended to use only shave foam or gel when using this with water, but this feature alone is a great time saver and helps to condition the skin for a smooth and healthy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device comes with a travel bag and cleaning brush, and the blade head only needs replacement every six months or so.  It carries a 2-year warranty. Overall, the Remington SmartEdge is an excellent wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> Throughout the years I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between razor blade shavers and electric shavers. I did prefer razor blades  but it does get tedious with the foam, shave, rinse routine so about 10 to 15 years ago I switched to electric shavers. I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands in the $100 range like Norelco, Braun and Panasonic; hey that&#x27;s a lot of money for electric shavers! Why so many different brands? Searching for the perfect shave that gets close like a straight edge or razorblade I guess. My solution was to grow back my beard from my youth, relinquishing my old fashioned grooming technique for an  electric shaver. I found that this Remington Smart edge is really nice. It feels good in your hand and is lightweight and is not bulky which is a big plus. It does a good job and is pretty easy to manipulate around the edges of my beard. I used to get lazy and not shave the areas where I want no hair on my beard because of the hassle. This shaver is a breeze because it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs, glides over and cuts them close. To be honest I do have to go over certain areas several times but that is to be expected because the hairs don&#x27;t all grow in the same direction. The charger stand is flimsy looking and feeling but heck it&#x27;s only a stand to hold your shaver. By contrast, the shaver itself is sturdy and firm. It comes apart without falling apart and cleans easily with the provided brushes. It feels good in your hand which allows you to clean up those unwanted hairs comfortably. The travel case is perfect for the getaways.Overall I am extremely happy with this shaver and have no need for my old electric shavers or razor blades. For the price this is a good choice..</li>
            <li> Really great shaver. Gives a smooth, close shave with little effort. A full charge lasts me for a couple of weeks, so this is good if you&#x27;re going away on trips - most of the time you don&#x27;t need to take the charger. It&#x27;s a convenient size, lightweight, nice ergonomic design, feels good to hold. This is a 5 star product which I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! AAA+++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve updated this review today, 6-24-2015.  The update is about finding replacement blades and foils.  I still like the shaver, but......  UPDATE 6-24-2015:  I became curious about the cost of the replacement blade and foils.  I contacted Remington since Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell the replacement parts.  I talked to several different people there and none of them could find the part and they haven&#x27;t heard of the shaver either.  Since Remington can&#x27;t find the shaver or the parts - the following question is now posted on Remington&#x27;s main site.  It has been two weeks and still no answers.  Need Foils/screens and Cutters/blades for XF8700 - Part SPF-XF87 The model is the hyper series smartedge XF8700 with LED and a charging stand. It is the model that comes in black only. Not to be confused with the blue one XF8550, which uses a different part number.  I&#x27;m beginning to think the part that I need doesn&#x27;t exist. If I wasn&#x27;t holding the shaver in my hand I wouldn&#x27;t think that it exists either.  Review:  I&#x27;m not an electric shaver guy, but I keep one for touch-ups when I have short notice about being somewhere.  I had a Braun Linear shaver that lasted 15 years and finally started to lose it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge.  I started looking for a new shaver with a charging dock/stand.  Seriously, I looked for weeks and they all have that newest gimmick, the cleaning &#x27;tub&#x27; and abundant accessories.  Not a stand or charging dock to be found, so the shaver is either in the large cleaning tub or laying on the sink.  I refined my search and two Remington&#x27;s with charging stands popped up, this black one with a digital display and a blue one without the display.  Okay, after all of that, I&#x27;m here to say that this is one fabulous shaver, whether you are an electric shave guy or not.  It gets close, is smooth and worked on my sensitive skin right out of the box.  I have no hesitation recommending this Remington.</li>
            <li> Have had several foil shavers.  Best one is the Remington F5.  Worst one was Braun 5 and 7 series which cannot be used in the Cold because the battery dies if left in the car over night.  This XF8700 seemed well made, but did not shave any better than the much cheaper 5 and left me needing to re-shave every few hours.  I am now in my third year of the F5 and just  buy a replacement foil once a year.</li>
            <li> A better than decent electric shaver, but let me be honest, I am happy to use a two bladed disposable razor and basic shave cream (think Barbasol), and feel that I get a good, close, comfortable shave. I have yet to find an electric razor that offers the closeness or quickness of that standard - the razor being reviewed included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the gamut of electric razors over the years, cheap and good quality, and given the above caveat, this Remington stands up with the best of the lot I have tried. The closeness of the shave is adequate, though it requires repeated passes from different directions to ensure full coverage. Cleanup is easy, pop the head off and brush off the residue, pop the head back on, done. It is nice that the razor is wet/dry and usable in the shower (though in our drought state here in California, I don&#x27;t think I could justify the length of time it would take me to shave under running water). The charging cradle is somewhat of an oddity, I&#x27;m not sure whether it is meant to simplify carrying for travel of stowage, but it just seems ill-designed. A couple of other nice features - the hair trimmer on the back side of the unit, and the remaining minutes of charge display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, one of the better electric razors I have used, but it still doesn&#x27;t beat a blade for closeness. P-)</li>
            <li> Our family has used all the big name electric razors.  It seems we switch from one company to the other every few years just to try something new and based on reviews.  This Remington has worked flawlessly.  It is easy to operate, has a long lasting charge, is comfortable to handle, and leaves nothing but smooth skin behind.  This has replaced a Braun that has slowly been lacking even though the blades have been replaced a few times.  We expect this one to last four or five years.  If you are one who maybe experiences razor burn, likes the ability to quickly touch up areas, and prefer electric shavers - then this one will serve you well.</li>
            <li> My dad has been using this. He had previously given up on electric razors, but he really likes this. He is in his 70s, so his skin is rather thin and loose, but he still gets a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the major flaw with this thing and I can&#x27;t really. It&#x27;s exactly what it claims to be, and I am impressed! The ergonomic design gives it a comfy grip and works well as you shave over the contours of your face. It&#x27;s a close shave too, with no burns or nicks. I like that it works with gel and cream, I use both, but more gel when I&#x27;m on the road. It&#x27;s feels like good quality too, which it should, considering the price. It&#x27;s a quality product, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> My Husband really loves the Remington XF8700. He has used a few electric shavers similar to this in the past (only on the lower price end) and he has always had a problem with them making him breakout. So, the first test we did was to use this Remington XF8700 for a dry shave without aftershave or anything. It did not make him break out at all! He has used it about 4-5 times in the last 2 weeks since we have had the shaver. He has not had any problems at all. The battery life also seems to be great since he has not had to recharge it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also likes that he is not confined to the sink or shower when it comes to shaving. I don&#x27;t love that he shaves while dressing in the bedroom, but he does. It gives him a very close shave that definitely rivals his typical Gillette razor (which he has abandoned since this arrived). The Remington XF8700 also comes with a travel bag, a cleaning brush and a stand. It would make a very nice gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We definitely recommend this Remington electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Wish it were sharper though.</li>
