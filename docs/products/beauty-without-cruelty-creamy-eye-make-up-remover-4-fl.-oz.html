            <li>The creamy version of BWC eye make up remover is wonderful!</li>
            <li>A very good decision!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that doesn&#x27;t make me sacrifice quality for being conscientious about animal cruelty.</li>
            <li>Guess I will have to keep looking for a good cruelty-free make-up remover.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>

            <li>My favorite makeup remover!</li>
            <li>Love this eye make-up remover!  </li>
            <li>So happy to have a cruelty free product like this.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that works very well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, very reasonably priced eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Very smooth creamy eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li>I love this product as an eye make up remover.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I think is an ok eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found one I like better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used BWC specifically eye make up remover, the one you pour on a cotton pad and rub your eyes, it was ok, but when I tried this one, fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean without having to rub and using a damp cotton pad to remove.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought this was a good product.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on the eyes and lids.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and effective at removing both stubborn mascara and eyelid primer.  </li>
            <li>First of all, no pad required which is amazing cause those pads always irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily as an eye makeup remover</li>
            <li>will be using this product from now on as I feel my search for a chemical free eye make-up remover has ended.</li>
            <li>This really takes your eye makeup off without drying your eye area or burning and I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and creamy but doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes, and it powers though the ultra long-lasting makeup that I use.</li>
            <li>This company is really on the right track for those of us who are looking for good chemical free products that work and are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>and it was full of parabans.  </li>
            <li>Very clean  and nontoxic and really works to get off eye makeup.</li>
            <li>It does the job while being natural and cruelty free :)</li>
            <li>It works quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite item in my skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>I also use the BWC Vit C with CoQ10 facial cleanser and LOVE that too!</li>
            <li>This is awesome, is a thick creamy formulation, gentle but removes waterproof mascara and liner.</li>
            <li>Because of prior good experience with facial cleansers from BWC I decided to try out their eye makeup remover and am so glad</li>
            <li>This is a nice, creamy fragrance-free lotion that smoothly removes eye make-up with little effort.</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle on your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is creamy and very gentle on removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I accidentally globbed the remover onto a cotton ball the first night</li>
            <li>Gentle and thorough cleansing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and love how gentle it is.</li>
            <li>I pretty much wear eyeliner, eye shadow, mascara (NOT waterproof) and powder.</li>
            <li>In addition it works really well.  </li>
            <li>and this creamy formula is so gently when removing my make-up.</li>
            <li>I really like this make-up remover.  </li>
            <li>the other reviewers, maybe it will be better if you purchase a mascara that is from a brand that does not test on animals or use any animal products.</li>
            <li>This cream works better than any other eye makeup up remover I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I put a little more on my lashes to get the rest of my non-waterproof mascara off, and although it worked, my eyes started burning and stinging like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I was looking for a cream eye makeup remover and couldn&#x27;t locate the one I normally use.  </li>
            <li>It says that it is extra gentle, but I had a very noticeable burning sensation in my eyes both times I tried it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy enough to go on without the pad and efficient enough to work from the first try of gently rubbing it in with your finger tips.</li>
            <li>this cream, even the tiniest amount will get the job done, and will leave you skin feeling soft as a bonus.</li>
            <li>So far it has been working well for me</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing left over.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh, either.</li>
            <li>I bought this in trying to adopt a conscious lifestyle with was eco- and animal-friendly products.</li>
            <li>product itself is thick and - yes - creamy, more like a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s creamy and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t use that much.</li>
            <li>I find it hard to find cosmetic products that are affordable AND cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>Vitacost generally has competitive pricing.</li>
            <li>I found this product when I was looking for an affordable substitute for Cliniques Naturally genlte makeup remover and this is it&#x27;s equal.</li>
            <li>I massage it gently onto my closed eyes, wait 10 seconds and then tissue it off.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and until recently have only discovered vegan</li>
            <li>It gently takes off the mascara and all my other make up.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It gently takes off the mascara and all my other make up.  </li>
            <li> I have to mention the service gets 5 stars also, my first shipment was damaged in transit and they were constantly in touch by email letting me know what was going on and why my product was late.  </li>
            <li> Intense which has a waxy consistency and is usually a pain (literally) to remove, especially when using these liquid removers, even the oily ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around the eyes and have had trouble finding a product that does not make my lids burn, itch or give me a rash.</li>
            <li> Not sure what particular ingredient my skin is reacting to.</li>
            <li> I have used Eminence herbal eye make-up remover and Jason&#x27;s natural eye make-up remover pads, both of which irritated my eyes and was not very effective in removing my eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li> I only need a little bit, rub it on my closed eyelids, count to ten and then wipe it off with a cotton pad.  </li>
            <li> I used a tiny bit, and it took off a little of my mascara without making my eyes sting.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like eye make up removers, cause usually you have to rub the skin off to remove the racoon eyes.</li>
            <li> This felt somewhat heavy and greasy and made the skin around my eyes red and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> Because my makeup is NOT waterproof, I foresee people who wear waterproof makeup might have to rub harder to the eye makeup remove.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like other products.</li>
            <li> You can use it to get lipstick and other make-up off as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other reviewers that have reported stinging in the eyes, I have not had that experience.</li>
            <li> I have now moved on to the other [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my eye area, though sometimes it does sting my eye a little.</li>
            <li> I have to rub a little harder to get it off.</li>
            <li> I use a dry washcloth with the cream in the morning and in a few sweeps my black raccoon eyes are gone (yes, I go to sleep with mascara and eyeliner on).</li>
            <li> Since a little dab-will-do-you, I would expect this product to last at least a month and a half (depending on what your removing besides eye make-up) before ordering again.</li>
            <li> I find this one to be even creamier than the product I previously used.  </li>
            <li> I wear black eyeliner and mascara</li>
            <li> but I will not review it until I have used it for a little longer than this one.</li>
            <li> basically, if you use too little, it won&#x27;t take your makeup off, but it won&#x27;t sting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BWC is gentler on my skin, cruelty-free, and I&#x27;m no longer generating as much waste.</li>
            <li> but I used it a few times in the shower at the end of the night but the skin around my eye started getting all tender and sore.</li>
            <li> After some sketchy experiences with other vegan makeup removers that shall remain nameless, I finally landed on this beauty.</li>
            <li> No strong chemical smells.</li>
            <li> In the past, I used a product with unhealthy chemicals, and the darn stuff had to be reapplied several times to get my mascara off.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why I could use it without trouble in the beginning - maybe it took the adverse reaction a while to manifest itself.</li>
            <li> I like to support companies that do not test on animals, but I have to admit I was pretty disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> The reason is that I seem to have developed an allergic reaction to this eye makeup remover and now it DOES make my lids burn badly when I use it.</li>
            <li> It takes the waterproof mascara with at least 3  washing.</li>
            <li> , I am unable to say whether it is the product or the mascara that is causing the problem.</li>
            <li> Feb 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I am sad to say that I had to revise this review and downgrade from 5 to 3 stars.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works beautifully.  So happy to have a cruelty free product like this.</li>
            <li> I love this product as an eye make up remover. I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and love how gentle it is. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like other products. I found this product when I was looking for an affordable substitute for Cliniques Naturally genlte makeup remover and this is it&#x27;s equal.</li>
            <li> I like this cream because I don&#x27;t have to rub my eye to get even waterproof makeup off. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my eye area, though sometimes it does sting my eye a little. Prefer this over Neutrogena&#x27;s eye makeup remover lotion ONLY because BWC does not ever test on animals, nor is it owned by a parent company who does.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, creamy fragrance-free lotion that smoothly removes eye make-up with little effort. It&#x27;s easy on the eyes and lids. You can use it to get lipstick and other make-up off as well.  The fact that the product is animal cruelty-free is a bonus. Since a little dab-will-do-you, I would expect this product to last at least a month and a half (depending on what your removing besides eye make-up) before ordering again.</li>
            <li> I like to support companies that do not test on animals, but I have to admit I was pretty disappointed with this product.  I only used this product twice, and will not be using it again.  It says that it is extra gentle, but I had a very noticeable burning sensation in my eyes both times I tried it.  Guess I will have to keep looking for a good cruelty-free make-up remover.</li>
            <li> Since I am using this product I am not losing any lashes when I am removing my eye makeup. I apply it on my lashes, then I remove it with a soaked cotton. My eyes never got irritated.&lt;br /&gt;For the other reviewers, maybe it will be better if you purchase a mascara that is from a brand that does not test on animals or use any animal products.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Works well at removing vegan mineral eye shadow that I use. I accidentally globbed the remover onto a cotton ball the first night and it didn&#x27;t sting at all when applied. I have very sensitive skin and until recently have only discovered vegan cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it does not fully remove the vegan waterproof mascara that I use, even after vigorous scrubbing. Because I have only started wearing makeup again (yay for vegan products!), I am unable to say whether it is the product or the mascara that is causing the problem. I&#x27;m giving the makeup remover the benefit of the doubt on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other reviewers that have reported stinging in the eyes, I have not had that experience.</li>
            <li> Gentle and thorough cleansing! Love it.</li>
            <li> Works well. No rabbits harmed. Win-win.</li>
            <li> I think is an ok eye makeup remover. I kinda feels like it takes a bit to work it in.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to find cosmetic products that are affordable AND cruelty free.  This product hits both of those marks.  In addition it works really well.  I use it to remove eye makeup.  I only need a little bit, rub it on my closed eyelids, count to ten and then wipe it off with a cotton pad.  It takes off all of the mascara and eyeshadow and does not irritate my eyes.  I would strongly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Very smooth creamy eye make-up remover. No chemical smells, no eye irritation. It does the job while being natural and cruelty free :)</li>
            <li> This cream works better than any other eye makeup up remover I&#x27;ve had. In the past, I used a product with unhealthy chemicals, and the darn stuff had to be reapplied several times to get my mascara off. I was left with irritated skin and red eyes.&lt;br /&gt;With this cream, even the tiniest amount will get the job done, and will leave you skin feeling soft as a bonus.</li>
            <li> After some sketchy experiences with other vegan makeup removers that shall remain nameless, I finally landed on this beauty. It&#x27;s rich and creamy but doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes, and it powers though the ultra long-lasting makeup that I use. This is a great product that doesn&#x27;t make me sacrifice quality for being conscientious about animal cruelty.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  Was using the Almay lotion remover but read the ingredients and it was full of parabans.  This is awesome, is a thick creamy formulation, gentle but removes waterproof mascara and liner.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I was looking for a cream eye makeup remover and couldn&#x27;t locate the one I normally use.  I find this one to be even creamier than the product I previously used.  It works quickly and efficiently.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I have to mention the service gets 5 stars also, my first shipment was damaged in transit and they were constantly in touch by email letting me know what was going on and why my product was late.  Will definitely order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and effective at removing both stubborn mascara and eyelid primer.  My skin feels very clean without having to rub and using a damp cotton pad to remove.  This is my new favorite item in my skin care routine.  It makes the skin around my eyes feel moisturized afterward.</li>
            <li> This really takes your eye makeup off without drying your eye area or burning and I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Still hurting around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The creamy version of BWC eye make up remover is wonderful! I haven&#x27;t found one I like better.</li>
            <li> This is a great, very reasonably priced eye makeup remover. I have very sensitive skin around the eyes and have had trouble finding a product that does not make my lids burn, itch or give me a rash. Because of prior good experience with facial cleansers from BWC I decided to try out their eye makeup remover and am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is thick and - yes - creamy, more like a body moisturizer. I massage it gently onto my closed eyes, wait 10 seconds and then tissue it off. It gets rid of all of my eye makeup without a lot of rubbing. Two, three swipes with a Kleenex do the trick. It even removes my Clinique Quickliner Intense which has a waxy consistency and is usually a pain (literally) to remove, especially when using these liquid removers, even the oily ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product to anyone with sensitivity issues around the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Feb 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I am sad to say that I had to revise this review and downgrade from 5 to 3 stars. The reason is that I seem to have developed an allergic reaction to this eye makeup remover and now it DOES make my lids burn badly when I use it. I am not sure why I could use it without trouble in the beginning - maybe it took the adverse reaction a while to manifest itself. I have now moved on to the other [[ASIN:B002IY5IH6 Beauty Without Cruelty Eye Make-up Remover, 4-fl Ounce]]. So far it has been working well for me but I will not review it until I have used it for a little longer than this one.</li>
            <li> This felt somewhat heavy and greasy and made the skin around my eyes red and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went back to using Estee Lauder&#x27;s eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I switched from disposable make remover cloths to this cleanser and a baby washcloth and couldn&#x27;t be happier. BWC is gentler on my skin, cruelty-free, and I&#x27;m no longer generating as much waste. A very good decision!</li>
            <li> I wear black eyeliner and mascara and this creamy formula is so gently when removing my make-up. I use a dry washcloth with the cream in the morning and in a few sweeps my black raccoon eyes are gone (yes, I go to sleep with mascara and eyeliner on). It&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s creamy and lasts a long time (I buy 2-3 bottles per year). Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This product burns my eyes, however, it takes off all of the make up, including high-priced waterproof mascara. I was using a different eye make-up remover before and every time I woke up in the morning, I would have raccoon eyes. This is not so with Beauty without Cruelty. There is absolutely nothing left over. It&#x27;s great! I would definitely recommend this product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like eye make up removers, cause usually you have to rub the skin off to remove the racoon eyes. I&#x27;ve used BWC specifically eye make up remover, the one you pour on a cotton pad and rub your eyes, it was ok, but when I tried this one, fell in love with it. First of all, no pad required which is amazing cause those pads always irritate my skin. It&#x27;s creamy enough to go on without the pad and efficient enough to work from the first try of gently rubbing it in with your finger tips. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It takes the waterproof mascara with at least 3  washing.</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle on your eyes.  Does not contain parabens.  It lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t use that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a Tarte Waterproof Mascara that would stay on my lashes even after purchasing Tarte&#x27;s Waterproof eye makeup remover. When I used this remover, it removed everything. It&#x27;s not harsh, either. No strong chemical smells. My favorite makeup remover!</li>
            <li> Stings eyes and takes a lot of product to remove even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this eye make-up remover!  Very gentle and effective.&lt;br /&gt;Thsnk you!</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this was a good product. I used a tiny bit, and it took off a little of my mascara without making my eyes sting. I put a little more on my lashes to get the rest of my non-waterproof mascara off, and although it worked, my eyes started burning and stinging like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, if you use too little, it won&#x27;t take your makeup off, but it won&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;If you use enough to get your makeup off, it will sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s cruelty free. I don&#x27;t wear any waterproof makeup. I pretty much wear eyeliner, eye shadow, mascara (NOT waterproof) and powder. I didn&#x27;t have any problems removing everything except for the eyeliner on my upper eyelid. I have to rub a little harder to get it off. Because my makeup is NOT waterproof, I foresee people who wear waterproof makeup might have to rub harder to the eye makeup remove. Recommend price shopping on the Internet. Vitacost generally has competitive pricing.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily as an eye makeup remover and I have found that my e ye lashes have grown. it is creamy and very gentle on removing eye makeup. I have use it over 5 years now and keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use the make-up remover. I tried but I got an allergy. My face was on fire and red red red...</li>
            <li> I bought this in trying to adopt a conscious lifestyle with was eco- and animal-friendly products. I wanted to like it but I used it a few times in the shower at the end of the night but the skin around my eye started getting all tender and sore. Not sure what particular ingredient my skin is reacting to.</li>
            <li> I have used Eminence herbal eye make-up remover and Jason&#x27;s natural eye make-up remover pads, both of which irritated my eyes and was not very effective in removing my eye liner and mascara. I do not use waterproof mascara by the way, so I can not vouch for the effectiveness in removing that. I do use Revlon ColorStay eyeliner, Maybelline mascara (and Rejuva Minerals eye shadow) and this BWC eye make-up remover gets it ALL off! It does not irritate my eyes, it&#x27;s creamy (like a moisturizer), and it does not leave a greasy feeling on my eyes after I&#x27;ve wiped it off.&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this product from now on as I feel my search for a chemical free eye make-up remover has ended. I also use the BWC Vit C with CoQ10 facial cleanser and LOVE that too! This company is really on the right track for those of us who are looking for good chemical free products that work and are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that works very well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  Seller shipped promptly and product was as described.</li>
            <li> Very clean  and nontoxic and really works to get off eye makeup. Stings a bit if you get it in your eye but the sting does not last.&lt;br /&gt;I would get it again but looking for no sting at all. Maybe I will go ack to my jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I really like this make-up remover.  I use waterproof smudge proof mascara and used to use baby oil to remove it.  This remove does it all.  It gently takes off the mascara and all my other make up.  I will buy this again.</li>
