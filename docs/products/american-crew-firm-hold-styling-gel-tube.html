            <li>I am VERY satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Their conditioner is also outstanding to me and contains some sort of medicating lotion in it that makes your scalp feel great.</li>
            <li>This gel smells great and has a okay hold.</li>
            <li>but I also bought this gel from somewhere else and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Good hold, not too flaky, nice scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good strong hold and great smell.</li>
            <li>Best if used right after shower when hair is the wettest.  </li>
            <li>I arrived right on time and all was great!</li>
            <li>right, it is the best hair gel I have used to date.</li>
            <li>This is the best gel out there right now.</li>
            <li>my husband&#x27;s favorite gel!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It styles my hair with lots of body and volume, but doesn&#x27;t leave (too many) flakes on my head!</li>
            <li>Love this gel!  </li>
            <li>first, the smell of this product is excellent.</li>
            <li>He has tried many others without successfully keeping his hair in place.</li>
            <li>Your hair will love it!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with what I recieved and will indeed order this way again!</li>
            <li>I have been using CREW for about 10 years, I loved the product because it held my very fine hair in place and CREW doesn&#x27;t flake during the day for me.</li>
            <li>So I figured I&#x27;d try this out with all the great reviews noting how strong the hold is and</li>
            <li>This is a great product and was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks and God Bless!!!!!</li>
            <li>Fortunately for the great customer service of Amazon.com, I received a refund and order the product again with no issues.  </li>
            <li>The size of the bottle is huge and the price was great for the size.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been looking for some gel to keep my hair nice and curly.</li>
            <li>With the hefty price tag I would have thought it would keep my hair nice and curly.</li>
            <li>what the heck kind of stink they put in it, but</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it because the quality is incredible.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp and has a nice scent</li>
            <li>My husband uses this each day and it keeps,his hair nice.  </li>
            <li>Works as good as the product sold in the salon but was better priced on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>I price compared and was able to find this gel for a great price right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this brand.  </li>
            <li>I thought the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>The crew gel has a clean refreshing scent and good hold.</li>
            <li>It smells like very cheap cologne if you ask me.  </li>
            <li>Very light, keeps my hair in place (whether spiked hair</li>
            <li>It has a nice hold, and is easily washed out.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong if you use a lot, kind of chemical-ish</li>
            <li>Large bottle is cost effective &amp; this is a good product.</li>
            <li>This bottle is HUGE!</li>

            <li>Will order again. :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best gel, but for the money it&#x27;s a solid performer.    </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a better price for it anywhere</li>
            <li>Much more product at a better price than a retail store.  </li>
            <li>The price here was better than he pays in salon.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s top of the line gel.</li>

            <li>Will not change it for another gel unless there is something better.</li>
            <li>I have used this hair gel for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I would also suggest buying a pump for it, as the top can sometimes get gunned up.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with a variety of hair gels, but this seems better than the lower dollar stuff you can pick up at any walmart.</li>
            <li>I used another brand that was ok.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite hair gel.</li>

            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It has a neutral scent and doesn&#x27;t require much to keep the hair happy in its place.  </li>

            <li>Whats not to love.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better deal out there for a hair product of this quality.</li>
            <li>Two of the 8.45oz bottles in stores cost more than one of these 33.8oz bottles on</li>
            <li>I like the product and am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS MY HUSBAND&#x27;S FAVORITE HAIR DRESSING.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>my husbands favorite.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, in great shape and has been great for filling other bottles for home, work and gym.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was a very significant savings.</li>
            <li>Works great, smells good, and it doesn&#x27;t flake up when dry.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good.</li>
            <li>As long as you have hair and intend to use gel, this is a great deal!</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>however I found a large bottle of gel from Walmart with a pump top for 3 bucks that works just as good</li>
            <li>This product will give you an excellent hold after blow drying, since you blow dry it in, there won&#x27;t be any shine, and no texture or separation,</li>
            <li>This product smells good and is easy to wash off your hands, but that&#x27;s just about the only good thing I have to say about.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was for the large bottle is good.</li>
            <li>Better value and huge bottle.</li>
            <li>This is by far a great deal.</li>
            <li>Holds well, best things is no flakes unless a lot of the other products I have used.</li>
            <li>Holds well, best things is no flakes unless a lot of the other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I rest my head on there as I am driving and it just means I have to clean my head rest more often.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews of Short Sexy Hair, I had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>You gotta make sure you keep your hair clean.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very quickly, but the packaging was damaged in transit.  </li>
            <li>American crew the best gel there is  always worth the money you spend  </li>
            <li>Worth the price, American Crew products are the best I have found.</li>
            <li>I have used, but it is strong.</li>
            <li>The hold is not as strong as SSH.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake or have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>People who say this gel isn&#x27;t strong, well think again, it works.  </li>
            <li>Holds great and washes out very easy and doesn&#x27;t leave your dry or damaged.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair healthy and full looking.</li>
            <li>I needed more gel and just could not pay full price at a store.  </li>
            <li>I bought this large bottle and it has lasted me for 2 years or more!</li>
            <li>The gel is fine and the shipping was fine.  </li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery and reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Holds fine hair well.</li>
            <li>I have had my hair stylist order the huge bottle for years</li>
            <li>huge bottle</li>
            <li>Great gel with solid hold.</li>
            <li>Crew Firm Hold Styling gel is wonderful.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s ditched his cheap gels and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want the feeling that with a light snap, I could break off a piece of my hair.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the putties and the cheap gel</li>
            <li>What a great value since I thought I was paying for something smaller and</li>
            <li>If you really need your hair to stay in place and still look nice, this will work.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff I use it every day holds my hair all day even when I go to the Gym and have a big workout</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price on Amazon and an even greater deal with Prime.</li>
            <li>This is the only Crew product I have tried and I am a lifer!&lt;br /&gt;This was priced great and came in a bag just in-case!&lt;br /&gt;No issues</li>
            <li>overall great product cant complain</li>
            <li>Makes your hair smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>Great overall experience..!</li>
            <li>The ONLY hair gel I will ever use--it has a great texture, smell to it.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>And then I found this for $27 and free shipping.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair still feeling light, yet controlled.</li>
            <li>For the price of 33.8 oz, it is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>We started to realize it was the cheap hair gels he was using.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend your money on cheap hair gel</li>
            <li>Product has great hold for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>This gel doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made like some others that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Glad amazon sells big bottle at a fair price.</li>
            <li>This gel works great, smell great and last for a long time without making your hair too crunchy.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>If anyone&#x27;s aware of a better gel that never flakes</li>
            <li>This bottle is more than twice the size for a slightly higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the price and the size of the bottle we got such a good deal for such a great gel.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product for taming wild, frizzy, curly hair, and straight.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>The gel holds your hair up great and for a long time! ...</li>
            <li>This makes for a much more natural and sophisticated look.  </li>
            <li>Clean quality hair product.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean fragrance smell too.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to scrub your hands with soap and water in order to get clean.</li>
            <li>This gel worked really well, husband really liked it, but when i wanted to order more, the price was way too high.  </li>
            <li>Great hold, doesn&#x27;t fake and it smells good, but not too strong of as scent.</li>
            <li>My cousin works with special needs people, and out of habit, he patted my head.  </li>
            <li>It actually dries VERY fast and holds great.</li>
            <li>Not so much for me, I had to spend more time trying to flatten my hair.</li>
            <li>I guess the only good thing about this gel is that your hair will not flake.  </li>
            <li>Did not want to pay full price at the store for hair gel</li>
            <li>Have noticed this does not come cheap, a price worth paying at times.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t flake, holds well, good amount of shine and last forever.</li>
            <li>It has a good balance that can shape well and last a while.  </li>
            <li>The gel stays on for the full day, I play racquetball about 3 hours a day, which causes me to sweat bullets.</li>
            <li>The product smells good and doesn&#x27;t flake white even after all day of use.</li>
            <li>American crew good hold hair</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; bottle should last for a good while.</li>
            <li>nice and soft hair gel for cool hair styles..</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price...</li>
            <li>which I like, the smell is very pleasant, unlike certain other brands that smell like horse poop</li>
            <li>Gel is great, not too stiff and combs out easily.</li>
            <li>AC on the other hand has a great consistency, allows you to apply it evenly, without clumping your hair together.  </li>
            <li>This gel is really great even after a day of work and other activities.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this gel, it washes very easy with water, keeps your hair style right in place all day,</li>
            <li>The product was shipped to me quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipments arrive quickly and the product is legitimate.</li>
            <li>I also like the mild scent.</li>
            <li>Great deal, super price, super fast delivery,  will be back!!</li>
            <li>Better yet, it has a suttle cologne scent which I appreciate much more than most products which typically have a floral scent.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipped it relatively quickly and It came in undamaged.</li>
            <li>quick shipping, as described</li>
            <li>It also dries relatively quickly and keeps your hair in place without that &amp;#34;slicked back&amp;#34; appearance.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the Crew \\&quot;Super</li>
            <li>I have been using cheap of the counter hair gel all my life, But after trying this product for the first time i can tell the difference in the way it smells and the way your hair looks.</li>
            <li>Works exceptionally to give more volume, and give all the benefits of firm hold without any flaking or crunchy appearance.</li>
            <li>I typically have been paying around $20-$22 dollars for a 15.7 ounce bottle from Great Clips or Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>exactly as photographed!</li>
            <li>Just as described and lighting fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Such a better deal!  </li>
            <li>He bought the little pump for the bottle and it works great for him.</li>
            <li>and although it doesn&#x27;t smell strong it has a nice scent to it unlike some other gels.</li>
            <li>I love dealing with folks on Amazon when I get the same quality stuff for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is still pricey but it is worth every ounce.  </li>
            <li>Like that I feel I am getting my money&#x27;s worth on this purchase.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>Economically packaged.</li>
            <li>If applied properly, the gel gives a nice textured look of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is not overly powerful, but fragrant.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s over 1 year&#x27;s worth just to give you an idea of size.  </li>
            <li>As it turned out, the old gel caused most or all of the flakes.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair gel by far.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed with quick delivery</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING even in a mega snowstorm in NY!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got the type of hair that sticks straight up without gel, worked out great when I used to spike my hair in middle school and high school,</li>
            <li>I have found that an easy fix is to use a hair dryer and comb to get it exactly how you want it and dry it more quickly.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of thickness, holds all day, smells good, adds a little shine, easy to rinse off...and love the big bottle with the optional pump.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to be saving so much money by buying this.</li>
            <li>Other than the cost, this gel is really good.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into style then you have come to the right place.</li>
            <li>What I love most about this hair gel is that it holds my hair all day no matter what, even after taking a nap or riding in the car with the windows rolled down.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re like me that&#x27;s tried everything its worth it to pay the price of all the products you&#x27;ve tried to get it right the first time, you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>I used to use many other types of products prior to AC, but was impressed by this one simple thing.</li>
            <li>The American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel is a great product, as are most Crew products.</li>
            <li>The American crew gel I bought in the past had a very strong distinct and pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li>The stiffness is exactly the right amount.  </li>
            <li>Will certainly buy again!</li>
            <li>Mine came quickly and was the real deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really frugal with my hair gel purchases because I believed that hair gel isn&#x27;t really that important</li>
            <li>: Does not take very much to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight hair</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It has a nice mild smell that isn&#x27;t offensive and is slightly musty.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it does not cause any flaking, especially in the drier winter months this is a huge plus!  </li>
            <li>It is much higher quality and my husband&#x27;s hair stopped breaking off - he is 49 and has his hair growing back on the top of his head.</li>
            <li>Starting searching for a better price and found it here along with no shipping costs.  </li>
            <li>because of the higher reviews,</li>
            <li>For some reason, this is cheaper than the SHORT SEXY HAIR GEL brand.</li>
            <li>He has been using it for many years and will not stray from American Crew.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have used this gel for the last five years and this is cheaper than I&#x27;ve ever been able to find it.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I will continue buying here at a quarter of the price for twice as much!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>So it will probably work better for very short and spiky hair.  </li>
            <li>BTW, I have Asian hair (although softer than most).</li>
            <li>Way better deal than what I&#x27;ve been paying locally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>American Crew is the top Men&#x27;s gel on the market.</li>
            <li>I have used this same product for many years I&#x27;m working on my third bottle. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and it was the real deal!</li>
            <li>The top had cracked open and all the gel had spilled out.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>So glad to have found it on Amazon (terrific savings !).</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and have always been satisfied, but smaller sizes are not very cost effective.  </li>
            <li>My husband really loves it!</li>
            <li>My husband has used this product for many years and has paid a lot of money for tiny bottles.</li>
            <li>I have found nothing better than American Crew.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using american crew for quite some time, and i love it.</li>
            <li>I knew exactly what I was ordering since I have used this product before.</li>
            <li>Fast and definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This gel also seems to last longer and control the hair better.</li>
            <li>However, this is probably standard for most hair gels anyway.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve found a bigger size for a better price, that&#x27;s just bonus.  </li>
            <li>This is a bigger bottle and a better price.</li>
            <li>so this isn&#x27;t my area of expertise, but I was given a jug of this stuff by a friend who worked at a salon a few years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job at providing a firm hold, but it does not flake when it is roughed up.    </li>
            <li>I like it because it provides a good hold but does not feel heavy, sticky, or gewy.  </li>
            <li>Nice to purchase in a large size, I refill older smaller containers for ease of use.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for some good gel for your super thick hair</li>
            <li>Just plain good stuff.</li>
            <li>This is normal so, other than that, this product is a good buy.</li>
            <li>It smells great, spreads on nicely, and keeps my hair in place without a stiff, crunchy feel or slick look.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I bought this huge bottle for just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>Plus if you are active, own a motorcycle, convertible or whatever... even if it gets messed up by 70+ mph wind or a women who likes messing up your hair.</li>
            <li>I am slowly buying more and more variety products with confidence from Amazon.com</li>
            <li>The large volume container is pretty convenient.</li>
            <li>I keep hair tight and clean cut with wavy spike at top.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of use, I switched to a gel called Short Sexy Hair, ridiculous name, AMAZING product!</li>
            <li>Ideal for styling short to medium length hair without being overly stiff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to buy this gel as long as I have hair &#x3D;).</li>
            <li>not so much when trying to have a clean, combed over, adult look.</li>
            <li>This is not a firm hold but a mild version of gel...</li>
            <li>And I am very particular with my hair (just ask my friends).&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>it is easy to put on the hair and truly holds the hair in place for the entire day.</li>
            <li>At least i got a good deal the first time.</li>
            <li>This Gel is a large bottle that lasts a while.  </li>
            <li>These are the large bottles.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the shine of this product; however, the hold isn&#x27;t that strong if your hair isn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s got a good hold but isn&#x27;t super heavy.</li>
            <li>I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy this large bottle then the 8 oz bottle in the store.</li>
            <li>The packaging was a little leaky, but the product is amazing</li>
            <li>This bottle of gel is double the size of what&#x27;s available at stores, and just a few dollars more!</li>
            <li>But their mark-up is pretty high.</li>
            <li>Very good quality and not too expensive.</li>
            <li>does a good job, but it will leave your hair quite hard and has a lot of alcohol in it...</li>
            <li>how fast it dries...</li>
            <li>The hair gel is very oily so you probably don&#x27;t need to apply much to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to combine it with my primary gel and use different techniques because now that I have it</li>
            <li>Fast Deliver/Good Product</li>
            <li>Lasts my brother a whole year</li>
            <li>And shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this gel, and the price on Amazon was so much cheaper per ounce then anywhere else on the web.</li>
            <li>Thus, I think the AC gel is very versatile.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real thing or not, n turns out to be a real thing, tho</li>
            <li>Crew made my hair stronger, stopped much of the hair loss.</li>
            <li>the hold is really strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really helps with styling.</li>
            <li>Crew also works very well for spike hair styles....</li>
            <li>It makes it really convenient.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really come off on my pillows either.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>Tried others to save some money, but coud&#x27;n&#x27;t find anything with as much control, yet flexible.  </li>
            <li>My hubby loves this gel but costs so much at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, medium length.  </li>
            <li>second the quality of the gel is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I would enjoy purchasing American Crew gel again.</li>
            <li>so when I sawthis  33.8 oz bottle  for a reasonable price I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li>I like this a whole lot, I have never used before</li>
            <li>I really like this gel</li>
            <li>My scalp never itched like this before with American crew, but has with cheap store brand.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li>This product is much cheaper to buy at Amazon.com, and I splurged and bought a pump to go with it.  </li>
            <li>Twenty years ago it probably would have worked well on my hair when it was much thicker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much stronger than the pomades and creams I was using before, AND let&#x27;s not forget about the unbeatable price.</li>
            <li>Fabulous price....will be back!!</li>
            <li>not flake after drying like those cheap gels you get at local drugstores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to all</li>
            <li>THREW THE WHOLE BOTTLE OUT.</li>
            <li>It is as advertised and much cheaper than buying in a store.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for medium to thick hair.</li>
            <li>It provides him the hold he needs, while leaving his hair nice and soft to the touch, and unlike other hair gels, it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t cause bumps on his scalp.</li>
            <li>It is really old styling gel not as I was expecting, I love crew products as i am using the small ones and they work fine.</li>
            <li>Better then the other ones.  </li>
            <li>Works fine in holding your hair in place all day long.</li>
            <li>but if you buy the large size on Amazon it&#x27;s a good deal because you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li>Men with a full head of hair need only a dollop about the size of a quarter to hold your hair in place all day.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li>Which is good if you wear cologne, because too many scents can smell bad.    </li>
            <li>Get ultra matte for a better hold with less shine</li>
            <li>Price is so much better than what you would find in the stores, as much as half the price.</li>
            <li>Almost twice the quantity for only a dollar or so more than local retailers.  </li>
            <li>already was particular to this gel,.</li>
            <li>I have classic Dennis the Menace head.</li>
            <li>American Crew products are in my opinion some of the best on the Market and for the price that you can get it for on Amazon you just cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li>This gel works great for wet or shower dried hair.  </li>
            <li>I loved the large bottle for the same price as a small salon size.</li>
            <li>I love this gel because it requires very little to give a nice firm hold.</li>
            <li>It smells good but not strong enough.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it yo any guy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying online.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend , dont think I am going to change to another brand anytime soon, or ever....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this setup.</li>
            <li>The bottle has lasted very long, the product has a great smell, and the gel leaves hair looking natural yet firm.  </li>
            <li>this gel is not strong enough and he needs to use short sexy hair, but with in a week he is able to use crew and he loves it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use a spray bottle and damp your hair a little bit before applying for a nicer look.</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised initially by the strong smell (strong compared to the old gel) and was ready to stop using it</li>
            <li>Holds hair really well and is not stiff.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not like concrete either.</li>
            <li>It also has a slight scent, I can&#x27;t really describe it, but its subtle and pretty great.</li>
            <li>Crew is a great gel and at this size and price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>My husband also uses it when he loses or forgets to pack his own styling gel.  </li>
            <li>and it holds much better and says firm hold on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price if you use it daily.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re all pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>Does not work as well as the Aveda product that I normally buy, but i was substantially cheaper, if you want a firmer hold go with the Aveda...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of this gel when dried and find it intoxicating.</li>
            <li>i use this gel daily and got this about 2 years ago and still not even half way done amazing how long it will last love the smell</li>
            <li>I have short spikes it works about right..</li>
            <li>Also, the gel, when it dries does not cause me to have any flakes (I have dark hair, so I can easily see flakes if were any.)</li>
            <li>just hold, which is fine because you&#x27;re finishing with a different product to achieve your final look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>American crew gel firm hold is the best I ever used I Ben using it for the past 10+ years</li>
            <li>This type of gel makes my hair like other cheap gel i used to use from supermarket.</li>
            <li>bottle because that&#x27;s the biggest size they carry where I live</li>
            <li>The gel has good hold on my hair but is still light and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, which admittedly is on the thin side.</li>
            <li>Works well, no perfume odor and hair looks natural, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Granted, it is not something your significant other will want to run their hands through, nor should they get to, because if you&#x27;re using this gel, you care about the way your hair looks, and you don&#x27;t want the \\&quot;Something about</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I have used many gels in the past that make it look like my hair is snowing when the gel dries.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted, for cheaper than we could get it in our local retail stores!</li>
            <li>Bought it for my significant other and he loves this product .</li>
            <li>It appears to be authentic and I have been buying this thing for the past two years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many of the other gels and they cause dandruff and flakes while American Crew does not promote dandruff or flakes on my hair.</li>
            <li>I like American Crew, and this product does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>Other mousse and gel products may look good when I leave the house, but fall apart within a few hours.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m wondering is it cut down with cheap gel.</li>
            <li>top of bottle was not securely shut and it would have leaked with a few more bumps to the external box.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you are having flaking/too much hold issues with your current gel.</li>
            <li>I used the gel this morning, and it is slightly firmer than the light hold, and does not make my hair feel like a brick.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t get too hard (unless you use too much) and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>and I prefer this gel because it&#x27;s more harder and dry.  </li>
            <li>Makes it easy to brush through my hair after it&#x27;s dried for a soft controlled wave.</li>
            <li>I even tried using much more than I have used of previous gels I have purchased - same results.  </li>
            <li>The other reviewers have pretty much got this one</li>
            <li>Large bottle that should last about 1 year for me.  </li>
            <li>these large bottles last me almost two years.</li>
            <li>I saved my smaller bottle and will fill it from this large one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle, and will last a very long time!</li>
            <li>I have short hair that I like to have a little hold on, and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and since this is my husband&#x27;s favorite styling gel, I decided to save a little and get the larger bottle.</li>
            <li>but if it dries a way you don&#x27;t like, simple add a little more, style the way you wanted and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no too gunky and hard, and it smells ok.  </li>
            <li>man...it smells like old people.</li>
            <li>I was worried about purchasing the firm hold gel, as I&#x27;ve been used to the light hold for years.</li>
            <li>This is not Firm Hold.</li>
            <li>The real thing, for an amazingly low price!</li>
            <li>This is the strongest gel I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>He was surprised that my hair was solid--like a helmet.  </li>
            <li>With fast shipping and the bigger bang for my buck, I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy this in the store again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old man and after I color my hair</li>
            <li>but nobody cares what an old man does these days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>applied whole day, your hair is set to the same position.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying it at a regular store.</li>
            <li>It just looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li>Not using too much water is the key.</li>
            <li>off it just too much for personal use, you have to buy a plastic bottle to pour some of  it  into.  </li>
            <li>I thought, is it old?</li>
            <li>It dries light but with a firm hold.  </li>
            <li>IT HOLDS HIS HAIR AND LOOKS NATURAL.</li>
            <li>I really like everything about it except for the price of the smaller bottles.  </li>
            <li>Has a masculine scent to it</li>
            <li>Now that I use Amazon I found this product for way cheaper than major stores and buying the large bottle will last you months.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it make me wonder if the bottle was filled by a manufacturer other than American Crew.</li>
            <li>TOO MUCH FLAKING BOUGHT AMERICAN CREW CLASSIC FIBER BLUE.</li>
            <li>Quick to arrive and what I expected!!</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a gel to replace the much less expensive gel I used for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>I feel American Crew&#x27;s product are of decent quality.</li>
            <li>doent hold much though so be carefull if you planning to buy it for long spikes..</li>
            <li>I buy the large bottle and refill several smaller bottles for travel purposes.</li>
            <li>I have very fine &amp; thin hair</li>
            <li>Short Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel, Packaging</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new experiment on amounts you may need until you reach what you feel is enough.  </li>
            <li>A bit expensive, but men don&#x27;t spend as much on products so that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to the product from an old girlfriend, back when I was in my early 20s.</li>
            <li>My husband continues to switch around with other brands, but for me this is the only gel that gives me the light, all-day-lift that my long hair requires.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only recently started using this particular brand of hair gel.</li>
            <li>Its thick enough to easily style moist hair, but not too thick so that it is like using rubber cement so he dosent use alot like he does with short sexy hair.</li>
            <li>But when it \\&quot;scrunches out\\&quot;, you get a very natural, minimal shine soft hair with a moveable hold that is still in control without any flakes!  </li>
            <li>this barely held.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using American Crew products since the early 1990&#x27;s after my hair stylist recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>Same as the crew I purchase in the salon only much cheaper same quality.</li>
            <li>Every day, by the end of the day it looks like I barely or didn&#x27;t apply this gel at all.</li>
            <li>Barely holds, even though it says maximum hold.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not a big supporter of hair \\&quot;gels\\&quot;, this product surprised me.</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but for the size, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>One down thing is that it should be a bit more concentrated instead of being diluted, so it takes time for the gel to hold firmly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different gels in the past: from the standard cheap junk you get at your local drug store; to the high end gels from the salons.</li>
            <li>a side note, I do not like gels that are extremely shiny when dried and this gel when dry looks more natural.</li>
            <li>The color is clear so even if you use slightly too much you can&#x27;t really tell unlike other products.</li>
            <li>SSH, on the other hand, does have a much stronger, but stiffer hold.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the other brand I used, this gel does not flake nearly as much.</li>
            <li>The cool thing too is that you can have a wet harden look or you can have a soft look depending how you style your hair with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very dark brown to black and this product gives it a nice clean-looking shine without looking all wet like some \\&quot;shine\\&quot; products do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used about a quarter size amount of this gel everyday, as well as my 9yo son a few times a week, and after purchasing in Jan of 2014 am just now in need of more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used American Crew firm hold for many years and decided to order the largest size online and save a little money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used hair gel or hair spray or anything like that before, so I can&#x27;t really compare this product with other similar products.  </li>
            <li>Have been using American Crew for last 10 years, and not even thinking of trying another one foe near future.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks natural and in place all day long.  </li>
            <li>The thing that I liked about the Firm Holding Gel was that there was no real &amp;#34;flaking&amp;#34; once the product dried in your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to stay stiff all day, and doesn&#x27;t wear out like other gels.</li>
            <li>When he sweated or played sports, it would drip down his face and really irritate it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick gel, but quickly absorbs into/onto the hair and virtually disappears.</li>
            <li>they believe that Amazon isn&#x27;t careful enough about ensuring that NEW products come from the manufacturer and are instead refurbished.</li>

            <li> Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Their conditioner is also outstanding to me and contains some sort of medicating lotion in it that makes your scalp feel great.</li>
            <li> This gel smells great and has a okay hold.</li>
            <li> but I also bought this gel from somewhere else and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Good hold, not too flaky, nice scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good strong hold and great smell.</li>

            <li> right, it is the best hair gel I have used to date.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It styles my hair with lots of body and volume, but doesn&#x27;t leave (too many) flakes on my head!</li>
            <li> Love this gel!  </li>
            <li> first, the smell of this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> He has tried many others without successfully keeping his hair in place.</li>
            <li> Your hair will love it!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with what I recieved and will indeed order this way again!</li>
            <li> I have been using CREW for about 10 years, I loved the product because it held my very fine hair in place and CREW doesn&#x27;t flake during the day for me.</li>
            <li> So I figured I&#x27;d try this out with all the great reviews noting how strong the hold is and</li>
            <li> This is a great product and was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Thanks and God Bless!!!!!</li>
            <li> Fortunately for the great customer service of Amazon.com, I received a refund and order the product again with no issues.  </li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is huge and the price was great for the size.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been looking for some gel to keep my hair nice and curly.</li>
            <li> With the hefty price tag I would have thought it would keep my hair nice and curly.</li>
            <li> what the heck kind of stink they put in it, but</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it because the quality is incredible.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp and has a nice scent</li>
            <li> My husband uses this each day and it keeps,his hair nice.  </li>
            <li> Works as good as the product sold in the salon but was better priced on Amazon.  </li>

            <li> Quite honestly, my hair just doesn&#x27;t behave itself.  </li>
            <li> There are many good things about this product.  </li>

            <li> Great gel, much better then the cheap stuff at the store.</li>
            <li> great price good gel and fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strong that it takes a good rinse before it comes out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a light fragrance that is pleasant.</li>
            <li> But I can tell you that it seems to work as well as I had hoped, and it washes out very easily.</li>

            <li> Very light, keeps my hair in place (whether spiked hair</li>
            <li> It has a nice hold, and is easily washed out.</li>

            <li> You can&#x27;t get a better price for it anywhere</li>
            <li> Much more product at a better price than a retail store.  </li>
            <li> The price here was better than he pays in salon.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s top of the line gel.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best value I&#x27;ve been able to find for Crew gel.  </li>

            <li> Will not change it for another gel unless there is something better.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair gel for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I would also suggest buying a pump for it, as the top can sometimes get gunned up.</li>

            <li> and this gel does its job in holding and styling into anything I want for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with a variety of hair gels, but this seems better than the lower dollar stuff you can pick up at any walmart.</li>
            <li> I used another brand that was ok.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite hair gel.</li>

            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It has a neutral scent and doesn&#x27;t require much to keep the hair happy in its place.  </li>
            <li> I like  Loreal for men better</li>
            <li> Better still, buying the product on Amazon saved me 50% off of the cost at my retail store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;American Crew for years and  love it.  </li>

            <li> Whats not to love.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better deal out there for a hair product of this quality.</li>
            <li> Two of the 8.45oz bottles in stores cost more than one of these 33.8oz bottles on</li>
            <li> I like the product and am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS MY HUSBAND&#x27;S FAVORITE HAIR DRESSING.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> my husbands favorite.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, in great shape and has been great for filling other bottles for home, work and gym.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was a very significant savings.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells good, and it doesn&#x27;t flake up when dry.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good.</li>
            <li> As long as you have hair and intend to use gel, this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> however I found a large bottle of gel from Walmart with a pump top for 3 bucks that works just as good</li>
            <li> This product will give you an excellent hold after blow drying, since you blow dry it in, there won&#x27;t be any shine, and no texture or separation,</li>
            <li> This product smells good and is easy to wash off your hands, but that&#x27;s just about the only good thing I have to say about.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price was for the large bottle is good.</li>
            <li> Better value and huge bottle.</li>
            <li> This is by far a great deal.</li>
            <li> Holds well, best things is no flakes unless a lot of the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Holds well, best things is no flakes unless a lot of the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I rest my head on there as I am driving and it just means I have to clean my head rest more often.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews of Short Sexy Hair, I had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> You gotta make sure you keep your hair clean.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly, but the packaging was damaged in transit.  </li>
            <li> American crew the best gel there is  always worth the money you spend  </li>
            <li> Worth the price, American Crew products are the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I have used, but it is strong.</li>
            <li> The hold is not as strong as SSH.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake or have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> People who say this gel isn&#x27;t strong, well think again, it works.  </li>
            <li> Holds great and washes out very easy and doesn&#x27;t leave your dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair healthy and full looking.</li>
            <li> I needed more gel and just could not pay full price at a store.  </li>
            <li> I bought this large bottle and it has lasted me for 2 years or more!</li>
            <li> The gel is fine and the shipping was fine.  </li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery and reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Holds fine hair well.</li>
            <li> I have had my hair stylist order the huge bottle for years</li>
            <li> huge bottle</li>
            <li> Great gel with solid hold.</li>
            <li> Crew Firm Hold Styling gel is wonderful.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s ditched his cheap gels and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the feeling that with a light snap, I could break off a piece of my hair.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the putties and the cheap gel</li>
            <li> What a great value since I thought I was paying for something smaller and</li>
            <li> If you really need your hair to stay in place and still look nice, this will work.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff I use it every day holds my hair all day even when I go to the Gym and have a big workout</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price on Amazon and an even greater deal with Prime.</li>
            <li> This is the only Crew product I have tried and I am a lifer!&lt;br /&gt;This was priced great and came in a bag just in-case!&lt;br /&gt;No issues</li>
            <li> overall great product cant complain</li>
            <li> Makes your hair smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> Great overall experience..!</li>
            <li> The ONLY hair gel I will ever use--it has a great texture, smell to it.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> And then I found this for $27 and free shipping.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair still feeling light, yet controlled.</li>
            <li> For the price of 33.8 oz, it is dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> We started to realize it was the cheap hair gels he was using.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on cheap hair gel</li>
            <li> Product has great hold for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> This gel doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made like some others that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Glad amazon sells big bottle at a fair price.</li>
            <li> This gel works great, smell great and last for a long time without making your hair too crunchy.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> If anyone&#x27;s aware of a better gel that never flakes</li>
            <li> This bottle is more than twice the size for a slightly higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the price and the size of the bottle we got such a good deal for such a great gel.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product for taming wild, frizzy, curly hair, and straight.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> The gel holds your hair up great and for a long time! ...</li>
            <li> This makes for a much more natural and sophisticated look.  </li>
            <li> Clean quality hair product.  </li>
            <li> It has a clean fragrance smell too.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to scrub your hands with soap and water in order to get clean.</li>
            <li> This gel worked really well, husband really liked it, but when i wanted to order more, the price was way too high.  </li>
            <li> Great hold, doesn&#x27;t fake and it smells good, but not too strong of as scent.</li>
            <li> My cousin works with special needs people, and out of habit, he patted my head.  </li>
            <li> It actually dries VERY fast and holds great.</li>
            <li> Not so much for me, I had to spend more time trying to flatten my hair.</li>
            <li> I guess the only good thing about this gel is that your hair will not flake.  </li>
            <li> Did not want to pay full price at the store for hair gel</li>
            <li> Have noticed this does not come cheap, a price worth paying at times.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t flake, holds well, good amount of shine and last forever.</li>
            <li> It has a good balance that can shape well and last a while.  </li>
            <li> The gel stays on for the full day, I play racquetball about 3 hours a day, which causes me to sweat bullets.</li>
            <li> The product smells good and doesn&#x27;t flake white even after all day of use.</li>
            <li> American crew good hold hair</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; bottle should last for a good while.</li>
            <li> nice and soft hair gel for cool hair styles..</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price...</li>
            <li> which I like, the smell is very pleasant, unlike certain other brands that smell like horse poop</li>
            <li> Gel is great, not too stiff and combs out easily.</li>
            <li> AC on the other hand has a great consistency, allows you to apply it evenly, without clumping your hair together.  </li>
            <li> This gel is really great even after a day of work and other activities.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this gel, it washes very easy with water, keeps your hair style right in place all day,</li>
            <li> The product was shipped to me quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipments arrive quickly and the product is legitimate.</li>
            <li> I also like the mild scent.</li>
            <li> Great deal, super price, super fast delivery,  will be back!!</li>
            <li> Better yet, it has a suttle cologne scent which I appreciate much more than most products which typically have a floral scent.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped it relatively quickly and It came in undamaged.</li>
            <li> quick shipping, as described</li>
            <li> It also dries relatively quickly and keeps your hair in place without that &amp;#34;slicked back&amp;#34; appearance.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the Crew \\&quot;Super</li>
            <li> I have been using cheap of the counter hair gel all my life, But after trying this product for the first time i can tell the difference in the way it smells and the way your hair looks.</li>
            <li> Works exceptionally to give more volume, and give all the benefits of firm hold without any flaking or crunchy appearance.</li>
            <li> I typically have been paying around $20-$22 dollars for a 15.7 ounce bottle from Great Clips or Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> exactly as photographed!</li>
            <li> Just as described and lighting fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Such a better deal!  </li>
            <li> He bought the little pump for the bottle and it works great for him.</li>
            <li> and although it doesn&#x27;t smell strong it has a nice scent to it unlike some other gels.</li>
            <li> I love dealing with folks on Amazon when I get the same quality stuff for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is still pricey but it is worth every ounce.  </li>
            <li> Like that I feel I am getting my money&#x27;s worth on this purchase.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> Economically packaged.</li>
            <li> If applied properly, the gel gives a nice textured look of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is not overly powerful, but fragrant.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s over 1 year&#x27;s worth just to give you an idea of size.  </li>
            <li> As it turned out, the old gel caused most or all of the flakes.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair gel by far.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed with quick delivery</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING even in a mega snowstorm in NY!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the type of hair that sticks straight up without gel, worked out great when I used to spike my hair in middle school and high school,</li>
            <li> I have found that an easy fix is to use a hair dryer and comb to get it exactly how you want it and dry it more quickly.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of thickness, holds all day, smells good, adds a little shine, easy to rinse off...and love the big bottle with the optional pump.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to be saving so much money by buying this.</li>
            <li> Other than the cost, this gel is really good.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into style then you have come to the right place.</li>
            <li> What I love most about this hair gel is that it holds my hair all day no matter what, even after taking a nap or riding in the car with the windows rolled down.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re like me that&#x27;s tried everything its worth it to pay the price of all the products you&#x27;ve tried to get it right the first time, you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I used to use many other types of products prior to AC, but was impressed by this one simple thing.</li>
            <li> The American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel is a great product, as are most Crew products.</li>
            <li> The American crew gel I bought in the past had a very strong distinct and pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li> The stiffness is exactly the right amount.  </li>
            <li> Will certainly buy again!</li>
            <li> Mine came quickly and was the real deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really frugal with my hair gel purchases because I believed that hair gel isn&#x27;t really that important</li>
            <li> : Does not take very much to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight hair</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It has a nice mild smell that isn&#x27;t offensive and is slightly musty.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it does not cause any flaking, especially in the drier winter months this is a huge plus!  </li>
            <li> It is much higher quality and my husband&#x27;s hair stopped breaking off - he is 49 and has his hair growing back on the top of his head.</li>
            <li> Starting searching for a better price and found it here along with no shipping costs.  </li>
            <li> because of the higher reviews,</li>
            <li> For some reason, this is cheaper than the SHORT SEXY HAIR GEL brand.</li>
            <li> He has been using it for many years and will not stray from American Crew.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used this gel for the last five years and this is cheaper than I&#x27;ve ever been able to find it.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I will continue buying here at a quarter of the price for twice as much!</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> So it will probably work better for very short and spiky hair.  </li>
            <li> BTW, I have Asian hair (although softer than most).</li>
            <li> Way better deal than what I&#x27;ve been paying locally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> American Crew is the top Men&#x27;s gel on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used this same product for many years I&#x27;m working on my third bottle. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and it was the real deal!</li>
            <li> The top had cracked open and all the gel had spilled out.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> So glad to have found it on Amazon (terrific savings !).</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and have always been satisfied, but smaller sizes are not very cost effective.  </li>
            <li> My husband really loves it!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for many years and has paid a lot of money for tiny bottles.</li>
            <li> I have found nothing better than American Crew.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using american crew for quite some time, and i love it.</li>
            <li> I knew exactly what I was ordering since I have used this product before.</li>
            <li> Fast and definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This gel also seems to last longer and control the hair better.</li>
            <li> However, this is probably standard for most hair gels anyway.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve found a bigger size for a better price, that&#x27;s just bonus.  </li>
            <li> This is a bigger bottle and a better price.</li>
            <li> so this isn&#x27;t my area of expertise, but I was given a jug of this stuff by a friend who worked at a salon a few years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job at providing a firm hold, but it does not flake when it is roughed up.    </li>
            <li> I like it because it provides a good hold but does not feel heavy, sticky, or gewy.  </li>
            <li> Nice to purchase in a large size, I refill older smaller containers for ease of use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for some good gel for your super thick hair</li>
            <li> Just plain good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is normal so, other than that, this product is a good buy.</li>
            <li> It smells great, spreads on nicely, and keeps my hair in place without a stiff, crunchy feel or slick look.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I bought this huge bottle for just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Plus if you are active, own a motorcycle, convertible or whatever... even if it gets messed up by 70+ mph wind or a women who likes messing up your hair.</li>
            <li> I am slowly buying more and more variety products with confidence from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> The large volume container is pretty convenient.</li>
            <li> I keep hair tight and clean cut with wavy spike at top.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of use, I switched to a gel called Short Sexy Hair, ridiculous name, AMAZING product!</li>
            <li> Ideal for styling short to medium length hair without being overly stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to buy this gel as long as I have hair &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> not so much when trying to have a clean, combed over, adult look.</li>
            <li> This is not a firm hold but a mild version of gel...</li>
            <li> And I am very particular with my hair (just ask my friends).&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> it is easy to put on the hair and truly holds the hair in place for the entire day.</li>
            <li> At least i got a good deal the first time.</li>
            <li> This Gel is a large bottle that lasts a while.  </li>
            <li> These are the large bottles.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the shine of this product; however, the hold isn&#x27;t that strong if your hair isn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s got a good hold but isn&#x27;t super heavy.</li>
            <li> I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy this large bottle then the 8 oz bottle in the store.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a little leaky, but the product is amazing</li>
            <li> This bottle of gel is double the size of what&#x27;s available at stores, and just a few dollars more!</li>
            <li> But their mark-up is pretty high.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> does a good job, but it will leave your hair quite hard and has a lot of alcohol in it...</li>
            <li> how fast it dries...</li>
            <li> The hair gel is very oily so you probably don&#x27;t need to apply much to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to combine it with my primary gel and use different techniques because now that I have it</li>
            <li> Fast Deliver/Good Product</li>
            <li> Lasts my brother a whole year</li>
            <li> And shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gel, and the price on Amazon was so much cheaper per ounce then anywhere else on the web.</li>
            <li> Thus, I think the AC gel is very versatile.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s real thing or not, n turns out to be a real thing, tho</li>
            <li> Crew made my hair stronger, stopped much of the hair loss.</li>
            <li> the hold is really strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really helps with styling.</li>
            <li> Crew also works very well for spike hair styles....</li>
            <li> It makes it really convenient.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really come off on my pillows either.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Reasonable price</li>
            <li> Tried others to save some money, but coud&#x27;n&#x27;t find anything with as much control, yet flexible.  </li>
            <li> My hubby loves this gel but costs so much at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight, medium length.  </li>
            <li> second the quality of the gel is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I would enjoy purchasing American Crew gel again.</li>
            <li> so when I sawthis  33.8 oz bottle  for a reasonable price I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li> I like this a whole lot, I have never used before</li>
            <li> I really like this gel</li>
            <li> My scalp never itched like this before with American crew, but has with cheap store brand.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> This product is much cheaper to buy at Amazon.com, and I splurged and bought a pump to go with it.  </li>
            <li> Twenty years ago it probably would have worked well on my hair when it was much thicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much stronger than the pomades and creams I was using before, AND let&#x27;s not forget about the unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> Fabulous price....will be back!!</li>
            <li> not flake after drying like those cheap gels you get at local drugstores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to all</li>
            <li> THREW THE WHOLE BOTTLE OUT.</li>
            <li> It is as advertised and much cheaper than buying in a store.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for medium to thick hair.</li>
            <li> It provides him the hold he needs, while leaving his hair nice and soft to the touch, and unlike other hair gels, it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t cause bumps on his scalp.</li>
            <li> It is really old styling gel not as I was expecting, I love crew products as i am using the small ones and they work fine.</li>
            <li> Better then the other ones.  </li>
            <li> Works fine in holding your hair in place all day long.</li>
            <li> but if you buy the large size on Amazon it&#x27;s a good deal because you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> Men with a full head of hair need only a dollop about the size of a quarter to hold your hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li> Which is good if you wear cologne, because too many scents can smell bad.    </li>
            <li> Get ultra matte for a better hold with less shine</li>
            <li> Price is so much better than what you would find in the stores, as much as half the price.</li>
            <li> Almost twice the quantity for only a dollar or so more than local retailers.  </li>
            <li> already was particular to this gel,.</li>
            <li> I have classic Dennis the Menace head.</li>
            <li> American Crew products are in my opinion some of the best on the Market and for the price that you can get it for on Amazon you just cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> This gel works great for wet or shower dried hair.  </li>
            <li> I loved the large bottle for the same price as a small salon size.</li>
            <li> I love this gel because it requires very little to give a nice firm hold.</li>
            <li> It smells good but not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it yo any guy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying online.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend , dont think I am going to change to another brand anytime soon, or ever....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this setup.</li>
            <li> The bottle has lasted very long, the product has a great smell, and the gel leaves hair looking natural yet firm.  </li>
            <li> this gel is not strong enough and he needs to use short sexy hair, but with in a week he is able to use crew and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use a spray bottle and damp your hair a little bit before applying for a nicer look.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised initially by the strong smell (strong compared to the old gel) and was ready to stop using it</li>
            <li> Holds hair really well and is not stiff.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not like concrete either.</li>
            <li> It also has a slight scent, I can&#x27;t really describe it, but its subtle and pretty great.</li>
            <li> Crew is a great gel and at this size and price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> My husband also uses it when he loses or forgets to pack his own styling gel.  </li>
            <li> and it holds much better and says firm hold on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re all pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as the Aveda product that I normally buy, but i was substantially cheaper, if you want a firmer hold go with the Aveda...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this gel when dried and find it intoxicating.</li>
            <li> i use this gel daily and got this about 2 years ago and still not even half way done amazing how long it will last love the smell</li>
            <li> I have short spikes it works about right..</li>
            <li> Also, the gel, when it dries does not cause me to have any flakes (I have dark hair, so I can easily see flakes if were any.)</li>
            <li> just hold, which is fine because you&#x27;re finishing with a different product to achieve your final look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> American crew gel firm hold is the best I ever used I Ben using it for the past 10+ years</li>
            <li> This type of gel makes my hair like other cheap gel i used to use from supermarket.</li>
            <li> bottle because that&#x27;s the biggest size they carry where I live</li>
            <li> The gel has good hold on my hair but is still light and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, which admittedly is on the thin side.</li>
            <li> Works well, no perfume odor and hair looks natural, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Granted, it is not something your significant other will want to run their hands through, nor should they get to, because if you&#x27;re using this gel, you care about the way your hair looks, and you don&#x27;t want the \\&quot;Something about</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I have used many gels in the past that make it look like my hair is snowing when the gel dries.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted, for cheaper than we could get it in our local retail stores!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my significant other and he loves this product .</li>
            <li> It appears to be authentic and I have been buying this thing for the past two years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many of the other gels and they cause dandruff and flakes while American Crew does not promote dandruff or flakes on my hair.</li>
            <li> I like American Crew, and this product does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li> Other mousse and gel products may look good when I leave the house, but fall apart within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m wondering is it cut down with cheap gel.</li>
            <li> top of bottle was not securely shut and it would have leaked with a few more bumps to the external box.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you are having flaking/too much hold issues with your current gel.</li>
            <li> I used the gel this morning, and it is slightly firmer than the light hold, and does not make my hair feel like a brick.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t get too hard (unless you use too much) and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li> and I prefer this gel because it&#x27;s more harder and dry.  </li>
            <li> Makes it easy to brush through my hair after it&#x27;s dried for a soft controlled wave.</li>
            <li> I even tried using much more than I have used of previous gels I have purchased - same results.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers have pretty much got this one</li>
            <li> Large bottle that should last about 1 year for me.  </li>
            <li> these large bottles last me almost two years.</li>
            <li> I saved my smaller bottle and will fill it from this large one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge bottle, and will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> I have short hair that I like to have a little hold on, and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and since this is my husband&#x27;s favorite styling gel, I decided to save a little and get the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> but if it dries a way you don&#x27;t like, simple add a little more, style the way you wanted and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no too gunky and hard, and it smells ok.  </li>
            <li> man...it smells like old people.</li>
            <li> I was worried about purchasing the firm hold gel, as I&#x27;ve been used to the light hold for years.</li>
            <li> This is not Firm Hold.</li>
            <li> The real thing, for an amazingly low price!</li>
            <li> This is the strongest gel I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> He was surprised that my hair was solid--like a helmet.  </li>
            <li> With fast shipping and the bigger bang for my buck, I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy this in the store again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old man and after I color my hair</li>
            <li> but nobody cares what an old man does these days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> applied whole day, your hair is set to the same position.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying it at a regular store.</li>
            <li> It just looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li> Not using too much water is the key.</li>
            <li> off it just too much for personal use, you have to buy a plastic bottle to pour some of  it  into.  </li>
            <li> I thought, is it old?</li>
            <li> It dries light but with a firm hold.  </li>
            <li> IT HOLDS HIS HAIR AND LOOKS NATURAL.</li>
            <li> I really like everything about it except for the price of the smaller bottles.  </li>
            <li> Has a masculine scent to it</li>
            <li> Now that I use Amazon I found this product for way cheaper than major stores and buying the large bottle will last you months.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it make me wonder if the bottle was filled by a manufacturer other than American Crew.</li>
            <li> TOO MUCH FLAKING BOUGHT AMERICAN CREW CLASSIC FIBER BLUE.</li>
            <li> Quick to arrive and what I expected!!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a gel to replace the much less expensive gel I used for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> I feel American Crew&#x27;s product are of decent quality.</li>
            <li> doent hold much though so be carefull if you planning to buy it for long spikes..</li>
            <li> I buy the large bottle and refill several smaller bottles for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> I have very fine &amp; thin hair</li>
            <li> Short Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel, Packaging</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new experiment on amounts you may need until you reach what you feel is enough.  </li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but men don&#x27;t spend as much on products so that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the product from an old girlfriend, back when I was in my early 20s.</li>
            <li> My husband continues to switch around with other brands, but for me this is the only gel that gives me the light, all-day-lift that my long hair requires.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started using this particular brand of hair gel.</li>
            <li> Its thick enough to easily style moist hair, but not too thick so that it is like using rubber cement so he dosent use alot like he does with short sexy hair.</li>
            <li> But when it \\&quot;scrunches out\\&quot;, you get a very natural, minimal shine soft hair with a moveable hold that is still in control without any flakes!  </li>
            <li> this barely held.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using American Crew products since the early 1990&#x27;s after my hair stylist recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Same as the crew I purchase in the salon only much cheaper same quality.</li>
            <li> Every day, by the end of the day it looks like I barely or didn&#x27;t apply this gel at all.</li>
            <li> Barely holds, even though it says maximum hold.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not a big supporter of hair \\&quot;gels\\&quot;, this product surprised me.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but for the size, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> One down thing is that it should be a bit more concentrated instead of being diluted, so it takes time for the gel to hold firmly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different gels in the past: from the standard cheap junk you get at your local drug store; to the high end gels from the salons.</li>
            <li> a side note, I do not like gels that are extremely shiny when dried and this gel when dry looks more natural.</li>
            <li> The color is clear so even if you use slightly too much you can&#x27;t really tell unlike other products.</li>
            <li> SSH, on the other hand, does have a much stronger, but stiffer hold.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the other brand I used, this gel does not flake nearly as much.</li>
            <li> The cool thing too is that you can have a wet harden look or you can have a soft look depending how you style your hair with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dark brown to black and this product gives it a nice clean-looking shine without looking all wet like some \\&quot;shine\\&quot; products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about a quarter size amount of this gel everyday, as well as my 9yo son a few times a week, and after purchasing in Jan of 2014 am just now in need of more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used American Crew firm hold for many years and decided to order the largest size online and save a little money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used hair gel or hair spray or anything like that before, so I can&#x27;t really compare this product with other similar products.  </li>
            <li> Have been using American Crew for last 10 years, and not even thinking of trying another one foe near future.</li>
            <li> and my hair looks natural and in place all day long.  </li>
            <li> The thing that I liked about the Firm Holding Gel was that there was no real &amp;#34;flaking&amp;#34; once the product dried in your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to stay stiff all day, and doesn&#x27;t wear out like other gels.</li>
            <li> When he sweated or played sports, it would drip down his face and really irritate it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick gel, but quickly absorbs into/onto the hair and virtually disappears.</li>
            <li> they believe that Amazon isn&#x27;t careful enough about ensuring that NEW products come from the manufacturer and are instead refurbished.</li>
            <li> not a strong hold, didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> Now the my son is getting a little older, I want to gel his hair every time we go out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and like to spike your hair (not crazy spikes either, just slightly angled spiked hair) or simply want a long-lasting firm hold then</li>
            <li> Personally it holds my hair a little too hard, and I should have bought a medium or light hold.</li>
            <li> but I personally prefer my old gel that I was using previously.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t, my hair gets quite flat</li>
            <li> It will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> but I dont think it works as same in long spikes as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and frizzy due to a newly diagnosed thyroid condition.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2565XBTBFYJYO]]This gel last a very long time</li>
            <li> Does not last very long.</li>
            <li> and they all leave a white residue when dry.  </li>
            <li> It hold your hair firm, but at the same time keeps your hair feeling natural.</li>
            <li> It holds strongly and doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I  just wish for 30 bucks i could have got a whole bottle and not a big mess and half a bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive than other gels but the quality is markedly improved and Amazon has some deals that beat my local salon.</li>
            <li> Occasionally leaves very small flakes when using too much.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and replaced other more expensive gel products</li>
            <li> It take a few tries to get the mix combination of gel to water for your particular use</li>
            <li> This is a product that my boyfriend uses on a regular bases, so rather than continue to buy several little bottles, we decided to buy the one big one.</li>
            <li> In a hair salon this stuff would cost at least three times as much...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll also hold your hair for a long period of time as well.</li>
            <li> and lasts a long time between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> but I plan to use it long term so why not save some money?</li>
            <li> Crew-Firm gets me through long days -sometimes</li>
            <li> I was reading reviews on here about how this works very well for really thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> that being said, this product is good as a \\&quot;Base Product\\&quot;, meaning you put it in, blow-dry it, and add your finishing product.</li>
            <li> You can brush through it and then wet it, and it will dry solid again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple methods of applying it; wet hair, damp hair, dry hair...</li>
            <li> Having black hair has always been tough because it is easy to see when other gels flake white.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other product besides American Crew.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s tried a couple of other ones, but always comes back to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with other brands but always come back to Crew.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it very long</li>
            <li> If you prefer oily gels, then get this one; it won&#x27;t dry at all.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt matter if you blow dry your hair or use this on wet/damp hair, it will do what its suppose to.</li>
            <li> Wash hair, towel dry, and put in damp hair, the hold lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I apply to damp hair, towel dry.</li>
            <li> It softens up a bit with a blow dry and running a comb or fingers through your hair.  </li>
            <li> I put the gel on after a shower or on damp hair, comb or brush hair into place, let it dry, then comb or brush again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair or dry it out.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s sticky and flakes when dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, doesn&#x27;t use alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Commonly sold at hair salons and barbershops at a significantly higher price, this 33.8 oz bottle typically lasts me and my son up to 6 months at a time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I needed something that would slick my long blonde hair back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african american male with thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> I think if the lid were taped down prior to shipping the issues would have been resolved.</li>
            <li> It gives you the hold you need to last throughout the day without the flaking of other gels!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this bottle should last months.</li>
            <li> But it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as AC if your hair is slightly longer (although still short hair style).</li>
            <li> I am never satisfied and always go back to American Crew.</li>
            <li> I believe I have used the same aftershave, shaving cream, hair products (American Crew), and soap brand for the past 10+ years.</li>
            <li> was considerably less per once than anywhere else on the net.</li>
            <li> If a slight breeze blows, my hair stays whereever the wind blew it last.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting hold for the entire day, but not super stiff.</li>
            <li> It doesnt make a mess like some lesser gels will (which some will make it look like you walked thru a sawmill).</li>
            <li> it simply washes off your hands with a little bit of water.</li>
            <li> Hair Gel is great--no flakes or real issues, just a little water revives it late afternoon if you&#x27;ve been wearing a hat or anything if you get your hair messed up.  </li>
            <li> , only bad thing is (this goes for many other gels too) is that when you lay your head down.  </li>
            <li> It may seem expensive at first, but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I can comb through it during the day and re-wet it to get the firm hold back as needed.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair to loosen up my curls, then I apply gel to my head...</li>
            <li> timely, and everything as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using AC Firm for several years now to control my &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> I apply while my hair is still wet</li>
            <li> Firm hold crew isnt the firmest (thats why only 4 stars)</li>
            <li> Instead of any plastic enclosure or paper cap, the item had a piece of tape across the lid to keep it closed.  </li>
            <li> B002N5MIF0 American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel, 33.8-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> Works well, just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Once the stuff dries, you can rough up your hair</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and what was expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using the American Crew Firm Hold Gel exclusively for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the American Crew Firm Hold Hair</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> American Crew firm hair gel is the bet I have ever used.</li>
            <li> You know, those guys whose hair looks harder than marble.  </li>
            <li> Only gripe is I have seen the price double in the past 2-3 years!</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, dudes shouldn&#x27;t be using \\&quot;gels\\&quot;, try pomade, clay, wax, paste, anything but gel.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Less then half of the place who used to carry the products locally for me</li>
            <li> I work into hair down to scalp &amp; blow dry, then I use curling iron &amp;  style.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bottle lasts a long time as you only need a small dag...especially compared to typical hair gels.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> just a small dab is enough.</li>
            <li> It holds up well to sweat or being out in the rain, has all day and then some hold, and doesn&#x27;t get flaky like other gels.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty well priced (although my friend thinks it&#x27;s too expensive)</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I can get rid of all my other styling gels.</li>
            <li> I actually squeeze some of this into a small spray bottle, mix with water and spray it on my hair instead of putting the gel in my palms and running it through my hair.</li>
            <li> ordered this with Prime and it came extremely fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a firm hold, which means it lasts for a long time and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other store bought off-the-shelf cheaper products</li>
            <li> This gel does not skip a beat, it continues the hold extremely well.</li>
            <li> won t by any other gel  </li>
            <li> unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid up to 16.00 for a small bottle of the same gel at a retail store.  </li>
            <li> I like how this gel does not flake like other gels I have used over the years.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause flaking at all like other gel brands do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These points make me wonder about friends oft-repeated comments about being VERY careful about ordering products from Amazon b/c</li>
            <li> The product that I purchased several years ago was very firm</li>
            <li> I use this to slick it all back into a little duck</li>
            <li> it loses some of it&#x27;s hold, especially if you&#x27;ve been sweating.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind too, a little goes a long way, so there&#x27;s not a need to glob it on, and if you do it can appear too stiff and unnatural.</li>
            <li> , this should last me half of f ayear or so at least.</li>
            <li> My husband slicks his hair forward, when he cuts his hair down to a 3</li>
            <li> I do feel the CREW company has weakened down the incredients.</li>
            <li> It gets matted down and once again this happen to all gel products.  </li>
            <li> work into hair &amp; comb through &amp; let it dry a little till it starts getting stiff, then spike with a pic and let it finish drying.</li>
            <li> Over four times the amount for less than doubled the price.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the bottle that is half the size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About half price than the leading brick and mortar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your very active it will wear out overtime</li>
            <li> Only reason why I didn&#x27;t buy from other suppliers is that they only sold in small bottles &amp; was too expensive.</li>
            <li> Also can be left wet look, blow dried or broken loss with fingers after it drys.  </li>
            <li> but it does not hold as well as the less firm.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the size when the product arrived, and realized it will probably last at least 6 months if not more.  </li>
            <li> Usually, with other hair gels, just the smell of it gives me a headache.  </li>
            <li> It takes just a little, applied to damp hair to work.</li>
            <li> : I read other reviews about it being packaged shady without any type of seal, mine came shrink wrapped (thumbs up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use any other hair gel other than American Crew firm hold, but the store prices are really expensive.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this gel for thin hair needing some serious hold.</li>
            <li> The down side is that if you are sweating this product will run into your eyes and burn like nothing else!</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for over 3 years, I wouldn&#x27;t want any other gel than Crew!!</li>
            <li> the bottle says firm</li>
            <li> They get waxy after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Product says firm hold</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and it holds well.</li>
            <li> I like the firm hold</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy</li>
            <li> Stays firm all day</li>
            <li> Joico is heavy.</li>
            <li> Does the hold but does leave flakes when dried.</li>
            <li> The bottle is heavy, so if you are elderly or have arhritis in your hands like I do, pick it up with both hands.  </li>
            <li> Despite the product&#x27;s claim that it is firm hold, I do not recommend this product at all.  </li>
            <li> It does not harden into firm hold at all.  </li>
            <li> I have used Crew firm hair gel for years.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> The CREW is Firm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in your body and hair</li>
            <li> Not sticky or tacky when dried.  </li>
            <li> but I was looking around for a gel that can hold my hair firmly and gives it some volume.</li>
            <li> This is coming from someone who uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> I would call this closer to a medium hold than to a Firm Hold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;Wears out after a few hours depending on your activity levels and hair thickness</li>
            <li> but the intensity of the smell went away when it dried.</li>
            <li> One less annoyance in the morning!    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even half way through with it!</li>
            <li> The head rest in my car is stiff and scaley.  </li>
            <li> and it still holds without making your hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Its NOT the Glue Stiff feel.  </li>
            <li> A little dab usually does the trick</li>
            <li> (If you have thick long hair, by that, I mean anything that is longer and thicker than Brad Pitt in Fight Club and you walk to work, re-application is often required.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much bigger and less expensive</li>
            <li> Then my scalp began to itch pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Not very effective.</li>
            <li> the tough, very dark, shiny but not quite pomade or other paste-based product type of shiny.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t cutting it, nor was the countless other things that I&#x27;ve been too lazy to return to these pharmacies that crusted up/flaked up/</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with a little water while applying it to keep it from being too thick.</li>
            <li> And it really is firm hold just like it says!</li>
            <li> He likes how this feels in his hair and has been using this product for the past 8 years.</li>
            <li> No better than say L.A Looks ($2.00 bottle) with the exception that there is no flakes.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations as it has in the past.</li>
            <li> LIKE IT FROM THE PAST YEARS.</li>
            <li> so I keep a spare small travel bottle in the car for touch ups.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m not sure how to explain this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it plenty of times in the past, but the price I&#x27;ve found it for on Amazon has me buying it here forever.</li>
            <li> I was never really sure, if the flakes were dandruff or the gel.</li>
            <li> Not sure why but does for me.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes this gel, but it is so expensive in the local stores.</li>
            <li> Very firm...</li>
            <li> He has very thick dark hair.  </li>
            <li> would recommend it for a strong hold without the nasty crust.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time trying to find this gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about all the reviews from people claiming it&#x27;s fake or empty.</li>
            <li> I would say at least 6-7 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t flake late in the day either.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product for his thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I found SSH just too thick and goey to spread evenly in my hair without clumping it together.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, get something lighter.</li>
            <li> This product is way too firm for thin hair.  </li>
            <li> hold is very, very firm - it&#x27;s not quite a freeze spray, but it still gives you that gelled look and feel - very hard to</li>
            <li> Very expensive in the smaller bottles.  </li>
            <li> American CREW is  very expensive in stores and salons</li>
            <li> I bought the mega size bottle knowing it&#x27;s a ridiculous size for hair gel</li>
            <li> and it was ridiculously cheaper here than in any brick-and-mortar store.</li>
            <li> I have thick wiry hair that is very hard to control.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with weak, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> But holding power is poor.</li>
            <li> Life is unfair, but at least I don&#x27;t have to spend any money on hair products or services anymore.</li>
            <li> The lid hasd broken during shipping</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it is made out of crap but</li>
            <li> : I put a quarter sized amount into my damp hair when I got out of the shower and had no fly aways did the combover, the combover done right&lt;</li>
            <li> Also, when it rains real hard, gel starts to come off.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the&lt;br</li>
            <li> Difficult to handle because of size.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive in salons</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin.  </li>
            <li> Does not make your hair feel gummy or dirty as some gels do.  </li>
            <li> This one, a very faint smell.</li>
            <li> wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> I hate that &amp;#34;gelled&#x27; look.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the product I received.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is awful, just like all gels, unless used before you blow-dry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the bottle says firm but it does nothing for my hair. I cant style my hair and will not hold my hair in place . This is not a firm hold but a mild version of gel...</li>
            <li> great product and best value.</li>
            <li> I feel American Crew&#x27;s product are of decent quality. I bought this large bottle and it has lasted me for 2 years or more! You do not need to use a lot of gel to style your hair just a small dab is enough. Also, the gel, when it dries does not cause me to have any flakes (I have dark hair, so I can easily see flakes if were any.) The cool thing too is that you can have a wet harden look or you can have a soft look depending how you style your hair with wet or dry hair. There is also no fragrance, which is another plus.</li>
            <li> Great gel with solid hold.</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s favorite gel!  holds all day, and not too crunchy, unless you use a lot.</li>
            <li> does a good job, but it will leave your hair quite hard and has a lot of alcohol in it...</li>
            <li> Great hair gel for men.  And it really is firm hold just like it says!</li>
            <li> Not entirely convinced this should be considered a &amp;#34;Firm Hold&amp;#34; styling gel. I&#x27;ve got the type of hair that sticks straight up without gel, worked out great when I used to spike my hair in middle school and high school, not so much when trying to have a clean, combed over, adult look. So I figured I&#x27;d try this out with all the great reviews noting how strong the hold is and how fast it dries... Not so much for me, I had to spend more time trying to flatten my hair. After a couple of weeks of use, I switched to a gel called Short Sexy Hair, ridiculous name, AMAZING product! It actually dries VERY fast and holds great. American Crew might work for some people, but not for me</li>
            <li> I have used Crew Styling Gel for years. The big bottle lasts an entire year because I only need to use a drop about the size of a nickel.  I can comb through it during the day and re-wet it to get the firm hold back as needed.</li>
            <li> Great hair gel, best deal anywhere!</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent price!</li>
            <li> Have been using American Crew for last 10 years, and not even thinking of trying another one foe near future.</li>
            <li> okay - so my beloved awesome husband has used cheap bottom rack gel for EVER.  I finally just got him this. It is much higher quality and my husband&#x27;s hair stopped breaking off - he is 49 and has his hair growing back on the top of his head. Never underestimate the destruction cheap gel can cause!</li>
            <li> Only gel I use. And I am very particular with my hair (just ask my friends).&lt;br /&gt;Only gel I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Locally the price is getting out of hand.  Starting searching for a better price and found it here along with no shipping costs.  Best deal I&#x27;ve gotten on this size and I never left the house.  I will be back.</li>
            <li> I am VERY satisfied with this product. The product was shipped to me quickly. The quality is exceptional, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I would do business again with them!!  Great Job!!!</li>
            <li> The hair gel doesn&#x27;t smell good at all.  It smells like very cheap cologne if you ask me.  The hair gel is very oily so you probably don&#x27;t need to apply much to your hair.  I guess the only good thing about this gel is that your hair will not flake.  I last bought [[ASIN:B000EM79QM Short Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel, Packaging May Vary, 16.9-Ounce Pump Bottle]] because of the higher reviews, and I prefer this gel because it&#x27;s more harder and dry.  If you prefer oily gels, then get this one; it won&#x27;t dry at all.  But if you sweat, then this American Crew gel will definitely go into your eyes.  For some reason, this is cheaper than the SHORT SEXY HAIR GEL brand.</li>
            <li> Love this over priced gel. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african american male with thick and curly hair so I&#x27;ve been looking for some gel to keep my hair nice and curly. I was reading reviews on here about how this works very well for really thick and curly hair so I decided to give it a try thinking that it would finally be the answer to my worries but it isn&#x27;t. I wet my hair to loosen up my curls, then I apply gel to my head...this barely held. It actually frizzed my hair up about an hour after I put it in. If you&#x27;re looking for some good gel for your super thick hair I&#x27;d recommend buying EcoStyler gel...it costs about 6 bucks and you can find it at almost any retailer. It&#x27;ll also hold your hair for a long period of time as well. That&#x27;s the best gel I have found so far. I had a hard time trying to find this gel. With the hefty price tag I would have thought it would keep my hair nice and curly. I&#x27;ll try to combine it with my primary gel and use different techniques because now that I have it I have to use it somehow. I&#x27;m not going to throw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other product besides American Crew. I&#x27;ve been using AC products for going on 12 years. The hair gel is the perfect blend of hold and texture. The price simply can not be beat.</li>
            <li> Fast Deliver/Good Product</li>
            <li> Lasts my brother a whole year and I buy it for him for Christmas every year.  He swears by this gel.</li>
            <li> I love this gell. It has a nice mild smell that isn&#x27;t offensive and is slightly musty. It holds up well to sweat or being out in the rain, has all day and then some hold, and doesn&#x27;t get flaky like other gels.</li>
            <li> Great product! And shipping was fast. Will order again. :-)</li>
            <li> timely, and everything as expected</li>
            <li> Works great, smells good, and it doesn&#x27;t flake up when dry. It&#x27;s cheaper buying it through Amazon, compared to buying it at a salon.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gel.  He has been using it for many years and will not stray from American Crew.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and was shipped very quickly. This saved me money by buying the larger size than having to buy lots of smaller ones.</li>
            <li> Awesome gel. Smells good and non flaky. I would highly recommend it yo any guy. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this helps it feel thicker and fuller.  My husband also uses it when he loses or forgets to pack his own styling gel.  Perfect size and price.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I found this product in a 33.8 Oz. size at 1/2 the price I was paying. This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using this styling gel for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using AC Firm for several years now to control my &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; hair. I apply while my hair is still wet and it does a reasonably good job keeping it under control for the day. I do sometimes see it flake off, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. For the price, this is probably the best value gel on the market.</li>
            <li> I like this gel, I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.  It&#x27;s strong enough to stay stiff all day, and doesn&#x27;t wear out like other gels. But it&#x27;s not like concrete either. I&#x27;ve used several different gels in the past: from the standard cheap junk you get at your local drug store; to the high end gels from the salons. This one is by far the best for all hair types. it&#x27;s no too gunky and hard, and it smells ok.  It&#x27;s not the best gel, but for the money it&#x27;s a solid performer.    It also has a suttle piney scent that isn&#x27;t too overbearing. Which is good if you wear cologne, because too many scents can smell bad.    What I don&#x27;t like is that it will stay on a surface you rest your head. Such as a pillow or a head rest. The head rest in my car is stiff and scaley.  I rest my head on there as I am driving and it just means I have to clean my head rest more often. Same for my pillows. They get waxy after a few weeks.  So if you use this, definitely wash your pillowcases often.</li>
            <li> so I bought this based on all the raving reviews...I dunno what the heck kind of stink they put in it, but man...it smells like old people.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping hair in place.</li>
            <li> We have used this product several times before.  You can&#x27;t get a better price for it anywhere but amazon.com  It is great for spiking hair, or setting it to a style you want all day.</li>
            <li> Did not want to pay full price at the store for hair gel and I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of Amazon. This stuff is pretty well priced (although my friend thinks it&#x27;s too expensive) but it&#x27;s worth it because the quality is incredible. The hold lasts for ages.</li>
            <li> When it works, don&#x27;t fix it.  Great product used it for 15 years+.  Buy the big one and refill.</li>
            <li> Awesome price!  Almost twice the quantity for only a dollar or so more than local retailers.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great value.  Much more product at a better price than a retail store.  Very satisfied.  Highly recommend buying online.</li>
            <li> Firm hold crew isnt the firmest (thats why only 4 stars) I have used, but it is strong. It doesnt matter if you blow dry your hair or use this on wet/damp hair, it will do what its suppose to. Plus if you are active, own a motorcycle, convertible or whatever... even if it gets messed up by 70+ mph wind or a women who likes messing up your hair. It doesnt make a mess like some lesser gels will (which some will make it look like you walked thru a sawmill).</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gel, and the price on Amazon was so much cheaper per ounce then anywhere else on the web.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. He has thinning hair and it works great. The price here was better than he pays in salon.</li>
            <li> Crew Firm Hold Styling gel is wonderful. Holds hair really well and is not stiff. It makes my hair healthy and full looking. I would highly recommend this product. I have tried alot of products and this works the best. I don;t know how I lived without this. I read other reviews and decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! I can get rid of all my other styling gels.</li>
            <li> Great Product. If anyone&#x27;s aware of a better gel that never flakes I got to see it.  This is the only product that I will ever use</li>
            <li> The gel is fine and the shipping was fine.  However, it worries me that there was no evidence that the item had not been tampered with.  Instead of any plastic enclosure or paper cap, the item had a piece of tape across the lid to keep it closed.  I don&#x27;t know if this product just has no tamperproof seals ever on it, but since it&#x27;s a personal hygiene item, I just can&#x27;t help but wonder if something was added to it or changed.  Otherwise it&#x27;s the gel itself is a 4 and the shipping was a 5.</li>
            <li> This gel is just great I highly recommend this gel, it washes very easy with water, keeps your hair style right in place all day,</li>
            <li> This gel works great, smell great and last for a long time without making your hair too crunchy.  It can be on the pricy side but you can always find great deals on it every now and again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff along with Aubrey gensing and biotin shampoo. He saves money on the gel through Amazon compared to local retailers... a lot of money. He bought the little pump for the bottle and it works great for him.</li>
            <li> I like this gel.  I have used it for years and Amazon is the best price I have found for it.</li>
            <li> I needed more gel and just could not pay full price at a store.  I love dealing with folks on Amazon when I get the same quality stuff for a much more reasonable price.  This stuff is still pricey but it is worth every ounce.  I highly recommend this gel for thin hair needing some serious hold.</li>
            <li> Good price for this size.  I&#x27;ve used American Crew firm hold for many years and decided to order the largest size online and save a little money.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel my husband will use now. It holds well and it doesn&#x27;t flake off like some gels do. My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Product says firm hold and I can tell you It&#x27;s not. I don&#x27;t think this is the same product sold in hair salons. I purchased a smaller bottle if the same product from the place I get my haircut and it holds much better and says firm hold on the bottle.  Buyer beware on this one.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2565XBTBFYJYO]]This gel last a very long time and it&#x27;s top of the line gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using American Crew products since the early 1990&#x27;s after my hair stylist recommended it to me. The gel works great. Holds great and washes out very easy and doesn&#x27;t leave your dry or damaged. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> it holds the same style even after the day!</li>
            <li> I have used this gel for the last five years and this is cheaper than I&#x27;ve ever been able to find it.  It&#x27;s great gel.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great Product as Advertised!  Met and exceeded my expectations. Will do business with this company again.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product for his thick curly hair.  He said he does not leave his hair sticky nor gives him dandruff.  His hair would look for poofy without it.  He&#x27;s ditched his cheap gels and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> great price good gel and fast shipping, I cant complain at all.This stuff is much more expensive if you buy it at the stores.</li>
            <li> I was worried about purchasing the firm hold gel, as I&#x27;ve been used to the light hold for years. I didn&#x27;t want the feeling that with a light snap, I could break off a piece of my hair. My worries have been put to rest. I used the gel this morning, and it is slightly firmer than the light hold, and does not make my hair feel like a brick. Granted, it is not something your significant other will want to run their hands through, nor should they get to, because if you&#x27;re using this gel, you care about the way your hair looks, and you don&#x27;t want the \\&quot;Something about Mary\\&quot; look. Or maybe you do, this gel would probably work for that too. It doesn&#x27;t flake, it smells good, and is a good purchase. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trip to salon and buy it online! Better value and huge bottle. This Gel is perfect to achieve great hair.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best value I&#x27;ve been able to find for Crew gel.  Shipments arrive quickly and the product is legitimate.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp and has a nice scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using this for 15 years.</li>
            <li> No issues here once again, this is my 5th time purchasing this product from them, and as normal it got to me faster than stated and works great!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, product as described, thank you !</li>
            <li> Always a good deal compared to stores.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this each day and it keeps,his hair nice.  It also smells pleasant and doesn&#x27;t flake or get oily.</li>
            <li> This gel worked really well, husband really liked it, but when i wanted to order more, the price was way too high.  At least i got a good deal the first time.</li>
            <li> This was the brand my husband use to get. I tried it once and was hooked. My husband continues to switch around with other brands, but for me this is the only gel that gives me the light, all-day-lift that my long hair requires.</li>
            <li> This bottle of gel is double the size of what&#x27;s available at stores, and just a few dollars more! Definitely a good buy for this product![[ASIN:B002N5MIF0 American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel, 33.8-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> Not the same Gel my husband gets on the salons. This is not Firm Hold. It looks like it was diluted.</li>
            <li> great price. fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This gel is great for thinning hair. Just make sure to use a spray bottle and damp your hair a little bit before applying for a nicer look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used hair gel or hair spray or anything like that before, so I can&#x27;t really compare this product with other similar products.  But I can tell you that it seems to work as well as I had hoped, and it washes out very easily.</li>
            <li> Take care of my untame hair!</li>
            <li> Works well, just as I expected. Same as the crew I purchase in the salon only much cheaper same quality.</li>
            <li> Amazing price! Awesome find...this is such a money saver if you use this brand. It&#x27;s a huge bottle, and will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> fabulous hold - works best with blow dryer</li>
            <li> Best gell I have had throughout the years for my hair it makes my hair feel better and while comb it makes it easier for the brush</li>
            <li> Love the price, Love the product. Recommend to any one who needs or uses gel.&lt;br /&gt;Firm holding power is great.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> Been using this gel for years!  Good hold for my hair and no flakes.</li>
            <li> The salon where I get my hair cut uses this stuff. They also sell it. But their mark-up is pretty high. So I&#x27;m glad that Amazon is stocking it. It&#x27;s a thick gel, but quickly absorbs into/onto the hair and virtually disappears. Men with a full head of hair need only a dollop about the size of a quarter to hold your hair in place all day. In fact, don&#x27;t use too much or it&#x27;s obvious you&#x27;ve got \\&quot;product\\&quot; on your hair. Once the stuff dries, you can rough up your hair and it still holds without making your hair feel stiff. My hair is very dark brown to black and this product gives it a nice clean-looking shine without looking all wet like some \\&quot;shine\\&quot; products do. Get some. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this hair gel and it always holds nicely/smells great. It was the best price we could find for this huge bottle which lasts him a year.</li>
            <li> Great volume for the money.</li>
            <li> Hair Gel is great--no flakes or real issues, just a little water revives it late afternoon if you&#x27;ve been wearing a hat or anything if you get your hair messed up.  Product came highly recommended by one of best friends.  Have been using CREW for almost 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Does not take very much to get the job done.  If you&#x27;re new experiment on amounts you may need until you reach what you feel is enough.  Best if used right after shower when hair is the wettest.  Based on amount used to hold hair in place will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Price.  Have noticed this does not come cheap, a price worth paying at times.</li>
            <li> the hold is about a B-.  The smell is an A+</li>
            <li> Great price, can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> The real thing, for an amazingly low price! I don&#x27;t know about all the reviews from people claiming it&#x27;s fake or empty. Mine came quickly and was the real deal. I will continue buying here at a quarter of the price for twice as much!</li>
            <li> Too sticky feeling for me, but smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy so this isn&#x27;t my area of expertise, but I was given a jug of this stuff by a friend who worked at a salon a few years ago and loved it.  It&#x27;s not sticky on your hands (that&#x27;s what she said), and has just enough consistency to let you shape your hair.  It also doesn&#x27;t flake or smell like a teenager.   Not cheap, but for the size, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This gel is by far the best for men! It does not flake, has a masculine smell and works great!</li>
            <li> great product. i&#x27;ve been using this gel since 2001 and the best product</li>
            <li> Love this gel. Best gel of all time. I don&#x27;t like the putties and the cheap gel leaves your hair looking flakey-white. This doesn&#x27;t flake, holds well, good amount of shine and last forever. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this gel every day. I have short hair that I like to have a little hold on, and I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and it holds well. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than other gels but the quality is markedly improved and Amazon has some deals that beat my local salon.</li>
            <li> exactly as photographed! thanks!</li>
            <li> On time delivery - accuracy on the order</li>
            <li> Wow!  I didn&#x27;t realize this said 33.8 oz!  What a great value since I thought I was paying for something smaller and out comes this massive bottle of gel out of the box!  Happy with it, good buy!</li>
            <li> Not very effective. Get ultra matte for a better hold with less shine</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews of Short Sexy Hair, I had to give it a try.  I&#x27;ll stick to American Crew!  I think it all depends on your hairstyle and what you&#x27;re looking for.  I found SSH just too thick and goey to spread evenly in my hair without clumping it together.  AC on the other hand has a great consistency, allows you to apply it evenly, without clumping your hair together.  This makes for a much more natural and sophisticated look.  The hold is not as strong as SSH.  But when it \\&quot;scrunches out\\&quot;, you get a very natural, minimal shine soft hair with a moveable hold that is still in control without any flakes!  It&#x27;s almost like using hair wax without the stickiness and residue.  Thus, I think the AC gel is very versatile.  Additionally, you can always add a freezing hair spray for those occasional times when you need the perfect hold (ie. formal events etc.)  SSH, on the other hand, does have a much stronger, but stiffer hold.  So it will probably work better for very short and spiky hair.  But it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as AC if your hair is slightly longer (although still short hair style). It&#x27;s almost like hair glue and clumps your hair into pieces. It too doesn&#x27;t flake.  BTW, I have Asian hair (although softer than most).</li>
            <li> Way better deal than what I&#x27;ve been paying locally. I like that it comes in bulk, this should last me half of f ayear or so at least.</li>
            <li> This is my only hair product.  The gel never flakes.  It smells great, spreads on nicely, and keeps my hair in place without a stiff, crunchy feel or slick look.  Makes it easy to brush through my hair after it&#x27;s dried for a soft controlled wave.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this hair gel.  It provides him the hold he needs, while leaving his hair nice and soft to the touch, and unlike other hair gels, it&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t cause bumps on his scalp.</li>
            <li> Was gambling it it&#x27;s real thing or not, n turns out to be a real thing, tho it is no difference with price walk in n on here shippin n so on</li>
            <li> Price is so much better than what you would find in the stores, as much as half the price. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the product sold in the salon but was better priced on Amazon.  Thanks and God Bless!!!!!</li>
            <li> A big bottle of gel.  I like the firm hold and although it doesn&#x27;t smell strong it has a nice scent to it unlike some other gels.</li>
            <li> Just as described and lighting fast shipping!! 5 stars! Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Much cheaper to buy this large bottle then the 8 oz bottle in the store.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands go to hair gel. He likes how this feels in his hair and has been using this product for the past 8 years. When he is running low he always asks me to pick up some before he runs out of styling gel.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily and it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy and it does noticeably hold my hair. If I don&#x27;t, my hair gets quite flat so I know it does work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this gel forever. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Great service along with a great price.</li>
            <li> Like that I feel I am getting my money&#x27;s worth on this purchase.  Would recommend the purchase to a friend.</li>
            <li> One of the best gels for men in the market.This is not a low quality gel.This is salon quality gel.Will not change it for another gel unless there is something better.Stays firm all day</li>
            <li> This Gel is a large bottle that lasts a while.  It has a good balance that can shape well and last a while.  Not the best of the best, but pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the strongest gel I&#x27;ve found so far. Works fine in holding your hair in place all day long.</li>
            <li> My hubby has been using this item for YEARS and it works great on Curly hair/Fine Hair and course. Thank you</li>
            <li> American Crew is the top Men&#x27;s gel on the market. It&#x27;s strong, doesn&#x27;t flake, smells great, and lasts all day! It&#x27;s so strong that it takes a good rinse before it comes out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Amazon pricing, the price is 25% of my barber shop!</li>
            <li> American crew gel firm hold is the best I ever used I Ben using it for the past 10+ years</li>
            <li> I have used gel for 20 years. I&#x27;ve tried Paul Mitchell and Joico before this. The reason I like this one best is because it is light. Joico is heavy. American Crew does the job as well as Joico but is a thinner gel. Paul Mitchell gives me the flakes, so I won&#x27;t touch that again.</li>
            <li> Good product. The only product I use.</li>
            <li> Nice product that does the job needed. I have used this same product for many years I&#x27;m working on my third bottle. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My husband says that he&#x27;s very happy with this gel. It does the job and smells good. That about says it all.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and what was expected.</li>
            <li> It styles my hair with lots of body and volume, but doesn&#x27;t leave (too many) flakes on my head! I&#x27;ll keep using it. The large volume container is pretty convenient.</li>
            <li> Does the hold but does leave flakes when dried.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff, great price.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair gel for years and love it.  It has a nice hold, and is easily washed out. I also like the mild scent. I would also suggest buying a pump for it, as the top can sometimes get gunned up.</li>
            <li> Hair gel is hair gel. I&#x27;m a crew guy so whatever.</li>
            <li> If you really need your hair to stay in place and still look nice, this will work.  My cousin works with special needs people, and out of habit, he patted my head.  He was surprised that my hair was solid--like a helmet.  But that is what this stuff does.  It dries solid, and it keeps your hair from moving.  You can brush through it and then wet it, and it will dry solid again.  My hair is very thin.  If you have thick hair, get something lighter.</li>
            <li> Good product, doesn&#x27;t get sticky in my hair, does a great job holding my unruly hair in place, washes out really easy, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great for making hair healthier.  My hair is very dry and frizzy due to a newly diagnosed thyroid condition.  I had to do something!  Crew made my hair stronger, stopped much of the hair loss. and lasts a long time between shampoos.  I would recommend this to anyone with weak, brittle hair.  It also smells wonderful and makes the hair, even the ends, shiny. The bottle is heavy, so if you are elderly or have arhritis in your hands like I do, pick it up with both hands.  Otherwise, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a great price.  It will last for a long time. This is my husbands favorite gel.</li>
            <li> Superb deal. Plus I can never find this in the big stores.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the shine of this product; however, the hold isn&#x27;t that strong if your hair isn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li> This gel is the best I have ever used. I have very straight hair and this gel does its job in holding and styling into anything I want for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I actually squeeze some of this into a small spray bottle, mix with water and spray it on my hair instead of putting the gel in my palms and running it through my hair. This actually stretches the use of the product and makes it easier to apply and you don&#x27;t have to rinse your hands of after applying it, just spray and brush it through your hair. It take a few tries to get the mix combination of gel to water for your particular use but it&#x27;s worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> I like it b/c I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;But top of bottle was not securely shut and it would have leaked with a few more bumps to the external box. Furthermore, it make me wonder if the bottle was filled by a manufacturer other than American Crew. In addition, if I wanted a &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; Amazon has on Prime, I had to buy a 33.8 oz bottle, when an 8.5 oz would be enough for me for a year and would remain fresh.&lt;br /&gt;These points make me wonder about friends oft-repeated comments about being VERY careful about ordering products from Amazon b/c they believe that Amazon isn&#x27;t careful enough about ensuring that NEW products come from the manufacturer and are instead refurbished.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the 8 oz. size and since this is my husband&#x27;s favorite styling gel, I decided to save a little and get the larger bottle. This will hopefully last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and happy with it.  Only gripe is I have seen the price double in the past 2-3 years!</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Gives good control without the sheen.  No clumping or flaking. Clean quality hair product.  One bottle lasted me 2 or 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using the American Crew Firm Hold Gel exclusively for a couple of years now.  I typically have been paying around $20-$22 dollars for a 15.7 ounce bottle from Great Clips or Wal-Mart.  This bottle is more than twice the size for a slightly higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this with Prime and it came extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a water based gel, and it doesn&#x27;t flake.  I have used many gels in the past that make it look like my hair is snowing when the gel dries.  I do not have this problem.  Its a firm hold, which means it lasts for a long time and the hold is really strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already was particular to this gel,. With fast shipping and the bigger bang for my buck, I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy this in the store again.</li>
            <li> I know this is for men but I have curly, frizzy hair and I use whatever it takes.  I have had my hair stylist order the huge bottle for years and I just found it on amazon about $10. Cheaper!!!!  This is a great product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old man and after I color my hair I use this to slick it all back into a little duck tail.&lt;br /&gt;I kinda look like a mobster that way but nobody cares what an old man does these days.&lt;br /&gt;I like the stuff.</li>
            <li> Timely shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> The crew gel has a clean refreshing scent and good hold. Won&#x27;t flake throughout the day. good value with the 33.8 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good. Compared to the other brand I used, this gel does not flake nearly as much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with a variety of hair gels, but this seems better than the lower dollar stuff you can pick up at any walmart.</li>
            <li> I used this gel years ago when I wore my hair spiky. Then when the salon stopped selling it I used another brand that was ok. Only reason why I didn&#x27;t buy from other suppliers is that they only sold in small bottles &amp; was too expensive. When my alternate brand was no longer avail I decided to try Amazon and there it was !!  Large bottle is cost effective &amp; this is a good product. Doesn&#x27;t flake or stay sticky/wet. I have very fine &amp; thin hair and it really helps with styling. I work into hair down to scalp &amp; blow dry, then I use curling iron &amp;  style.  Crew also works very well for spike hair styles.... work into hair &amp; comb through &amp; let it dry a little till it starts getting stiff, then spike with a pic and let it finish drying.</li>
            <li> Holds well, best things is no flakes unless a lot of the other products I have used. I am a regular purchaser.</li>
            <li> nice and soft hair gel for cool hair styles.. doent hold much though so be carefull if you planning to buy it for long spikes.. I have short spikes it works about right.. but I dont think it works as same in long spikes as well.</li>
            <li> This gel is really great even after a day of work and other activities. It holds my hair in place and I don&#x27;t get any sticky feeling at my head even when I sweat.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good hold, not too flaky, nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re unsure about the scent, visit a salon or two - they will likely have it, and you can get an idea of it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be saving so much money by buying this. This is my husband&#x27;s favorite hair gel. Before looking on Amazon.com, I went into my local salon to see about purchasing an 8.4oz bottle of this and they wanted $13.95 for it. It&#x27;s a killer deal to have gotten 33 ounces for $27.97! We essentially just bought 4 bottles for the price of 2. My husband won&#x27;t be needing any gel for a while! :-)</li>
            <li> Great stuff I use it every day holds my hair all day even when I go to the Gym and have a big workout</li>
            <li> Tried many that claim for men, this does smell like for men. Big bottle last me over year if used correct amount. My favorite hair gel.</li>
            <li> Works great.  You should buy a screw on pump to replace the cap.  It makes it really convenient.</li>
            <li> Its great hair gel that smells good, if you like Crew products you will like this one.    It does a good job at providing a firm hold, but it does not flake when it is roughed up.    The down side is that if you are sweating this product will run into your eyes and burn like nothing else!</li>
            <li> the top was broke but the product works great.</li>
            <li> Good quality product recommended by my hairdresser, who also uses it for his customers!  I&#x27;ve tried other store bought off-the-shelf cheaper products and they all leave a white residue when dry.  This stuff is the bomb!</li>
            <li> Commonly sold at hair salons and barbershops at a significantly higher price, this 33.8 oz bottle typically lasts me and my son up to 6 months at a time. It&#x27;s well worth the price on Amazon and an even greater deal with Prime.</li>
            <li> This is the only Crew product I have tried and I am a lifer!&lt;br /&gt;This was priced great and came in a bag just in-case!&lt;br /&gt;No issues and it was the real deal!</li>
            <li> Great buy. This stuff costs a fortune at the supermarket. This is by far a great deal. I transferred some into a smaller bottle to use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted, for cheaper than we could get it in our local retail stores!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Does not last very long. No better than say L.A Looks ($2.00 bottle) with the exception that there is no flakes. But holding power is poor.</li>
            <li> Great product - Great Price</li>
            <li> i use this gel daily and got this about 2 years ago and still not even half way done amazing how long it will last love the smell overall great product cant complain</li>
            <li> Good product and more affordable than the competition.  I used to use a comparable Aveda product that was 50% more expensive until I found this stuff.  Does the job.  Doesn&#x27;t flake or have a strong smell.  We have a winner!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my significant other and he loves this product . It&#x27;s a great price for the amount it comes in</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother in law who has hair. I went bald about 10 years ago from all the stress of having to work, and family matters. Life is unfair, but at least I don&#x27;t have to spend any money on hair products or services anymore.</li>
            <li> Showed up spilled all over in the box! The lid hasd broken during shipping i guess... the product is what it is I  just wish for 30 bucks i could have got a whole bottle and not a big mess and half a bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband slicks his hair forward, when he cuts his hair down to a 3 this gel is not strong enough and he needs to use short sexy hair, but with in a week he is able to use crew and he loves it. Its thick enough to easily style moist hair, but not too thick so that it is like using rubber cement so he dosent use alot like he does with short sexy hair. This bottle is HUGE! Well worth the price if you use it daily. We just refill our regular size bottle with this to make it easier.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair gel I have ever found  Not heavy and holds well all day</li>
            <li> Buy it!! Buy it!! Buy it!!&lt;br /&gt;once applied whole day, your hair is set to the same position. Makes your hair smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> My favorite.  No flaking and smells good</li>
            <li> Been using for years &amp; 33.8 oz bottle with pump is the way to go!</li>
            <li> just what i wanted. i will order again!</li>
            <li> Love this product since it does not leave any residue or flakes.</li>
            <li> Great hair gel... Can&#x27;t beat this price for the amount</li>
            <li> This is a good product although the cap was cracked and some of the gel leaked from the container during shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to product for hair!</li>
            <li> Great overall experience..!</li>
            <li> Good price,good stuff!!</li>
            <li> this is a great price!</li>
            <li> Great hair gel! Have been using this product for years. Works well without any flakes.</li>
            <li> Works Okay. Some flaking does occurs.</li>
            <li> This is a product that my boyfriend uses on a regular bases, so rather than continue to buy several little bottles, we decided to buy the one big one. It arrived on time, in great shape and has been great for filling other bottles for home, work and gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed with quick delivery</li>
            <li> I would recommend to everyone. Now the my son is getting a little older, I want to gel his hair every time we go out. This brand gel is the best.</li>
            <li> Great hold and nice scent.</li>
            <li> Great stuff been using it for years</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  It is the only gel my husband will use. Much cheaper than buying it at a regular store.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel my husband uses.  For the price and the size of the bottle we got such a good deal for such a great gel.  My husband is very happy!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair product for years.  It works well and I have no desire to look for anything else.  Amazon&#x27;s price was for the large bottle is good.</li>
            <li> Husband began to use Crew after he borrowed grandsons&#x27; once when we were visiting.  It&#x27;s very good for his hair and does not look greasy or sticky.  It just looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this one product for about three years. He&#x27;s tried a couple of other ones, but always comes back to this one. It smells nice. I&#x27;m gonna warn you though, this stuff dries and leaves white stuff. You gotta make sure you keep your hair clean.</li>
            <li> The ONLY hair gel I will ever use--it has a great texture, smell to it.  Usually, with other hair gels, just the smell of it gives me a headache.  This is a light fragrance that is pleasant. Also, the bottle lasts a long time as you only need a small dag...especially compared to typical hair gels.  HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> yes I love this product more than anything in the world ameican crew gel for life I will order more</li>
            <li> I purchased the American Crew Firm Hold Hair Styling Gel - 33.8 oz from amazon as I now have Amazon Prime.  The product arrived very quickly, but the packaging was damaged in transit.  The top had cracked open and all the gel had spilled out.  Fortunately for the great customer service of Amazon.com, I received a refund and order the product again with no issues.  Two thumbs up for Amazon.  I am slowly buying more and more variety products with confidence from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> This is an excellent styling gel.  Economically packaged.</li>
            <li> Large bottle that should last about 1 year for me.  Hair product lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started using this particular brand of hair gel. I&#x27;ve been really frugal with my hair gel purchases because I believed that hair gel isn&#x27;t really that important, they&#x27;re all pretty much the same. Boy was I wrong. After my roommate raved about this gel and provided me with a sample, I was hooked. This gel is simply the best, and for the price it is phenomenal. My roommate paid $13 for about 8oz at walmart, whereas you can get 33.8oz for about $25 on amazon. Over four times the amount for less than doubled the price. Well onto the hair gel review.  I love this gel because it requires very little to give a nice firm hold. The gel stays on for the full day, I play racquetball about 3 hours a day, which causes me to sweat bullets. This gel does not skip a beat, it continues the hold extremely well. It also has a slight scent, I can&#x27;t really describe it, but its subtle and pretty great. It also NEVER flakes, I take naps with it on and it never flakes. It doesn&#x27;t really come off on my pillows either.  I just can&#x27;t praise this enough, its a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product for taming wild, frizzy, curly hair, and straight. Even thought this product is created for men, it works wonders on women&#x27;s hair.  My hair dresser told me about this and my daughter and I have been using it ever since. LOVE LOVE the results!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years it works well for me</li>
            <li> Works well, no perfume odor and hair looks natural, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product offered at a great price!</li>
            <li> Wash hair, towel dry, and put in damp hair, the hold lasts all day. The smell is great, manly.</li>
            <li> Good product, but it was not delivered on time</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery and reasonable price! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Was not &amp;#34;watered-down&amp;#34;.  Cheapest price I could find anywhere!</li>
            <li> Great price! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try something else and it was one of the top reviewed hair styling gels on Amazon. This product smells good and is easy to wash off your hands, but that&#x27;s just about the only good thing I have to say about. If you&#x27;re like me and like to spike your hair (not crazy spikes either, just slightly angled spiked hair) or simply want a long-lasting firm hold then this product is NOT for you. I&#x27;ve tried multiple methods of applying it; wet hair, damp hair, dry hair... nothing works. I don&#x27;t know why this it&#x27;s labeled as &amp;#34;firm hold&amp;#34;. Every day, by the end of the day it looks like I barely or didn&#x27;t apply this gel at all. I don&#x27;t touch my hair throughout the day and I don&#x27;t sweat either since I have an office job, but it never holds it look no matter how I apply it.</li>
            <li> Great Price.  Paid $15 for the 8.5 oz bottle at Wal-mart.  The product smells good and doesn&#x27;t flake white even after all day of use.</li>
            <li> It is the best gel anyone can use and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this brand.  It appears to be authentic and I have been buying this thing for the past two years.</li>
            <li> I have classic Dennis the Menace head. Every now and then I try a different hair gel. I am never satisfied and always go back to American Crew. I apply to damp hair, towel dry. My hair stays put without looking like I used any product at all.</li>
            <li> Beat price anywhere, try buying this for $27.00 at a salon Lol Won&#x27;t happen!! Great deal, super price, super fast delivery,  will be back!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the incredible price. In a hair salon this stuff would cost at least three times as much...</li>
            <li> these large bottles last me almost two years. Great stuff</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.Reasonable price</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves your products!</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for years however I found a large bottle of gel from Walmart with a pump top for 3 bucks that works just as good</li>
            <li> Exceptional styling gel.  Not gooey or sticky, yet it holds. My husband and I both use it.  It has a clean fragrance smell too.</li>
            <li> The best styling gel for men. I have used product for years and even thought its more expensive I still continued to buy it. Now that I use Amazon I found this product for way cheaper than major stores and buying the large bottle will last you months.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years.  Tried others to save some money, but coud&#x27;n&#x27;t find anything with as much control, yet flexible.  Very firm... especially if applied and left untouched.  It softens up a bit with a blow dry and running a comb or fingers through your hair.  Lasts all day and a touch up with damp refreshes it.</li>
            <li> Despite the product&#x27;s claim that it is firm hold, I do not recommend this product at all.  It does not harden into firm hold at all.  I even tried using much more than I have used of previous gels I have purchased - same results.  It looks like a gel but does nothing.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations as it has in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for along time and I love it.  The stiffness is exactly the right amount.  Update... The product that I purchased several years ago was very firm and I loved it.  They must have changed the formula as I would now call it medium to fair hold gel.  I no longer like it and I will no longer buy this product.</li>
            <li> Bottle top received broken&lt;br /&gt;Minimal product loss</li>
            <li> Works as described. Very good quality and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this gel but costs so much at the grocery store. This is such a great buy and at a great price too. Saved us a lot of money!! Plus it works awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this gel!  It gives you the hold you need to last throughout the day without the flaking of other gels!  Highly recommend it if you are having flaking/too much hold issues with your current gel.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of gel and it can get costly. I&#x27;ve paid $26.00 for a 16 oz. bottle because that&#x27;s the biggest size they carry where I live so I went on line and found a 33.3 oz bottle for just under $20.00 so I bought 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY hairgel I&#x27;ve come across that doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a gross teenage boy, and it doesn&#x27;t flake. Holds all day, great quality.</li>
            <li> I have used Crew firm hair gel for years.  In my opinion this is the best hair gel on the market.  Does not make your hair feel gummy or dirty as some gels do.  Also can be left wet look, blow dried or broken loss with fingers after it drys.  If you use gel you should try Crew.</li>
            <li> Great hold, doesn&#x27;t fake and it smells good, but not too strong of as scent. I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Irmproduct and has a good smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good and the price is great! Holds well and isn&#x27;t too sticky.</li>
            <li> Husband has been using it for 5+ years</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product that works for me these days.  I used to use the Aveda style wax (in the shape of a deodorant stick) until they stopped production.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t get too hard (unless you use too much) and washes out easily.  And it&#x27;s cheap.  Good stuff.  I buy the large bottle and refill several smaller bottles for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product.  So glad to have found it on Amazon (terrific savings !).</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as the Aveda product that I normally buy, but i was substantially cheaper, if you want a firmer hold go with the Aveda...</li>
            <li> Been using this for a decade, best price I have ever found!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I liked the price.</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with a little water while applying it to keep it from being too thick.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and have always been satisfied, but smaller sizes are not very cost effective.  This is the same great product at a great price.  As long as you have hair and intend to use gel, this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Did not realize this was so big. I&#x27;ve been using for years, though.</li>
            <li> This lasts me all year, so I get one for Christmas each year.  It takes just a little, applied to damp hair to work.</li>
            <li> I personally like a firmer hold and the scent is the one of the best out there. This product is excellent!</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of Crew gel.  The gel holds my hair in place all day.  My hair is straight, medium length.  I put the gel on after a shower or on damp hair, comb or brush hair into place, let it dry, then comb or brush again and my hair looks natural and in place all day long.  Best product I have every used.</li>
            <li> if anyone likes to use a styling gel for their hair, then you must try american crew brand. I absolutely love this stuff. first, the smell of this product is excellent. second the quality of the gel is fantastic. it is easy to put on the hair and truly holds the hair in place for the entire day. next, it&#x27;s not greasy. it simply washes off your hands with a little bit of water. you don&#x27;t have to scrub your hands with soap and water in order to get clean. finally, you cannot beat the price i got through amazon anywhere. it was a very significant savings. overall i couldn&#x27;t be happier with this deal.</li>
            <li> Described just as described in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but men don&#x27;t spend as much on products so that&#x27;s ok. Smells woodsy. Holds fine hair well. My husband was happy to get this as a gift from his adoring wife :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Use all the time. Glad amazon sells big bottle at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Very good product! It holds strongly and doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable. One down thing is that it should be a bit more concentrated instead of being diluted, so it takes time for the gel to hold firmly</li>
            <li> This gel works great if you know how to apply it. You do not have to use a great deal to get results. Not using too much water is the key. Use a blow dryer after applying the gel eventually gets the gel sticky enough for you to form your hair do. This is when you can use some water to readjust your hair style. If applied properly, the gel gives a nice textured look of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I do not like gels that are extremely shiny when dried and this gel when dry looks more natural. I absolutely love the smell of this gel when dried and find it intoxicating. The smell is not overly powerful, but fragrant.</li>
            <li> Great product. My husband loves it</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY 3 BOTTLE OF THIS PRODUCT, I ALSO USE THE SHAMPOO, AND CONDITIONER. I USE EVERY DAY, IT LOOKS LIKE ALLOT OF MY HAIR HAS STARTED TO RETURN TO MY HEAD, WHO KNOWS IF THIS IS HAPPENING IT LOOKS LIKE IT FROM THE PAST YEARS.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. Best hair gel there is.</li>
            <li> Great Product. My husband really loves it!</li>
            <li> I loved the large bottle for the same price as a small salon size. I do feel the CREW company has weakened down the incredients. The CREW is Firm but it does not hold as well as the less firm.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Great product</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for many years and has paid a lot of money for tiny bottles. We were thrilled to find it on Amazon and for a STEAL!</li>
            <li> Good price and quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 10+ years.  I&#x27;ve experimented with other brands but always come back to Crew.  Very expensive in the smaller bottles.  33.8 ounce bottle is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> American crew the best gel there is  always worth the money you spend  won t by any other gel  love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always like crew gel. Doesn&#x27;t flake and has great hold. Best price on amazon.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a little leaky, but the product is amazing and I only had to wash the bottle.  I think if the lid were taped down prior to shipping the issues would have been resolved.</li>
            <li> American Crew firm hair gel is the bet I have ever used. I have thick wiry hair that is very hard to control. This gel does a great job of taming the wiriness.  I have been using Crew products for about 10 years and haven&#x27;t bought another brand since. Their conditioner is also outstanding to me and contains some sort of medicating lotion in it that makes your scalp feel great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for years.  It has a neutral scent and doesn&#x27;t require much to keep the hair happy in its place.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy this gel as long as I have hair &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> So much bigger and less expensive that what I was getting in the stores.  Walmart doesn&#x27;t even carry this, so we came looking here.  Such a better deal!  This is great gel that holds well.</li>
            <li> I was paying $21 for a 15 oz. bottle at every retailer that sold it (Walmart, Meijer, etc.). And then I found this for $27 and free shipping. Can&#x27;t beat it. I won&#x27;t anywhere else for my Crew now.</li>
            <li> By far this is the best gel! I have ever used. I would enjoy purchasing American Crew gel again. The big bottle lasts forever. I would say at least 6-7 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many of the other gels and they cause dandruff and flakes while American Crew does not promote dandruff or flakes on my hair. It also smells pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> Great hold that lasts</li>
            <li> Great gel, much better then the cheap stuff at the store. Good strong hold and great smell. Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair or dry it out. Worth the price, American Crew products are the best I have found.</li>
            <li> American CREW is  very expensive in stores and salons so when I sawthis  33.8 oz bottle  for a reasonable price I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;First off it just too much for personal use, you have to buy a plastic bottle to pour some of  it  into.  I&#x27;m not impressed with the&lt;br /&gt;texture it gives your hair.  I like  Loreal for men better</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  The bottle has lasted very long, the product has a great smell, and the gel leaves hair looking natural yet firm.  Great product for those who want to start styling their hair.</li>
            <li> Great hold.  I have found nothing better than American Crew.  A little dab usually does the trick</li>
            <li> Holds well, best things is no flakes unless a lot of the other products I have used. I am a regular purchaser.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel because it claimed a &amp;#34;firm hold&amp;#34; but it did not meet the expectation. It smells good but not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this on behalf of a friend since i get the 2 day shipping...Personally, I think it is made out of crap but whatever</li>
            <li> received as advertised</li>
            <li> not a strong hold, didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> Love this gel and Amazon has it at a great price! Can&#x27;t lose</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  Its NOT the Glue Stiff feel.  Its a nice hold and wont make your scalp feel sticky or gooey.  I ordered the 33.8 ounce (2 of them) for the deal and then squeeze it into a smaller container to leave out.  The 33.8 size is HUGE! but will last a while.  If your very active it will wear out overtime so I keep a spare small travel bottle in the car for touch ups.  Price is the only con but like all things quality, you pay for it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into style then you have come to the right place. American Crew products are in my opinion some of the best on the Market and for the price that you can get it for on Amazon you just cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> My husband thinks this gel is the best!  He has tried many others without successfully keeping his hair in place.</li>
            <li> I use American Crew each morning and it holds up all day.  Better yet, it has a suttle cologne scent which I appreciate much more than most products which typically have a floral scent. Better still, buying the product on Amazon saved me 50% off of the cost at my retail store.</li>
            <li> Excellent holding without the greasy look.</li>
            <li> Used the brand for years, and this is a great price on this find. Less then half of the place who used to carry the products locally for me</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, I have seen a big difference in my hair texture.</li>
            <li> I have been using&lt;br /&gt;American Crew for years and  love it.  I arrived right on time and all was great!</li>
            <li> We like this product, my boys like the smell, I just wish it was a firmer hold</li>
            <li> great price for this 33.3 once bottle well worth the money</li>
            <li> This styling gel is very effective! The gel holds your hair up great and for a long time! ...unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried before. And did I mention it smells GOOD too! Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> The other reviewers have pretty much got this one right, it is the best hair gel I have used to date. I have relatively short hair and it holds it in place. Having black hair has always been tough because it is easy to see when other gels flake white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this is that when you put it on, it takes a while to harden. I have found that an easy fix is to use a hair dryer and comb to get it exactly how you want it and dry it more quickly. Once in place, it stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for a strong hold without the nasty crust. It also smells pretty good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this because my salon uses the same stuff. CREW seems to be the salon choice of product around my area. Overall it&#x27;s got a good hold but isn&#x27;t super heavy. Doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a flaky residue either (if used in moderation). The color is clear so even if you use slightly too much you can&#x27;t really tell unlike other products.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner. Product is as advertised. Very happy about this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using American Crew products for the past14 years. I was introduced to the product from an old girlfriend, back when I was in my early 20s. The thing that I liked about the Firm Holding Gel was that there was no real &amp;#34;flaking&amp;#34; once the product dried in your hair. I used to use many other types of products prior to AC, but was impressed by this one simple thing. After, I started buying all their hair products. I&#x27;m a firm believer in your body and hair doesn&#x27;t like a lot changes in products, chemical, and such. I have always had sensative skin, so I try to find good products and stick with them, to not &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34; the body, skin, or hair which could cause damage. I believe I have used the same aftershave, shaving cream, hair products (American Crew), and soap brand for the past 10+ years. Anyway, great product, never had any issues with AC. Glad they are still around...</li>
            <li> It is really old styling gel not as I was expecting, I love crew products as i am using the small ones and they work fine. This type of gel makes my hair like other cheap gel i used to use from supermarket.</li>
            <li> I started buying the more expensive hair gel at my barber. I realized that I could save a ton of money if I bought it at a larger quantity.</li>
            <li> The gel is nearly as equal as applying water to the hair. Barely holds, even though it says maximum hold. Runs off the hands when applied. Serves no purpose.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for over 3 years, I wouldn&#x27;t want any other gel than Crew!!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not a big supporter of hair \\&quot;gels\\&quot;, this product surprised me. Plain and simple, dudes shouldn&#x27;t be using \\&quot;gels\\&quot;, try pomade, clay, wax, paste, anything but gel.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this product is good as a \\&quot;Base Product\\&quot;, meaning you put it in, blow-dry it, and add your finishing product. This product will give you an excellent hold after blow drying, since you blow dry it in, there won&#x27;t be any shine, and no texture or separation, just hold, which is fine because you&#x27;re finishing with a different product to achieve your final look.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is awful, just like all gels, unless used before you blow-dry.</li>
            <li> Gonna be totally honest here, used LA looks for years and it wasn&#x27;t cutting it, nor was the countless other things that I&#x27;ve been too lazy to return to these pharmacies that crusted up/flaked up/ frizzed my hair, so I searched mens gel and this came up with some good reviews so I went for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: I read other reviews about it being packaged shady without any type of seal, mine came shrink wrapped (thumbs up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: I put a quarter sized amount into my damp hair when I got out of the shower and had no fly aways did the combover, the combover done right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3: I&#x27;m not sure how to explain this but if it dries a way you don&#x27;t like, simple add a little more, style the way you wanted and it doesn&#x27;t overcrust and plaster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4: scent, complements my cologne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product and if you&#x27;re like me that&#x27;s tried everything its worth it to pay the price of all the products you&#x27;ve tried to get it right the first time, you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> This product is my number one choice for hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;Of course had to buy the size that&#x27;s a bit to big for gym bag.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband.  He has very thick dark hair.  There is no flaking, stickiness, or residue in his hair from this gel.  It has a nice smell, not overwhelming at all.  This is the only gel my husband will use.</li>
            <li> Great hair gel.  Not sticky or tacky when dried.  Leaves hair still feeling light, yet controlled. Doesn&#x27;t leave any funky smells like some hair gels.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great without flaking like some of the cheaper brands. This has the same consistency as the product I bought in a retail store. It holds your hair in place for the entire day. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using american crew for quite some time, and i love it. it&#x27;s been the best fit gel style for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Crew mens hair gel for over ten years now and las I checked it was going for around $11 for a 8.4 ounce bottle. This would last me around 2 years. This bottle sells for around $27 for a 33.8 ounce bottle! Should last for a long,long time!</li>
            <li> American crew good hold hair</li>
            <li> I have used Paul Mitchell for 20 years and switched to Crew and love it.  Holds you hair well and smells great.</li>
            <li> I like this a whole lot, I have never used before but I was looking around for a gel that can hold my hair firmly and gives it some volume. I found these, they dont make your hair all shinny, which I like, the smell is very pleasant, unlike certain other brands that smell like horse poop lol. For the price of 33.8 oz, it is dirt cheap. I paid 20 bucks for a 1/4 of the volume of this bottle. Amazon shipped it relatively quickly and It came in undamaged. It makes my hair looks nice, which i like. Highly recommend , dont think I am going to change to another brand anytime soon, or ever....</li>
            <li> Makes your hair look dy and without life</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and have been very satisfied. Nice to purchase in a large size, I refill older smaller containers for ease of use.</li>
            <li> Great price for the quantity.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> This gel is the best I&#x27;ve used.  NO flaking, no itchiness, no helmet head!  My hair feels and looks great using this gel.  The smell is a bit strong if you use a lot, kind of chemical-ish but it has not damaged my hair after using daily.  I bought the mega size bottle knowing it&#x27;s a ridiculous size for hair gel but I plan to use it long term so why not save some money?</li>
            <li> My husband was breaking out with severe acne. We started to realize it was the cheap hair gels he was using. When he sweated or played sports, it would drip down his face and really irritate it. Since switching to this product, the break outs have stopped.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on cheap hair gel that&#x27;s sticky and flakes when dry. The last thing you need is flakes that look like dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel smells nice (and manly), doesn&#x27;t flake, and holds. That&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li> I really like this gel and it was ridiculously cheaper here than in any brick-and-mortar store. The gel has good hold on my hair but is still light and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, which admittedly is on the thin side. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t flake late in the day either. I had a pump from my last bottle and I only need one pump to cover my head. Great product.</li>
            <li> My salon friend recommended this and been using it since.  Great product and the rest of the Crew products are excellent.</li>
            <li> I knew exactly what I was ordering since I have used this product before.</li>
            <li> Good product. Will buy it again +A product. I have been using cheap of the counter hair gel all my life, But after trying this product for the first time i can tell the difference in the way it smells and the way your hair looks. I suggest buying the small one first. so you can try it.</li>
            <li> Been trying new pomades, waxes, pastes, gels every month it seems..just couldn&#x27;t find the perfect one - this is it!  Just the right amount of thickness, holds all day, smells good, adds a little shine, easy to rinse off...and love the big bottle with the optional pump.  One less annoyance in the morning!    **Update: 1 Year Later:  I&#x27;ve used about a quarter size amount of this gel everyday, as well as my 9yo son a few times a week, and after purchasing in Jan of 2014 am just now in need of more.  That&#x27;s over 1 year&#x27;s worth just to give you an idea of size.  Not bad for the price...</li>
            <li> The American crew gel I bought in the past had a very strong distinct and pleasant smell to it. This one, a very faint smell. I thought, is it old? Then my scalp began to itch pretty bad. Now I&#x27;m wondering is it cut down with cheap gel. My scalp never itched like this before with American crew, but has with cheap store brand. Stopped using it, itching stopped. I thought the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Has been my go to gel for over five years. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The best hair products I have try I will definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a hair gel</li>
            <li> After finding this gel and using  I won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy and is keeps your hair in place</li>
            <li> Buy this with the hand pump!! Unless you like picking this giant thing up every time you need to use it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years now and I love it. It has nice smell and holds hair well.</li>
            <li> The gel does the job for the most part but I personally prefer my old gel that I was using previously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair gel for years now. Holds throughout the day. Will even hold after I&#x27;ve run my fingers through it several times. Occasionally leaves very small flakes when using too much.</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use any other hair gel other than American Crew firm hold, but the store prices are really expensive. I found this online and loved the price and loved that it came with free delivery.</li>
            <li> Crew products works great. Make sure to order pump with this size. Difficult to handle because of size.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time and saved a ton by buying a larger bottle.Also, this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> quick shipping, as described</li>
            <li> Whats not to love. It is what it says, and at one fourth the price to buy it in stores.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the American crew shampoo I buy at hairmasters. It really doesn&#x27;t smell at all. When I received it it was spilled all over the inside of the box. U guess I will continue to buy it more expensive from my local salon.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel out there right now. Out performs all others and at a good price. I recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid up to 16.00 for a small bottle of the same gel at a retail store.  Never again!  This product is much cheaper to buy at Amazon.com, and I splurged and bought a pump to go with it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the size when the product arrived, and realized it will probably last at least 6 months if not more.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is way too firm for thin hair.  Twenty years ago it probably would have worked well on my hair when it was much thicker.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Doesn&#x27;t clump and cause your hair to turn white.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair jizz that keeps my jew curls under control.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, doesn&#x27;t use alcohol.  Best stuff!  Your hair will love it! And at that price, who could say no?</li>
            <li> My husband will only use Crew products.  He swears by it.</li>
            <li> Just plain good stuff. Does what I need it to so I just keep using it and have for years.</li>
            <li> Best hair gel I have ever used, doesn&#x27;t flake &amp; smell&#x27;s good, also can&#x27;t get this size in the store&#x27;s. AWESOME PRICEüëç</li>
            <li> Very good gel! It doesn&#x27;t flake at all and it smells nice.  It&#x27;s a big difference from regular gels like Dep or LA Looks.</li>
            <li> The shipment came on time , and I always use Crew for men works great</li>
            <li> was considerably less per once than anywhere else on the net. I saved my smaller bottle and will fill it from this large one. Gel is great, not too stiff and combs out easily.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Great price</li>
            <li> this is the gel that me and my two sons use religiously. it&#x27;s expensive in salons but if you buy the large size on Amazon it&#x27;s a good deal because you only need a little bit. I really love the smell</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I needed something that would slick my long blonde hair back. What I love most about this hair gel is that it holds my hair all day no matter what, even after taking a nap or riding in the car with the windows rolled down. It&#x27;s much stronger than the pomades and creams I was using before, AND let&#x27;s not forget about the unbeatable price. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better deal out there for a hair product of this quality. It may seem expensive at first, but it lasts a long time. I bought this 34 ounce container a month ago and I&#x27;m not even half way through with it! This is coming from someone who uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> These are the large bottles. I tend to try to use gels without alcohol in them as it drys out and damages the hair. This stuff fits the bill and works great! Long lasting hold for the entire day, but not super stiff. Pleasant scent as well. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I would call this closer to a medium hold than to a Firm Hold. You would really have to use a lot of it to get a Firm Hold, but maybe that is why they sell it in such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I know I like this product. I&#x27;ve used it plenty of times in the past, but the price I&#x27;ve found it for on Amazon has me buying it here forever. Two of the 8.45oz bottles in stores cost more than one of these 33.8oz bottles on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is very, very firm - it&#x27;s not quite a freeze spray, but it still gives you that gelled look and feel - very hard to the tough, very dark, shiny but not quite pomade or other paste-based product type of shiny.</li>
            <li> great price, and excellent gel.  I hate that &amp;#34;gelled&#x27; look.  You know, those guys whose hair looks harder than marble.  I use about 2 half-dollar amounts to style, and after about 30 minutes, run my hands through to break up my hair some.  Works exceptionally to give more volume, and give all the benefits of firm hold without any flaking or crunchy appearance.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Fast and definitely worth it. I will be coming back for morw, my husband loves this product. Great experience.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep in my drawer at work so I can have some gel just in case. I like the product and am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> the hair gel holds well, my hair is coarse so i hope the hair spray added will help. i will see what happens</li>
            <li> Product is great. Cheaper than the bottle that is half the size.</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING even in a mega snowstorm in NY!  Fabulous price....will be back!!</li>
            <li> What I like:&lt;br /&gt;Great value (American Crew products can be pricey, so this big bottle saves me some money.)&lt;br /&gt;Great manly piney scent that&#x27;s not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;Does not flake after drying like those cheap gels you get at local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;Strong hold for hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;Wears out after a few hours depending on your activity levels and hair thickness (If you have thick long hair, by that, I mean anything that is longer and thicker than Brad Pitt in Fight Club and you walk to work, re-application is often required.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s probably the best you can get if you don&#x27;t wanna spend a fortune. And if you&#x27;re a just simple guy, it&#x27;s all that you need for hair products.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and a really really really great price!! Thanks to all</li>
            <li> I just found the hair gel for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Other than the cost, this gel is really good.  I like it because it provides a good hold but does not feel heavy, sticky, or gewy.  It dries light but with a firm hold.  It also does not make my head itch.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS MY HUSBAND&#x27;S FAVORITE HAIR DRESSING. IT HOLDS HIS HAIR AND LOOKS NATURAL. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> THREW THE WHOLE BOTTLE OUT. TOO MUCH FLAKING BOUGHT AMERICAN CREW CLASSIC FIBER BLUE. AND ITS CHEAPER AT THE DRUG STORE.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised!</li>
            <li> Have been using this gel for about 5 years now and have bought it on Amazon ever since they started carrying this size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About half price than the leading brick and mortar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing deal.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and replaced other more expensive gel products</li>
            <li> My husband loves this styling gel and we can not find the 33 oz bottle in the stores now.</li>
            <li> Quick to arrive and what I expected!!</li>
            <li> A lot of Hair Gel for a great price.</li>
            <li> This gel works great for wet or shower dried hair.  Leaves your hands a bit sticky but otherwise I&#x27;d say I like it overall.  Smells good and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> After searching here in town I price compared and was able to find this gel for a great price right here on Amazon. I was worried about it shipping and arriving to my home and then sitting outside until I returned home in the evening and freezing but thankfully I was home the day it arrived.  I was pleased with what I recieved and will indeed order this way again!</li>
            <li> Great product!! It hold your hair firm, but at the same time keeps your hair feeling natural.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  The size of the bottle is huge and the price was great for the size. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using CREW for about 10 years, I loved the product because it held my very fine hair in place and CREW doesn&#x27;t flake during the day for me. I really enjoyed the product unfortunately because CREW has changed the ingredient it is not holding my hair like it once did, I am looking for something to replace CREW.</li>
            <li> Great price for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, my hair just doesn&#x27;t behave itself.  If a slight breeze blows, my hair stays whereever the wind blew it last.  No longer a worry for me because of this product.  I really like everything about it except for the price of the smaller bottles.  That&#x27;s why I bought this huge bottle for just a few dollars more. In addition, I ordered an &amp;#34;American Crew / Nioxin Pump for liter / 33.8 oz&amp;#34; for just a few dollars and the bottle just sits on my vanity ready to go.  I highly recommend this setup.</li>
            <li> Works well, good size for the price</li>
            <li> This gel smells great and has a okay hold. The look of the gel in your hair looks great. But this product will last about 10 hours for a hold.</li>
            <li> I have not received the gel yet but I also bought this gel from somewhere else and have been very pleased with it.  I had been looking for a gel to replace the much less expensive gel I used for many, many years.  The former gel did the job but.....the flakes were out of control. I was never really sure, if the flakes were dandruff or the gel. As it turned out, the old gel caused most or all of the flakes.  I do not notice any flakes now. I was a little surprised initially by the strong smell (strong compared to the old gel) and was ready to stop using it but the intensity of the smell went away when it dried. I like the smell now.  This gel also seems to last longer and control the hair better. After sleeping on it, my hair still looks good. I have not used it very long but my hair also seems to look healthier.  I have one regret: not buying this product years ago</li>
            <li> Great deal! Same stuff that cost $12.99 for 5-8 oz at the local drug store..</li>
            <li> The American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel is a great product, as are most Crew products. A little goes a long way and this bottle should last months.</li>
            <li> Perfect and good price</li>
            <li> Great, very happy with product. Will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> Great hair product and great price!</li>
            <li> It is as advertised and much cheaper than buying in a store.</li>
            <li> Product has great hold for the entire day.  I like how this gel does not flake like other gels I have used over the years.  I also feel like this gel darkens my hair which is good for grays are making way into my scalp.  This darkens the grays.  Not sure why but does for me.  I keep hair tight and clean cut with wavy spike at top.  Purchase 33.8 with pump and save money.</li>
            <li> excellent hair product. The best on the market. The this price, best I&#x27;ve seen...</li>
            <li> my husbands favorite. huge bottle</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair gel by far.  It has a pleasant &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell without being overbearing.  It also dries relatively quickly and keeps your hair in place without that &amp;#34;slicked back&amp;#34; appearance.  Another plus is that it does not cause any flaking, especially in the drier winter months this is a huge plus!  I would say the only problem I encountered is by the end of the day it loses some of it&#x27;s hold, especially if you&#x27;ve been sweating.  However, this is probably standard for most hair gels anyway.  Keep in mind too, a little goes a long way, so there&#x27;s not a need to glob it on, and if you do it can appear too stiff and unnatural.</li>
            <li> Better then the other ones.  Doesn&#x27;t cause flaking at all like other gel brands do. People who say this gel isn&#x27;t strong, well think again, it works.  I&#x27;ve tried over 30 different gel brands and only three worked. One being American Crew, another &amp;#34;tree&amp;#34; and I can&#x27;t remember the last one. Overall.  Awesome brand to buy.</li>
            <li> Only gel my husband will use. Been buying this for years.</li>
            <li> There are many good things about this product.  This gel doesn&#x27;t feel cheaply made like some others that I&#x27;ve used.  Has a masculine scent to it, it&#x27;s as it&#x27;s described.  Very light, keeps my hair in place (whether spiked hair or however I style it).  It was actually recommended by the barber shop I went to.  That was about 4 yrs ago.  Still using this product till now.  Now that I&#x27;ve found a bigger size for a better price, that&#x27;s just bonus.  I won&#x27;t be buying for awhile which would last me for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, only bad thing is (this goes for many other gels too) is that when you lay your head down.  It gets matted down and once again this happen to all gel products.  Also, when it rains real hard, gel starts to come off.  This is normal so, other than that, this product is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I received what I ordered but it was not what I wanted.  I thought I was getting the Crew \\&quot;Super Glue\\&quot;.  I am very disappointed with the product I received.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this gel, but it is so expensive in the local stores. This is a bigger bottle and a better price. Will certainly buy again!</li>
            <li> For me, this gel has the perfect balance of lightness and hold.  Other mousse and gel products may look good when I leave the house, but fall apart within a few hours.  Crew-Firm gets me through long days -sometimes 16 hours.  It is a good product for medium to thick hair.</li>
            <li> would have ginen 5 stars but I think it should have come with a pump. I had to buy one separate.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. This arrived on time and in perfect condition. I plan on ordering this again once I run out</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for years..keeps his hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> Very good product. on time delivery</li>
            <li> I like American Crew, and this product does exactly as it says. Personally it holds my hair a little too hard, and I should have bought a medium or light hold. I still use it though, looks and smells great</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Ideal for styling short to medium length hair without being overly stiff. This &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; bottle should last for a good while.</li>
            <li> A pump with the bottle would be nice.</li>
            <li> My bottle had a crack in it. Didnt notice it because i have a pump on it.</li>
            <li> Crew is a great gel and at this size and price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I really like the product.</li>
