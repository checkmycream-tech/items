            <li>It felt like touching a baby skin!  </li>
            <li>Fabulous Eye Cream (a great under eye cream</li>
            <li>and it does nicely at that.</li>

            <li>The Better Botanicals stuff seems as good and cheaper and made with \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was SUPER excited to try this product; I&#x27;m on a chemically-conscious cosmetic binge and My Chelle products came up in my search to find the perfect skin care</li>
            <li>It is a very light rose/floral scent that is not at all perfumy.</li>
            <li>I love the screen</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used MyChelle for about 3 years now and am still totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I agree that they are not inexpensive, but neither are they out of proportion given the excellent ingredients and the amount of research in back of the products (check out MyChelle&#x27;s website) and the price of comparable products.  </li>
            <li>Try it out,  you&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>A scent that smells like fresh-cut vegetables means nothing to the overall awesome quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A scent that smells like fresh-cut vegetables means nothing to the overall awesome quality of the product.    </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product. .</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Was expecting much more, but found that it&#x27;s just another semi-mediocre moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this more for the wrinkle fighting than anything else.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more hydrated and nourished by this cream  </li>
            <li>actually love the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found Mychelle products.</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>maybe more, like 4 or 5 years....</li>
            <li>This face cream has been a favorite of mine for years.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it online.</li>
            <li>and liked it tremendously.</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural products and this one works great.  </li>
            <li>Best clean facial cream I have found.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it felt - never greasy and absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great product that does keep ones skin soft and supple, like all MyChelle products they are creamy and clean, absorbs well.</li>
            <li>This Deep Repair cream is very rich and emollient, and I find the scent pleasant.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too heavy); Pumpkin Renew Cream (a great lightweight moisturizer, especially for summer months); Fruit Enzyme Mist (WONDERFUL toner!</li>
            <li>and it really smoothes out your skin); Oil-free Grapefruit Cream (a nice alternative for the summer, or if you&#x27;re having any breakouts...</li>
            <li>so I went to Whole Foods to see what they had for a nice night time moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have to say it really is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It is light and non-greasy and helps keep my skin hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different moisturizers and this one is great.  </li>
            <li>but I have found others (that are also using healthy ingredients without sodium lauryl sulfate, paraben, etc) to be equally as good with a smaller price tag.  </li>
            <li>It smells very fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a super floral fragrance that&#x27;s a bit off-putting, but honestly, by the time I&#x27;m ready to put on makeup it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought it wasn&#x27;t the most pleasing fragrance, but I&#x27;m used to it now</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it wasn&#x27;t the most pleasing fragrance, but I&#x27;m used to it now</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle and pleasant and it is perfect for my mature combination skin.</li>
            <li>The Deep Repair Cream used to make my skin feel enveloped in moisture, but not heavy, just beautifully, perfectly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something light with good absorption and with the proper hydrating attributes to keep my face hydrated while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it at night on a clean face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>Feels rich, yet absorbs quickly and without residue.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>The cream itself is amazing, such nice texture and very hydrating.</li>
            <li>my face was bright red.</li>
            <li>Use it after applying C Serum or to refresh during the day); Clear Skin Serum (great for spot treating breakouts - use pumpkin renew cream afterward); Fruit Enzyme Scrub (really nice scrub; use it every other day or just once a week</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;ve used other MyChelle products and been happy with them...</li>
            <li>quickly received, as described.</li>
            <li>Light texture thus very absorb ant leaving skin feeling smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li>It can be used by a broad range of skin types as either a day creme or a light weight night creme paired with your favorite treatment product before bed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if any wrinkles and fine lines are diminished, but I certainly feel an improvement in skin texture and tone.  </li>
            <li>After the first day using it, I touched my face and almost screamed at myself in the mirror!</li>
            <li>I received the fastest results after the first two days using them!</li>
            <li>There is a slight floral fragrance (not unpleasant at all and not lingering) and it absorbs remarkably well.  </li>
            <li>They must have REALLY oily skin or be used to extremely light weight moisturizers.</li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s absorbed and my make up is on, I don&#x27;t smell it anyhow.  </li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s absorbed and my make up is on, I don&#x27;t smell it anyhow.  </li>
            <li>While I will always be a devotee of 3Lab M cream, this is a really nice DEEP moisturizer for once a week use.</li>
            <li>I live in an extremely dry climate and if I don&#x27;t moisturize with a great product after showering or washing my face, my skin tightens up in minutes.  </li>
            <li>I work in the Spa Industry and have used MANY face cremes and face care products in general.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31, and my skin is normal to dry; I find Deep Repair Cream perfect for the winter months</li>
            <li>Now my skin is very much off balance.</li>
            <li>When I first started using MyChelle products, I used the Pumpkin Renew Cream (which is fabulous), but as I learned more about each product, I decided I should try the Deep Repair Cream for my &#x27;mature&#x27; (over 28) skin.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try a lighter cream from the same company and see if it works better.</li>
            <li>At any rate, you can try this in a sample size, I did and bought a whole jar!</li>
            <li>The apple brightening mist has made the age spots faded away in the first week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Excellent product especially for those who have sensitive skin and are allergic to the many chemicals found in typical facial creams.</li>
            <li>It is a rich and nourishing creme (but NOT heavy like one reviewer commented?</li>
            <li>Deep Repair Cream is a great moderately heavy moisturizer, though it is not at all greasy, and the smell is pleasantly mild.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous and I always notice a negative difference when I stop using it for a while); Revitalizing Night Cream (nice evening cream...</li>
            <li>I think they may have changed the formula on this, because I have used it in the past and loved it.  </li>
            <li>While the old formula used to be super concentrated</li>
            <li>The reason i&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because the scent was way too strong for me and not to my taste, I couldn&#x27;t wear it and had to send it back.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, flaky skin that laughed at just about every over-the-counter facial moisturizer you could think of.  </li>
            <li>Although, I was often dissapointed by how small the offerings are it seems more realistic to me now considering the more natural ingredients and lack of toxic preservatives.</li>
            <li>It really really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the real test was if would stand up under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very earthy, herbally scent.  </li>
            <li>It has a very earthy, herbally scent.  </li>
            <li>I went into the bathroom and much to my horror...</li>
            <li>Just way too much \\&quot;heaviness\\&quot; for daytime use.</li>
            <li>then one day, I was here on Amazon looking for more natural blends, thinking maybe that would be the answer to my life-long issue with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is definately suitable as a day creme that can be used alone or under makeup without feeling too heavy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s twenty bucks, people...comparable to full price drugstore moisturizers of the same volume.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, though evidently not as sensitive as a couple of reviewers, and love every MyChelle product I&#x27;ve tried thus far.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unscented, moisturizing face cream.</li>
            <li>I used this on top of my regular acne moisturizer because my face wash has 10% benzoyl peroxide, which can make your skin very dry.</li>
            <li>(I live in a semi-arid climate).  </li>
            <li>, after seven years of avoiding makeup, I decided to give it a try again (a new man in your life can do that sometimes).  </li>
            <li>This has become a product I can&#x27;t live</li>
            <li>After trying many kinds of moisturizers, including those easily purchased at drug stores, expensive types like Lancome, etc, and many other supposedly \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products, I finally stumbled upon MyChelle products.  </li>
            <li>In between spa projects I often find myself using high quality natural lines like MyChelle.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using it too quickly, use on a freshly washed not completely dry face and it&#x27;ll take a lot less.</li>
            <li>By time I had washed my faced, used toner and applied the moisturizer, my skin was flaking as I began applying makeup; and within ten minutes after completing my makeup, the creases and dryness were even more apparent as my dry spots soaked in the makeup, creating unsightly discolorations.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the least bit worried when I saw the new packaging because I was sure the formula hadn&#x27;t changed.  </li>
            <li>Over the next 1-2 weeks, if you have been using a more basic skin creme or less nourishing  face creme you will notice much softer and hydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It only takes a little bit and makeup goes on smoothly on top of it.  </li>
            <li>It is not as heavy as some creams; it is smooth and soft to apply.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After nearly three decades of fighting with flaky, peeling skin under my foundation, MyChelle has come to the rescue.  </li>
            <li>old and have not had a problem with pimples in years until using these products.</li>
            <li>the whole line actually!  </li>
            <li>However, during that same time period, I have been battling acne that is unusual for me.  </li>
            <li>but since the aromas in MyChelle are from natural botanicals and not artifiial fragrances</li>
            <li>How old am I again?</li>
            <li>have age spots and have tried so many expensive cosmetic lines such as Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair and Even Skintone Illuminator including Dr Hauschka&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>It sinks in easily and leaves a comfortable amount of moisture for me...without feeling like an oil slick later in the day.  </li>
            <li>Also, they have recently added hypo-allergenic versions of some of their creams, so for highly sensitive skin, that would be the way to go.)any breakouts...)    </li>
            <li>Also, they have recently added hypo-allergenic versions of some of their creams, so for highly sensitive skin, that would be the way to go.)</li>
            <li>And even the next day, after having removed the make up the night before, my skin has remained supple, soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li>The only reason this cream has 4/5 stars currently is from 3-4 year old reviews back when the formula of the cream hadn&#x27;t changed radically.</li>
            <li>skin is dry, sensitive and prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I read both current and past reviews and decided it would be worth my while to try the cream regardless of the complaints regarding the formula change.</li>
            <li>It fixed the dry, controlled the oil, and allowed me to learn how to graciously accept compliments on my glowing skin!</li>
            <li>I regret this very seriously, as this cream has caused my skin to break out pretty intensely.</li>
            <li>The dry climate I live in (southern California), in addition to all of the acne products I use causes my skin to get extremely dry.</li>

            <li> I have to say it really is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It is light and non-greasy and helps keep my skin hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different moisturizers and this one is great.  </li>
            <li> but I have found others (that are also using healthy ingredients without sodium lauryl sulfate, paraben, etc) to be equally as good with a smaller price tag.  </li>
            <li> It smells very fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a super floral fragrance that&#x27;s a bit off-putting, but honestly, by the time I&#x27;m ready to put on makeup it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought it wasn&#x27;t the most pleasing fragrance, but I&#x27;m used to it now</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it wasn&#x27;t the most pleasing fragrance, but I&#x27;m used to it now</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and pleasant and it is perfect for my mature combination skin.</li>
            <li> The Deep Repair Cream used to make my skin feel enveloped in moisture, but not heavy, just beautifully, perfectly moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something light with good absorption and with the proper hydrating attributes to keep my face hydrated while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it at night on a clean face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> Feels rich, yet absorbs quickly and without residue.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> The cream itself is amazing, such nice texture and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> my face was bright red.</li>
            <li> Use it after applying C Serum or to refresh during the day); Clear Skin Serum (great for spot treating breakouts - use pumpkin renew cream afterward); Fruit Enzyme Scrub (really nice scrub; use it every other day or just once a week</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;ve used other MyChelle products and been happy with them...</li>
            <li> quickly received, as described.</li>
            <li> Light texture thus very absorb ant leaving skin feeling smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li> It can be used by a broad range of skin types as either a day creme or a light weight night creme paired with your favorite treatment product before bed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if any wrinkles and fine lines are diminished, but I certainly feel an improvement in skin texture and tone.  </li>
            <li> After the first day using it, I touched my face and almost screamed at myself in the mirror!</li>
            <li> I received the fastest results after the first two days using them!</li>
            <li> There is a slight floral fragrance (not unpleasant at all and not lingering) and it absorbs remarkably well.  </li>
            <li> They must have REALLY oily skin or be used to extremely light weight moisturizers.</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s absorbed and my make up is on, I don&#x27;t smell it anyhow.  </li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s absorbed and my make up is on, I don&#x27;t smell it anyhow.  </li>
            <li> While I will always be a devotee of 3Lab M cream, this is a really nice DEEP moisturizer for once a week use.</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely dry climate and if I don&#x27;t moisturize with a great product after showering or washing my face, my skin tightens up in minutes.  </li>
            <li> I work in the Spa Industry and have used MANY face cremes and face care products in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31, and my skin is normal to dry; I find Deep Repair Cream perfect for the winter months</li>
            <li> Now my skin is very much off balance.</li>
            <li> When I first started using MyChelle products, I used the Pumpkin Renew Cream (which is fabulous), but as I learned more about each product, I decided I should try the Deep Repair Cream for my &#x27;mature&#x27; (over 28) skin.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try a lighter cream from the same company and see if it works better.</li>
            <li> At any rate, you can try this in a sample size, I did and bought a whole jar!</li>
            <li> The apple brightening mist has made the age spots faded away in the first week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Excellent product especially for those who have sensitive skin and are allergic to the many chemicals found in typical facial creams.</li>
            <li> It is a rich and nourishing creme (but NOT heavy like one reviewer commented?</li>
            <li> Deep Repair Cream is a great moderately heavy moisturizer, though it is not at all greasy, and the smell is pleasantly mild.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fabulous and I always notice a negative difference when I stop using it for a while); Revitalizing Night Cream (nice evening cream...</li>
            <li> I think they may have changed the formula on this, because I have used it in the past and loved it.  </li>
            <li> While the old formula used to be super concentrated</li>
            <li> The reason i&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because the scent was way too strong for me and not to my taste, I couldn&#x27;t wear it and had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, flaky skin that laughed at just about every over-the-counter facial moisturizer you could think of.  </li>
            <li> Although, I was often dissapointed by how small the offerings are it seems more realistic to me now considering the more natural ingredients and lack of toxic preservatives.</li>
            <li> It really really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the real test was if would stand up under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very earthy, herbally scent.  </li>
            <li> It has a very earthy, herbally scent.  </li>
            <li> I went into the bathroom and much to my horror...</li>
            <li> Just way too much \\&quot;heaviness\\&quot; for daytime use.</li>
            <li> then one day, I was here on Amazon looking for more natural blends, thinking maybe that would be the answer to my life-long issue with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is definately suitable as a day creme that can be used alone or under makeup without feeling too heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s twenty bucks, people...comparable to full price drugstore moisturizers of the same volume.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, though evidently not as sensitive as a couple of reviewers, and love every MyChelle product I&#x27;ve tried thus far.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unscented, moisturizing face cream.</li>
            <li> I used this on top of my regular acne moisturizer because my face wash has 10% benzoyl peroxide, which can make your skin very dry.</li>
            <li> (I live in a semi-arid climate).  </li>
            <li> , after seven years of avoiding makeup, I decided to give it a try again (a new man in your life can do that sometimes).  </li>
            <li> This has become a product I can&#x27;t live</li>
            <li> After trying many kinds of moisturizers, including those easily purchased at drug stores, expensive types like Lancome, etc, and many other supposedly \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products, I finally stumbled upon MyChelle products.  </li>
            <li> In between spa projects I often find myself using high quality natural lines like MyChelle.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using it too quickly, use on a freshly washed not completely dry face and it&#x27;ll take a lot less.</li>
            <li> By time I had washed my faced, used toner and applied the moisturizer, my skin was flaking as I began applying makeup; and within ten minutes after completing my makeup, the creases and dryness were even more apparent as my dry spots soaked in the makeup, creating unsightly discolorations.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the least bit worried when I saw the new packaging because I was sure the formula hadn&#x27;t changed.  </li>
            <li> Over the next 1-2 weeks, if you have been using a more basic skin creme or less nourishing  face creme you will notice much softer and hydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit and makeup goes on smoothly on top of it.  </li>
            <li> It is not as heavy as some creams; it is smooth and soft to apply.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After nearly three decades of fighting with flaky, peeling skin under my foundation, MyChelle has come to the rescue.  </li>
            <li> old and have not had a problem with pimples in years until using these products.</li>
            <li> the whole line actually!  </li>
            <li> However, during that same time period, I have been battling acne that is unusual for me.  </li>
            <li> but since the aromas in MyChelle are from natural botanicals and not artifiial fragrances</li>
            <li> How old am I again?</li>
            <li> have age spots and have tried so many expensive cosmetic lines such as Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair and Even Skintone Illuminator including Dr Hauschka&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> It sinks in easily and leaves a comfortable amount of moisture for me...without feeling like an oil slick later in the day.  </li>
            <li> Also, they have recently added hypo-allergenic versions of some of their creams, so for highly sensitive skin, that would be the way to go.)any breakouts...)    </li>

            <li> And even the next day, after having removed the make up the night before, my skin has remained supple, soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li> The only reason this cream has 4/5 stars currently is from 3-4 year old reviews back when the formula of the cream hadn&#x27;t changed radically.</li>
            <li> skin is dry, sensitive and prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I read both current and past reviews and decided it would be worth my while to try the cream regardless of the complaints regarding the formula change.</li>
            <li> It fixed the dry, controlled the oil, and allowed me to learn how to graciously accept compliments on my glowing skin!</li>
            <li> I regret this very seriously, as this cream has caused my skin to break out pretty intensely.</li>
            <li> The dry climate I live in (southern California), in addition to all of the acne products I use causes my skin to get extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Serious Hyaluronic first then spray Apple Brightening Mist following with Deep Repair Cream and it works!</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t have dry enough skin to appreciate the deep repair creme.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, this cream will probably be too heavy but for those with dry skin, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The conditions in my apartment have actually gotten less dry lately since the heat has been on less with the warmer, more humid weather.  </li>
            <li> This is the only face cream that has worked for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin especially in winter.  </li>
            <li> Ponds, Oil of Olay, Neutrogena and none of them could hydrate my skin, much less heal it from the constant, itchy, flaking in three very noticeable trouble spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> some reviewers have complained about it being heavy, but if you&#x27;re plagued with what I have, heavy is just fine!  </li>
            <li> After a while, I gave up and stopped wearing makeup for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I then tried the more expensive department store brands, only to find them a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and so I just use this product as well as their other creams for night time only.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m also very hard to please when it comes to facial products; every time I balk at the prices and try something else that promises the same thing (i.e. \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and cruelty-free), I end up going back to MyChelle.  </li>

            <li> I have been using this product for years now,  and I notice absolutely no change in fragrance or texture.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think this cream necessarily causes it for all skin types, but for me I think it was just too heavy.  </li>

            <li> I love the screen it&#x27;s fantastic. I have it on AutoShip every three months. Great service great product.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t have dry enough skin to appreciate the deep repair creme. Its really thick. Sorry to say its been reduced to hand creame..and it does nicely at that. no repeat buys for me.</li>
            <li> I was SUPER excited to try this product; I&#x27;m on a chemically-conscious cosmetic binge and My Chelle products came up in my search to find the perfect skin care solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ CURRENT REVIEWS of this product. The only reason this cream has 4/5 stars currently is from 3-4 year old reviews back when the formula of the cream hadn&#x27;t changed radically. I read both current and past reviews and decided it would be worth my while to try the cream regardless of the complaints regarding the formula change. I regret this very seriously, as this cream has caused my skin to break out pretty intensely. I never have pimples on my forehead (haven&#x27;t since I was 15 and I&#x27;m 24 now) and I suddenly have breakouts occurring all over my cheeks and forehead. It sucks, but it&#x27;s part of trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from me: don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> After trying many kinds of moisturizers, including those easily purchased at drug stores, expensive types like Lancome, etc, and many other supposedly \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products, I finally stumbled upon MyChelle products.

I&#x27;m 31, and my skin is normal to dry; I find Deep Repair Cream perfect for the winter months (I live in a semi-arid climate).  I use it in the morning and MyChelle&#x27;s Revitalizing Night Cream before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used MyChelle for about 3 years now and am still totally satisfied.  One reviewer remarked upon the price- I agree that they are not inexpensive, but neither are they out of proportion given the excellent ingredients and the amount of research in back of the products (check out MyChelle&#x27;s website) and the price of comparable products.  Some other MyChelle products I&#x27;ve used: Fabulous Eye Cream (a great under eye cream; I don&#x27;t have wrinkles to contend with, but I&#x27;ve also been using this for a number of years, so...); Perfect C Serum (#1 favorite MyChelle product...it&#x27;s fabulous and I always notice a negative difference when I stop using it for a while); Revitalizing Night Cream (nice evening cream...a little heavier than deep repair, but I also can use it during the summer months when it&#x27;s dry out and it&#x27;s not too heavy); Pumpkin Renew Cream (a great lightweight moisturizer, especially for summer months); Fruit Enzyme Mist (WONDERFUL toner! Use it after applying C Serum or to refresh during the day); Clear Skin Serum (great for spot treating breakouts - use pumpkin renew cream afterward); Fruit Enzyme Scrub (really nice scrub; use it every other day or just once a week and it really smoothes out your skin); Oil-free Grapefruit Cream (a nice alternative for the summer, or if you&#x27;re having any breakouts...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, I love MyChelle products!

            <li> I have been using this product for years now,  and I notice absolutely no change in fragrance or texture.  There is a slight floral fragrance (not unpleasant at all and not lingering) and it absorbs remarkably well.  I dont know what I would do if they took this off the market,  its wonderful!  Try it out,  you&#x27;ll love it.  If you are skeptical, many health food stores will offer a sample....</li>
            <li> I have been a devotee of this product for several years now.  Wasn&#x27;t the least bit worried when I saw the new packaging because I was sure the formula hadn&#x27;t changed.  However, what was in that jar was not the same thing I have been using all this while.  The Deep Repair Cream used to make my skin feel enveloped in moisture, but not heavy, just beautifully, perfectly moisturized.  With this jar, I felt like I needed two applications in order to keep my skin from feeling dried out.  The conditions in my apartment have actually gotten less dry lately since the heat has been on less with the warmer, more humid weather.  While the old formula used to be super concentrated and I could use very little and feel completely moisturized, I went through this jar in twice the time, so its just not worth the money to me.  Changed to a different organic brand that my esthetician recommended, and it works the way Deep Repair should.  Too bad, I really like this company.</li>
            <li> It deep repairs your skin. Light and pleasant scent, non-oily and light formula, yet is perfect for an arid environment (Denver). I felt a difference in the texture of my facial skin after just one use, and it only improves over time. Have been using daily for over a month, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the only face cream that has worked for my dry skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  I have dry skin especially in winter.  This leaves my face feeling well hydrated and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 5 years.  Best clean facial cream I have found.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is amazing, such nice texture and very hydrating. The reason i&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because the scent was way too strong for me and not to my taste, I couldn&#x27;t wear it and had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, flaky skin that laughed at just about every over-the-counter facial moisturizer you could think of.  I&#x27;ve tried Ponds, Oil of Olay, Neutrogena and none of them could hydrate my skin, much less heal it from the constant, itchy, flaking in three very noticeable trouble spots on my face.  By time I had washed my faced, used toner and applied the moisturizer, my skin was flaking as I began applying makeup; and within ten minutes after completing my makeup, the creases and dryness were even more apparent as my dry spots soaked in the makeup, creating unsightly discolorations.  After a while, I gave up and stopped wearing makeup for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after seven years of avoiding makeup, I decided to give it a try again (a new man in your life can do that sometimes).  I went back to the store like an idiot looking for the same products that had let me down in the past.  I then tried the more expensive department store brands, only to find them a waste of money.  I was losing hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then one day, I was here on Amazon looking for more natural blends, thinking maybe that would be the answer to my life-long issue with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hallelujah.  MyChelle WORKS!  It really really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now some reviewers have complained about it being heavy, but if you&#x27;re plagued with what I have, heavy is just fine!  After washing and toning, I applied MyChelle and I was instantly awed by the glow it gave my skin.  But the real test was if would stand up under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly three decades of fighting with flaky, peeling skin under my foundation, MyChelle has come to the rescue.  And even the next day, after having removed the make up the night before, my skin has remained supple, soft and glowing.  The three problem areas I&#x27;d endured with peeling and dryness all my life are now healed.  Now, grant it, I have to keep up the regimen, but I can go two or three days without reapplying MyChelle where as I couldn&#x27;t go 20 minutes after applying something like Ponds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Amazon reviews complain that it&#x27;s expensive.  Well, for the tiny jar you get, it does seem pricey, but you don&#x27;t need a lot of product!  One dollop the size of a dime will moisturize your face and neck.  And if your skin isn&#x27;t as dry as mine, you&#x27;ll use less than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews have also complained about the scent.  Well, it&#x27;s not the best smelling stuff on the planet, but it works.  It has a very earthy, herbally scent.  At first, I thought it wasn&#x27;t the most pleasing fragrance, but I&#x27;m used to it now and I kinda like it. After it&#x27;s absorbed and my make up is on, I don&#x27;t smell it anyhow.  A scent that smells like fresh-cut vegetables means nothing to the overall awesome quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have chronic, extremely dry skin, this is your answer.lying something like Ponds.

            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened. I used samples of this product last yr. and liked it tremendously. I just recently bought the regular size of this product and used it for 2 weeks and it dried out my skin, it also made my skin peel and feel very tight. They had to of changed the formula. These are not the same ingredients I used when I bought the sample package last yr. Needless to say I am returning this product along with the Supreme Polypeptide and Pumpkin Renew which also dried out my face, made it peel, and broke me out. I am 49 yrs. old and have not had a problem with pimples in years until using these products. Now my skin is very much off balance.</li>
            <li> Great product that does keep ones skin soft and supple, like all MyChelle products they are creamy and clean, absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Really a great product and an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> While traveling in ski country for a month I ran out of my night time face moisturizer so I went to Whole Foods to see what they had for a nice night time moisturizer.  I was looking for something light with good absorption and with the proper hydrating attributes to keep my face hydrated while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this and gave it a try and I still use it months later.  I combine it with SkinCeutical 1.0 retinol cream.  I use it at night on a clean face.  If you combine a retinol of a higher concentration use a tiny bit and mix it in the palm of your hand with a small bit of MyChelle Deep Repair Cream.  It is silky to the face and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unscented, moisturizing face cream. It is not as heavy as some creams; it is smooth and soft to apply.</li>
            <li> I think they may have changed the formula on this, because I have used it in the past and loved it.  Now it lists a few ingredients that are not listed on the current Amazon ingredient list.  The smell is completely different, enough so that I had to wash it off my face and use something else.  It smells to earthy for me, but you may like it.</li>
            <li> When I first started using MyChelle products, I used the Pumpkin Renew Cream (which is fabulous), but as I learned more about each product, I decided I should try the Deep Repair Cream for my &#x27;mature&#x27; (over 28) skin.  I have to say it really is fabulous.  I mix it with the Fruit Enzyme Mist to create the perfect coverage.  Even though it is a deep repair cream, I use it morning and night.  It is light and non-greasy and helps keep my skin hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. . .and the whole line actually!  A little goes a long way.  The fragrance is subtle and pleasant and it is perfect for my mature combination skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some insanely temperamental skin over the past year--from the worst flakey winter to the oiliest summer... my face was a mess.  This cream did what $$$ of store-bought ones couldn&#x27;t.  It fixed the dry, controlled the oil, and allowed me to learn how to graciously accept compliments on my glowing skin! It&#x27;s got a super floral fragrance that&#x27;s a bit off-putting, but honestly, by the time I&#x27;m ready to put on makeup it&#x27;s gone.  Now, if only it could melt fat... &amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I like this product but I have found others (that are also using healthy ingredients without sodium lauryl sulfate, paraben, etc) to be equally as good with a smaller price tag.  The Better Botanicals stuff seems as good and cheaper and made with \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent product especially for those who have sensitive skin and are allergic to the many chemicals found in typical facial creams. Light texture thus very absorb ant leaving skin feeling smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li> this is the firs time I have ordered this product, I have been using it for a few nights now and I love it</li>
            <li> I live in the mid-west and suffer from dry skin all year around -- winter is the worst. I&#x27;ve had dry skin since I was a child (I remember putting petroleum jelly on my face when I was in grade school because it was so dry).  I&#x27;ve been working on reducing my chemical load and I was having trouble finding a moisturizer that worked all day - until I tried this one.  This is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;ve used other MyChelle products and been happy with them... so I don&#x27;t know what happened with this product. Less than five minutes after I put it on, my face was starting to feel a little tingly but nothing uncomfortable. I went into the bathroom and much to my horror... my face was bright red. I look like I have a terrible sunburn! Stay away from this if you have extra-sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> Nothing about which to write home.  Was expecting much more, but found that it&#x27;s just another semi-mediocre moisturizer.  It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> I used this on top of my regular acne moisturizer because my face wash has 10% benzoyl peroxide, which can make your skin very dry. The dry climate I live in (southern California), in addition to all of the acne products I use causes my skin to get extremely dry. This Deep Repair cream is very rich and emollient, and I find the scent pleasant. If you have oily skin, this cream will probably be too heavy but for those with dry skin, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t pleasant at all!  My husband hates snuggling with me after I have applied it. It is somewhat offensive!</li>
            <li> I used this cream for about 2 or so years.  I loved the way it felt - never greasy and absorbed quickly.  However, during that same time period, I have been battling acne that is unusual for me.  I finally gave up this cream a few months ago even though I have several stored.  My acne issues are clearing up.  I don&#x27;t think this cream necessarily causes it for all skin types, but for me I think it was just too heavy.  I do not suffer from dry skin - I bought this more for the wrinkle fighting than anything else.  I am going to try a lighter cream from the same company and see if it works better.</li>
            <li> wonderful cream, keeps me face hydrated specially in winter.</li>
            <li> My skin is more hydrated and nourished by this cream  I don&#x27;t know if any wrinkles and fine lines are diminished, but I certainly feel an improvement in skin texture and tone.  My only complaint is that it is quite heavy and so I just use this product as well as their other creams for night time only. Just way too much \\&quot;heaviness\\&quot; for daytime use. Otherwise , great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a year - This has become a product I can&#x27;t live without.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry, sensitive and prone to breakouts.  What a combo!&lt;br /&gt;Mychelle seems to understand these skin conditions.  Deep Repair cream is moisturizing, not to heavy, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and even seems to repair scars / damage from past breakouts.  Feels rich, yet absorbs quickly and without residue.&lt;br /&gt;A MUST for surviving this dry Colorado weather.  I just wish I&#x27;d discovered this before I reached my 30&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  A jar of this lasts me about a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my creping hands, but was so impressed with the hydrating/repairing effects immediately tried it on my face. While I will always be a devotee of 3Lab M cream, this is a really nice DEEP moisturizer for once a week use. It is heavy but quickly absorbing with no greasy feel. I loved the scent. It smells very fresh. This will be a subscribe and save item for me. I have no idea what people are complaining about for the price. This will last me 3-6 months with once or twice a week use. It&#x27;s twenty bucks, people...comparable to full price drugstore moisturizers of the same volume. If you&#x27;re using it too quickly, use on a freshly washed not completely dry face and it&#x27;ll take a lot less. Problem solved.</li>
            <li> I work in the Spa Industry and have used MANY face cremes and face care products in general. In between spa projects I often find myself using high quality natural lines like MyChelle.  Although, I was often dissapointed by how small the offerings are it seems more realistic to me now considering the more natural ingredients and lack of toxic preservatives. This along with the fact that less is needed due to the effectiveness of the ingredients and the lack of large amounts of useless \\&quot;filler\\&quot; ingredients that even expensive skin care lines will utilize, right along with the drug store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of their examples of \\&quot;a lot of good in a lit bit\\&quot;. I find myself having to use less of this creme than some of other brands. It is a rich and nourishing creme (but NOT heavy like one reviewer commented? They must have REALLY oily skin or be used to extremely light weight moisturizers. This product is definately suitable as a day creme that can be used alone or under makeup without feeling too heavy. You do have to give it about 1-2 minutes to fully soak in, but it will not leave your skin filmy or greasy feeling). It can be used by a broad range of skin types as either a day creme or a light weight night creme paired with your favorite treatment product before bed. Over the next 1-2 weeks, if you have been using a more basic skin creme or less nourishing  face creme you will notice much softer and hydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually love the scent. It is a very light rose/floral scent that is not at all perfumy. I know they have an unscented Deep Repair creme but since the aromas in MyChelle are from natural botanicals and not artifiial fragrances I would never pick that over this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this face creme in the day time along with MyChelle&#x27;s Polypeptide Creem at night makes a great duo for my middle-aged skin!</li>
            <li> Not very impressed, but maybe that was just me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different moisturizers and this one is great.  It only takes a little bit and makeup goes on smoothly on top of it.  Not greasy at all!  I use it morning and night.  I&#x27;m glad I found Mychelle products.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural products and this one works great.  My skin is sensative and dry, this works better than some of the expensive products I have tried and have broken my face out! I am in my 30&#x27;s and my skin breaking out is only an allergic reaction. At any rate, you can try this in a sample size, I did and bought a whole jar!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years.</li>
            <li> I searched online which cream works well for my skin and I found out this cream has an ingredients that helps your skin to get younger. I have been using this one for a month and people told me my skin got better!!! I love this cream and I keep using it!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Been using this for several years.....maybe more, like 4 or 5 years.... How old am I again? I can&#x27;t tell from looking I the mirror because this face cream is so effective!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for approximately two years.  I live in an extremely dry climate and if I don&#x27;t moisturize with a great product after showering or washing my face, my skin tightens up in minutes.  I use this after spritzing on their Fruit Enzyme mist (both morning and night) and feel an immediate difference in my skin.  This is not greasy or heavy and does not coat the skin.  It sinks in easily and leaves a comfortable amount of moisture for me...without feeling like an oil slick later in the day.  I used to have to moisturize 3 or 4 times a day before finding this product.  I get tons of compliments on my skin and complexion and I have a feeling that a lot of those are due to this holy grail.</li>
            <li> This face cream has been a favorite of mine for years. So glad I found it online.</li>
            <li> I follow the instruction by applying Firming Serum Serious Hyaluronic first then spray Apple Brightening Mist following with Deep Repair Cream and it works! After the first day using it, I touched my face and almost screamed at myself in the mirror! How could it be!! It felt like touching a baby skin!  I asked my husband to put his hand on my face and he was shock too! The apple brightening mist has made the age spots faded away in the first week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have age spots and have tried so many expensive cosmetic lines such as Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair and Even Skintone Illuminator including Dr Hauschka&#x27;s products. All I can say is MyChelle is the best of all. I received the fastest results after the first two days using them!</li>
