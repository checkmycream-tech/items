            <li>DeodoMom is one of the best.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run (like Cleure&#x27;s), it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance (which can irritate my skin or make me smell like something I don&#x27;t like), AND it does a great job of keeping the stink at bay!</li>

            <li>Anyway, I think it&#x27;s a great product and will continue to support them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great too.  </li>
            <li>I saw all of these great reviews, so I purchased this along with another deodorant.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is great.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This is great to take with you and reapply.  </li>
            <li>It kept any odors under control, and I was a happy camper.</li>
            <li>The Deodo-Mom roll on is great.</li>
            <li>I fly a lot, so I put it into a plastic zippy bag just in case it should leak, but it hasn&#x27;t leaked yet.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>this stuff does a great job - no stains either.</li>
            <li>Works great for me and my skin is happy.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>but I felt the need to let people know what a great product this is.  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
            <li>alternative and never came across a product I was happy with....until now.  </li>
            <li>But for me, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>happy stinking-less days.</li>
            <li>but in the winter it has been great.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product.</li>
            <li>We have been really happy with all of the products from this company.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>so I was worried about switching brands, but DeodoMom works great</li>
            <li>seems like a great idea</li>
            <li>Spray or glide would be great if translatable to those mechanisms.</li>
            <li>So happy to find this.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>The results have been phenomenal!!</li>
            <li>I found the roll-on to be very effective</li>
            <li>Very effective...</li>
            <li>This really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Unbelievably amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>However, Deodomom is effective!  </li>
            <li>DeodoMom is a remarkable discovery.  </li>
            <li>am thrilled with this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this deodorant, good protection, no chemical stuff and no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Lots of good reviews here, maybe I got a lemon.</li>
            <li>good--</li>
            <li>optimum qty)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The reviews seemed quite good</li>
            <li>but I was surprisingly dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel good knowing that I&#x27;m using an all-natural product during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Order arrived prompt and as promised, good vendor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, the best aluminium free deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used is my boyfriend&#x27;s Speed Stick....</li>
            <li>Without any good result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have found DeodoMom&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>It does not stop the sweating, which it is not supposed to do, because sweating is actually good for you</li>
            <li>Good product, works as it should without any irritation.</li>
            <li>One application in the morning, and I&#x27;m good.  </li>
            <li>Good packaging.</li>
            <li>purchased in September 2013 and loved it.</li>
            <li>, what we put under our arms is a good place to start an eliminationquest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am good through the day.</li>
            <li>I have heard a good amount of to-be-moms trying out toxin-free products</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how good this deodorant is.</li>
            <li>I tried two very popular brands, which I liked, but the baking soda in those products irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just one of those people who don&#x27;t have the greatest success with it!</li>
            <li>I really love knowing that it is a very healthy product to use, and I will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li>After doing my homework online, I found many happy customers who use DeodoMom.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this deodorant and the irritation under my arms</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I recommended it to many of my friends and they are happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I did some more research and found great reviews on Deodomom Roll-on.</li>
            <li>Very, very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>There is no nasty smell at all coming from your underarms since this deodorant is very effective.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it felt like they were making me MORE smelly than if I had used nothing!</li>
            <li>Update--just want to write that I still love this product and it still works!</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose and its as safe as it can get!</li>
            <li>This roll-on is just as fantastic!!  </li>
            <li>I have not been using deodorants that contain aluminum for many years, and I have not come across one that eliminates B.O. the way DeodoMom does!</li>
            <li>And i am so glad i did!</li>
            <li>I know I have tried it all and nothing works better than this!</li>
            <li>Excellent safe eco friendly product.</li>
            <li>I really do love this product!  </li>
            <li>I am going to order much more from this company!</li>
            <li>I just love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>so i am so pleased to have one brand that meets everyone&#x27;s needs!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone to give it a try!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I even have my mom hooked:)!</li>
            <li>Have been using DeodoMom for a week now and love it!</li>
            <li>The weather here is never too hot and even on our hottest days, it&#x27;s very beautiful with no humidity.</li>
            <li>and I can say after two months of no rash and a hot summer this is the best deodorant I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>faith and order yourself a bottle of this amazing product.</li>
            <li>It is amazing that you can feel the difference.</li>
            <li>THIS IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>An amazing product.</li>
            <li>$12 may seem a lot for a deodorant, but it is effective, non itching, and non toxic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I find myself wanting to reach for that Dove again because it&#x27;s just a habit, but then I remind myself that this product works just as effectively.</li>
            <li>I used to think that i liked the smell of the fruity and floral deodorants</li>
            <li>Really, really liked it.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a nice touch to put my name on the package too.  </li>
            <li>This has been effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using crystal deodorant for a while, but it&#x27;s not as effective as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;DeodoMom is definitely effective.</li>
            <li>He works 12 hour shifts as an acute care nurse, I&#x27;m chasing a toddler around all day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still loving it.</li>
            <li>However, I have found that it&#x27;s kind of a hit and a miss.</li>
            <li>Nice communication from the seller as well.</li>
            <li>Schmidts is also highly effective, but a pain to put on.</li>
            <li>It neutralizes body odor all day, and I add my own cologne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for years for an effective deodorant.</li>
            <li>My friends are loving it as well.</li>
            <li>each at their own trials, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a nice container</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly tell you is works as well</li>
            <li>I am beyond thrilled.</li>
            <li>(would be nice if they made some that did)</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like my own smell.  </li>
            <li>I was about to start making my own (baking soda, corn starch...natural deodorant) when I found DeodoMom on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Until I found this kind I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update if that changes when the weather gets really warm, but for now this will be my go-to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>dollars?the weather gets really warm, but for now this will be my go-to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they all work effectively..</li>
            <li>I will have to keep using my dove until I can find a kind that works without aluminum.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best deoderant I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>Because I liked it.</li>
            <li>I saw this and saw how many good reviews it had.</li>
            <li>, I am so impressed with it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works perfect and is all natural!!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, and my sensitive skin is loving it.</li>
            <li>It also has a light, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients, love the product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the best natural deodorant i have ever tried!</li>
            <li>Magnesium is a truly amazing remedy for so many things.</li>
            <li>Best I have had so far.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I have found.  </li>
            <li>The unscented version is waaaaaaaaaay better, honestly in my opinion and experience you should buy it.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used that did not leave any rash/bumps.</li>
            <li>The best natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I found that DeodoMom so far has been the best as both a deodorant and antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work for her, and my best friend uses a natural deodorant that she buys at the store that I have tried and doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I tried.</li>
            <li>Which is quite impressive given that is totally natural and has no antiperspirant in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so nice to have a safe product that works.</li>
            <li>This is an effective product and I love that is doesn&#x27;t have a scent to try to mask the stench.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly the best natural deodorant out there.</li>
            <li>and I can say without hesitation that this is THE best natural deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li>Deodomom is a wonderful product that I would recommend to anyone seeking an all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great, safe product for mom and baby!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve used, even better than chemical deodorants/anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;d like to avoid adding toxic chemicals to your body, and have better protection, this is the by far the best!  </li>
            <li>I did read the reviews and do wash each morning before reapplying and it really works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>While in really hot and humid climates, I still sweat and feel wetness, in cooler climates, DeodoMom has worked great for me.</li>
            <li>if anything it seemed to make me smell more strongly!</li>
            <li>so I am super protective of my one good kidney.  </li>
            <li>I have never used a roll on before but the deodorant applies nicely and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially effective if you use a good, natural deodorant bar soap (like the one from Maine with &amp;#34;odor fighting sage&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice when you don&#x27;t have to put a bunch of chemicals on your body, and I think it works fine for those less-active activities.</li>
            <li>But...I started to notice that I was a lot more ripe smelling than before.  </li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Sure, I get damp in my armpits since this is not an antiperspirant, but I did that with the turbo strength deodorant as well.  </li>
            <li>Like many of you, I&#x27;ve tried a gazillion deodorants and nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li>I think this product would work much better if it was in \\&quot;gel\\&quot; form.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>love that there are no toxic ingredients, no fragrance, no parabens, and etc.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>So I looked on the internet and read many, many reviews before finding Deodomom.</li>
            <li>I have been using DeodoMom cream in the jar for about 6 months and love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy it only contains two ingredients!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay by me.</li>
            <li>I had been using my husband&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant which had lots of fragrance and dye in it, so I thought this would probably not cover my funk, but it does!  </li>
            <li>yes while it seemed pricey i figured what&#x27;s twelve more dollars?</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li>but now i realize scent free is the way to go!</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>Also I do sweat more</li>
            <li>Found this one on Amazon, and am now amazed it doesn&#x27;t get more press.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used deodomom&#x27;s deodorant cream for quite awhile and love it.  </li>
            <li>Deodomom was awesome enough to send me a sample of the roll-on to try out</li>
            <li>and I love it even more than the cream.  </li>
            <li>(I tried many).  </li>
            <li>It is made by a smaller company, but the quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a deodorant that you feel confident to use and this is it.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant -</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Many irritated my skin or just didn&#x27;t help well with underarm smell.</li>
            <li>Much better than toms.</li>
            <li>I am expecting, and wondered, is my deodorant safe?  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safe for me and my baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a great product!  </li>
            <li>Mine came with a label of my name printed on it, which I thought was a cute touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance on this.</li>
            <li>I sometimes put on more when I go out dancing at night</li>
            <li>(just to be sure), but I&#x27;ve never noticed any embarrassing odor problems since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Now have a second bottle and will keep using it -- best I can say for anything.</li>
            <li>Was so glad to find something without aluminum.  </li>
            <li>It is oderless which I love.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone looking for a safe alternative to antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s not supposed to be antiperspirant I am not noticing wetness most of the time.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t flawless, and sometimes I have to wash again and reapply later...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so much better for me than anything else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others because I develop underarm rashes.</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite.</li>
            <li>So bottom line, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It said it generally is safe but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now, and I wanted to wait until I was sure that it would work all</li>
            <li>Sometimes after I reapply, I start smelling my BO, and I&#x27;ve noticed that many times it&#x27;s better not to reapply at all, if there is no need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and THEN I started itching like crazy--and thousands of dollars for patch testing, I&#x27;ve learned that I have more contact allergies than most people.</li>
            <li>I do not know why there are so many 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li>Smell is interesting though once applief.</li>
            <li>I like that even more.</li>
            <li>Everything is made with chemicals any more.</li>
            <li>I feel better as well.</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I know I will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s not overloaded with chemicals.</li>
            <li>Love it and have been recommending it to all my friends and family :)</li>
            <li>it better than anti perspiration, without the Aluminum.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at best, but to my surprise they both worked great!!  </li>
            <li>In fact, works even better than the over the counter stuff which always made me feel like I needed 2 or 3 showers a day, depending on the season.  </li>
            <li>This product is truly wonderful and they even give it a personal touch with your name on a sticker.  </li>
            <li>Under more stressful conditions (like when I&#x27;m nervous), however, I do feel wetness but no odor.</li>
            <li>but really, it&#x27;s such an improvement over anything else I&#x27;ve tried, that I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a great product that is toxin-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>LOVE it</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews and internet research, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>It works more in harmony with how the body was intended to work.  </li>
            <li>Best aluminum free deoderant I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>This thing is magic.</li>
            <li>Most scents give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve put this through MANY workouts during my lunch at work.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(and mostly I sweat after I work out).  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll like it! :)</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Also does not work- better off rubbing water under your arms</li>
            <li>The summer is ending soon, so hopefully it will work better for me in the fall when it&#x27;s cooler.  </li>
            <li>But the best part is that it actually works.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase DeodoMom because its formula seemed the most innocuous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>But you can search for its only ingredient (magnesium hydroxide) and see that it scores a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;, a perfect score on its toxicity scale.  </li>
            <li>deodomom worked better for me than Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  </li>
            <li>It comes with your name on it :)  </li>
            <li>I prefer the roll-on most days because of the convenience factor, but when I have some time I do the jar as it allows me to put on a thicker coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love about this stuff</li>
            <li>also love how there is no scent at all</li>
            <li>Also, they put a label with my name on the top of it</li>
            <li>also love how there is no scent at all</li>
            <li>Also, they put a label with my name on the top of it</li>
            <li>So many of my friend&#x27;s recommended this deodorant</li>
            <li>was hesitant to try DeodoMom because I have tried so many brands and feel like I was just wasting money.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it works and it has like 3 ingredients all of which are perfectly safe.</li>
            <li>anything is way better.</li>
            <li>but I will continue to use it because it works so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it here on Amazon, and hope I can use it beyond 30 some weeks :)</li>
            <li>I still love Donna Karan Cashmere Mist if I need an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>There is nothing more unattractive than that.  </li>
            <li>DeodoMom popped up as an ad when I was ordering the latest test products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and will continue to use it even after my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS and will buy again and again.  </li>
            <li>Love the concept.</li>
            <li>I figure going &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; overnight has to be better than nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For all of us who are intolerant to the aluminum found in most deodorant antiperspirants</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products but never found anything that could stand up against the Florida heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It was all OK, but I cannot use it: after allergic dermatitis it gives me a rush.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I love that this is a family-owned business and wish it had worked for me.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is hypoallergenic, not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have an odor but makes sure the person using it does not.</li>
            <li>So I willed myself to spend a bit more to try others with better reviews.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than I ever thought.  </li>
            <li>The sample I had in the cooler climate seemed to work a but better.</li>
            <li>I loved that the deodorant came with a label on it with my name... a very nice personal touch.</li>
            <li>it really works!!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>DeodoMom rolls on easily, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t discolor my clothes, AND IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li>I shave my armpits every day and keep them very clean.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this works pretty</li>
            <li>Works fairly well unless its really humid out!</li>
            <li>This to me is the best product I have discovered in a long time.</li>
            <li>But even then, this does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am about this deodorant!</li>
            <li>I have been using DeodoMom for two months now and am happy to say I have found my new staple.</li>
            <li>Of course, like all natural deodorants, this d.o. will not prevent wetness, but it does an excellent job keeping smells at bay and helping me feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect since I have never used a natural deodorant before - but I am SO PLEASED!!</li>
            <li>This deodorant most importantly keeps the smell away.</li>
            <li>thought it was great having a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant I have tried, and it has been wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Oh and whats great is I have the stinkiest 5 year old in the planet and</li>
            <li>Let me tell you my daughter is 10 years old and she no longer smells like strawberries (LOL) at any rate</li>
            <li>a great natural solution.</li>
            <li>Love that it is Aluminum free.</li>
            <li>Company offered me free product for my review, which could be a way of biasing reviews toward people who like the product and want more.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s incredible that it works so well with two simple ingredients.  </li>
            <li>i found this product, thanks to all the good reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using it for months now</li>
            <li>I searched online for one that got good reviews and didn&#x27;t expect much when I first ordered it, but I must say I LOVE this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>No odor and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Well-packaged and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t smell and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product--all natural and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to be penny-wise, pound-foolish and forget that it&#x27;s the difference between $1 and $4 a month.</li>
            <li>But on the downside, the roll on applicator easily pulls arm hair.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and works.</li>
            <li>I very quickly became the smelly one in the office (or</li>
            <li>I still perspire, but the smell isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat often if any at all, nor do I have a strong body odor.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is very gentle and extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>I originally found this product while looking for deodorants safe for pregnant women (assuming many would be vegan).</li>
            <li>I love that this is a true \\&quot;mom and pop\\&quot; type product.</li>
            <li>Aug 2017: still using this product is as effective as i first time said it</li>
            <li>After trying many natural deodorants, and wasting a ton of money, I have to say that this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really effective, with no weird chemicals or scents and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy to say the DeodoMom roll on is working extremely well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy and I love that its a roll on!</li>
            <li>When not at the gym, it works fine.</li>
            <li>product is fine for if I have a day off and am puttering around the house.</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t smell anything and you&#x27;re fine, don&#x27;t reapply.</li>
            <li>It is light and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>Dries reasonably quickly and IT WORKS!  </li>
            <li>Was hoping it would work a lot better but it rubs off really quickly</li>
            <li>Being pregnant, I wanted something safe to use.</li>
            <li>When I found out I was pregnant I started doing research on deodorants and realized the one I was using had aluminum in it which I didn&#x27;t feel safe using during the pregnancy.</li>
            <li>And DeodoMom (I do think they could use a better name!) is absolutely one you should give a try in your pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a truly safe product that does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>And I love supporting a mom-owned business!  </li>
            <li>best friend was diagnosed with breast cancer a little over a year ago, and it has influenced everyone who knows her.  </li>
            <li>After reading about how Aluminum based toxic deodorants have been linked to breast cancer I was looking for a deo which was toxin, Aluminum and Alcohol free</li>
            <li>One that works and is chemical free.</li>
            <li>and I would be stink free, and it kept my underarms light as well,</li>
            <li>It also does not irritate my skin at all and my underarms are still light,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>The seller was great and very personal as well.</li>
            <li>When I began to breast feed after the birth of my daughter, I began to intensify my search for a toxic free deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on chemical free, aluminum free, vegan deodorants.  </li>
            <li>This is a great step and will eliminate a TON of toxins when compared to regular deodorant or anti-persperant.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I have to say that I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Free of perfume, aluminum, salt, preservatives, parabens, etc.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great stuff, and is the only deodorant I plan on buying from now on.</li>
            <li>i was looking for an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>I was on a mission to find an aluminum free, vegan deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation and it went on smoothly (hence the 2 stars)</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of natural deodorants and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It is so great to find a natural, safe deodorant that really works.</li>
            <li>And I have tried a good number of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>any event, chucking my Old Spice rose to the top of the list of changes that needed to be made.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>I tried deodomom as my first experiment (used it for a month) with natural/organic deodorants and the only good thing that I liked about it</li>
            <li>It works great, keeps me dry and smell free.  </li>
            <li>Good luck and try this super natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I like that this dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave too much residue on clothes and does a pretty good job of keeping me odor free.</li>
            <li>At the gym though, it doesn&#x27;t seem able to hold up to higher perspiration levels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted no two bodies are the same, but there are two enthusiastic thumbs up from this woman and man!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited that this works and that I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals into my body.</li>
            <li>No more stink, my pits literally smell like nothing, so this is perfect wearing perfume without worrying about the deodorant scent being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if DeodoMom was working.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to any vegan or pregnant women (or pregnant vegan ladies)!</li>
            <li>As healthy as I think I am, it&#x27;s really foolish to assume my lymph/detox system is as finely synced as it would have been in a pre-industrial environment.</li>
            <li>I live in a warm environment, and I sweat.  </li>
            <li>Every time I don&#x27;t use harmful products, I try to remind myself that I may be getting a few more years in my life or maybe just days, but I&#x27;m happy to pick the safer choice</li>
            <li>I have finally found a deodorant that meets my criteria of safe, 100% effective and doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes.</li>
            <li>I do have to apply it on clean skin (unlike mainstream deodorants, which you can apply over B.O.</li>
            <li>Then, finally, I remembered seeing an unscented version of the green tidings deodorant and in desperation to find the perfect natural deodorant I decided to give this one a try, and I am soooo happy and glad I did.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like about this deodorant is that I feel like my shirts are easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>So I think when trying to find a natural deodorant, you have to find which works best for your body chemistry - one that works well for one person won&#x27;t necessarily work well for another.</li>
            <li>It has no scent, so no artificial chemicals, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and is easily applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on perfectly smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>i like to smell clean.</li>
            <li>Must say I am very surprised how effective this product is.</li>
            <li>After seeing many positive reviews of &#x27;DeodoMom&amp;#34;, I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel as though sweat is just sitting under my armpits and that is an amazing feat for a natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li>I was very intrigued by the positive reviews and decided to give deodomom a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I tend to sweat more than most</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am thrilled to to have finally found a deodorant that works without my body absorbing aluminum any more!</li>
            <li>It rolls on easily, has no smell and keeps me dry and smelling good all day.</li>
            <li>Pretty good all natural.  </li>
            <li>Like so many people, I did not want to put something onto my body/skin that was potentially very harmful.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to try a safe hypoallergenic product.</li>
            <li>I really was hoping to be able to get away from an aluminum based product.</li>
            <li>Only good things to say.</li>
            <li>No bad armpit smell at all.</li>
            <li>No bad smell also.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you giving this a try, and as far as the cost (with free shipping), it&#x27;s more than worth it for the peace of mind</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard the cream is more effective at keeping you dry.  </li>
            <li>Tried so many different natural Deodorant and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I decided to try another deodorant (and then another and another) from an upscale store that has a large selection of paraben free, aluminum free deodorants.</li>
            <li>Need to apply twice a day, but other than that this stuff is great</li>
            <li>Some days it seems like it works great and other days</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to not have to use aluminum deoderants, and for the first time  since my teen years, I can confidently wear sleeveless tops.  </li>
            <li>What I loved even more is they make a little label with your name and ordering date</li>
            <li>So after reading the wonderful reviews for this product, I decided to try it out despite the ridiculous $12 price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild with no scent and keeps the odor at bay.</li>
            <li>Like most folks, I decided to try this product because I react badly to most commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li>and my pits were super irritated.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s awesome, it works, and therefore I really recommend the Unscented Green Tidings Deodorant.</li>
            <li>Works great weird how it works so good</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a fun smell, no smell at all really, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the harmful chemicals in.  </li>
            <li>This glides on, dries quickly and performs well.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products but they either didn&#x27;t work (I sure smelled &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;!) or irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Now that I am pregnant</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and even had a label with my name on it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have not gotten it to work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I do perspire, the deodorant quickly dries.</li>
            <li>However, I wish I would have had this when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly, unlike some roll-ons.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great product.</li>
            <li>The wife used this while pregnant</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I am pregnant and I am trying to eliminate chemicals going onto my body.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t stand the very strong smell and the stickiness of the old deodorant.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product and I&#x27;m going back for more!</li>
            <li>I just love it and recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best natural deodorant I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Also, the product wasn&#x27;t effective at keeping my underarms odor free for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>On very hot days or days where I exerted myself, it did not work as well (and my underarms felt sticky).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Erbaviva, Pure Body Scents (surprisingly strong \\&quot;scent\\&quot; that exceeded any perfume I may have ever used), Lavanila, and Eau de Minimes.  </li>
            <li>Having decided to live in a more &amp;#34;anti toxin&amp;#34; way, I&#x27;ve changed shampoo, toothpaste and now deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and for normal activity, it works great.</li>
            <li>, I loved it at first because I would only have to reapply once or twice</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a strong body odor to begin with, which is maybe why it works so well for me.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an effective aluminum free antiperspirant for a long time.</li>
            <li>Good protection svdn when it&#x27;s really hot outside</li>
            <li>I carried it in my purse with me the first two weeks, in case I needed to reapply, and I didn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical trying it (tried many deodorants that blocked odors but not wetness) but was happy to find that it does work!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>It absolutely works like a charm!!</li>
            <li>Drip some essential oils on the top for an added scent!  </li>
            <li>This works wonderful and keeps me dry throughout the entire day!</li>
            <li>deodorant does not make my sensitive skin react, and most of all, I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for anyone, and even more so for people who do not have strong body odor issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all--NOW, Lavanilla, Lavalin, Truly, Schmidt&#x27;s, Lush--this one is the only that is both non-messy and super effective.</li>
            <li>This deodorant provides a nice compromise, especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to finally choose a deodorant that is all natural!</li>
            <li>So i&#x27;ve been on this long search for the most natural, and most importantly, aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle (my rash is completely gone) but still works, even through a challenging yoga class!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally scent free and very comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a huge list and feel better putting it on than I ever did using traditional anti-perspirant, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a few months now and it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to continue my search for a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural deodorants and they would all work for 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li>I can even use it after shaving without it burning, and that is rare.</li>
            <li>Every natural deodorant just didn&#x27;t cut it for me, i have had many embarrassing days where halfway through work i reeked of body odor.</li>
            <li>I tried arm and hammer and a couple of known branded natural deos but nothing worked more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or minimal deodorants and none work as good as this one does at keeping me smelly-free and not too sweaty.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s all worth it, knowing I&#x27;m not poisoning myself.</li>
            <li>The research is inconclusive, but I wanted to be safe, so I decided to try out DeodoMom and am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>it came with a cute label with my name and a smiley face on it - and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>for improvement but still worth the money; I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it, you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many natural deodorants</li>
            <li>It is so worth the price</li>
            <li>hubby has sensitive underarms and many brands irritate him but not this one.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do ok for wetness, I only had one issue where I was in a one on one meeting with a really important person in the community</li>
            <li>I have tried so many natural deodorants</li>
            <li>deodorant is completely unscented, which I LOVE.  </li>
            <li>I had tried several popular brands of non anti-perspirant deodorants with no luck, they seemed to do nothing</li>
            <li>I would say, for me, and I am a sweaty person, that this works as well as the antipersperants or deodorants that I used to use, and I love that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals that are harmful to me or my child.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No artificial anything.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had reactions to many &amp;#34;natural products&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Keeps me feeling fresh all day, even in the humid Indiana summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of deodorant that is aluminum free.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to go to a more natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it and so tried this.  </li>
            <li>I love how natural it is</li>
            <li>Been through so many brands that purport to eliminate odor through natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The armpit pain wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I believe it to be worth it though.</li>
            <li>Only problem is roll-on head catching hair.</li>
            <li>After trying many other natural brand deodorants, this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product after reading quite a few good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 6-8 months and this is the best natural deodorant I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Based on so many various reviews, both on and off Amazon, I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>It held up to the hot Florida humidity,all while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several aluminum free deoderants and was starting to lose hope, but then I came across deodomom and am so happy I did because t really works!</li>
            <li>I always end up needing to change and wash my shirts right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done it right out of the shower, I&#x27;ve done it at waking, and at night before sleeping-</li>
            <li>And I can put it on right after shaving - it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been using other natural deodorants and they haven&#x27;t worked, chances are you&#x27;ll have good luck with this one!</li>
            <li>Most natural ones just don&#x27;t work unless you sit at a desk in a climate-controlled office all day (in which case you really don&#x27;t need deodorant anyway!).</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that I LOVE, have been working on finding one for many years.  </li>
            <li>Also love that it is completely fragrance free and truly all natural.</li>
            <li>The real test was wearing full sleeves in the blazing sun...</li>
            <li>how long it lasts and, perhaps, if you are so inclined, to set your own expiration date.  </li>
            <li>One very popular brand made me smell like I had rubbed raw onions on my armpits within 10 minutes of applying it.</li>
            <li>and I do prefer the cream as it seems to go on a little better, although, the roll on is probably more convenient to take along when traveling.</li>
            <li>It keeps my dry and odor-free all day which is amazing.  </li>
            <li>When we started to think about starting a family, I began researching this last unnatural hold out and found great reviews for this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT DRIES QUICKLY AND IS GENTLE TO MY UNDERARMS.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, I think finding a good natural deodorant for YOU is simply trial and error.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much of an issue with odor or perspiration, but since I&#x27;ve been pregnant, I&#x27;ve been looking for a safer alternative to aluminum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many and none would work more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li>The Crystal, for example, was effective in the short term, but gave me really irritated skin after repeated use.</li>
            <li>I have been on a quest to find a good natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>I am very thankful to have found this and will now be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>I expend any effort at all - my five minute walk in to work or even a very gentle non-heated yoga</li>
            <li>This one is very gentle.</li>
            <li>, it feels very light on, and it hasn&#x27;t left any marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li>, it feels very light on, and it hasn&#x27;t left any marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I do not have a stressful job that involves very much movement around since it&#x27;s a desk job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am willing to sacrifice only a small amount of comfort in my path to becoming toxin-free (which is why I&#x27;m researching the best natural products).  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s had reactions to other natural products, so this was a great find.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no smell of any kind, just a perfect organic solution to all the nasty aluminum products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly and if it leaves a bit of white residue, that washes easily out of clothing.</li>
            <li>I personally like the roll on because it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Holistic Health Coach and have told many people about this product and all of them have told me the same thing:</li>
            <li>I am a health coach and have recommended this to many of my clients and they all tell me the same thing--nothing else has worked until THIS.</li>
            <li>I finally found a healthy deodorant that my mom loves.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, DeodoMom!</li>
            <li>I do apply liberally and it has not failed me once.</li>
            <li>We just went through another really hot, humid summer.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Ok it seemed to work initially, but into weeks 4 and 5, it stopped working after 4 hours or so</li>
            <li>and I would get a really funky smell and started yellowing shirts again!</li>
            <li>The first week it did not work</li>
            <li>First of all, this works against odor almost all day.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>I ordered this with skepticism, although I&#x27;ve learned that Amazon reviews are generally pretty spot on.</li>
            <li>No perfumey cover-up, no weird salt/mineral odor, just skin.</li>
            <li>I doubt anyone else noticed, but it did make me pretty self-conscious at work.</li>
            <li>He loves the results this product delivers and the fact that it really works is evidenced to me by his requests for me to keep on reordering it!</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well for me when I apply twice a day.</li>
            <li>and I purchased the lavender one first</li>
            <li>so I stopped using it because I smelled funky and I was pretty embarrassed.</li>
            <li>really, it works!  </li>
            <li>I am on my third bottle of DeodoMom and love it.  </li>
            <li>But this deordoarnt really works!</li>
            <li>I did find one that was sold on Amazon that was better than the others, but it didn&#x27;t last all day, and I would forget to bring it to work...</li>
            <li>Personally I think it works better then</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s consistent.</li>
            <li>worked from the first use.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works really well!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever written a product review</li>
            <li>I have not had ANY under arm oder since I first started using this product.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure if my daughter could say enough words to tell me I stink and go take a shower-</li>
            <li>I really am amazed how well it works!  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is for the most part the only one I use anymore.  </li>
            <li>So while this one does not make me smell like flowers, i love that it&#x27;s simple and does NOT stain or leave discoloration on my shirts.  </li>
            <li>But I sweat A LOT, so it does pretty well considering.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;ve tried Lavanila, which works better than Tom&#x27;s, but it contains Carrageenan which is a possible cancer causing ingredient...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll like it! :)of toxins when compared to regular deodorant or anti-persperant.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to sacrifice that annoyance for the preventative measure of not getting breast cancer.  </li>
            <li>I waited several weeks so that I could write an authentic review after using</li>
            <li>It is the first deodorant that I have found that did not break me out.  </li>
            <li>I am grateful and will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I think it works better on me than the commercial deodorants that have aluminum.  </li>
            <li>The first time I took of my sweaty T-shirt and gave it the sniff test, I was amazed.</li>
            <li>After trying many natural, aluminum free deo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve FINALLY found one that works for me!  </li>
            <li>I also use Weleda Wildrose Deodorant on top of it to get some extra protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perspiration has never been an issue for me, so was glad that this is a deodorant only.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a natural aluminum and paraben free deodorant for some time.  </li>
            <li>It really is a miracle!</li>
            <li>The roll-on lasted almost exactly 3 months (as suggested by the company).</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I still love it, but as the weather has gotten hotter in NY I have had to reapply if I workout in the later part of the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Something that I&#x27;ve found I love in the last month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about a week now and while we haven&#x27;t had any really hot days in NY this year</li>
            <li>I first heard about DeodoMom from a blogger friend of mine who had given the deodorant cream a test drive and raved about it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me but might for someone else!</li>
            <li>One of the only healthy women&#x27;s deodorants that works for my daughter and myself.</li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>but it just didn&#x27;t work for me, I stayed pretty stinky.</li>
            <li>Above all... NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>First, it comes with a label with your name on it and the date you ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Love to support&lt;br /&gt;The independent companies.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different kinds of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and I</li>
            <li>so I think I will just re-fill the bottle with (much cheaper!)</li>
            <li>so I have hot and humidity working against me and with body chemistry</li>
            <li>I just pop my blow drier under each of my arms for a few seconds and good to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily and dries within a minute, and even though it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant I&#x27;ve found that it stays pretty dry until I start to sweat.  </li>
            <li>Works better than the many other natural products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, on a very humid day you may need to reapply one more time but it lasts more than any other natural deodorant i&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>If you are concerned on the widely used aluminum anti perspirant, try this great product as it stops odor and doesn&#x27;t create problems by blocking your toxins release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 19 August 2013&lt;br /&gt;After buying several products from Deodomom, I like how they send my deodorant personalised with my name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a much better alternative to the jar model, but it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li>One application in the morning is enough to last all day and I feel good about putting it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different non-aluminum deodorants but this one Really helps with underarm odor.</li>
            <li>As the many dissenting reviews attest, so much of this is about finding a match for your personal body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My bluntly honest ten year old</li>
            <li>Okay, So I have tried literally every single natural aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I live in a very hot and humid climate.  </li>
            <li>We live in a very hot, humid area year-round.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product and really wanted to love it, but after trying it multiple times right after a shower, I had to give up.  </li>
            <li>Positive reviews convinced me to try DeodoMom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not pregnant, I&#x27;m just a woman who wants better, more natural products.  </li>
            <li>DeodoMom is really hypoallergenic and really works!</li>
            <li>Also, it comes labeled with your first name, which really cracks me up.</li>
            <li>It is for me, as long as I have it with me :)</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say, I&#x27;ve finally found a natural deodorant that ACTUALLY WORKS!  </li>
            <li>after trying several other brands i stumbled upon this product and have to say it works great</li>
            <li>, it is efficient all day long, even with more strenuous activities and has the advantage of being unscented, so you can wear the perfume you want.</li>
            <li>All of them pretty much failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since this is a watery liquid it will run out pretty fast</li>
            <li>I used this producted consistently for two weeks straight</li>
            <li>I would say just as good if not slightly better than my dove that I used to use.</li>
            <li>Like all the other natural deodorants (well, as mentioned, better than others!), you won&#x27;t have success if you are in a rush and try to skip your morning routine.  </li>
            <li>I live in one of the most hot and humid cities on the planet, Houston, TX and this non aluminum deodorant keeps me relatively dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and odorless and, for me, really works (but I must say, I&#x27;m NOT a heavy sweater).</li>
            <li>After becoming pregnant, I just happened to see this product on Amazon while looking at other pregnancy products</li>
            <li>Even if you do start stinking, you just put a little more deo on and the smell goes away!</li>
            <li>On days when I am more active, I have to apply 2-3 times, but most days I only need to apply once.</li>
            <li>(some of the reviews made it seem like it would be ages), and I stay dry through most of the day.</li>
            <li>This roll on deodorant is chemical-free, scentless, easy to apply, &amp; hasn&#x27;t left any residue on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Her doctors told her that she must use natural deodorant, and I was quick to jump on the bandwagon with her.  </li>
            <li>The cream is better at keeping you dry than the roll-on, but the roll-on is so darn convenient.</li>
            <li>I very quickly moved on from Lavanilla and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li>In fact, I am very pleased that I can feel comfortable starting a family and having a baby grow in a much healthier, less toxic body.  </li>
            <li>If you workout it might start to wear off but honestly the peace of mind of knowing that there is nothing harmful in this product far outweighs any minor inconvience of re-applying after a workout or a stressful day.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to all of the strong regular deodorants you find in the drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I am impatient, so I just use a hairdryer on the cool setting. :)</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t notice a strong odor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a large guy, 6&#x27;2&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li>I even react to pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I heard and read there are speculations of certain deo&#x27;s being toxic to the breast milk, no substantial evidence, but I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it on a whim &amp; out of pure frustration.  </li>
            <li>This is the first (and thus only) product I found that can keep my armpits odor free for 24+ hours regardless of how much I sweat.</li>
            <li>Have tried many natural deodorants and this is the first product that actually works.</li>
            <li>We live in Texas where it is pretty hot during the summer and the deodorant does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>and I still smell fine the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you need this especially if your pregnant during the summer months!</li>
            <li>On those very high dew point days I do develop some wetness</li>
            <li>I love that there are only two ingredients, and it really does keep me dry and odor free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely ripe and ready for a shower the next morning, but most people probably are regardless of what deodorant they wore the day before!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to detoxify my life right now, and it&#x27;s a relief to know that I can use something this natural without any unintended harmful side effects!</li>
            <li>and I even gave it a good test run with a hard workout</li>
            <li>so it rolls easily onto the skin, but other than that it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Many of the others don&#x27;t work, are really &#x27;wet&#x27;, or smell really funky.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this product works really well and is something that I can feel comfortable putting on, especially during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to.  </li>
            <li>This really works to eliminate any wetness and odor.</li>
            <li>I really wish this worked for me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an aluminum free deodorant/antiperspirant that actually works.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume or my shampoo and really why do you care if your armpits smell like pomegranate or baby powder?</li>
            <li>my armpits smell like absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>Deodorant really is a trial type of thing.</li>
            <li>All have been unsatisfactory, regardless of high price (@ Dr. Hauschka!)  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is long-lasting odor protection each day even though I apply it very sparingly.</li>
            <li>and I love that it has minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two months in summer weather, and unless I really work out, DeodoMom does the job for about 30 hours without reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The roller applicator makes it much easier to apply than the cream version.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying this product, however, in our &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; so the heat can&#x27;t really be a factor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Really bummed, I wanted this to work for me.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this one, i really did.</li>
            <li>and I really need a deod.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and living in Florida</li>
            <li>was that it really cleared up my armpits</li>
            <li>Dries fast</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on natural deodorants, including ingredients to make my own.</li>
            <li>works very well for me and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter has many allergies, and we&#x27;ve had trouble finding a natural deodorant that is non-allergenic and effective.  </li>
            <li>Works well,  better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>and it really works -</li>
            <li>30SomeWeeks.com was very accommodating and sent a replacement after hearing about the delay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you really smell nothing, and it works all day.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand how to use this product, I&#x27;ve followed all the instructions provided.</li>
            <li>Some of the liquid spilled out during shipment and as it gets more empty you need to keep shaking it to get any liquid onto the ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just very watery</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast with no issues.</li>
            <li>Now that the summer is here, I will put it to a real test</li>
            <li>/&gt;DeodoMom works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Absolutely have to try it for yourself and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>but I also really don&#x27;t want to smell like some granola-eating hipee.  </li>
            <li>When I received it in the mail, it was leaking and came in a bottle without much of a label.</li>
            <li>When you read the labels, they always stick something in there that you don&#x27;t really want on your body . .</li>
            <li>so hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use it as much in the winter.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But for me, in analyzing this modern, toxic soup we&#x27;re all living in</li>
            <li>how light the deodorant actually is.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten very sweaty and I haven&#x27;t smelled AT ALL</li>
            <li>It works very well to control odor as well.  </li>
            <li>I was using crystal body deodorant stick, used it because thought Its aluminum free, but its not, they named it ammonium alum, just a different way to name aluminum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odor free, which is a big thing for me, because I don&#x27;t want to smell my deodorant as I go about my day.  </li>
            <li>Being vegan I&#x27;m always searching for a cruelty free deodorant that actually works and until DeodoMom</li>
            <li>Very helpful as a sort of gauge as to</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking for a chemical free product.</li>
            <li>I started to really sweat</li>
            <li>this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>haha Jerks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat all that much</li>
            <li>I have tried many different natural deodorants in search of one that doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum.</li>
            <li>I am currently trying MoM (Milk of Magnesia) but only two weeks in so too early to tell if it will be a good</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be switching deodorants in the foreseeable future, which is nice to have found a product I like enough to stick with.</li>
            <li>So then again I searched and saw that green tidings natural deodorant had good reviews</li>
            <li>This year I made a commitment to purchase safer, more natural personal care products.  </li>
            <li>i am a heavy stinky sweater and was thrilled to find this deodorant works for me as well.  </li>
            <li>35 yr old male looking into healthy alternatives for my products....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different natural deodorants and they never fully work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally been able to get rid of my old toxic antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this natural product and its effectiveness but it turned out to work great!  </li>
            <li>I do miss the dryness of my old antiperspirant, but for a healthy alternative, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and they put a little printed sticker with your name and the date on each deodorant, very nice personal touch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it, moreso than deodorants I&#x27;ve used previously, even natural ones.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how I cam across this product but am super glad that I did.</li>
            <li>We live in a hot city.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii where is can get pretty humid and 87 degrees.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and am an avid gardener.</li>
            <li>I share this information because I think it&#x27;s important - if you&#x27;re a particularly smelly person (and you should know this), or you&#x27;re otherwise chemically different than I am, then perhaps this deodorant won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>I had problems with itchiness with other brands, but this one was okay.</li>
            <li>The only change I had to make was getting used to using a roll on rather than a stick; totally worth it!</li>
            <li>, I love when small businesses make things feel more personal...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the rollerball application, but other than that, no complaints from me.</li>
            <li>I wish it held up a little better when I get hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses the deo roll on mainly because it&#x27;s non toxic which means that it doesn&#x27;t contain tons of harmful chemicals like aluminum and parabens which have been linked to cancer and degenerative brain diseases.</li>
            <li>this is the first natural deodorant that has really worked for me...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to clean up my beauty products for a while and one of my last hold outs was deodorant.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about how effective it would be at keeping me dry and smelling good.</li>
            <li>After trying several different natural deodorants I came across DeodoMom and absolutely LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely no fragrance (awesome for those who are sensitive to chemical fragrance), and hardly any residue.  </li>
            <li>so you need to allow time for it to dry, which is fine.  </li>
            <li>The cost is justified by the results, plus it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Just be sure not to apply too much or there will be some white residue left on your armpit.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, although I am not a heavy sweater.</li>
            <li>The only natural product that I have found so far that has been able to reduce wetness.</li>
            <li>I at first opted to go au natural</li>
            <li>I decided to try the roll-on, even though I still had a couple full jars left.</li>
            <li>but it does dry up pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Did I mention that I LOVE that it has absolutely NO SCENT?!?!?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not someone who goes overboard with trying to keep everything natural and organic, but I have been reading a lot about what products are safe to use while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using DeodoMom since the first week in April, and while we haven&#x27;t yet had the warm weather we typically do here in the Deep South, DeodoMom has had it&#x27;s time to shine.  </li>
            <li>More important my poor pits have been getting pretty read even with natural and hypoallergenic products.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve used it more than typical</li>
            <li>I probably skew toward someone who is less smelly than others :)</li>
            <li>This product is the only one that I found that left me feeling confident all day</li>
            <li>: I am one of those who sweats earlier than most others and cannot wear a shirt 2nd time without washing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m following the instructions and not quite sure what I can do differently</li>
            <li>So excited to finally find a natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li>but if you want something natural and equal to the quality of your chemical filled deodorant this is the stuff</li>
            <li>What appealed to me most was that there are only 2 ingredients in this deodorant (BIG PLUS!).  </li>
            <li>It really has no scent at all - I&#x27;m thinking about adding a drop or two of essential grapefruit oil just for fun.</li>
            <li>I decided this was my last attempt before I switched back to antiperspirant, and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>I began with the Jason brand as an intended cross over to natural deodorants because it was both convenient and cheap.</li>
            <li>Not only am I converting during the period we are pregnant and through breastfeeding, but I’ll be a customer for life.</li>
            <li>Like many people trying to avoid harmful ingredients, I&#x27;ve tried countless natural antiperspirants like The Crystal and Tom&#x27;s with limited success.</li>
            <li>For the first week I used this with a layer of Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant, as I work in a professional office and really don&#x27;t want to be the smelly woman.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this deodorant to expectant mothers or anyone else who is concerned about the effects of chemicals on our bodies.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for no smell and piece of mind.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend DeodoMom.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>For me it lasted all day, the next morning I could tell it had wore off, but most shower and put new deodorant on daily</li>
            <li>I am new to the natural chemical free deodorant search, but as they say, third times a charm</li>
            <li>It is amazing people still buy deodorant with aluminum and other potentially harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>You need to follow directions of applying on dry skin and to let it dry, which is easy to do as it dries quickly I think.  </li>
            <li>I always used strong deodorants, which had a ton of aluminum and other harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s too be expected when switching to aluminum free.</li>
            <li>Realizing how much it&#x27;s hurtful for me, I started looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I think she may be asking to much for any natural product.</li>
            <li>Your health is worth it and supporting a U.S. small business is worth it.</li>
            <li>I stay dry and clean smelling all day.  </li>
            <li>I just went on a testing run with a whole series of natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li>, I sweat normal)</li>
            <li>worked OK for a few days before rashes started breaking out.</li>
            <li>After trying so many different natural deodorants,from amazon to sephora,I finally found the one i like</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t hold up for more than a few hours, so</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of deodorant, but they always caused a rash, even the ones marked, &amp;quot;hypoallergenic.&amp;quot;  I finally went online and read about DeodoMom.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;d gotten rid of aluminum cookware at least 20 years ago, yet never even considered the difference between what constituted a deodorant  and an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that I don&#x27;t smell as fresh as I used to with commercial deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when using the natural deodorants, the odor was still present but mixed into some lovely scents.  </li>
            <li>I previously ordered the deodorants through the company directly and was also very satisfied especially since they gave me a little sticker with my name on it to put on the deo containers :-).</li>
            <li>It definitely neutralizes any odor right when you put it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most definitely be using this product for as long as the company will make it!!</li>
            <li>I know magnesium hydroxide is safe enough to eat, which is comforting, but I would be interested to see if there are any side effects associated with long term topical application.</li>
            <li>He had an allergic reaction to all of the other paraben free deo we tried.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nothing new.</li>
            <li>I purchased one for my daughter, who is a new mom and nursing.</li>
            <li>and I live in Florida.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I live in New Mexico with 100+ degree heat</li>
            <li>I asked her if she ate or put anything new on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I used to live like that</li>
            <li>I live in California, specifically in San Francisco.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li>Been looking for ANOTHER new deodorant because I was using Terra naturals Sports</li>
            <li>I smell fresh, well as fresh as anyone after a workout, but it works everyday for me.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li>I have been trying for years to get away from deodorants containing aluminum, however, I have extremely sensitive skin and have been stuck with one particular aluminum-containing deodorant/antiperspirant that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out in a rash.  </li>
            <li>I have seriously tried everything (Arm &amp; Hammer, Nourish Organics, Weleda, and even making my own) and I would always wind up smelling like B.O. within an hour or 2 of application.  </li>
            <li>only thing you have to watch out for is not putting too much on or your armpits will be super white.</li>
            <li>It has never left any kind of residue on any of my clothing, even when I wear black tops (which is a lot!).  </li>
            <li>and I did not have any reactions to it even though I am very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product does not cause any itching on me.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells and cannot take the scent of B.O. from anyone, including myself.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive about body odor.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and have no problems there, and it hasn&#x27;t stainedy clothes.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I get through a whole day smelling neutral and feeling pretty dry.</li>
            <li>This is the first deodorant I have tried out of all deodorants that lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li>My friends and I have purchased every product on the shelves of our natural food co-op and other stores that carry aluminum free deodorants.  </li>
            <li>and I am willing to pay for something that actually works and isn&#x27;t made with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>was completely gone within one week of using DeodoMom!  </li>
            <li>I gave it to my 11 year old daughter, it didn&#x27;t work for her either!</li>
            <li>bottle is pretty basic, but who cares.</li>
            <li>Most anti-perspirants mask or coat your underarms, which is not healthy for any woman.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the mineral salt rock for a couple of years because it&#x27;s the only thing that had any effect so far, but it really didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Finally, deodomom was recommended to me and it really works!</li>
            <li>First of all, the amount you get for the price is simply not justifiable.</li>
            <li>I tried first, Thai Crystal Stick but found it simply did not work for my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>It gives me such peace of mind to be using a deodorant with only 2 safe ingredients that work well with my body&#x27;s chemistry to eliminate odor and do not cause yellow staining on my clothes (</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s a small company</li>
            <li>Milk of Magnesia since that&#x27;s exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>Nothing completely eliminated the odor till I used Deodomom!  </li>
            <li>and it feels good to know that my porous armpits are not being fed aluminum zirconium and other harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard people swear up and down Tom&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant works and</li>
            <li>I use natural deodorant, and have found that typical &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; deodorants do keep me from smelling too strongly.  </li>
            <li>If you take magnesium glycinate supplements you will find that most of your body odor will disappear, but under extreme conditions, the extra magnesium directly to the pores is needed.</li>
            <li>While it is a bit pricey, hopefully the health benefits are worth it in the long run!</li>
            <li>This allows for you to keep your own personal human being scent and not have your deodorant interfering with any other scents you might choose.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much time and money on my experiments that I&#x27;m not willing to spend more money on aniffy solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m doing heavy exercise I do have to reapply because it doesn&#x27;t last a full day of intense sweating, but it is a lot better than a lot of other natural deodorants I have tried.</li>
            <li>Finding a deodorant that not only works, but works all day long has been a HUGE accomplishment for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used that actually works.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m pregnant, I need to be careful about the products I put on my skin.</li>
            <li>When I first switched to using natural deodorants I tried about 10 different ones, and none worked.</li>
            <li>First of all I am a 35 year old male.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; type deoderants, and this is the first one that completely does its job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts a full day from one workout to the next, the following day.</li>
            <li>My last bottle lasted me over 3 months - I recommend to anyone looking for a natural deodorant that really works!</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every natural deodorant product that sells online and in natural health food stores and none of them compare to this one!</li>
            <li>I recently found out that I am pregnant and definitely wanted to switch to a safer deodorant.  </li>
            <li>even more confused as to all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Please, someone, tell me if I&#x27;m doing something wrong?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently picked up an order of 5 different types of deodorants, all natural, and so far 2 of them are almost as strong as the generic store bought, chemical brands.</li>
            <li>the end of the day I may smell a little bit human, but I sure don&#x27;t stink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my super sensitive skin, does what it says and there isn&#x27;t even a white mark on my clothes when I apply liberally (is there any other way?)</li>
            <li>Rolls on clear, theres no, &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; scent</li>
            <li>If you are looking at this page, you are no doubt on that same quest of trying to find a natural deodorant that really works.  </li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve used a ton of natural deodorants but none of them worked.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li>Well, so far, all is well.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working well for me.</li>
            <li>I was searching and searching for an all natural deodorant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d come back from the gym and be able to smell myself pretty well, which is not a good feeling.</li>
            <li>No stinking from this old man.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this one to my friends as a natural way to prevent order with out all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>I believe I&#x27;ve tried just about all the natural deodorants</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update if it stops working for me, but so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It completely blocks odors.</li>
            <li>there are not harsh chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li>I would put it on, let it dry, and an hour or two later when I was going about my day in my own house (not doing much active)</li>
            <li>Natural</li>
            <li>I bought this deodorant after getting fed up with drugstore offerings that had toxic ingredients, very plasticky containers, and a tendency to leave white residue/crumbles.</li>
            <li>I was using Arm and Hammer natural deodorant and Toms of Maine at the time.  </li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t irritate me but after a couple of hours I would smell like sweat mixed with lavender oil (and I don&#x27;t sweat much</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten into the natural deodorant product range because I always felt they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I like that this product has natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I found an article about DeodoMom and how there are only two ingredients which really appealed to me.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter just started using this.</li>
            <li>NONE of them really worked, especially since we are used to stronger products.  </li>
            <li>I know, I get surprised myself, every day.  </li>
            <li>It smelled like old deodorant.</li>
            <li>Rub them and you&#x27;ll have old aluminum residue come off.&lt;br /&gt;Deodomom</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be surprised.  </li>
            <li>I wish the label was printed differently--the logo completely washed off the bottle</li>
            <li>My body has gotten overly sensitive to things that I put on it and in it.</li>
            <li>So far, no odor.</li>
            <li>I want to stay natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a natural deodorant for a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for years for an all-natural deoderant for my 10 yr old daughter, who started having underarm odor when she was 6.  </li>
            <li>I will continue searching for a natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li>I know what it&#x27;s like to have naturally &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34; pits.  </li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t expect to smell like perfumes or flowers, its just an all natural unscented smell.</li>
            <li>It is not messy and it has no scent.</li>
            <li>I saw the reviews for DeodoMom and decided to give natural deodorant</li>
            <li>I have tried several aluminum free deodorants in the last month and so far this is the only one that works.</li>
            <li>bought DeodoMom for my boyfriend as well, also a long-time searcher for natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely unsatisfied of that for some reasons: 1)</li>
            <li>Nothing all natural has ever worked for me, but this stuff is on point.</li>
            <li>I decided to switch to natural deodorant because my armpits had become so sensitive because of all the chemicals that I put on them.</li>
            <li>It does leave a white haze if you put too much, but you can just rub that in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks and it completely blocks any odor.  </li>
            <li>I thought natural deodorant meant always having to worry about stinking until I found this.</li>
            <li>and he wants me to order some for him next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried three or four natural deodorant products and was about to give up.</li>
            <li>I have probably tried every natural deodorant on the planet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even sweat a lot, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant to avoid the harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Even my skeptic husband was surprised of the effectiveness when he tried it.  </li>
            <li>Over the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been on a quest to eliminate as much toxic environmental load as I can.</li>
            <li>Old Spice worked and that was that.</li>
            <li>That brand worked well but irritated my arm pits so much and left stains on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>I really like that is has no aluminum and a very short ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>Always let it try completely before putting on clothing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin or sensitivity to perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for YEARS for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;DeodoMom surprised me.  </li>
            <li>Have been searching for&lt;br /&gt; natural deodorants that work.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything from Weleda Deodorant spray to Lifestinks and all of the natural deodorant crystals.</li>
            <li>Since this company has a no-return policy, I consider this a complete loss.</li>
            <li>I was beginning to think I&#x27;d have to resign myself to some body odor if I were to continue the quest towards natural</li>
            <li>We have two preteens and they needed some deodorant (:)  our preference was to use something with as few chemicals as possible.  </li>
            <li>I tried it a few more days when I was just at home and by the middle of the day I always reeked!</li>
            <li>I work out at a gym regularly and wanted something that kept me fresh and DeodoMom is definitely the answer for me!</li>
            <li>and honestly i had that problem with Secret and Dove too</li>
            <li>but I found it annoying to have to use my hands to apply it, so boy was I happy to find the roll on version!</li>
            <li>I love how when they say Natural they mean Natural.</li>
            <li>Right now, this is the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or nasty chemicals, so I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the other natural and aluminum- free deoderants, only to find that they were not effective, until I tried DeodoMom.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t provide the same protection/coverage as my name-brand clinical strength deodorant, this stuff seems to work well enough, and definitely better than Tom&#x27;s and all the other store brand natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I tried several (4) other natural, aluminum free deodorants.</li>
            <li>I have a severe corn allergy, so among other fun things I&#x27;m contact sensitive to corn derived chemicals including the alcohols, fragrances etc.</li>
            <li>, so I used this for about two weeks, and it started to become less and less effective.</li>
            <li>No other natural deodorant I found so far can do that.</li>
            <li>(Originally, it took probably a few weeks for it to work</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve tried two other natural deodorants since I&#x27;ve started using DeodoMom and DeodoMom is much better than the other two.</li>
            <li>So glad it comes in a bottle small enough for travel.</li>
            <li>I suggest anyone interested in such a quest utilize the website of the Environmental Working Group website (www.ewg.org) to vet the various products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also bought the cream and had the same exact results (massive stank).</li>
            <li>it kept me ordorless through high intensity workouts as well as a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>It goes on completely clear and holds up through a 10 hour shift at my active job, a day in the sun, working out, etc, and at the very most I&#x27;ve ended up with a very slight odor by the end of the day (but this happens with regular clinical strength deodorant too).</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price-wise, DeodoMom is definitely in the high range.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used commercial brands (antiperspirants) and high end</li>
            <li>My under arms are happy and it is so nice to finally not have to deal with the awful red bumps!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Toms of Maine, and although ok for the first hour, one ends up smelling pretty bad.</li>
            <li>Will never use any other deodorant as long as this is available.  </li>
            <li>I bought 4 or 5 different natural and sensitive skin deodorants and they all gave my 10 year old daughter rash.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands with no success and have ended up throwing them all out along with my money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not exactly sure if this is an antiperspirant too, but I have noticed that my underarms are dry, which is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not really a lotion like how you would think of a face lotion, but a really watery white liquid that absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>each one has lasted me about 2 1/2 months so even though they are a little more expensive then a store bought brand it kind of works out for how long each one lasts.  </li>
            <li>She said no, the only new thing was this deodorant.</li>
            <li>In addition, it goes on clear, but dries white rather than clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- White residue and ruboff on black clothes is lessened but still present, especially after more than one or two rolls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not particularly active at work, but for some reason it lost its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I may have a tiny bit of odor by the very end of the day, but not enough for anyone else around me to notice.</li>
            <li>I had to switch back to my old deodorant because I didn&#x27;t want to be a grown adult stinking.</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot with it - which is to be expected with a natural deodorant, but it did absolutely nothing to mask the odor for me.  </li>
            <li>But my armpits have always been very sensitive because when I was younger I burned them using Drysol.</li>
            <li>I used to use the usual drugstore brand deodorants, like Dove and such, and they did work really well to keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than the Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Trader Joes and similar products, though I know they mean well.</li>
            <li>We tried crystal and other deoderants made for kids, but they didn&#x27;t work consistently for her.  </li>
            <li>I live in hot weather and would find within a few hours that I would be perspiring, sticky, and smelly.</li>
            <li>Keeps me pretty dry and definitely blocks odors.</li>
            <li>So I am a tough customer and have tried many times to replace the aluminum for health reasons over the years.</li>
            <li>On the other hand this deodorants consists of magnesium which is an essential nutrient in which most of us are deficient now days and which can be absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li>Was a little apprehensive about using this product at first, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Through the years I have tried all of the major natural brands, from solid rock salts to products with lavender and calendula.  </li>
            <li>This seems to keep me pretty dry, as much as a natural deodorant can keep you dry.</li>
            <li>Yes, you still sweet, but you are supposed to, and there is very little odor by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a quest for a long lasting natural deodorant for a loooong time and DeodoMom has emerged as the clear winner!!</li>
            <li>they asked me to write a review, I said &amp;#34;no sweat,&amp;#34; because this is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;It works extremely well unlike other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorents that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the natural crystals, sprays, sticks, etc., and they all fell short of their promises.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Wow, after 70 plus years I finally found a deodorant that I can use without worrying about an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>If I would recommend a natural deodorant to anyone, I would definitely go with this one.</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised, pits don&#x27;t itch and are not red, assume it is working, no one passes out or anything when I stroll by</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 39 year old male.</li>
            <li>It rolls on a bit wet, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, but especially to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it barely does the job.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have tried a gazillion different brands of natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous natural deodorants and one by one they ended up no longer working.</li>
            <li>I sometimes will layer another natural essential oil based deodorant over it for scent because this is unscented.</li>
            <li>$12 is still a sticker shock to the recent natural deodorant converted.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s always been my morning routine) and the only times I have ever been stinky have been after a full day of work followed by a 2 hour heavy workout.  </li>
            <li>No funky odors like certain other deodorants that claim not to contain aluminum.  </li>
            <li>One concrete piece of evidence:  on the other all natural products I&#x27;ve tried, my wife had to tell me a number of times, covertly, that it wasn&#x27;t working.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped that this would be as great as the reviews sounded, but sadly, I was a bit disappointed - stopped working by midday ( and I don&#x27;t know how one reviewer could say &amp;#34; only had to reapply once&amp;#34; - I want to be able to get through ine whole day without reapplying it.)</li>
            <li>Will they have a strange smell (I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells)?</li>
            <li>As most of you know, gene expression (epigenetics) is key to understanding much of what ails us, can ameliorate symptoms, and how we might avoid ill health entirely.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much ( a little goes a long way) and give it a second to dry before putting on your top.</li>
            <li>The same was the case with this brand -- it worked well at first, but then left me feeling stinky and not very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been actively looking for an effective deodorant without excessive chemicals for a VERY long time (years!).  </li>
            <li>I have tried AT LEAST 10 different brands of aluminum free deodorants.</li>
            <li>Even though it does not completely keep my underarms dry, it seems to work even better than some of the strongest antiperspirants I used in the past.</li>
            <li>We tried several different deodorants for my 9 year old son.</li>
            <li>I have finally found not only a natural but a vegan deodorant that works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used my old commercial deodorant once in the last month (when I had forgotten to apply deodomom before going to bed</li>
            <li>b.o. So not perfect but one of the better all natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>The only issue was that I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the application process as the cream is difficult to reapply on the go.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products from my local whole grocery store and also a few online from the strange to the ordinary.  </li>
            <li>If they are strong enough to protect me from body odor they cause ridiculous itching</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this product is kind of expensive, I probably will not buy it again once my current bottle runs out, even for overnight use.</li>
            <li>Plus the scents were nice, especially the pomegranate ones, but lately for the past two years, I&#x27;ve been trying to be conscious of what I put on my body, like makeup, skincare, and what I eat as well.</li>
            <li>I started using natural deoderant among all my other personal care products to remove the preservatives and synthetic hormone disruptors from my system around 6 years ago, changing to a new brand each time a deoderant ran out because I never found one that worked.  </li>
            <li>It lasts longer than any other one I had tried and the roll on is the easiest way to put it on (at least for me, as a man I don&#x27;t like to get my fingers in a jar and spread it under my armpits:-).</li>
            <li>The generous size of the sample allowed me to try for several weeks (and it is still not empty)</li>
            <li>if an all natural can hang in there that long I&#x27;m all in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a vegan deodorant for a long time that doesn&#x27;t break me out in hives (I have really sensitive skin) and lasts longer than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>After a few days I even added a few drops of my favorite essential oil to perhaps see if it&#x27;d help, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I also tried the crystals, and that worked ok, but not ideal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You feel a little wet, but no bad smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other natural deodorants, but they did not work well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a natural deodorant that works for me for a very long time.</li>
            <li>A few tips/heads up: at first you might get used to the smell, as it only contains two ingredients, and no scents.</li>
            <li>As I had been looking for a non-toxic product that actually worked for a while (I have a \\&quot;graveyard\\&quot; of products that I disliked), I was willing to give DeodoMom a try based on her recommendation.</li>
            <li>This stuff blows the other natural stuff out of the water!!</li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant and have ordered this twice so far throughout my pregnancy (2 bottles should last you at least 10 months)!</li>
            <li>I have been advised if the roll on the top of the bottle needs dry to use a little water to turn the roll a little.</li>
            <li>Shake the roll-on, apply, it dries quickly, has never left a mark on my dark clothing, and I have zero body odor even after running around on a 12 hour shift!!!</li>
            <li>I get wet somewhat, but usually no odor.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I probably put on too much and it leaves a white residue on my black t-shirts, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that I have found that keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the roll on and although takes a few seconds to dry, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find that DeodoMom keeps me dry throughout the day and does so without any aluminum!  </li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin, and other products still broke him out.</li>

            <li> DeodoMom is one of the best.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run (like Cleure&#x27;s), it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance (which can irritate my skin or make me smell like something I don&#x27;t like), AND it does a great job of keeping the stink at bay!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am using the roll-on and am very happy.</li>

            <li> and I am very pleased with this product!  </li>

            <li> Anyway, I think it&#x27;s a great product and will continue to support them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells great too.  </li>
            <li> I saw all of these great reviews, so I purchased this along with another deodorant.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is great.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is great to take with you and reapply.  </li>
            <li> It kept any odors under control, and I was a happy camper.</li>
            <li> The Deodo-Mom roll on is great.</li>
            <li> I fly a lot, so I put it into a plastic zippy bag just in case it should leak, but it hasn&#x27;t leaked yet.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> thank you for great product.  </li>

            <li> I am so happy I took a chance and tried this out.</li>

            <li> Great customer service as well</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> this stuff does a great job - no stains either.</li>
            <li> Works great for me and my skin is happy.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> but I felt the need to let people know what a great product this is.  </li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
            <li> alternative and never came across a product I was happy with....until now.  </li>
            <li> But for me, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> happy stinking-less days.</li>
            <li> but in the winter it has been great.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product.</li>
            <li> We have been really happy with all of the products from this company.</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> so I was worried about switching brands, but DeodoMom works great</li>
            <li> seems like a great idea</li>
            <li> Spray or glide would be great if translatable to those mechanisms.</li>
            <li> So happy to find this.</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> The results have been phenomenal!!</li>
            <li> I found the roll-on to be very effective</li>
            <li> Very effective...</li>
            <li> This really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Unbelievably amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> However, Deodomom is effective!  </li>
            <li> DeodoMom is a remarkable discovery.  </li>
            <li> am thrilled with this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this deodorant, good protection, no chemical stuff and no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Lots of good reviews here, maybe I got a lemon.</li>
            <li> good--</li>
            <li> optimum qty)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed quite good</li>
            <li> but I was surprisingly dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel good knowing that I&#x27;m using an all-natural product during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Order arrived prompt and as promised, good vendor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, the best aluminium free deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used is my boyfriend&#x27;s Speed Stick....</li>
            <li> Without any good result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to have found DeodoMom&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> It does not stop the sweating, which it is not supposed to do, because sweating is actually good for you</li>
            <li> Good product, works as it should without any irritation.</li>
            <li> One application in the morning, and I&#x27;m good.  </li>
            <li> Good packaging.</li>
            <li> purchased in September 2013 and loved it.</li>
            <li> , what we put under our arms is a good place to start an eliminationquest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am good through the day.</li>
            <li> I have heard a good amount of to-be-moms trying out toxin-free products</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how good this deodorant is.</li>
            <li> I tried two very popular brands, which I liked, but the baking soda in those products irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just one of those people who don&#x27;t have the greatest success with it!</li>
            <li> I really love knowing that it is a very healthy product to use, and I will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> After doing my homework online, I found many happy customers who use DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this deodorant and the irritation under my arms</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I recommended it to many of my friends and they are happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I did some more research and found great reviews on Deodomom Roll-on.</li>
            <li> Very, very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> There is no nasty smell at all coming from your underarms since this deodorant is very effective.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it felt like they were making me MORE smelly than if I had used nothing!</li>
            <li> Update--just want to write that I still love this product and it still works!</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose and its as safe as it can get!</li>
            <li> This roll-on is just as fantastic!!  </li>
            <li> I have not been using deodorants that contain aluminum for many years, and I have not come across one that eliminates B.O. the way DeodoMom does!</li>
            <li> And i am so glad i did!</li>
            <li> I know I have tried it all and nothing works better than this!</li>
            <li> Excellent safe eco friendly product.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product!  </li>
            <li> I am going to order much more from this company!</li>
            <li> I just love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li> so i am so pleased to have one brand that meets everyone&#x27;s needs!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone to give it a try!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deodorant!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I even have my mom hooked:)!</li>
            <li> Have been using DeodoMom for a week now and love it!</li>
            <li> The weather here is never too hot and even on our hottest days, it&#x27;s very beautiful with no humidity.</li>
            <li> and I can say after two months of no rash and a hot summer this is the best deodorant I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> faith and order yourself a bottle of this amazing product.</li>
            <li> It is amazing that you can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> An amazing product.</li>
            <li> $12 may seem a lot for a deodorant, but it is effective, non itching, and non toxic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I find myself wanting to reach for that Dove again because it&#x27;s just a habit, but then I remind myself that this product works just as effectively.</li>
            <li> I used to think that i liked the smell of the fruity and floral deodorants</li>
            <li> Really, really liked it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a nice touch to put my name on the package too.  </li>
            <li> This has been effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using crystal deodorant for a while, but it&#x27;s not as effective as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;DeodoMom is definitely effective.</li>
            <li> He works 12 hour shifts as an acute care nurse, I&#x27;m chasing a toddler around all day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still loving it.</li>
            <li> However, I have found that it&#x27;s kind of a hit and a miss.</li>
            <li> Nice communication from the seller as well.</li>
            <li> Schmidts is also highly effective, but a pain to put on.</li>
            <li> It neutralizes body odor all day, and I add my own cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for years for an effective deodorant.</li>
            <li> My friends are loving it as well.</li>
            <li> each at their own trials, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a nice container</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly tell you is works as well</li>
            <li> I am beyond thrilled.</li>
            <li> (would be nice if they made some that did)</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like my own smell.  </li>
            <li> I was about to start making my own (baking soda, corn starch...natural deodorant) when I found DeodoMom on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Until I found this kind I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update if that changes when the weather gets really warm, but for now this will be my go-to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> dollars?the weather gets really warm, but for now this will be my go-to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and they all work effectively..</li>
            <li> I will have to keep using my dove until I can find a kind that works without aluminum.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best deoderant I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> Because I liked it.</li>
            <li> I saw this and saw how many good reviews it had.</li>
            <li> , I am so impressed with it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works perfect and is all natural!!  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, and my sensitive skin is loving it.</li>
            <li> It also has a light, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients, love the product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the best natural deodorant i have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Magnesium is a truly amazing remedy for so many things.</li>
            <li> Best I have had so far.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have found.  </li>
            <li> The unscented version is waaaaaaaaaay better, honestly in my opinion and experience you should buy it.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used that did not leave any rash/bumps.</li>
            <li> The best natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I found that DeodoMom so far has been the best as both a deodorant and antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work for her, and my best friend uses a natural deodorant that she buys at the store that I have tried and doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I tried.</li>
            <li> Which is quite impressive given that is totally natural and has no antiperspirant in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so nice to have a safe product that works.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product and I love that is doesn&#x27;t have a scent to try to mask the stench.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly the best natural deodorant out there.</li>
            <li> and I can say without hesitation that this is THE best natural deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li> Deodomom is a wonderful product that I would recommend to anyone seeking an all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great, safe product for mom and baby!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve used, even better than chemical deodorants/anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d like to avoid adding toxic chemicals to your body, and have better protection, this is the by far the best!  </li>
            <li> I did read the reviews and do wash each morning before reapplying and it really works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> While in really hot and humid climates, I still sweat and feel wetness, in cooler climates, DeodoMom has worked great for me.</li>
            <li> if anything it seemed to make me smell more strongly!</li>
            <li> so I am super protective of my one good kidney.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a roll on before but the deodorant applies nicely and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially effective if you use a good, natural deodorant bar soap (like the one from Maine with &amp;#34;odor fighting sage&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice when you don&#x27;t have to put a bunch of chemicals on your body, and I think it works fine for those less-active activities.</li>
            <li> But...I started to notice that I was a lot more ripe smelling than before.  </li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Sure, I get damp in my armpits since this is not an antiperspirant, but I did that with the turbo strength deodorant as well.  </li>
            <li> Like many of you, I&#x27;ve tried a gazillion deodorants and nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li> I think this product would work much better if it was in \\&quot;gel\\&quot; form.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> love that there are no toxic ingredients, no fragrance, no parabens, and etc.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> So I looked on the internet and read many, many reviews before finding Deodomom.</li>
            <li> I have been using DeodoMom cream in the jar for about 6 months and love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy it only contains two ingredients!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay by me.</li>
            <li> I had been using my husband&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant which had lots of fragrance and dye in it, so I thought this would probably not cover my funk, but it does!  </li>
            <li> yes while it seemed pricey i figured what&#x27;s twelve more dollars?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li> but now i realize scent free is the way to go!</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> Also I do sweat more</li>
            <li> Found this one on Amazon, and am now amazed it doesn&#x27;t get more press.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used deodomom&#x27;s deodorant cream for quite awhile and love it.  </li>
            <li> Deodomom was awesome enough to send me a sample of the roll-on to try out</li>
            <li> and I love it even more than the cream.  </li>
            <li> (I tried many).  </li>
            <li> It is made by a smaller company, but the quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a deodorant that you feel confident to use and this is it.  </li>
            <li> I love this deodorant -</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Many irritated my skin or just didn&#x27;t help well with underarm smell.</li>
            <li> Much better than toms.</li>
            <li> I am expecting, and wondered, is my deodorant safe?  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safe for me and my baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a great product!  </li>
            <li> Mine came with a label of my name printed on it, which I thought was a cute touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance on this.</li>
            <li> I sometimes put on more when I go out dancing at night</li>
            <li> (just to be sure), but I&#x27;ve never noticed any embarrassing odor problems since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Now have a second bottle and will keep using it -- best I can say for anything.</li>
            <li> Was so glad to find something without aluminum.  </li>
            <li> It is oderless which I love.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone looking for a safe alternative to antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not supposed to be antiperspirant I am not noticing wetness most of the time.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t flawless, and sometimes I have to wash again and reapply later...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so much better for me than anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others because I develop underarm rashes.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite.</li>
            <li> So bottom line, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> It said it generally is safe but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now, and I wanted to wait until I was sure that it would work all</li>
            <li> Sometimes after I reapply, I start smelling my BO, and I&#x27;ve noticed that many times it&#x27;s better not to reapply at all, if there is no need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and THEN I started itching like crazy--and thousands of dollars for patch testing, I&#x27;ve learned that I have more contact allergies than most people.</li>
            <li> I do not know why there are so many 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li> Smell is interesting though once applief.</li>
            <li> I like that even more.</li>
            <li> Everything is made with chemicals any more.</li>
            <li> I feel better as well.</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I know I will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s not overloaded with chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love it and have been recommending it to all my friends and family :)</li>
            <li> it better than anti perspiration, without the Aluminum.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at best, but to my surprise they both worked great!!  </li>
            <li> In fact, works even better than the over the counter stuff which always made me feel like I needed 2 or 3 showers a day, depending on the season.  </li>
            <li> This product is truly wonderful and they even give it a personal touch with your name on a sticker.  </li>
            <li> Under more stressful conditions (like when I&#x27;m nervous), however, I do feel wetness but no odor.</li>
            <li> but really, it&#x27;s such an improvement over anything else I&#x27;ve tried, that I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a great product that is toxin-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> LOVE it</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and internet research, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> It works more in harmony with how the body was intended to work.  </li>
            <li> Best aluminum free deoderant I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li> This thing is magic.</li>
            <li> Most scents give me a headache.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve put this through MANY workouts during my lunch at work.  </li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (and mostly I sweat after I work out).  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll like it! :)</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Also does not work- better off rubbing water under your arms</li>
            <li> The summer is ending soon, so hopefully it will work better for me in the fall when it&#x27;s cooler.  </li>
            <li> But the best part is that it actually works.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase DeodoMom because its formula seemed the most innocuous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> But you can search for its only ingredient (magnesium hydroxide) and see that it scores a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;, a perfect score on its toxicity scale.  </li>
            <li> deodomom worked better for me than Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  </li>
            <li> It comes with your name on it :)  </li>
            <li> I prefer the roll-on most days because of the convenience factor, but when I have some time I do the jar as it allows me to put on a thicker coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love about this stuff</li>
            <li> also love how there is no scent at all</li>
            <li> Also, they put a label with my name on the top of it</li>
            <li> also love how there is no scent at all</li>
            <li> Also, they put a label with my name on the top of it</li>
            <li> So many of my friend&#x27;s recommended this deodorant</li>
            <li> was hesitant to try DeodoMom because I have tried so many brands and feel like I was just wasting money.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works and it has like 3 ingredients all of which are perfectly safe.</li>
            <li> anything is way better.</li>
            <li> but I will continue to use it because it works so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it here on Amazon, and hope I can use it beyond 30 some weeks :)</li>
            <li> I still love Donna Karan Cashmere Mist if I need an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> There is nothing more unattractive than that.  </li>
            <li> DeodoMom popped up as an ad when I was ordering the latest test products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and will continue to use it even after my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS and will buy again and again.  </li>
            <li> Love the concept.</li>
            <li> I figure going &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; overnight has to be better than nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For all of us who are intolerant to the aluminum found in most deodorant antiperspirants</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products but never found anything that could stand up against the Florida heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was all OK, but I cannot use it: after allergic dermatitis it gives me a rush.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a family-owned business and wish it had worked for me.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is hypoallergenic, not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have an odor but makes sure the person using it does not.</li>
            <li> So I willed myself to spend a bit more to try others with better reviews.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than I ever thought.  </li>
            <li> The sample I had in the cooler climate seemed to work a but better.</li>
            <li> I loved that the deodorant came with a label on it with my name... a very nice personal touch.</li>
            <li> it really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> DeodoMom rolls on easily, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t discolor my clothes, AND IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I shave my armpits every day and keep them very clean.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this works pretty</li>
            <li> Works fairly well unless its really humid out!</li>
            <li> This to me is the best product I have discovered in a long time.</li>
            <li> But even then, this does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am about this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I have been using DeodoMom for two months now and am happy to say I have found my new staple.</li>
            <li> Of course, like all natural deodorants, this d.o. will not prevent wetness, but it does an excellent job keeping smells at bay and helping me feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect since I have never used a natural deodorant before - but I am SO PLEASED!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant most importantly keeps the smell away.</li>
            <li> thought it was great having a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I have tried, and it has been wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Oh and whats great is I have the stinkiest 5 year old in the planet and</li>
            <li> Let me tell you my daughter is 10 years old and she no longer smells like strawberries (LOL) at any rate</li>
            <li> a great natural solution.</li>
            <li> Love that it is Aluminum free.</li>
            <li> Company offered me free product for my review, which could be a way of biasing reviews toward people who like the product and want more.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s incredible that it works so well with two simple ingredients.  </li>
            <li> i found this product, thanks to all the good reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using it for months now</li>
            <li> I searched online for one that got good reviews and didn&#x27;t expect much when I first ordered it, but I must say I LOVE this deodorant!  </li>
            <li> No odor and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Well-packaged and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t smell and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product--all natural and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to be penny-wise, pound-foolish and forget that it&#x27;s the difference between $1 and $4 a month.</li>
            <li> But on the downside, the roll on applicator easily pulls arm hair.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and works.</li>
            <li> I very quickly became the smelly one in the office (or</li>
            <li> I still perspire, but the smell isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat often if any at all, nor do I have a strong body odor.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is very gentle and extremely effective.  </li>
            <li> I originally found this product while looking for deodorants safe for pregnant women (assuming many would be vegan).</li>
            <li> I love that this is a true \\&quot;mom and pop\\&quot; type product.</li>
            <li> Aug 2017: still using this product is as effective as i first time said it</li>
            <li> After trying many natural deodorants, and wasting a ton of money, I have to say that this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really effective, with no weird chemicals or scents and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> and I am very happy to say the DeodoMom roll on is working extremely well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy and I love that its a roll on!</li>
            <li> When not at the gym, it works fine.</li>
            <li> product is fine for if I have a day off and am puttering around the house.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t smell anything and you&#x27;re fine, don&#x27;t reapply.</li>
            <li> It is light and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> Dries reasonably quickly and IT WORKS!  </li>
            <li> Was hoping it would work a lot better but it rubs off really quickly</li>
            <li> Being pregnant, I wanted something safe to use.</li>
            <li> When I found out I was pregnant I started doing research on deodorants and realized the one I was using had aluminum in it which I didn&#x27;t feel safe using during the pregnancy.</li>
            <li> And DeodoMom (I do think they could use a better name!) is absolutely one you should give a try in your pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a truly safe product that does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> And I love supporting a mom-owned business!  </li>
            <li> best friend was diagnosed with breast cancer a little over a year ago, and it has influenced everyone who knows her.  </li>
            <li> After reading about how Aluminum based toxic deodorants have been linked to breast cancer I was looking for a deo which was toxin, Aluminum and Alcohol free</li>
            <li> One that works and is chemical free.</li>
            <li> and I would be stink free, and it kept my underarms light as well,</li>
            <li> It also does not irritate my skin at all and my underarms are still light,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> The seller was great and very personal as well.</li>
            <li> When I began to breast feed after the birth of my daughter, I began to intensify my search for a toxic free deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on chemical free, aluminum free, vegan deodorants.  </li>
            <li> This is a great step and will eliminate a TON of toxins when compared to regular deodorant or anti-persperant.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I have to say that I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Free of perfume, aluminum, salt, preservatives, parabens, etc.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great stuff, and is the only deodorant I plan on buying from now on.</li>
            <li> i was looking for an aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was on a mission to find an aluminum free, vegan deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation and it went on smoothly (hence the 2 stars)</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of natural deodorants and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It is so great to find a natural, safe deodorant that really works.</li>
            <li> And I have tried a good number of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> any event, chucking my Old Spice rose to the top of the list of changes that needed to be made.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> I tried deodomom as my first experiment (used it for a month) with natural/organic deodorants and the only good thing that I liked about it</li>
            <li> It works great, keeps me dry and smell free.  </li>
            <li> Good luck and try this super natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I like that this dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave too much residue on clothes and does a pretty good job of keeping me odor free.</li>
            <li> At the gym though, it doesn&#x27;t seem able to hold up to higher perspiration levels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted no two bodies are the same, but there are two enthusiastic thumbs up from this woman and man!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited that this works and that I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals into my body.</li>
            <li> No more stink, my pits literally smell like nothing, so this is perfect wearing perfume without worrying about the deodorant scent being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if DeodoMom was working.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to any vegan or pregnant women (or pregnant vegan ladies)!</li>
            <li> As healthy as I think I am, it&#x27;s really foolish to assume my lymph/detox system is as finely synced as it would have been in a pre-industrial environment.</li>
            <li> I live in a warm environment, and I sweat.  </li>
            <li> Every time I don&#x27;t use harmful products, I try to remind myself that I may be getting a few more years in my life or maybe just days, but I&#x27;m happy to pick the safer choice</li>
            <li> I have finally found a deodorant that meets my criteria of safe, 100% effective and doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes.</li>
            <li> I do have to apply it on clean skin (unlike mainstream deodorants, which you can apply over B.O.</li>
            <li> Then, finally, I remembered seeing an unscented version of the green tidings deodorant and in desperation to find the perfect natural deodorant I decided to give this one a try, and I am soooo happy and glad I did.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about this deodorant is that I feel like my shirts are easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> So I think when trying to find a natural deodorant, you have to find which works best for your body chemistry - one that works well for one person won&#x27;t necessarily work well for another.</li>
            <li> It has no scent, so no artificial chemicals, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and is easily applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on perfectly smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> i like to smell clean.</li>
            <li> Must say I am very surprised how effective this product is.</li>
            <li> After seeing many positive reviews of &#x27;DeodoMom&amp;#34;, I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as though sweat is just sitting under my armpits and that is an amazing feat for a natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li> I was very intrigued by the positive reviews and decided to give deodomom a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I tend to sweat more than most</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am thrilled to to have finally found a deodorant that works without my body absorbing aluminum any more!</li>
            <li> It rolls on easily, has no smell and keeps me dry and smelling good all day.</li>
            <li> Pretty good all natural.  </li>
            <li> Like so many people, I did not want to put something onto my body/skin that was potentially very harmful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to try a safe hypoallergenic product.</li>
            <li> I really was hoping to be able to get away from an aluminum based product.</li>
            <li> Only good things to say.</li>
            <li> No bad armpit smell at all.</li>
            <li> No bad smell also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you giving this a try, and as far as the cost (with free shipping), it&#x27;s more than worth it for the peace of mind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard the cream is more effective at keeping you dry.  </li>
            <li> Tried so many different natural Deodorant and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I decided to try another deodorant (and then another and another) from an upscale store that has a large selection of paraben free, aluminum free deodorants.</li>
            <li> Need to apply twice a day, but other than that this stuff is great</li>
            <li> Some days it seems like it works great and other days</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to not have to use aluminum deoderants, and for the first time  since my teen years, I can confidently wear sleeveless tops.  </li>
            <li> What I loved even more is they make a little label with your name and ordering date</li>
            <li> So after reading the wonderful reviews for this product, I decided to try it out despite the ridiculous $12 price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild with no scent and keeps the odor at bay.</li>
            <li> Like most folks, I decided to try this product because I react badly to most commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li> and my pits were super irritated.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s awesome, it works, and therefore I really recommend the Unscented Green Tidings Deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works great weird how it works so good</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a fun smell, no smell at all really, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the harmful chemicals in.  </li>
            <li> This glides on, dries quickly and performs well.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products but they either didn&#x27;t work (I sure smelled &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;!) or irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> Now that I am pregnant</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and even had a label with my name on it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have not gotten it to work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I do perspire, the deodorant quickly dries.</li>
            <li> However, I wish I would have had this when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> and it dries quickly, unlike some roll-ons.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> The wife used this while pregnant</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am pregnant and I am trying to eliminate chemicals going onto my body.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t stand the very strong smell and the stickiness of the old deodorant.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product and I&#x27;m going back for more!</li>
            <li> I just love it and recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best natural deodorant I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Also, the product wasn&#x27;t effective at keeping my underarms odor free for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> On very hot days or days where I exerted myself, it did not work as well (and my underarms felt sticky).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Erbaviva, Pure Body Scents (surprisingly strong \\&quot;scent\\&quot; that exceeded any perfume I may have ever used), Lavanila, and Eau de Minimes.  </li>
            <li> Having decided to live in a more &amp;#34;anti toxin&amp;#34; way, I&#x27;ve changed shampoo, toothpaste and now deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily and for normal activity, it works great.</li>
            <li> , I loved it at first because I would only have to reapply once or twice</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a strong body odor to begin with, which is maybe why it works so well for me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an effective aluminum free antiperspirant for a long time.</li>
            <li> Good protection svdn when it&#x27;s really hot outside</li>
            <li> I carried it in my purse with me the first two weeks, in case I needed to reapply, and I didn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical trying it (tried many deodorants that blocked odors but not wetness) but was happy to find that it does work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> It absolutely works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> Drip some essential oils on the top for an added scent!  </li>
            <li> This works wonderful and keeps me dry throughout the entire day!</li>
            <li> deodorant does not make my sensitive skin react, and most of all, I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for anyone, and even more so for people who do not have strong body odor issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all--NOW, Lavanilla, Lavalin, Truly, Schmidt&#x27;s, Lush--this one is the only that is both non-messy and super effective.</li>
            <li> This deodorant provides a nice compromise, especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to finally choose a deodorant that is all natural!</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;ve been on this long search for the most natural, and most importantly, aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle (my rash is completely gone) but still works, even through a challenging yoga class!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally scent free and very comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a huge list and feel better putting it on than I ever did using traditional anti-perspirant, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a few months now and it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to continue my search for a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants and they would all work for 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> I can even use it after shaving without it burning, and that is rare.</li>
            <li> Every natural deodorant just didn&#x27;t cut it for me, i have had many embarrassing days where halfway through work i reeked of body odor.</li>
            <li> I tried arm and hammer and a couple of known branded natural deos but nothing worked more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or minimal deodorants and none work as good as this one does at keeping me smelly-free and not too sweaty.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s all worth it, knowing I&#x27;m not poisoning myself.</li>
            <li> The research is inconclusive, but I wanted to be safe, so I decided to try out DeodoMom and am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> it came with a cute label with my name and a smiley face on it - and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> for improvement but still worth the money; I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it, you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants</li>
            <li> It is so worth the price</li>
            <li> hubby has sensitive underarms and many brands irritate him but not this one.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do ok for wetness, I only had one issue where I was in a one on one meeting with a really important person in the community</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants</li>
            <li> deodorant is completely unscented, which I LOVE.  </li>
            <li> I had tried several popular brands of non anti-perspirant deodorants with no luck, they seemed to do nothing</li>
            <li> I would say, for me, and I am a sweaty person, that this works as well as the antipersperants or deodorants that I used to use, and I love that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals that are harmful to me or my child.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No artificial anything.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had reactions to many &amp;#34;natural products&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Keeps me feeling fresh all day, even in the humid Indiana summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of deodorant that is aluminum free.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to go to a more natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it and so tried this.  </li>
            <li> I love how natural it is</li>
            <li> Been through so many brands that purport to eliminate odor through natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The armpit pain wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I believe it to be worth it though.</li>
            <li> Only problem is roll-on head catching hair.</li>
            <li> After trying many other natural brand deodorants, this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product after reading quite a few good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 6-8 months and this is the best natural deodorant I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> Based on so many various reviews, both on and off Amazon, I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> It held up to the hot Florida humidity,all while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several aluminum free deoderants and was starting to lose hope, but then I came across deodomom and am so happy I did because t really works!</li>
            <li> I always end up needing to change and wash my shirts right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done it right out of the shower, I&#x27;ve done it at waking, and at night before sleeping-</li>
            <li> And I can put it on right after shaving - it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been using other natural deodorants and they haven&#x27;t worked, chances are you&#x27;ll have good luck with this one!</li>
            <li> Most natural ones just don&#x27;t work unless you sit at a desk in a climate-controlled office all day (in which case you really don&#x27;t need deodorant anyway!).</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that I LOVE, have been working on finding one for many years.  </li>
            <li> Also love that it is completely fragrance free and truly all natural.</li>
            <li> The real test was wearing full sleeves in the blazing sun...</li>
            <li> how long it lasts and, perhaps, if you are so inclined, to set your own expiration date.  </li>
            <li> One very popular brand made me smell like I had rubbed raw onions on my armpits within 10 minutes of applying it.</li>
            <li> and I do prefer the cream as it seems to go on a little better, although, the roll on is probably more convenient to take along when traveling.</li>
            <li> It keeps my dry and odor-free all day which is amazing.  </li>
            <li> When we started to think about starting a family, I began researching this last unnatural hold out and found great reviews for this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT DRIES QUICKLY AND IS GENTLE TO MY UNDERARMS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, I think finding a good natural deodorant for YOU is simply trial and error.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much of an issue with odor or perspiration, but since I&#x27;ve been pregnant, I&#x27;ve been looking for a safer alternative to aluminum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many and none would work more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li> The Crystal, for example, was effective in the short term, but gave me really irritated skin after repeated use.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest to find a good natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> I am very thankful to have found this and will now be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I expend any effort at all - my five minute walk in to work or even a very gentle non-heated yoga</li>
            <li> This one is very gentle.</li>
            <li> , it feels very light on, and it hasn&#x27;t left any marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> , it feels very light on, and it hasn&#x27;t left any marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I do not have a stressful job that involves very much movement around since it&#x27;s a desk job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am willing to sacrifice only a small amount of comfort in my path to becoming toxin-free (which is why I&#x27;m researching the best natural products).  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had reactions to other natural products, so this was a great find.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no smell of any kind, just a perfect organic solution to all the nasty aluminum products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly and if it leaves a bit of white residue, that washes easily out of clothing.</li>
            <li> I personally like the roll on because it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Holistic Health Coach and have told many people about this product and all of them have told me the same thing:</li>
            <li> I am a health coach and have recommended this to many of my clients and they all tell me the same thing--nothing else has worked until THIS.</li>
            <li> I finally found a healthy deodorant that my mom loves.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, DeodoMom!</li>
            <li> I do apply liberally and it has not failed me once.</li>
            <li> We just went through another really hot, humid summer.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Ok it seemed to work initially, but into weeks 4 and 5, it stopped working after 4 hours or so</li>
            <li> and I would get a really funky smell and started yellowing shirts again!</li>
            <li> The first week it did not work</li>
            <li> First of all, this works against odor almost all day.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with skepticism, although I&#x27;ve learned that Amazon reviews are generally pretty spot on.</li>
            <li> No perfumey cover-up, no weird salt/mineral odor, just skin.</li>
            <li> I doubt anyone else noticed, but it did make me pretty self-conscious at work.</li>
            <li> He loves the results this product delivers and the fact that it really works is evidenced to me by his requests for me to keep on reordering it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well for me when I apply twice a day.</li>
            <li> and I purchased the lavender one first</li>
            <li> so I stopped using it because I smelled funky and I was pretty embarrassed.</li>
            <li> really, it works!  </li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle of DeodoMom and love it.  </li>
            <li> But this deordoarnt really works!</li>
            <li> I did find one that was sold on Amazon that was better than the others, but it didn&#x27;t last all day, and I would forget to bring it to work...</li>
            <li> Personally I think it works better then</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s consistent.</li>
            <li> worked from the first use.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works really well!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever written a product review</li>
            <li> I have not had ANY under arm oder since I first started using this product.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure if my daughter could say enough words to tell me I stink and go take a shower-</li>
            <li> I really am amazed how well it works!  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is for the most part the only one I use anymore.  </li>
            <li> So while this one does not make me smell like flowers, i love that it&#x27;s simple and does NOT stain or leave discoloration on my shirts.  </li>
            <li> But I sweat A LOT, so it does pretty well considering.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve tried Lavanila, which works better than Tom&#x27;s, but it contains Carrageenan which is a possible cancer causing ingredient...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll like it! :)of toxins when compared to regular deodorant or anti-persperant.  </li>
            <li> I was willing to sacrifice that annoyance for the preventative measure of not getting breast cancer.  </li>
            <li> I waited several weeks so that I could write an authentic review after using</li>
            <li> It is the first deodorant that I have found that did not break me out.  </li>
            <li> I am grateful and will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I think it works better on me than the commercial deodorants that have aluminum.  </li>
            <li> The first time I took of my sweaty T-shirt and gave it the sniff test, I was amazed.</li>
            <li> After trying many natural, aluminum free deo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve FINALLY found one that works for me!  </li>
            <li> I also use Weleda Wildrose Deodorant on top of it to get some extra protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perspiration has never been an issue for me, so was glad that this is a deodorant only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a natural aluminum and paraben free deodorant for some time.  </li>
            <li> It really is a miracle!</li>
            <li> The roll-on lasted almost exactly 3 months (as suggested by the company).</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I still love it, but as the weather has gotten hotter in NY I have had to reapply if I workout in the later part of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something that I&#x27;ve found I love in the last month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about a week now and while we haven&#x27;t had any really hot days in NY this year</li>
            <li> I first heard about DeodoMom from a blogger friend of mine who had given the deodorant cream a test drive and raved about it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me but might for someone else!</li>
            <li> One of the only healthy women&#x27;s deodorants that works for my daughter and myself.</li>
            <li> really works!</li>
            <li> but it just didn&#x27;t work for me, I stayed pretty stinky.</li>
            <li> Above all... NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> First, it comes with a label with your name on it and the date you ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Love to support&lt;br /&gt;The independent companies.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different kinds of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and I</li>
            <li> so I think I will just re-fill the bottle with (much cheaper!)</li>
            <li> so I have hot and humidity working against me and with body chemistry</li>
            <li> I just pop my blow drier under each of my arms for a few seconds and good to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on very easily and dries within a minute, and even though it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant I&#x27;ve found that it stays pretty dry until I start to sweat.  </li>
            <li> Works better than the many other natural products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, on a very humid day you may need to reapply one more time but it lasts more than any other natural deodorant i&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> If you are concerned on the widely used aluminum anti perspirant, try this great product as it stops odor and doesn&#x27;t create problems by blocking your toxins release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 19 August 2013&lt;br /&gt;After buying several products from Deodomom, I like how they send my deodorant personalised with my name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a much better alternative to the jar model, but it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li> One application in the morning is enough to last all day and I feel good about putting it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different non-aluminum deodorants but this one Really helps with underarm odor.</li>
            <li> As the many dissenting reviews attest, so much of this is about finding a match for your personal body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My bluntly honest ten year old</li>
            <li> Okay, So I have tried literally every single natural aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> and I live in a very hot and humid climate.  </li>
            <li> We live in a very hot, humid area year-round.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product and really wanted to love it, but after trying it multiple times right after a shower, I had to give up.  </li>
            <li> Positive reviews convinced me to try DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pregnant, I&#x27;m just a woman who wants better, more natural products.  </li>
            <li> DeodoMom is really hypoallergenic and really works!</li>
            <li> Also, it comes labeled with your first name, which really cracks me up.</li>
            <li> It is for me, as long as I have it with me :)</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say, I&#x27;ve finally found a natural deodorant that ACTUALLY WORKS!  </li>
            <li> after trying several other brands i stumbled upon this product and have to say it works great</li>
            <li> , it is efficient all day long, even with more strenuous activities and has the advantage of being unscented, so you can wear the perfume you want.</li>
            <li> All of them pretty much failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since this is a watery liquid it will run out pretty fast</li>
            <li> I used this producted consistently for two weeks straight</li>
            <li> I would say just as good if not slightly better than my dove that I used to use.</li>
            <li> Like all the other natural deodorants (well, as mentioned, better than others!), you won&#x27;t have success if you are in a rush and try to skip your morning routine.  </li>
            <li> I live in one of the most hot and humid cities on the planet, Houston, TX and this non aluminum deodorant keeps me relatively dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and odorless and, for me, really works (but I must say, I&#x27;m NOT a heavy sweater).</li>
            <li> After becoming pregnant, I just happened to see this product on Amazon while looking at other pregnancy products</li>
            <li> Even if you do start stinking, you just put a little more deo on and the smell goes away!</li>
            <li> On days when I am more active, I have to apply 2-3 times, but most days I only need to apply once.</li>
            <li> (some of the reviews made it seem like it would be ages), and I stay dry through most of the day.</li>
            <li> This roll on deodorant is chemical-free, scentless, easy to apply, &amp; hasn&#x27;t left any residue on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Her doctors told her that she must use natural deodorant, and I was quick to jump on the bandwagon with her.  </li>
            <li> The cream is better at keeping you dry than the roll-on, but the roll-on is so darn convenient.</li>
            <li> I very quickly moved on from Lavanilla and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> In fact, I am very pleased that I can feel comfortable starting a family and having a baby grow in a much healthier, less toxic body.  </li>
            <li> If you workout it might start to wear off but honestly the peace of mind of knowing that there is nothing harmful in this product far outweighs any minor inconvience of re-applying after a workout or a stressful day.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to all of the strong regular deodorants you find in the drug stores.  </li>
            <li> I am impatient, so I just use a hairdryer on the cool setting. :)</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t notice a strong odor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a large guy, 6&#x27;2&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> I even react to pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I heard and read there are speculations of certain deo&#x27;s being toxic to the breast milk, no substantial evidence, but I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it on a whim &amp; out of pure frustration.  </li>
            <li> This is the first (and thus only) product I found that can keep my armpits odor free for 24+ hours regardless of how much I sweat.</li>
            <li> Have tried many natural deodorants and this is the first product that actually works.</li>
            <li> We live in Texas where it is pretty hot during the summer and the deodorant does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> and I still smell fine the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you need this especially if your pregnant during the summer months!</li>
            <li> On those very high dew point days I do develop some wetness</li>
            <li> I love that there are only two ingredients, and it really does keep me dry and odor free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely ripe and ready for a shower the next morning, but most people probably are regardless of what deodorant they wore the day before!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to detoxify my life right now, and it&#x27;s a relief to know that I can use something this natural without any unintended harmful side effects!</li>
            <li> and I even gave it a good test run with a hard workout</li>
            <li> so it rolls easily onto the skin, but other than that it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Many of the others don&#x27;t work, are really &#x27;wet&#x27;, or smell really funky.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this product works really well and is something that I can feel comfortable putting on, especially during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to.  </li>
            <li> This really works to eliminate any wetness and odor.</li>
            <li> I really wish this worked for me</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an aluminum free deodorant/antiperspirant that actually works.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume or my shampoo and really why do you care if your armpits smell like pomegranate or baby powder?</li>
            <li> my armpits smell like absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> Deodorant really is a trial type of thing.</li>
            <li> All have been unsatisfactory, regardless of high price (@ Dr. Hauschka!)  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is long-lasting odor protection each day even though I apply it very sparingly.</li>
            <li> and I love that it has minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two months in summer weather, and unless I really work out, DeodoMom does the job for about 30 hours without reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The roller applicator makes it much easier to apply than the cream version.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying this product, however, in our &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; so the heat can&#x27;t really be a factor.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Really bummed, I wanted this to work for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this one, i really did.</li>
            <li> and I really need a deod.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and living in Florida</li>
            <li> was that it really cleared up my armpits</li>
            <li> Dries fast</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on natural deodorants, including ingredients to make my own.</li>
            <li> works very well for me and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has many allergies, and we&#x27;ve had trouble finding a natural deodorant that is non-allergenic and effective.  </li>
            <li> Works well,  better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> and it really works -</li>
            <li> 30SomeWeeks.com was very accommodating and sent a replacement after hearing about the delay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you really smell nothing, and it works all day.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand how to use this product, I&#x27;ve followed all the instructions provided.</li>
            <li> Some of the liquid spilled out during shipment and as it gets more empty you need to keep shaking it to get any liquid onto the ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just very watery</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast with no issues.</li>
            <li> Now that the summer is here, I will put it to a real test</li>
            <li> /&gt;DeodoMom works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely have to try it for yourself and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> but I also really don&#x27;t want to smell like some granola-eating hipee.  </li>
            <li> When I received it in the mail, it was leaking and came in a bottle without much of a label.</li>
            <li> When you read the labels, they always stick something in there that you don&#x27;t really want on your body . .</li>
            <li> so hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use it as much in the winter.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But for me, in analyzing this modern, toxic soup we&#x27;re all living in</li>
            <li> how light the deodorant actually is.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten very sweaty and I haven&#x27;t smelled AT ALL</li>
            <li> It works very well to control odor as well.  </li>
            <li> I was using crystal body deodorant stick, used it because thought Its aluminum free, but its not, they named it ammonium alum, just a different way to name aluminum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odor free, which is a big thing for me, because I don&#x27;t want to smell my deodorant as I go about my day.  </li>
            <li> Being vegan I&#x27;m always searching for a cruelty free deodorant that actually works and until DeodoMom</li>
            <li> Very helpful as a sort of gauge as to</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking for a chemical free product.</li>
            <li> I started to really sweat</li>
            <li> this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> haha Jerks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat all that much</li>
            <li> I have tried many different natural deodorants in search of one that doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum.</li>
            <li> I am currently trying MoM (Milk of Magnesia) but only two weeks in so too early to tell if it will be a good</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be switching deodorants in the foreseeable future, which is nice to have found a product I like enough to stick with.</li>
            <li> So then again I searched and saw that green tidings natural deodorant had good reviews</li>
            <li> This year I made a commitment to purchase safer, more natural personal care products.  </li>
            <li> i am a heavy stinky sweater and was thrilled to find this deodorant works for me as well.  </li>
            <li> 35 yr old male looking into healthy alternatives for my products....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different natural deodorants and they never fully work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally been able to get rid of my old toxic antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this natural product and its effectiveness but it turned out to work great!  </li>
            <li> I do miss the dryness of my old antiperspirant, but for a healthy alternative, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and they put a little printed sticker with your name and the date on each deodorant, very nice personal touch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it, moreso than deodorants I&#x27;ve used previously, even natural ones.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how I cam across this product but am super glad that I did.</li>
            <li> We live in a hot city.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii where is can get pretty humid and 87 degrees.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and am an avid gardener.</li>
            <li> I share this information because I think it&#x27;s important - if you&#x27;re a particularly smelly person (and you should know this), or you&#x27;re otherwise chemically different than I am, then perhaps this deodorant won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I had problems with itchiness with other brands, but this one was okay.</li>
            <li> The only change I had to make was getting used to using a roll on rather than a stick; totally worth it!</li>
            <li> , I love when small businesses make things feel more personal...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the rollerball application, but other than that, no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> I wish it held up a little better when I get hot and sweaty.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses the deo roll on mainly because it&#x27;s non toxic which means that it doesn&#x27;t contain tons of harmful chemicals like aluminum and parabens which have been linked to cancer and degenerative brain diseases.</li>
            <li> this is the first natural deodorant that has really worked for me...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to clean up my beauty products for a while and one of my last hold outs was deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how effective it would be at keeping me dry and smelling good.</li>
            <li> After trying several different natural deodorants I came across DeodoMom and absolutely LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no fragrance (awesome for those who are sensitive to chemical fragrance), and hardly any residue.  </li>
            <li> so you need to allow time for it to dry, which is fine.  </li>
            <li> The cost is justified by the results, plus it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Just be sure not to apply too much or there will be some white residue left on your armpit.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, although I am not a heavy sweater.</li>
            <li> The only natural product that I have found so far that has been able to reduce wetness.</li>
            <li> I at first opted to go au natural</li>
            <li> I decided to try the roll-on, even though I still had a couple full jars left.</li>
            <li> but it does dry up pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Did I mention that I LOVE that it has absolutely NO SCENT?!?!?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who goes overboard with trying to keep everything natural and organic, but I have been reading a lot about what products are safe to use while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DeodoMom since the first week in April, and while we haven&#x27;t yet had the warm weather we typically do here in the Deep South, DeodoMom has had it&#x27;s time to shine.  </li>
            <li> More important my poor pits have been getting pretty read even with natural and hypoallergenic products.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve used it more than typical</li>
            <li> I probably skew toward someone who is less smelly than others :)</li>
            <li> This product is the only one that I found that left me feeling confident all day</li>
            <li> : I am one of those who sweats earlier than most others and cannot wear a shirt 2nd time without washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m following the instructions and not quite sure what I can do differently</li>
            <li> So excited to finally find a natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li> but if you want something natural and equal to the quality of your chemical filled deodorant this is the stuff</li>
            <li> What appealed to me most was that there are only 2 ingredients in this deodorant (BIG PLUS!).  </li>
            <li> It really has no scent at all - I&#x27;m thinking about adding a drop or two of essential grapefruit oil just for fun.</li>
            <li> I decided this was my last attempt before I switched back to antiperspirant, and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> I began with the Jason brand as an intended cross over to natural deodorants because it was both convenient and cheap.</li>
            <li> Not only am I converting during the period we are pregnant and through breastfeeding, but I’ll be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Like many people trying to avoid harmful ingredients, I&#x27;ve tried countless natural antiperspirants like The Crystal and Tom&#x27;s with limited success.</li>
            <li> For the first week I used this with a layer of Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant, as I work in a professional office and really don&#x27;t want to be the smelly woman.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this deodorant to expectant mothers or anyone else who is concerned about the effects of chemicals on our bodies.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for no smell and piece of mind.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> For me it lasted all day, the next morning I could tell it had wore off, but most shower and put new deodorant on daily</li>
            <li> I am new to the natural chemical free deodorant search, but as they say, third times a charm</li>
            <li> It is amazing people still buy deodorant with aluminum and other potentially harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> You need to follow directions of applying on dry skin and to let it dry, which is easy to do as it dries quickly I think.  </li>
            <li> I always used strong deodorants, which had a ton of aluminum and other harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s too be expected when switching to aluminum free.</li>
            <li> Realizing how much it&#x27;s hurtful for me, I started looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I think she may be asking to much for any natural product.</li>
            <li> Your health is worth it and supporting a U.S. small business is worth it.</li>
            <li> I stay dry and clean smelling all day.  </li>
            <li> I just went on a testing run with a whole series of natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> , I sweat normal)</li>
            <li> worked OK for a few days before rashes started breaking out.</li>
            <li> After trying so many different natural deodorants,from amazon to sephora,I finally found the one i like</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t hold up for more than a few hours, so</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of deodorant, but they always caused a rash, even the ones marked, &amp;quot;hypoallergenic.&amp;quot;  I finally went online and read about DeodoMom.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;d gotten rid of aluminum cookware at least 20 years ago, yet never even considered the difference between what constituted a deodorant  and an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I don&#x27;t smell as fresh as I used to with commercial deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when using the natural deodorants, the odor was still present but mixed into some lovely scents.  </li>
            <li> I previously ordered the deodorants through the company directly and was also very satisfied especially since they gave me a little sticker with my name on it to put on the deo containers :-).</li>
            <li> It definitely neutralizes any odor right when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most definitely be using this product for as long as the company will make it!!</li>
            <li> I know magnesium hydroxide is safe enough to eat, which is comforting, but I would be interested to see if there are any side effects associated with long term topical application.</li>
            <li> He had an allergic reaction to all of the other paraben free deo we tried.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s nothing new.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for my daughter, who is a new mom and nursing.</li>
            <li> and I live in Florida.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I live in New Mexico with 100+ degree heat</li>
            <li> I asked her if she ate or put anything new on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I used to live like that</li>
            <li> I live in California, specifically in San Francisco.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii</li>
            <li> Been looking for ANOTHER new deodorant because I was using Terra naturals Sports</li>
            <li> I smell fresh, well as fresh as anyone after a workout, but it works everyday for me.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I have been trying for years to get away from deodorants containing aluminum, however, I have extremely sensitive skin and have been stuck with one particular aluminum-containing deodorant/antiperspirant that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> I have seriously tried everything (Arm &amp; Hammer, Nourish Organics, Weleda, and even making my own) and I would always wind up smelling like B.O. within an hour or 2 of application.  </li>
            <li> only thing you have to watch out for is not putting too much on or your armpits will be super white.</li>
            <li> It has never left any kind of residue on any of my clothing, even when I wear black tops (which is a lot!).  </li>
            <li> and I did not have any reactions to it even though I am very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product does not cause any itching on me.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells and cannot take the scent of B.O. from anyone, including myself.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive about body odor.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin and have no problems there, and it hasn&#x27;t stainedy clothes.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I get through a whole day smelling neutral and feeling pretty dry.</li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant I have tried out of all deodorants that lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li> My friends and I have purchased every product on the shelves of our natural food co-op and other stores that carry aluminum free deodorants.  </li>
            <li> and I am willing to pay for something that actually works and isn&#x27;t made with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> was completely gone within one week of using DeodoMom!  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my 11 year old daughter, it didn&#x27;t work for her either!</li>
            <li> bottle is pretty basic, but who cares.</li>
            <li> Most anti-perspirants mask or coat your underarms, which is not healthy for any woman.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the mineral salt rock for a couple of years because it&#x27;s the only thing that had any effect so far, but it really didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Finally, deodomom was recommended to me and it really works!</li>
            <li> First of all, the amount you get for the price is simply not justifiable.</li>
            <li> I tried first, Thai Crystal Stick but found it simply did not work for my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> It gives me such peace of mind to be using a deodorant with only 2 safe ingredients that work well with my body&#x27;s chemistry to eliminate odor and do not cause yellow staining on my clothes (</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s a small company</li>
            <li> Milk of Magnesia since that&#x27;s exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> Nothing completely eliminated the odor till I used Deodomom!  </li>
            <li> and it feels good to know that my porous armpits are not being fed aluminum zirconium and other harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard people swear up and down Tom&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant works and</li>
            <li> I use natural deodorant, and have found that typical &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; deodorants do keep me from smelling too strongly.  </li>
            <li> If you take magnesium glycinate supplements you will find that most of your body odor will disappear, but under extreme conditions, the extra magnesium directly to the pores is needed.</li>
            <li> While it is a bit pricey, hopefully the health benefits are worth it in the long run!</li>
            <li> This allows for you to keep your own personal human being scent and not have your deodorant interfering with any other scents you might choose.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much time and money on my experiments that I&#x27;m not willing to spend more money on aniffy solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m doing heavy exercise I do have to reapply because it doesn&#x27;t last a full day of intense sweating, but it is a lot better than a lot of other natural deodorants I have tried.</li>
            <li> Finding a deodorant that not only works, but works all day long has been a HUGE accomplishment for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used that actually works.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m pregnant, I need to be careful about the products I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> When I first switched to using natural deodorants I tried about 10 different ones, and none worked.</li>
            <li> First of all I am a 35 year old male.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; type deoderants, and this is the first one that completely does its job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts a full day from one workout to the next, the following day.</li>
            <li> My last bottle lasted me over 3 months - I recommend to anyone looking for a natural deodorant that really works!</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every natural deodorant product that sells online and in natural health food stores and none of them compare to this one!</li>
            <li> I recently found out that I am pregnant and definitely wanted to switch to a safer deodorant.  </li>
            <li> even more confused as to all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Please, someone, tell me if I&#x27;m doing something wrong?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently picked up an order of 5 different types of deodorants, all natural, and so far 2 of them are almost as strong as the generic store bought, chemical brands.</li>
            <li> the end of the day I may smell a little bit human, but I sure don&#x27;t stink.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my super sensitive skin, does what it says and there isn&#x27;t even a white mark on my clothes when I apply liberally (is there any other way?)</li>
            <li> Rolls on clear, theres no, &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; scent</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this page, you are no doubt on that same quest of trying to find a natural deodorant that really works.  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve used a ton of natural deodorants but none of them worked.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li> Well, so far, all is well.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working well for me.</li>
            <li> I was searching and searching for an all natural deodorant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d come back from the gym and be able to smell myself pretty well, which is not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> No stinking from this old man.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this one to my friends as a natural way to prevent order with out all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;ve tried just about all the natural deodorants</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update if it stops working for me, but so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It completely blocks odors.</li>
            <li> there are not harsh chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li> I would put it on, let it dry, and an hour or two later when I was going about my day in my own house (not doing much active)</li>
            <li> Natural</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant after getting fed up with drugstore offerings that had toxic ingredients, very plasticky containers, and a tendency to leave white residue/crumbles.</li>
            <li> I was using Arm and Hammer natural deodorant and Toms of Maine at the time.  </li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t irritate me but after a couple of hours I would smell like sweat mixed with lavender oil (and I don&#x27;t sweat much</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten into the natural deodorant product range because I always felt they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I like that this product has natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I found an article about DeodoMom and how there are only two ingredients which really appealed to me.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter just started using this.</li>
            <li> NONE of them really worked, especially since we are used to stronger products.  </li>
            <li> I know, I get surprised myself, every day.  </li>
            <li> It smelled like old deodorant.</li>
            <li> Rub them and you&#x27;ll have old aluminum residue come off.&lt;br /&gt;Deodomom</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be surprised.  </li>
            <li> I wish the label was printed differently--the logo completely washed off the bottle</li>
            <li> My body has gotten overly sensitive to things that I put on it and in it.</li>
            <li> So far, no odor.</li>
            <li> I want to stay natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a natural deodorant for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for an all-natural deoderant for my 10 yr old daughter, who started having underarm odor when she was 6.  </li>
            <li> I will continue searching for a natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> I know what it&#x27;s like to have naturally &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34; pits.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t expect to smell like perfumes or flowers, its just an all natural unscented smell.</li>
            <li> It is not messy and it has no scent.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews for DeodoMom and decided to give natural deodorant</li>
            <li> I have tried several aluminum free deodorants in the last month and so far this is the only one that works.</li>
            <li> bought DeodoMom for my boyfriend as well, also a long-time searcher for natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely unsatisfied of that for some reasons: 1)</li>
            <li> Nothing all natural has ever worked for me, but this stuff is on point.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch to natural deodorant because my armpits had become so sensitive because of all the chemicals that I put on them.</li>
            <li> It does leave a white haze if you put too much, but you can just rub that in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks and it completely blocks any odor.  </li>
            <li> I thought natural deodorant meant always having to worry about stinking until I found this.</li>
            <li> and he wants me to order some for him next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three or four natural deodorant products and was about to give up.</li>
            <li> I have probably tried every natural deodorant on the planet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even sweat a lot, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant to avoid the harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Even my skeptic husband was surprised of the effectiveness when he tried it.  </li>
            <li> Over the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been on a quest to eliminate as much toxic environmental load as I can.</li>
            <li> Old Spice worked and that was that.</li>
            <li> That brand worked well but irritated my arm pits so much and left stains on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I really like that is has no aluminum and a very short ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> Always let it try completely before putting on clothing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin or sensitivity to perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for YEARS for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DeodoMom surprised me.  </li>
            <li> Have been searching for&lt;br /&gt; natural deodorants that work.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything from Weleda Deodorant spray to Lifestinks and all of the natural deodorant crystals.</li>
            <li> Since this company has a no-return policy, I consider this a complete loss.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to think I&#x27;d have to resign myself to some body odor if I were to continue the quest towards natural</li>
            <li> We have two preteens and they needed some deodorant (:)  our preference was to use something with as few chemicals as possible.  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few more days when I was just at home and by the middle of the day I always reeked!</li>
            <li> I work out at a gym regularly and wanted something that kept me fresh and DeodoMom is definitely the answer for me!</li>
            <li> and honestly i had that problem with Secret and Dove too</li>
            <li> but I found it annoying to have to use my hands to apply it, so boy was I happy to find the roll on version!</li>
            <li> I love how when they say Natural they mean Natural.</li>
            <li> Right now, this is the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or nasty chemicals, so I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the other natural and aluminum- free deoderants, only to find that they were not effective, until I tried DeodoMom.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t provide the same protection/coverage as my name-brand clinical strength deodorant, this stuff seems to work well enough, and definitely better than Tom&#x27;s and all the other store brand natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I tried several (4) other natural, aluminum free deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have a severe corn allergy, so among other fun things I&#x27;m contact sensitive to corn derived chemicals including the alcohols, fragrances etc.</li>
            <li> , so I used this for about two weeks, and it started to become less and less effective.</li>
            <li> No other natural deodorant I found so far can do that.</li>
            <li> (Originally, it took probably a few weeks for it to work</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve tried two other natural deodorants since I&#x27;ve started using DeodoMom and DeodoMom is much better than the other two.</li>
            <li> So glad it comes in a bottle small enough for travel.</li>
            <li> I suggest anyone interested in such a quest utilize the website of the Environmental Working Group website (www.ewg.org) to vet the various products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also bought the cream and had the same exact results (massive stank).</li>
            <li> it kept me ordorless through high intensity workouts as well as a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> It goes on completely clear and holds up through a 10 hour shift at my active job, a day in the sun, working out, etc, and at the very most I&#x27;ve ended up with a very slight odor by the end of the day (but this happens with regular clinical strength deodorant too).</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price-wise, DeodoMom is definitely in the high range.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used commercial brands (antiperspirants) and high end</li>
            <li> My under arms are happy and it is so nice to finally not have to deal with the awful red bumps!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Toms of Maine, and although ok for the first hour, one ends up smelling pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Will never use any other deodorant as long as this is available.  </li>
            <li> I bought 4 or 5 different natural and sensitive skin deodorants and they all gave my 10 year old daughter rash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands with no success and have ended up throwing them all out along with my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure if this is an antiperspirant too, but I have noticed that my underarms are dry, which is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not really a lotion like how you would think of a face lotion, but a really watery white liquid that absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> each one has lasted me about 2 1/2 months so even though they are a little more expensive then a store bought brand it kind of works out for how long each one lasts.  </li>
            <li> She said no, the only new thing was this deodorant.</li>
            <li> In addition, it goes on clear, but dries white rather than clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- White residue and ruboff on black clothes is lessened but still present, especially after more than one or two rolls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly active at work, but for some reason it lost its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I may have a tiny bit of odor by the very end of the day, but not enough for anyone else around me to notice.</li>
            <li> I had to switch back to my old deodorant because I didn&#x27;t want to be a grown adult stinking.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot with it - which is to be expected with a natural deodorant, but it did absolutely nothing to mask the odor for me.  </li>
            <li> But my armpits have always been very sensitive because when I was younger I burned them using Drysol.</li>
            <li> I used to use the usual drugstore brand deodorants, like Dove and such, and they did work really well to keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than the Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Trader Joes and similar products, though I know they mean well.</li>
            <li> We tried crystal and other deoderants made for kids, but they didn&#x27;t work consistently for her.  </li>
            <li> I live in hot weather and would find within a few hours that I would be perspiring, sticky, and smelly.</li>
            <li> Keeps me pretty dry and definitely blocks odors.</li>
            <li> So I am a tough customer and have tried many times to replace the aluminum for health reasons over the years.</li>
            <li> On the other hand this deodorants consists of magnesium which is an essential nutrient in which most of us are deficient now days and which can be absorbed through the skin.</li>
            <li> Was a little apprehensive about using this product at first, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Through the years I have tried all of the major natural brands, from solid rock salts to products with lavender and calendula.  </li>
            <li> This seems to keep me pretty dry, as much as a natural deodorant can keep you dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, you still sweet, but you are supposed to, and there is very little odor by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a quest for a long lasting natural deodorant for a loooong time and DeodoMom has emerged as the clear winner!!</li>
            <li> they asked me to write a review, I said &amp;#34;no sweat,&amp;#34; because this is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;It works extremely well unlike other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorents that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the natural crystals, sprays, sticks, etc., and they all fell short of their promises.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Wow, after 70 plus years I finally found a deodorant that I can use without worrying about an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> If I would recommend a natural deodorant to anyone, I would definitely go with this one.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised, pits don&#x27;t itch and are not red, assume it is working, no one passes out or anything when I stroll by</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 39 year old male.</li>
            <li> It rolls on a bit wet, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, but especially to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it barely does the job.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have tried a gazillion different brands of natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous natural deodorants and one by one they ended up no longer working.</li>
            <li> I sometimes will layer another natural essential oil based deodorant over it for scent because this is unscented.</li>
            <li> $12 is still a sticker shock to the recent natural deodorant converted.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s always been my morning routine) and the only times I have ever been stinky have been after a full day of work followed by a 2 hour heavy workout.  </li>
            <li> No funky odors like certain other deodorants that claim not to contain aluminum.  </li>
            <li> One concrete piece of evidence:  on the other all natural products I&#x27;ve tried, my wife had to tell me a number of times, covertly, that it wasn&#x27;t working.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that this would be as great as the reviews sounded, but sadly, I was a bit disappointed - stopped working by midday ( and I don&#x27;t know how one reviewer could say &amp;#34; only had to reapply once&amp;#34; - I want to be able to get through ine whole day without reapplying it.)</li>
            <li> Will they have a strange smell (I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells)?</li>
            <li> As most of you know, gene expression (epigenetics) is key to understanding much of what ails us, can ameliorate symptoms, and how we might avoid ill health entirely.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much ( a little goes a long way) and give it a second to dry before putting on your top.</li>
            <li> The same was the case with this brand -- it worked well at first, but then left me feeling stinky and not very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been actively looking for an effective deodorant without excessive chemicals for a VERY long time (years!).  </li>
            <li> I have tried AT LEAST 10 different brands of aluminum free deodorants.</li>
            <li> Even though it does not completely keep my underarms dry, it seems to work even better than some of the strongest antiperspirants I used in the past.</li>
            <li> We tried several different deodorants for my 9 year old son.</li>
            <li> I have finally found not only a natural but a vegan deodorant that works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used my old commercial deodorant once in the last month (when I had forgotten to apply deodomom before going to bed</li>
            <li> b.o. So not perfect but one of the better all natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> The only issue was that I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the application process as the cream is difficult to reapply on the go.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products from my local whole grocery store and also a few online from the strange to the ordinary.  </li>
            <li> If they are strong enough to protect me from body odor they cause ridiculous itching</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this product is kind of expensive, I probably will not buy it again once my current bottle runs out, even for overnight use.</li>
            <li> Plus the scents were nice, especially the pomegranate ones, but lately for the past two years, I&#x27;ve been trying to be conscious of what I put on my body, like makeup, skincare, and what I eat as well.</li>
            <li> I started using natural deoderant among all my other personal care products to remove the preservatives and synthetic hormone disruptors from my system around 6 years ago, changing to a new brand each time a deoderant ran out because I never found one that worked.  </li>
            <li> It lasts longer than any other one I had tried and the roll on is the easiest way to put it on (at least for me, as a man I don&#x27;t like to get my fingers in a jar and spread it under my armpits:-).</li>
            <li> The generous size of the sample allowed me to try for several weeks (and it is still not empty)</li>
            <li> if an all natural can hang in there that long I&#x27;m all in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a vegan deodorant for a long time that doesn&#x27;t break me out in hives (I have really sensitive skin) and lasts longer than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> After a few days I even added a few drops of my favorite essential oil to perhaps see if it&#x27;d help, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the crystals, and that worked ok, but not ideal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You feel a little wet, but no bad smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other natural deodorants, but they did not work well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural deodorant that works for me for a very long time.</li>
            <li> A few tips/heads up: at first you might get used to the smell, as it only contains two ingredients, and no scents.</li>
            <li> As I had been looking for a non-toxic product that actually worked for a while (I have a \\&quot;graveyard\\&quot; of products that I disliked), I was willing to give DeodoMom a try based on her recommendation.</li>
            <li> This stuff blows the other natural stuff out of the water!!</li>
            <li> I am 7 months pregnant and have ordered this twice so far throughout my pregnancy (2 bottles should last you at least 10 months)!</li>
            <li> I have been advised if the roll on the top of the bottle needs dry to use a little water to turn the roll a little.</li>
            <li> Shake the roll-on, apply, it dries quickly, has never left a mark on my dark clothing, and I have zero body odor even after running around on a 12 hour shift!!!</li>
            <li> I get wet somewhat, but usually no odor.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I probably put on too much and it leaves a white residue on my black t-shirts, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that I have found that keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the roll on and although takes a few seconds to dry, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find that DeodoMom keeps me dry throughout the day and does so without any aluminum!  </li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin, and other products still broke him out.</li>
            <li> I also tried all kinds of natural stuff like eo deodorant spray, arm and hammer natural deo, toms natural deo, lush coco deo, plain baking soda, and just plain coconut oil.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just no more of that sweet pomegranate taste, so I have to rely on other products for that scent.</li>
            <li> Most recently, I had high hopes for Soapwalla deodorant cream, but I had a bad skin reaction (the maker says to keep applying it until your skin gets used to it, but baking soda on a rash is like lemon juice on a wound.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every type of natural deodorant and this literally is the only one that lasts all day and that I don&#x27;t stink when doing active things.</li>
            <li> a lot of the other natural deodorants don&#x27;t seem to work for me for some reason and I refuse to use the ones with all kinds of chemicals in them including aluminum.</li>
            <li> I have tried other natural deodorants and none compare to DeodoMom.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural types of deodorants which don&#x27;t come close to the effectiveness of DedoMom Roll on.</li>
            <li> is I can apply it after shaving with no irritation, which sets it apart from every other natural deodorant and antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a problem I had with other natural deodorants that I tried).  </li>
            <li> I tried many different deodorants from over the counter to very expensive natural deodorants and even some from makeup counters and Sephora.  </li>
            <li> Drinking lots of water and eating a lot of raw food really helps, too.  </li>
            <li> For normal everyday wear it last all day.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time, went to work, work in busy restaurant behind bar, came home and didn&#x27;t smelled myself.</li>
            <li> Regular commercial deodorants tend to give me redness and irritation, yet the natural brands I&#x27;ve tried (Tom&#x27;s of Maine for example) don&#x27;t really work and need to be reapplied at least once during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, however, not only has very few ingredients, all of which are natural, but it actually WORKS.  </li>
            <li> but I appreciate products that are actually all natural as that was how my mother raised me, and as hard as I looked, I didn&#x27;t find a natural deodorant that actually worked until I found DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> I know people commented that it can leave a white mark on your skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t care if it made my armpits blue as long as it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to live a more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; life and minimize the amount of bad things that I&#x27;m putting on/in my body.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this would be able to do the job as well as my old Addidas anti-perspirant, but it has well exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have very sensitive skin, and try to put as few chemicals on it as possible.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my first order end of August and have probably at least another months use in the roll on.  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve had with the long list of other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> However I want to see how long the product lasts and how it does in the Florida summer, so I will come back with an update.</li>
            <li> but I think it will last a long time</li>
            <li> Once summer came it didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I find that without it, though, my deodorants don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Last a long time too.</li>
            <li> It actually works all day long.  </li>
            <li> It last a long time.</li>
            <li> I would normally sweat  a lot on a typical day, but now, my underarms stay dry</li>
            <li> It worked well for the first few weeks, though it rolls on wet, so it needs time to dry.  </li>
            <li> It does give me a little bit of rash if I shave my armpits and then put it on right away, so I have altered my morning routine a little bit.</li>
            <li> With each new deodorant, after a few days, I break down and buy &amp;#34;real deodorant&amp;#34; because the natural brand just is not working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it obviously will not eliminate sweating, I do not have to worry about having a funky smell during the winter wearing long sleeves or now during the spring/summer wearing tank tops!</li>
            <li> I had major armpit irritation with other brands.</li>
            <li> It took about a week before my underarms cleared up from the effects of previous products, but after that I have had clear skin and NO irritation.</li>
            <li> Second of all it does keep you somewhat dry.  </li>
            <li> No white marks on underarms (if u dry it well and apply</li>
            <li> I could just use my spray bottle of magnesium oil (it does dry but leaves a white mark)</li>
            <li> I have found that I typically sweat still with natural products.</li>
            <li> The only thing that gives it  4 stars instead of 5 is that you have to flap your arms to get it to dry before putting your clothes on.  </li>
            <li> The package labeling could use to be bigger as my 40+ year old eyes had trouble reading the ingredients on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times, but works well so far</li>
            <li> How much can you say about an everyday product that works as expected.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s all natural with only a few ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, while I can tell it definitely makes a difference, it&#x27;s just not enough to keep me smelling fresh for an entire 8-hour day at work.</li>
            <li> While researching some more on amazon after my failed attempts with other deos, I came across this stuff.</li>
            <li> Like most other people, I blindly applied lotions, anti-persperants, serums, etc.</li>
            <li> I use this with another natural deodorant that has baking soda, coconut oil, and powdered sugar in it because if I use just this deodorant, I stink a little bit.</li>
            <li> Like natural deodorants, I do perspire a little now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised that it works so well.  </li>
            <li> Okay Ill admit is I sweat big time and seriously doubted switching to natural deodorant</li>
            <li> My bathroom cabinet is filled with failed experiments in non-toxic deodorants.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have become very pro chemical-free/toxin-free lately.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the cream because I don&#x27;t have to get my hands dirty.  </li>
            <li> There are other natural deodorants out there, but this one works for me and is not way overpriced like some other ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried over 20 plus natural or organic deodorants over the past several years.  </li>
            <li> Even though it only has two ingredients it works as well as, if not better than, my old deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I had already switched to natural makeup and skincare and have reformed my eating habits, but hadn&#x27;t thought that switching deodorant was an option since I tend to be a heavy sweater-</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine natural deodorant was not so harsh on my skin, but it did not prevent odor well at all.</li>
            <li> That way I can see just how long it lasts me.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Plus it lasts long - I am using the roll on.</li>
            <li> As long as it is on the market, I will keep reordering it.</li>
            <li> As long as they don&#x27;t change the formula, Deodomom has a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural deodorants and each one either doesn&#x27;t work at all or makes my skin itch after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> and I look like a monkey scraching my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave up on commercial brands a long time ago; started at the health food store and spent a fortune on stuff that I just threw away.</li>
            <li> or at the very least, quickly wipe my underarms with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> only complaint I really have is that it does leave a little white residue.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry all day long</li>
            <li> I began searching for a baking soda free deodorant and (after a few major fails) found DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> But, I really wanted to find a deodorant that wasn&#x27;t full of nasty chemicals and one that really worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am at the end of my pregnancy, but will continue to use this product as long as it is made, which is hopefully forever!  </li>
            <li> It obviously doesn&#x27;t compare to regular anti-perspirants, which are really not safe if you look at the ingredients and what their effects on the human body are.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> , I will be a long time customer!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the exorbitant price for some of the other products advertised and thought I&#x27;d give Deodomom a shot as a last ditch effort.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s and other similar deodorants just made me armpits an immediate irritated mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to dry, so only wish it could be made as a solid.</li>
            <li> Yes, I still sweat, but that is only natural, and I feel like this does help me sweat a little less.  </li>
            <li> and so far I have no irritation and very little odor after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to dry but do not stain clothing.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to get use to the deodorant having to dry after applying it</li>
            <li> Trust me, run your fingers over your armpit after you&#x27;ve washed with soap, you&#x27;ll feel dry areas.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry, and no perfume smell.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep me as dry as what I was used to, but does control any odor that might develop.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep you dry, but keeps you from smelling.</li>
            <li> I had settled for one available at a local chain store and much less expensive</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and odorless all day and there is no underarm irritation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> Then I allow it to fully dry, and get dressed.  </li>
            <li> Also, I tend to wear a dress that needs to be dry-cleaned two or three times before dry cleaning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but if it works and doesn&#x27;t kill me why not spend a few more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but if it works and doesn&#x27;t kill me why not spend a few more dollars?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell and I&#x27;m always dry trust me</li>
            <li> Since it takes it a while to dry, it&#x27;s not practical to take it to work and reapply mid-day, either. :</li>
            <li> Some products last a few hours while others don&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> I only lasted a few hours without odor, y prefer my homemade coconut deodorant, but everyone&#x27;s respiration is different!</li>
            <li> I already ordered my second and third roll-on&#x27;s just a few minutes ago.</li>
            <li> I was recently tested for heavy metal poisoning and the results came back</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands, searching for something that actually works.  </li>
            <li> I waited about three weeks before reviewing this product since, like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve found in the past that natural deodorants tend to only work for me for about a week or so, before they stop working.  </li>
            <li> deodorants which have limited ingredients and are aluminum-free.  </li>
            <li> now, I&#x27;m back on conventional deodorant for work, however, I compromise by wearing DeodoMom to bed after my nighttime shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago, along with other 2 natural deodorants (\\&quot;takes whiff\\&quot; being one of them).</li>
            <li> Goes on wet - a bit different from other roll ons.  </li>
            <li> Caused itching and left a sour smell instead of&lt;br /&gt;masking odors as a deo should.</li>
            <li> If it can keep us dry and not smelly, it can work for anyone!</li>
            <li> there is one less thing for me to worry about in elevators and when sitting next to the boss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I actually sweat less, and my shirts are no longer discolored.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use this on the weekends, and I&#x27;ll probably give it a try for work again in the winter, but I&#x27;ve gone back to my previous deodorant.</li>
            <li> do not sweat excessively, and I only am basing it on daily wear.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first saw that this deodorant only had two ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants in the past that don&#x27;t work, work a little or leave gunk on clothing.</li>
            <li> With it&#x27;s very simple packaging and minimal contents, I hope they can bring the price down.</li>
            <li> Shocking how effective this is, and I&#x27;ve literally tried every natural underarm deodorant on the market!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I wish, is that it was a little bit cheaper...</li>
            <li> The only time I feel I start to smell a little is when I&#x27;ve been sweating a lot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little more inconvenient</li>
            <li> So I use it in combination with the other deodorant to stay dry and not smelly.</li>
            <li> I had tried a natural deodorant before, this crystal one, but I found the spray bottle hard to use since the pump sucked</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where the heat and humidity are ridiculous</li>
            <li> After a long and arduous struggle through the trenches of buying and returning natural deodorants, my boyfriend told me about DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> This has absolutely no smell to it, doesn&#x27;t feel tacky when I put it on</li>
            <li> I just swipe my underarms a few times and voila, instant, almost all-day protection supplied by two ingredients.</li>
            <li> so I will be buying a few extra bottles.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no odor, all day, when I use this.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I started getting a red, irritated, itchy and burning rash under my arms.</li>
            <li> Even though DeodoMom is a bit expensive, it&#x27;s SO worth it.</li>
            <li> It came a few days later in between storms.  </li>
            <li> I know how difficult it is looking for a natural deodorant that actually works, you should definitely just go for it and give it a try.</li>
            <li> wife started using this as her TOMS gave her broken skin, and this deodorant was gentle and it works.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO scent to it at all.  </li>
            <li> but, well, it&#x27;s not very lady</li>
            <li> I work out daily (and sweat heavily as a result).</li>
            <li> The directions say to use sparingly since not much is needed to do the job.</li>
            <li> Some of the ones I&#x27;ve tossed that claimed to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; were harsh, caused irritation, or simply stunk.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how well this works in the summer</li>
            <li> This proved to be harder than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to use too much, just a thin layer will do.</li>
            <li> I gave this about a 4 - 6 week period of time to adjust but became so self conscious of people thinking I smell that I&#x27;ve gone back to my Secret antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> When they changed the formula of a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; unscented deodorant I had been using for nearly 20 years, I was forced to forage for a replacement.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s had an allergic reaction I mean even the ones that say for sensitive skin/hypo allergenic.  </li>
            <li> I live a very active lifestyle, and with constant transitioning from suit and tie to a workout wear and casual clothes... one would assume I use this deodorant multiple times a day,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve either had an allergic reaction to them or they were not strong enough.</li>
            <li> really like some of the natural deodorants that are based on coconut oil, baking soda, and other essential oils, but they all turn my shirts yellowish from the oils :(  </li>
            <li> Other natural deordorants left me with a weird smell at the end of the day especially if I wore certain fabrics....very weird.  </li>
            <li> and I was sweating like crazy and didn&#x27;t feel clean at all.</li>
            <li> I have used other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants before</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be trying other brands anymore.</li>
            <li> A lot of other deodorants work but have sketchy, cancer-linked ingredients.</li>
            <li> I tried Tom&#x27;s brand and other deodorants that were not antiperspirants that were sold in stores.</li>
            <li> For the past week I&#x27;ve gone with only DeodoMom</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone and everyone, and for all who are skeptical, (as I was at first)</li>
            <li> the other based on the way she smells (or lack of smell) at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people use it for a couple days and then it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I work in a hot environment.</li>
            <li> and I bought this one along with 2 other brands, DeodoMom</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from sweating excessively since my teenage years.</li>
            <li> As I age it seems my tolerance for chemicals and perfumes has waned almost wonder if it is due to years of over exposure building up.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but in the hot sweaty summer&#x27;s I would have rather had toxicity in my pores than smell like shitake mushrooms marinading over the hudson river.  </li>
            <li> also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin the way other deodorents that I&#x27;ve tried do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was worried at first that I&#x27;d made a mistake, but I was proven wrong.  </li>
            <li> other brands</li>
            <li> and i know that from now on i wont use any other deodorant on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My seemingly endless deodorant search is over!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every other deodorant I have tried has given me irritation.  </li>
            <li> Other than that once in the morning and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I do not use any other the deodorant since I have found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> All of the other ones I have tried seemed like they were scented in an attempt to cover up smells and not eliminate them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a liquid, so it takes a little while to dry after I roll it on.</li>
            <li> And this roll-on does live up to its claim of not leaving behind a residue, which was always a problem with chemical deodorants.  </li>
            <li> then my old secret because it goes on wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m active with exercise and working with our horses.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient is Magnesium Hydroxide</li>
            <li> Full stars, because Ill be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> I tried several products from other companies, but they were not effective antipersperants.  </li>
            <li> I quickly learned the hard way that &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean I won&#x27;t have a negative reaction.</li>
            <li> I did not break out in hives like I have from previous attempts with other vegan deodorant brands.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t look dark anymore</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but works very well.</li>
            <li> After a few days, your body gets used to it, and there is absolutely no smell.</li>
            <li> My armpits smelled &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; within a few hours  minus any rigorous activities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be curious to try the cream version, although I wonder if that&#x27;s going to be too messy.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural deodorant since giving up Secret.</li>
            <li> many other reviewers, I have tried several other natural deodorants and they failed miserably.</li>
            <li> maybe a dollar less??</li>
            <li> I also feel there is less dampness under my arms and don&#x27;t think this is my imagination.  </li>
            <li> I have come home from a stressful day or two with damp shirts, but none of the BO that is typically associated with not wearing any at all.  </li>
            <li> I started using it because the typical deodorant/antiperspirants were giving me a rash, and discoloring my shirts</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have said it leaves marks on their clothes, but I have not had this problem, even with black.</li>
            <li> It says it lasts 3 months with typical usage.</li>
            <li> But, sadly, by the end of the last day, after chasing after my toddler, I smell like a total hobo.  </li>
            <li> It gives me about 6 to 8 hours of freshness before I notice a slight breakdown.</li>
            <li> I could slightly smell b.o. at times.</li>
            <li> After a ridiculous amount of research, I finally decided to give DeodoMom a try!  </li>
            <li> I ordered DeodoMom based on previous reviews</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a typical body odor smell, I just don&#x27;t smell as fresh/clean as I would expect a deodorant to keep me.</li>
            <li> This is BETTER than the Secret deodorant I&#x27;ve been using my whole life without all the nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> The product is thick enough not to run but thin enough to spread around as needed.</li>
            <li> And even after applying a very minimal amount, it still leaves a white film behind.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but it seems to be lasting a long time.  </li>
            <li> By the time I went to bed, I was a little stinky.</li>
            <li> I did notice a little bit of the deo wearing off but who cares....</li>
            <li> Its little pricier, but def cheeper than dealing with breast cancer.</li>
            <li> Since it is completely natural, I was skeptical but decided to try it.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll keep it around for those (too few) relaxing days at home.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and have no issues - even when I work out.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few deodorants but none works as well as they claim.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours of using it, I began to smell.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m surprised my co-workers didn&#x27;t flee the area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with sweating and used the harsh aluminum roll-on treatments to stop sweating.  </li>
            <li> Plus regular deodorant (Secret, Dove, Degree, etc.).</li>
            <li> Sticky, messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s been a few years now since I&#x27;ve been using this</li>
            <li> I wanted something without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to use an adult deoderant on her, and though I was skeptical that this would do the job, decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an extra bonus that the skin will absorb the magnesium---something we are all, apparently, deficient in these days.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks not</li>
            <li> I have to apply it a few times a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been really skeptical of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> I went from rocks to gels to sprays to weird putty-like creams that I would slather under my arms hoping to find a natural solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not a huge sweat ball), and I do sweat with this since it&#x27;s not an anti-persperant, but it&#x27;s not been a problem for me at all</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying another natural deodorant after trying quite a few that didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To test it out I put it on right before my workout, and I asked my trainer to let me know if I smelled bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several all natural deodorants and they either smell awful or don&#x27;t last very long (at least for men).</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 5 other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> actually gave up my search for awhile and resigned myself to Secret Unscented, which wasn&#x27;t irritating, but had a long list of chemicals I was not a fan of.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with horrible irritation under my arms for several years--awful, large red bumps that were painful and very embarrassing to the point that I would not wear sleeveless tops.  </li>
            <li> And I usually have pretty bad BO after working out.</li>
            <li> This works better than deodorants that have the promise of helping with underarm smell, but also are laced with all kinds of scary bad stuff.  </li>
            <li> , honestly I hated the smell, it was too strong for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the dog is disappointed that I am less smelly, thanks to DeodoMom</li>
            <li> The company went beyond customer service when they shipped the product later to avoid freezing it due to the cold weather we were having.  </li>
            <li> I normally stink pretty bad after a day&#x27;s work and now I am not so bad.</li>
            <li> not sure how I found DeodoMom,</li>
            <li> I do feel like I have to apply it a few times a day for it to work well, but at least it does.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it in combo with a baking soda deodorant</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe i lost $12 on this :/</li>
            <li> and then (and I mean it when I say little).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Search no more.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased.</li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> I am so thankful I did because both actually work just as well as my Secret Unscented!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I have used Deodomom for a few weeks, and it works!</li>
            <li> I had tried two other &amp;#34;no aluminum&amp;#34; natural deodorants, but were disappointed that they stopped working on me after about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I react terribly to every deodorant I have tried, even natural ones and products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation or painful red bumps with this product.</li>
            <li> but when i say small, i mean small...</li>
            <li> I have been amazed at how hard it was to find a non-toxic deodorant that worked.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a deodorant that does not make me burn, itch or make me smell.  </li>
            <li> Even afret a hard core workout,there is no</li>
            <li> Deodorants with aluminum would leave a smell in the underarm area of the shirt which I had a hard time getting rid of when washing.  </li>
            <li> lotion itself has hardly any scent</li>
            <li> (I wait at least 5 minutes or so to put a shirt</li>
            <li> At least 75% of the odor disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I have almost finished week three of using this product, please give this product at least 3 to 4 weeks to try as your body adjusts.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only disappointing part.</li>
            <li> I suggest at least giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> I would shower and be shocked at how much old residue would build up.  </li>
            <li> I have tried maybe 15 different kinds of deodorants that make my underarms itch like crazy or don&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> My husband is NOT thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased  this deodorant at least 4 or 5 times.</li>
            <li> at least I felt that way as I sat reeking of b.o. at my desk).</li>
            <li> i had already practically threw away money with all the other useless deodorants i had stored.</li>
            <li> (I mean, if you can eat it, it&#x27;s got to be head of the class),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that, there&#x27;s nothing I could find wrong with DeodoMom.</li>
            <li> Developed dry skin and terrible underarm rash after using product for a month.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I decided there must be other deodorants that are less expensive but which yield commensurate results.</li>
            <li> and i do get a very small whiff of body odor (by the end of the day)on those days</li>
            <li> Usually unless I take a long shower I don&#x27;t reapply, and it Always keeps me from smelling bad at my meetings and also at work, and even when I play soccer or workout (which is a Lot of sweating and cardio).</li>
            <li> It SERIOUSLY works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seriously works.  </li>
            <li> However, I would unfortunately notice an odor after a few hours of wearing them.  </li>
            <li> have tried putting on a thin layer, I have tried putting on a thick layer, I have tried reapplying throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out with traditional deodorant and was sick of taking benedryls.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would start to smell partway through the day, but there is absolutely no odor!</li>
            <li> Was hesitant but a little desperate when I ordered DeodoMoM deodorant.  </li>
            <li> The stones and deodorant crystal sprays stopped working for me and seemed to make things worse.</li>
            <li> Being tired of stained blouses and worried about the chemicals in deodorants, I did some research and found DeodoMom roll on.</li>
            <li> and they still work, thanks to all the nasty chemicals!).</li>
            <li> but nope, it just kept getting worse to the point</li>
            <li> Something in the deodorant I used to use started irritating my underarms and my skin became brown and splotchy.</li>
            <li> I hate yellow stains on my shirts caused by the aluminum from the antiperspirant, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shake it, apply a thin layer after my shower, and by the time I&#x27;m done putting on my face lotion (30 seconds, maybe?)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind sweating, I just get annoyed with deodorants that leave me feeling sticky - this does not.  </li>
            <li> I tired Pitpaste before this one.</li>
            <li> Not warm at all and all of the others failed except for DeodoMom.  </li>
            <li> Yep, it seriously works!  </li>
            <li> I even used Secret Clinical in the past and nothing has worked as well as DeodoMom!!!</li>
            <li> All deodorants seem to give me a nasty rash under my arms, including the natural deodorant products.  </li>
            <li> The only one that worked was Almay, but I hated that it had aluminum in it.  </li>
            <li> I always thought that shaving and the regrowth of the hair made me itch like mad, but for the past month or so, I have shaved and used this deodorant and there is no itching at all!</li>
            <li> I guess she is one of the few people. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the crystal, vinegar/baking soda and other inconvenient home made deodorants and been disappointed and somewhat stinky.</li>
            <li> I found this one - DeodoMom and, frankly, was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but after using it for 2 months I&#x27;m convinced.</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> weird.</li>
            <li> One made me break out in this horrible rash that left my armpits scarred and angry for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a number of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum or questionable chemicals like BHT.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Figured with 2 ingredients I couldn&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> weird thing is this has no scent.</li>
            <li> sorry this product didn&#x27;t work, but</li>
            <li> The uncomfortable wetness is still there.</li>
            <li> Having tried Tom&#x27;s, a nightmare, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to work for a lot of people, but, unfortunately, I&#x27;m in that group for whom it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant after reading about it on some blog and web sites, I was kinda skeptical, so I ordered another one along with this one.</li>
            <li> I was not happy at all!</li>
            <li> This causes me to consume a bottle in about a month unfortunately.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sad to say I am too stinky for this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated that I wouldn&#x27;t find deodorant for my daughter;as a result we went weeks without deodorant (not good).  </li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;m freezing cold at work (desk job), my armpits sweat.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work for me.  :(</li>
            <li> Sad!</li>
            <li> My clothes would wreak and I felt very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> when i tried it, a couple hours in i smelled so bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;Deodomom works, in roll-on form, without bad ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I was still having the bad reaction and irritation no matter what I tried.  </li>
            <li> but after the 4th day it gave me a really bad rash</li>
            <li> With all of them I smelled so bad afterwards.</li>
            <li> I tried the crystal stick and it worked well but made my armpits break out and itch so bad</li>
            <li> They either just did not work or I had a bad reaction to something in the formula.</li>
            <li> I never had have a so bad deodorant before, smell really bad after awhile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really shocked that this deodorant works.  </li>
            <li> I was beyond shocked when I came home after a 12hr work day and my underarms had no smell whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well this deodorant works.</li>
            <li> I was completely shocked to find that it stops bad</li>
            <li> As i type, i have tons of deodorants in my bathroom that i have bought and have failed miserably.</li>
            <li> I can smell myself .Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> ; :( I hadn&#x27;t even done anything to make me sweat that day either.</li>
            <li> You will  not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to rid my body - and home - of crap &amp; chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I hate the idea of plugging my pores with aluminum</li>
            <li> and after 4 hours, I still didn&#x27;t smell bad!</li>
            <li> wanted this one to work SO BADLY!  </li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Brutal.  </li>
            <li> No smell that makes me sick either!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s was terrible and Kiss</li>
            <li> Beats the heck out of aluminum and nasty additives.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible itching reaction to deodorants even those with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about aluminum and all those nasty side effects!</li>
            <li> Then after the 4th day, I began to stink horribly by the end of the work day.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I live in one of the most hot and humid cities on the planet, Houston, TX and this non aluminum deodorant keeps me relatively dry and fresh. I&#x27;ve tried others, but this is the only one that works. I have already purchased again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am about this deodorant! THANK GOODNESS YOU EXIST, DEODOMOM!  Like so many people, I did not want to put something onto my body/skin that was potentially very harmful. I gave up antiperspirant decades ago. Since then I&#x27;ve used a ton of natural deodorants but none of them worked. Sometimes it felt like they were making me MORE smelly than if I had used nothing! I don&#x27;t remember now how I found Deodomom, but I&#x27;m so grateful I did. IT WORKS. That&#x27;s the bottom line. IT WORKS.  I&#x27;m a Holistic Health Coach and have told many people about this product and all of them have told me the same thing: IT WORKS.  And I love supporting a mom-owned business!  The truth is, we are all individuals and what works for some may not work for all. But you should DEFINITELY GIVE THIS A TRY. If you&#x27;ve been using other natural deodorants and they haven&#x27;t worked, chances are you&#x27;ll have good luck with this one! YAY DEODOMOMS!  Update--just want to write that I still love this product and it still works! I am a health coach and have recommended this to many of my clients and they all tell me the same thing--nothing else has worked until THIS. DEODOMOM ROCKS!</li>
            <li> My whole family uses the deo roll on mainly because it&#x27;s non toxic which means that it doesn&#x27;t contain tons of harmful chemicals like aluminum and parabens which have been linked to cancer and degenerative brain diseases. This way we have a piece of mind that  we are not exposing ourselves to toxins. On the other hand this deodorants consists of magnesium which is an essential nutrient in which most of us are deficient now days and which can be absorbed through the skin. We live in Texas where it is pretty hot during the summer and the deodorant does it&#x27;s job. All in all a win win. I previously ordered the deodorants through the company directly and was also very satisfied especially since they gave me a little sticker with my name on it to put on the deo containers :-).</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this deodorant.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work very well for me.  It is a liquid so you need to allow time for it to dry, which is fine.  But...I started to notice that I was a lot more ripe smelling than before.  I expect to perspire, that isn&#x27;t the problem, but I didn&#x27;t expect to have an odor.  I gave this about a 4 - 6 week period of time to adjust but became so self conscious of people thinking I smell that I&#x27;ve gone back to my Secret antiperspirant.  I really didn&#x27;t want to.  I guess I will have to continue my search for a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I finally found a healthy deodorant that my mom loves.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> After reading about how Aluminum based toxic deodorants have been linked to breast cancer I was looking for a deo which was toxin, Aluminum and Alcohol free and this was the perfect find. It serves the purpose and its as safe as it can get!</li>
            <li> I picked the roll on deodorant because it&#x27;s faster to apply. I love how when they say Natural they mean Natural. It only has two ingredients. I have used other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants before and I&#x27;ve either had an allergic reaction to them or they were not strong enough. I stink when my armpits sweat and I am satisfied with this product. If I&#x27;m doing heavy exercise I do have to reapply because it doesn&#x27;t last a full day of intense sweating, but it is a lot better than a lot of other natural deodorants I have tried. So this is definiely a keeper.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is wonderful! I&#x27;m happy to finally choose a deodorant that is all natural! I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for an all-natural deodorant, especially since the commercial stuff has been linked to breast cancer! Oh, AND IT WORKS!! This stuff blows the other natural stuff out of the water!! The only thing that I wish, is that it was a little bit cheaper... maybe a dollar less?? That&#x27;s why I took out one star.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants and they would all work for 6-8 hours. This is the first deodorant I have tried out of all deodorants that lasts the entire day. Deodomom only contains water and magnesium hydroxide. Magnesium hydroxide is also knows as milk of magnesia and can be used for all types of skin ailments. This really works to eliminate any wetness and odor. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to live a more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; life and minimize the amount of bad things that I&#x27;m putting on/in my body.  I had already switched to natural makeup and skincare and have reformed my eating habits, but hadn&#x27;t thought that switching deodorant was an option since I tend to be a heavy sweater- I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;Clinical Protection&amp;#34; deodorant for years.  Even when I&#x27;m freezing cold at work (desk job), my armpits sweat.  When we started to think about starting a family, I began researching this last unnatural hold out and found great reviews for this product so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 2 1/2 weeks now and am very impressed.  Sure, I get damp in my armpits since this is not an antiperspirant, but I did that with the turbo strength deodorant as well.  This has absolutely no smell to it, doesn&#x27;t feel tacky when I put it on (I wait at least 5 minutes or so to put a shirt on- that&#x27;s always been my morning routine) and the only times I have ever been stinky have been after a full day of work followed by a 2 hour heavy workout.  Even then, it&#x27;s not until I lift my arms and take a whiff that I notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am willing to sacrifice only a small amount of comfort in my path to becoming toxin-free (which is why I&#x27;m researching the best natural products).  This has passed that test for me with flying colors, as I have noticed nothing that I take issue with.  In fact, I am very pleased that I can feel comfortable starting a family and having a baby grow in a much healthier, less toxic body.  Thanks, DeodoMom!</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I&#x27;ve tried a gazillion deodorants and nothing seems to work. Some products last a few hours while others don&#x27;t last at all. That is until I read tried Deodomom&#x27;s miracle deodorant. I bought the lotion because I wanted the ease of a roll on. I just swipe my underarms a few times and voila, instant, almost all-day protection supplied by two ingredients. That&#x27;s amazing. I say almost because liquid deodorants have a tendency to dissipate or run off, depending on work activity and temperature. I think this product would work much better if it was in \\&quot;gel\\&quot; form. Anyway, I think it&#x27;s a great product and will continue to support them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have faith and order yourself a bottle of this amazing product. I&#x27;ll be ordering again. That&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I really wish this worked for me but it didn&#x27;t whatsoever.  After a few days I even added a few drops of my favorite essential oil to perhaps see if it&#x27;d help, but it didn&#x27;t.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, though, which I was grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to do an armpit detox and then try it again to see if it&#x27;ll work any better.&lt;br /&gt;(this is the detox I&#x27;m going to try -- http://wellnessmama.com/25432/detox-your-armpits/ )</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this works. Magnesium is a truly amazing remedy for so many things. If you take magnesium glycinate supplements you will find that most of your body odor will disappear, but under extreme conditions, the extra magnesium directly to the pores is needed. I use both magnesium glycinate supplements and this milk of magnesia deodorant every day.</li>
            <li> I used to use the usual drugstore brand deodorants, like Dove and such, and they did work really well to keep me smelling fresh. Plus the scents were nice, especially the pomegranate ones, but lately for the past two years, I&#x27;ve been trying to be conscious of what I put on my body, like makeup, skincare, and what I eat as well. I had tried a natural deodorant before, this crystal one, but I found the spray bottle hard to use since the pump sucked and I didn&#x27;t want to rub a crystal rock underneath my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This DeodoMom lotion deodorant is the answer to all my problems. You shake it and apply. I like to massage it into the skin, which helps get rid of any white residue that might happen once it drys. I do apply liberally and it has not failed me once. I smell fresh, well as fresh as anyone after a workout, but it works everyday for me. There is no nasty smell at all coming from your underarms since this deodorant is very effective. I&#x27;m not exactly sure if this is an antiperspirant too, but I have noticed that my underarms are dry, which is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not really a lotion like how you would think of a face lotion, but a really watery white liquid that absorbs really quickly. Maybe 10 second tops after rubbing it into my skin and I can put my shirt back on. There is no residue at all on my shirt or underarms so I can wear those strapless and short sleeve tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are no toxic ingredients, no fragrance, no parabens, and etc. The biggest plus of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make me itch! I always thought that shaving and the regrowth of the hair made me itch like mad, but for the past month or so, I have shaved and used this deodorant and there is no itching at all! I never realized the pleasure of not having to try to discretely itch your underarms in public. I will buy this product again and again. $12 may seem a lot for a deodorant, but it is effective, non itching, and non toxic. There are other natural deodorants out there, but this one works for me and is not way overpriced like some other ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it daily for about a  month and there is a lot of product left. It says that it should last about 3 months so I will be buying a few extra bottles. I don&#x27;t know if they expire or anything, but I plan to keep one at my place and my parents place so that I will never be without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I find myself wanting to reach for that Dove again because it&#x27;s just a habit, but then I remind myself that this product works just as effectively. There&#x27;s just no more of that sweet pomegranate taste, so I have to rely on other products for that scent. Plus a bit of rubbing into the skin that I never had to do with traditional deodorants, but then I remember that I don&#x27;t want to put such toxic chemicals into my body. Every time I don&#x27;t use harmful products, I try to remind myself that I may be getting a few more years in my life or maybe just days, but I&#x27;m happy to pick the safer choice any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how sanitary this rollon applicator is, but traditional deodorants use it too, and it&#x27;s only three months of usage so I&#x27;m not too worried about like bacterial build up or stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so thankful that you guys created this product.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine before but wanted a deodorant without aluminum (that actually works!) After doing my homework online, I found many happy customers who use DeodoMom. I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and buy the roll-on. I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now and I have zero complaints! I can even use it after shaving without it burning, and that is rare. It keeps me dry all day long and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the ingredients. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My friends and I have purchased every product on the shelves of our natural food co-op and other stores that carry aluminum free deodorants.  None of those products work! I always end up needing to change and wash my shirts right away. So I looked on the internet and read many, many reviews before finding Deodomom. However, Deodomom is effective!  My test is two classes back to back at gold&#x27;s gym (1 hour weight lifting class followed by 1 hour cycle-spin class). I do sweat, but there is no smell.  I also feel there is less dampness under my arms and don&#x27;t think this is my imagination.  This is the only product I have seen with this formulation, so maybe that is why it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using DeodoMom cream in the jar for about 6 months and love it.  This roll-on is just as fantastic!!  Will never use any other deodorant as long as this is available.  Absolutely no odor, all day, when I use this.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with allergies on lots of things used by &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorants, but this deodorant doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. At the same time, I have noticed that sweating is reduced (not stopped, but reduced). No idea what causes this, but it is a plus for me. I would normally sweat  a lot on a typical day, but now, my underarms stay dry</li>
            <li> I have not been using deodorants that contain aluminum for many years, and I have not come across one that eliminates B.O. the way DeodoMom does! While it obviously will not eliminate sweating, I do not have to worry about having a funky smell during the winter wearing long sleeves or now during the spring/summer wearing tank tops! I have not been happy with a deodorant like this for years!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: 9/2016. I&#x27;ve been using DeodoMom Roll On for 3-4 years now. We just went through another really hot, humid summer. This product works for me and I&#x27;m very happy it only contains two ingredients! There&#x27;s no residue, no irritation. The itchy red rash hasn&#x27;t come back. (Originally, it took probably a few weeks for it to work but I was patient and now it&#x27;s a keeper!)  UPDATE: 10/2015. I decided to try another deodorant (and then another and another) from an upscale store that has a large selection of paraben free, aluminum free deodorants. Never again. I&#x27;m staying with DeodoMom Roll On. Ordered one, ordered another one just to have on hand. I won&#x27;t be trying other brands anymore. This deodorant most importantly keeps the smell away. I&#x27;m now a customer for life!  A few years ago I started getting a red, irritated, itchy and burning rash under my arms. I stopped using deodorant for a while but that didn&#x27;t last of course (odor). I used Kiss My Face deodorant for a couple years and then all of a sudden the rash came back a couple months ago. After being checked out (again) by a dermatologist who gave me a &#x27;script for the rash, I ended up looking for another deodorant to use. I found this one - DeodoMom and, frankly, was skeptical. Well, so far, all is well. It&#x27;s mild with no scent and keeps the odor at bay. On those very high dew point days I do develop some wetness but that&#x27;s okay by me. I&#x27;m keeping my figurative fingers crossed that I can keep using this deodorant from now on. I am very happy with it and will repurchase. UPDATE: we are in the midst of a heat wave and I am very happy to say the DeodoMom roll on is working extremely well!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works perfect and is all natural!!  It smells great too.  You can tell as soon as you put it on that it&#x27;s a high quality product.  I will definitely be buying again when I run out</li>
            <li> I saw all of these great reviews, so I purchased this along with another deodorant.  I&#x27;ve been searching for an aluminum free deodorant/antiperspirant that actually works. This deodorant didn&#x27;t work for me.  Also, I did not like the smell.  It does not serve as a deodorant or antiperspirant.  In addition, it goes on clear, but dries white rather than clear.</li>
            <li> Best I have had so far. It takes awhile to dry but do not stain clothing. I had problems with itchiness with other brands, but this one was okay.</li>
            <li> Need to apply twice a day, but other than that this stuff is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really shocked that this deodorant works.  I had been using my husband&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant which had lots of fragrance and dye in it, so I thought this would probably not cover my funk, but it does!  And I do get under arm funk.  This stuff works!  Highly recommend. P.S. Removing meat (rotting flesh) from my diet drastically improved my body odor. At least 75% of the odor disappeared.  This takes care of the rest.</li>
            <li> Actually smells like BO before you even put it on. Lots of good reviews here, maybe I got a lemon.</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;ve been on this long search for the most natural, and most importantly, aluminum free deodorant. As i type, i have tons of deodorants in my bathroom that i have bought and have failed miserably. Every natural deodorant just didn&#x27;t cut it for me, i have had many embarrassing days where halfway through work i reeked of body odor. I finally gave up and ended up going back to aluminium filled Secret cause i just wasn&#x27;t finding anything. Just by accident on amazon i ran into deodomom and yes while it seemed pricey i figured what&#x27;s twelve more dollars? i had already practically threw away money with all the other useless deodorants i had stored. And i am so glad i did! this stuff really works! I absolutely love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent. I used to think that i liked the smell of the fruity and floral deodorants but now i realize scent free is the way to go! It doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume or my shampoo and really why do you care if your armpits smell like pomegranate or baby powder? it&#x27;s deodorant! i just don&#x27;t want body odor. my armpits smell like absolutely nothing and i love it. I have put this to the test on 100 degree weather and i do get a very small whiff of body odor (by the end of the day)on those days but when i say small, i mean small...like you&#x27;d have to be under my armpit smelling it to get a smell. and honestly i had that problem with Secret and Dove too so that&#x27;s nothing new. One thing to note about deodorant is everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is so different so what works for one person won&#x27;t work for another. Deodorant really is a trial type of thing. I&#x27;ve heard people swear up and down Tom&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant works and when i tried it, a couple hours in i smelled so bad no one wanted to be around me. Also I do sweat more but that&#x27;s too be expected when switching to aluminum free. Definitely recommend giving this a try!!</li>
            <li> My bathroom cabinet is filled with failed experiments in non-toxic deodorants.  All have been unsatisfactory, regardless of high price (@ Dr. Hauschka!)  Most recently, I had high hopes for Soapwalla deodorant cream, but I had a bad skin reaction (the maker says to keep applying it until your skin gets used to it, but baking soda on a rash is like lemon juice on a wound.  It also had to be applied with your fingers, but did not wash off easily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deodomom works, in roll-on form, without bad ingredients.  I have sniffed my shirts to double check at the end of the day; they never smell.  I have been amazed at how hard it was to find a non-toxic deodorant that worked.  I have pored over the blogs looking for recommendations. Found this one on Amazon, and am now amazed it doesn&#x27;t get more press. It should!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different natural deodorants in search of one that doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum. This works wonderful and keeps me dry throughout the entire day! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I only lasted a few hours without odor, y prefer my homemade coconut deodorant, but everyone&#x27;s respiration is different!</li>
            <li> Developed dry skin and terrible underarm rash after using product for a month. Also, the product wasn&#x27;t effective at keeping my underarms odor free for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. The shipping needs work. It came in a zip lock bag for a reason because it had leaked quite a bit by time it got to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant now for about a month. So far, so good. No white residue on clothes, and it seems to work for the entire day, even after exercising. I had tried two other &amp;#34;no aluminum&amp;#34; natural deodorants, but were disappointed that they stopped working on me after about two weeks. I purchased one for my daughter, who is a new mom and nursing.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this works pretty good-- a lot of the other natural deodorants don&#x27;t seem to work for me for some reason and I refuse to use the ones with all kinds of chemicals in them including aluminum. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of natural deodorants and this one is by far the best. Prevents any body odor even after working out. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Update! Ok it seemed to work initially, but into weeks 4 and 5, it stopped working after 4 hours or so and I would get a really funky smell and started yellowing shirts again! So this product did not work for me after 4/5 + weeks of use. I am currently trying MoM (Milk of Magnesia) but only two weeks in so too early to tell if it will be a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review: So far so good! I have almost finished week three of using this product, please give this product at least 3 to 4 weeks to try as your body adjusts. The first week it did not work and I had switched from using Truly&#x27;s Deodorant for 2 + months. I believe it is working now, while I still perspire if exercising, I am not smelly at the end of the day, and no yellow stains, gross pits, rashes or ingrown hair. However I want to see how long the product lasts and how it does in the Florida summer, so I will come back with an update.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. I WANTED TO FIND AN UNSCENTED, ALUMINUM-FREE DEODORANT  AND THIS IS IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT DRIES QUICKLY AND IS GENTLE TO MY UNDERARMS. BEST OF ALL, IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> My son loves this. He had an allergic reaction to all of the other paraben free deo we tried.</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out with traditional deodorant and was sick of taking benedryls. I tried arm and hammer and a couple of known branded natural deos but nothing worked more than 2 hours. I would definately buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working well for me. You&#x27;ll have to get use to the deodorant having to dry after applying it but it does dry up pretty quickly so it&#x27;s not a problem at all for me. Just be sure not to apply too much or there will be some white residue left on your armpit. Overall, it is definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that I LOVE, have been working on finding one for many years.  Shake the roll-on, apply, it dries quickly, has never left a mark on my dark clothing, and I have zero body odor even after running around on a 12 hour shift!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used deodomom&#x27;s deodorant cream for quite awhile and love it.  It keeps my dry and odor-free all day which is amazing.  The only issue was that I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the application process as the cream is difficult to reapply on the go.  Deodomom was awesome enough to send me a sample of the roll-on to try out and I love it even more than the cream.  First of all, this works against odor almost all day.  Sometimes, on a very humid day you may need to reapply one more time but it lasts more than any other natural deodorant i&#x27;ve ever tried.  Second of all it does keep you somewhat dry.  I don&#x27;t feel as though sweat is just sitting under my armpits and that is an amazing feat for a natural deodorant!  This is great to take with you and reapply.  I&#x27;ve heard the cream is more effective at keeping you dry.  My suggestion is buy the cream and the roll-on.  Use the cream as your intial application after showering and then use the roll-on when you need to reapply before your next shower.  Amazing product!!!  Try it if you&#x27;ve tried everything else!  I know I have tried it all and nothing works better than this!</li>
            <li> I was searching and searching for an all natural deodorant and I decided to try this one.  This product is the only one that I found that left me feeling confident all day (I tried many).  All the others, left me checking.  Get this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I found this item by Googling for a deodorant that would not make my underarms itch and break out. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands with no success and have ended up throwing them all out along with my money. Tom&#x27;s of Maine natural deodorant was not so harsh on my skin, but it did not prevent odor well at all. I thought I would just be stuck with itching for the rest of my life. DeodoMom roll-on is absolutely wonderful!! It took about a week before my underarms cleared up from the effects of previous products, but after that I have had clear skin and NO irritation. Even though DeodoMom is a bit expensive, it&#x27;s SO worth it. It is long-lasting odor protection each day even though I apply it very sparingly. I like how 30SomeWeeks ships it with your name and the month/year of purchase. That way I can see just how long it lasts me. No matter what, this is the product I will be buying from now on.</li>
            <li> Excellent safe eco friendly product.</li>
            <li> Works great! Was a little apprehensive about using this product at first, but was pleasantly surprised. Really, really liked it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant WORKS. Since it is completely natural, I was skeptical but decided to try it. I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants in the past that don&#x27;t work, work a little or leave gunk on clothing. A lot of other deodorants work but have sketchy, cancer-linked ingredients. I have finally found a deodorant that meets my criteria of safe, 100% effective and doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes. You will still sweat... but it will not smell! And it lasts all day! I&#x27;m a very happy customer and won&#x27;t be buying anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain all of the synthetic ingredients that are ubiquitous on all anti-perpirants and deodorants found in stores. I&#x27;ve tried the natural crystals, sprays, sticks, etc., and they all fell short of their promises.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how I found DeodoMom, but I have to say, I&#x27;ve been using it since it was delivered in Mid-July, and it works as advertised.  One concrete piece of evidence:  on the other all natural products I&#x27;ve tried, my wife had to tell me a number of times, covertly, that it wasn&#x27;t working.  WIth DeodoMom, not a peep.  I have come home from a stressful day or two with damp shirts, but none of the BO that is typically associated with not wearing any at all.  Bottom line; if you need a deodorant that works, check this out.  I prefer the roll-on because it&#x27;s just easier to use.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the best!  It is made by a smaller company, but the quality is excellent.  I thought it was a nice touch to put my name on the package too.  I have been trying to find a deodorant that you feel confident to use and this is it.  Excellent product, and my sensitive skin is loving it.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended DeodoMom because it a) works and b) doesn&#x27;t turn the underarms of her shirts yellow. I was skeptical but after using it for 2 months I&#x27;m convinced. I don&#x27;t have b.o. and the undershirts I started wearing around the time I got it are still white. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is exactly what I have been looking for. One that works and is chemical free. It is expensive but I think it will last a long time and I am willing to pay for something that actually works and isn&#x27;t made with harmful chemicals. After it dries it feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing any deodorant but you don&#x27;t sweat or smell.</li>
            <li> I used this product during the heat of the summer for about 3 months. When not at the gym, it works fine. It kept any odors under control, and I was a happy camper. At the gym though, it doesn&#x27;t seem able to hold up to higher perspiration levels. I&#x27;d come back from the gym and be able to smell myself pretty well, which is not a good feeling. So if you&#x27;re going to get this, but also like to work out, I&#x27;d recommend you use this as your non-active deodorant. It&#x27;s nice when you don&#x27;t have to put a bunch of chemicals on your body, and I think it works fine for those less-active activities.</li>
            <li> This was a much better alternative to the jar model, but it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day. That&#x27;s the only disappointing part.</li>
            <li> I have a severe corn allergy, so among other fun things I&#x27;m contact sensitive to corn derived chemicals including the alcohols, fragrances etc. in off the shelf deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am a nature gal at heart, I don&#x27;t want to smell like the wildlife when I&#x27;m in the office. I&#x27;ve tried the crystal, vinegar/baking soda and other inconvenient home made deodorants and been disappointed and somewhat stinky. The Deodo-Mom roll on is great. It is gentle on my super sensitive skin, does what it says and there isn&#x27;t even a white mark on my clothes when I apply liberally (is there any other way?) --at  the end of the day I may smell a little bit human, but I sure don&#x27;t stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the dog is disappointed that I am less smelly, thanks to DeodoMom there is one less thing for me to worry about in elevators and when sitting next to the boss. DeodoMom is really hypoallergenic and really works!</li>
            <li> I refuse to use anti-perspirant or chemical deodorants. Most natural ones just don&#x27;t work unless you sit at a desk in a climate-controlled office all day (in which case you really don&#x27;t need deodorant anyway!). The stones and deodorant crystal sprays stopped working for me and seemed to make things worse. This has been effective. I fly a lot, so I put it into a plastic zippy bag just in case it should leak, but it hasn&#x27;t leaked yet. Just a dab works and it&#x27;s been the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve used, even better than chemical deodorants/anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> I found the roll-on to be very effective and I did not have any reactions to it even though I am very sensitive</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant - it works so well and I love that it has minimal ingredients. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or minimal deodorants and none work as good as this one does at keeping me smelly-free and not too sweaty. I&#x27;d totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Like most folks, I decided to try this product because I react badly to most commercial deodorants. I&#x27;ve been using crystal deodorant for a while, but it&#x27;s not as effective as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DeodoMom is definitely effective. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months in summer weather, and unless I really work out, DeodoMom does the job for about 30 hours without reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this is *not* an antiperspirant. For me, that&#x27;s a plus, but I know not everyone agrees!</li>
            <li> Wow, after 70 plus years I finally found a deodorant that I can use without worrying about an allergic reaction. This product is also sold in a jar, don&#x27;t buy it. The roll on is definitely the way to go. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and so far I have no irritation and very little odor after a long day at work. While it is a bit pricey, hopefully the health benefits are worth it in the long run!</li>
            <li> I will never use another antiperspirant again!  I&#x27;m a large guy, 6&#x27;2&amp;#34;, 190 lbs and I sweat a lot!  Just ask my wife.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find that DeodoMom keeps me dry throughout the day and does so without any aluminum!  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about name brand antiperspirants giving me alzheimer&#x27;s or cancer someday!  I already ordered my second and third roll-on&#x27;s just a few minutes ago.</li>
            <li> Some odor detected throughout the day, but overall no complaints considering its non toxic</li>
            <li> Great product.  Nothing fancy, yet does the job exceptionably well.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Being tired of stained blouses and worried about the chemicals in deodorants, I did some research and found DeodoMom roll on. It has been wonderful. It has kept me drier than what I had used for years. I will be using this product exclusively.</li>
            <li> I was recently tested for heavy metal poisoning and the results came back that I had life-threatening amounts of aluminum in me. Along with chelation treatments, I have eliminated aluminum from the food and products I use. I&#x27;ve tried several different deodorants with varying results. This product does the job. On days when I am more active, I have to apply 2-3 times, but most days I only need to apply once. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave stains on my clothes. I recommend it to anyone looking for an aluminum-free deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. It&#x27;s clean and odorless and, for me, really works (but I must say, I&#x27;m NOT a heavy sweater). I do have to apply it on clean skin (unlike mainstream deodorants, which you can apply over B.O. and they still work, thanks to all the nasty chemicals!). But it&#x27;s all worth it, knowing I&#x27;m not poisoning myself. Also, it comes labeled with your first name, which really cracks me up. I won&#x27;t be switching deodorants in the foreseeable future, which is nice to have found a product I like enough to stick with.</li>
            <li> I tried Tom&#x27;s brand and other deodorants that were not antiperspirants that were sold in stores. Many irritated my skin or just didn&#x27;t help well with underarm smell. This one works so well! The roller applicator makes it much easier to apply than the cream version. I will keep buying this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I started using it because the typical deodorant/antiperspirants were giving me a rash, and discoloring my shirts (I assume from the Aluminum).  However, even with &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorants, my armpits were still soggy by the end of the day.  Not so with DeodoMom.  I&#x27;ve found that I actually sweat less, and my shirts are no longer discolored.  There is absolutely no fragrance (awesome for those who are sensitive to chemical fragrance), and hardly any residue.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. No stinking from this old man. The people that make it are mom and pop and are the nicest people. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with horrible irritation under my arms for several years--awful, large red bumps that were painful and very embarrassing to the point that I would not wear sleeveless tops.  I tried many different deodorants from over the counter to very expensive natural deodorants and even some from makeup counters and Sephora.  I was still having the bad reaction and irritation no matter what I tried.  After becoming pregnant, I just happened to see this product on Amazon while looking at other pregnancy products and I decided to give it a try.  I have been very pleased with this deodorant and the irritation under my arms was completely gone within one week of using DeodoMom!  I am at the end of my pregnancy, but will continue to use this product as long as it is made, which is hopefully forever!  My under arms are happy and it is so nice to finally not have to deal with the awful red bumps!  This is not an antiperspirant, so you will sweat, but I have never had body odor while using this and I live in a very hot and humid climate.  Hope this helps if you are on the fence about trying it!</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have found.  Works fairly well unless its really humid out! Much better than toms.</li>
            <li> I am expecting, and wondered, is my deodorant safe?  Turns out, I was using an antiperspirant that it did contain aluminum, which could be harmful. The research is inconclusive, but I wanted to be safe, so I decided to try out DeodoMom and am pleasantly surprised.  No odor and easy to use.  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I was very intrigued by the positive reviews and decided to give deodomom a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I tend to sweat more than most and I live in Florida.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying this product, however, in our &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; so the heat can&#x27;t really be a factor.&lt;br /&gt;The product is fine for if I have a day off and am puttering around the house. Works perfectly and not even a hint of odor.&lt;br /&gt;If I expend any effort at all - my five minute walk in to work or even a very gentle non-heated yoga class- I can smell myself .Really disappointed. I suppose I&#x27;m just one of those people with a body chemistry that just doesn&#x27;t jive well with deodomom. But I&#x27;ll keep it around for those (too few) relaxing days at home.</li>
            <li> I did not care for DodoMom Roll-on, was sticky and does not control body odor...I gave it to my 11 year old daughter, it didn&#x27;t work for her either!</li>
            <li> no smell means no fragrance which means no chemicals!  works well I will reorder again. thank you for great product.  I am not sure how I cam across this product but am super glad that I did. I will recommend this one to my friends as a natural way to prevent order with out all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several aluminum free deoderants and was starting to lose hope, but then I came across deodomom and am so happy I did because t really works!</li>
            <li> It obviously doesn&#x27;t compare to regular anti-perspirants, which are really not safe if you look at the ingredients and what their effects on the human body are.&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant does not make my sensitive skin react, and most of all, I&#x27;m pregnant and it&#x27;s safe for me and my baby.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no smell to it, so it also doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies, and it does do the job- I don&#x27;t smell that yucky preggo B.O.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I really have is that it does leave a little white residue. Overall, a good product and I&#x27;m going back for more!</li>
            <li> I really do love this product!  I have a hard time finding a deodorant that does not make me burn, itch or make me smell.  I did read the reviews and do wash each morning before reapplying and it really works beautifully.  The company went beyond customer service when they shipped the product later to avoid freezing it due to the cold weather we were having.  It came a few days later in between storms.  I am going to order much more from this company! 2016 up date.  After writing the above review 2 years ago I still use this product and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.   I just love it and recommend it highly.  No burning, no itching, no smell just the knowing that your deodorant is doing what it is suppose without added chemicals you don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> Such a great product!  And it works!!! Tried so many different natural Deodorant and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;ve tried just about all the natural deodorants I could get my hands on. By the end of the day I&#x27;d end up stinky, or with brown underarms after a few weeks of use (thanks Tom&#x27;s). I ordered this with skepticism, although I&#x27;ve learned that Amazon reviews are generally pretty spot on. For the first week I used this with a layer of Arm &amp; Hammer natural deodorant, as I work in a professional office and really don&#x27;t want to be the smelly woman. By the time I went to bed, I was a little stinky. So over the weekend I gave it a go solo, and it worked! For the past week I&#x27;ve gone with only DeodoMom and I still smell fine the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a liquid, so it takes a little while to dry after I roll it on. I definitely over apply, I get the white haze, but its not that noticeable. There is just no smell. At all. No perfumey cover-up, no weird salt/mineral odor, just skin. Its great! I work a fairly low stress, not physically demanding job, so I can&#x27;t rate its effectiveness for people who sweat a lot. But for the basic office worker with a balanced diet (I&#x27;m a meat eater), it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty basic, but who cares. Mine came with a label of my name printed on it, which I thought was a cute touch. I&#x27;ll update if it stops working for me, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 8/16/13 -----------&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I used this for about two weeks, and it started to become less and less effective. It would work for about 4 hours and then I could start to smell b/o. I doubt anyone else noticed, but it did make me pretty self-conscious at work. I&#x27;m not particularly active at work, but for some reason it lost its effectiveness. I&#x27;ll still use this on the weekends, and I&#x27;ll probably give it a try for work again in the winter, but I&#x27;ve gone back to my previous deodorant. Really bummed, I wanted this to work for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used that actually works. It completely blocks odors. It works so well that my husband has started using it too. He works 12 hour shifts as an acute care nurse, I&#x27;m chasing a toddler around all day. We live in a hot city. If it can keep us dry and not smelly, it can work for anyone!</li>
            <li> It works great, keeps me dry and smell free.  And I like that there are not harsh chemicals in it.  The package labeling could use to be bigger as my 40+ year old eyes had trouble reading the ingredients on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I smelled like B.O., as if I used nothing at all. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I react terribly to every deodorant I have tried, even natural ones and products for sensitive skin. I even react to pure coconut oil. Deodomom is the only thing I can use without getting a rash! It works pretty well, although I am not a heavy sweater. Some reviewers have said it leaves marks on their clothes, but I have not had this problem, even with black. Don&#x27;t use too much ( a little goes a long way) and give it a second to dry before putting on your top. I love that this is a true \\&quot;mom and pop\\&quot; type product. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars from me is that it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago, I made the switch to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; deodorants. I tried two very popular brands, which I liked, but the baking soda in those products irritated my skin. I began searching for a baking soda free deodorant and (after a few major fails) found DeodoMom. I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance on this. I use this everyday and have no issues - even when I work out. Of course, like all natural deodorants, this d.o. will not prevent wetness, but it does an excellent job keeping smells at bay and helping me feel fresh. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I order this for my husband who has a contact allergy to ingredients in regular deodorant.  He loves the results this product delivers and the fact that it really works is evidenced to me by his requests for me to keep on reordering it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this one, i really did. it came with a cute label with my name and a smiley face on it - and it&#x27;s all natural. and I really need a deod. that works!! but this one didn&#x27;t do it for me. I would put it on, let it dry, and an hour or two later when I was going about my day in my own house (not doing much active), it was like I had nothing on. if anything it seemed to make me smell more strongly! weird. this just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Aug 2017: still using this product is as effective as i first time said it is.&lt;br /&gt;May, 2014: I am one of those who sweats earlier than most others and cannot wear a shirt 2nd time without washing. I have tried quite a few deodorants but none works as well as they claim. This is the best product I have ever used. Advantages,&lt;br /&gt;- Natural&lt;br /&gt;- 24hr+ protection (I never thought that was possible)&lt;br /&gt;- No marks on clothing&lt;br /&gt;- No white marks on underarms (if u dry it well and apply optimum qty)&lt;br /&gt;- You can also make it at home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages&lt;br /&gt;- None that I can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search for the best deodorant ends here.</li>
            <li> Pretty good all natural.  My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I kcontinue to re-order this product through Amazon.  It works very well, and living in Florida, I have plenty of chance to challenge it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well for me when I apply twice a day. Wish it stopped sweating too, but does keep the stink away.</li>
            <li> Well-packaged and easy to use. Dries reasonably quickly and IT WORKS!  I sometimes put on more when I go out dancing at night (just to be sure), but I&#x27;ve never noticed any embarrassing odor problems since I started using it.  Don&#x27;t know how it works, but don&#x27;t have to. Now have a second bottle and will keep using it -- best I can say for anything.</li>
            <li> Deodomom works as advertised.  Lasts for 12 hours, and doesn&#x27;t leave stains in my clothes.  I definitely will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant after getting fed up with drugstore offerings that had toxic ingredients, very plasticky containers, and a tendency to leave white residue/crumbles. The results I&#x27;ve found are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- In terms of blocking odors, this deodorant works as well for me as did drugstore deodorants, which is impressive given that it has just two ingredients (water and magnesium hydroxide). Still, I need to reapply at the end of the workday or before exercising&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The container is recyclable, which is a big plus to me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- White residue and ruboff on black clothes is lessened but still present, especially after more than one or two rolls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No scent whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Room for improvement but still worth the money; I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I just love this deodorant!  My daughter introduced me to this product when she was preganent.  I was using Arm and Hammer natural deodorant and Toms of Maine at the time.  Both of these required reapplication after my Pilates workouts.  Ever since I started using DeodoMom there is no need to reapply.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried deodomom as my first experiment (used it for a month) with natural/organic deodorants and the only good thing that I liked about it was that it really cleared up my armpits and they didn&#x27;t look dark anymore but I would smell after an hour of applying it. I searched again and gave truly&#x27;s deodorant a try, I loved it at first because I would only have to reapply once or twice and I would be stink free, and it kept my underarms light as well, but after the 4th day it gave me a really bad rash and my pits were super irritated. I decided to keep using it for 3 weeks as I thought my pits were probably getting used to the change but nope, it just kept getting worse to the point were moving my arms burned so I had to stop using it. So then again I searched and saw that green tidings natural deodorant had good reviews and I purchased the lavender one first, honestly I hated the smell, it was too strong for me but then again others might like it, it didn&#x27;t irritate me but after a couple of hours I would smell like sweat mixed with lavender oil (and I don&#x27;t sweat much, I sweat normal) so I stopped using it because I smelled funky and I was pretty embarrassed. I went back to truly&#x27;s deodorant to see if maybe the irritation wouldn&#x27;t  come back but it did. Then, finally, I remembered seeing an unscented version of the green tidings deodorant and in desperation to find the perfect natural deodorant I decided to give this one a try, and I am soooo happy and glad I did. The unscented version is waaaaaaaaaay better, honestly in my opinion and experience you should buy it. It lasts all day, even til the next day so there&#x27;s no need to reapply throughout the day. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks now and I&#x27;m still loving it. I have worked out with it on and even then I still don&#x27;t smell after, no kidding! I also like that I can apply it like a regular deodorant. It also does not irritate my skin at all and my underarms are still light, yayyyy! So there you go, it&#x27;s awesome, it works, and therefore I really recommend the Unscented Green Tidings Deodorant. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it, you get what you paid for. And trust me I know how difficult it is looking for a natural deodorant that actually works, you should definitely just go for it and give it a try. (:</li>
            <li> Was so glad to find something without aluminum.  The unscented is the best part, and it works. Highly recommend.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this deodorant is the purity of the ingredients. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a huge list and feel better putting it on than I ever did using traditional anti-perspirant, etc. However, I have found that it&#x27;s kind of a hit and a miss. Some days it seems like it works great and other days it&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t put anything on at all. I&#x27;m following the instructions and not quite sure what I can do differently - I use the roll-on and I would like to try the jar to see if it&#x27;s any different. Maybe I&#x27;m just one of those people who don&#x27;t have the greatest success with it!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. I have tried the ff fragrance free: dove, degree, toms, and secret. All have irritated my skin. This product is by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used that did not leave any rash/bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten into the natural deodorant product range because I always felt they didn&#x27;t work. Now that I&#x27;m pregnant, I need to be careful about the products I put on my skin. I researched and found DeodoMom and figured I would give it a try. I am very pleased with its effectiveness. I was afraid I would start to smell partway through the day, but there is absolutely no odor! It doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry (some of the reviews made it seem like it would be ages), and I stay dry through most of the day. I highly recommend this deodorant to expectant mothers or anyone else who is concerned about the effects of chemicals on our bodies.</li>
            <li> Works great weird how it works so good no oder, just what I was hopping for yup great produce. No stain either.</li>
            <li> thought it was great having a natural deodorant. worked OK for a few days before rashes started breaking out. And had to reapply multiple times a day as it does not stop the odor well</li>
            <li> DeodoMom roll-on is an excellent product. After trying so many different natural deodorants,from amazon to sephora,I finally found the one i like and it works. And when I say it works.....it works. Even afret a hard core workout,there is no BO.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone whos trying to be BO and aluminum free!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like that this product has natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants and they all come up short or the smell bothers me. I found an article about DeodoMom and how there are only two ingredients which really appealed to me. When I found out I could buy this product through Amazon I decided to give it a try. It is oderless which I love. This is by far the best natural deodorant I have tried so far. It does the trick and keeps me oderfree through the work day. If you workout it might start to wear off but honestly the peace of mind of knowing that there is nothing harmful in this product far outweighs any minor inconvience of re-applying after a workout or a stressful day.  I recommend this for anyone looking for a safe alternative to antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to rid my body - and home - of crap &amp; chemicals.  This is the first natural deodorant I have tried, and it has been wonderful.  I carried it in my purse with me the first two weeks, in case I needed to reapply, and I didn&#x27;t!  Even outside in 80+ degree sunny weather, this wonderful deodorant held up and did it&#x27;s job.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this - I am hooked!</li>
            <li> When I first switched to using natural deodorants I tried about 10 different ones, and none worked. I had almost given up until I came across this one. The reviews seemed quite good so I thought, &amp;#34;I may as well try one more&amp;#34;. I am so happy I took a chance and tried this out. Now i am not saying that this prevents sweating, because it does not, you need an antiperspirant if you are looking for that BUT I do go all day not smelling. I was beyond shocked when I came home after a 12hr work day and my underarms had no smell whatsoever. No other natural deodorant I found so far can do that. I initially bought the jar version of this deodorant but I found it annoying to have to use my hands to apply it, so boy was I happy to find the roll on version!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect since I have never used a natural deodorant before - but I am SO PLEASED!! I don&#x27;t really have a strong body odor to begin with, which is maybe why it works so well for me. I live in Florida so I am constantly in 90 degree weather and it still lasts all day. I may have a tiny bit of odor by the very end of the day, but not enough for anyone else around me to notice. It is so worth the price and it feels good to know that my porous armpits are not being fed aluminum zirconium and other harsh chemicals. I definitely recommend this for anyone, and even more so for people who do not have strong body odor issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be purchasing this for years to come! I recommend Deodomom to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant it really works!!!! It held up to the hot Florida humidity,all while I was pregnant.They even put your name on the bottle...it&#x27;s Organic and great!!!</li>
            <li> This worked well during the winter/ spring months. Once summer came it didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Have become increasingly concerned about deodorants containing aluminum. Could not find a deodorant for women without it at retail stores. Threw away every \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant I tried because they did not work. Resorted to using my husband&#x27;s deodorant (not antiperspirant) but didn&#x27;t want to smell like him. Found this product by accident on-line. Got a $2 sample and was enormously impressed. I live in New Mexico with 100+ degree heat and I exercise outdoors and THIS WORKS. Sometimes I smell by the next day without a shower or reapplying (like when I get up in the morning and hike--then I can sometimes smell some BO but it was the same with regular deodorants). The generous size of the sample allowed me to try for several weeks (and it is still not empty) before I decided to purchase the full-size. I use the roll-on because it&#x27;s convenient. Dries fast and I have not noticed any residue on anything. Even though it&#x27;s not supposed to be antiperspirant I am not noticing wetness most of the time. I am simply amazed! Love the ingredients, love the product! Cannot recommend highly enough.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on natural deodorants, including ingredients to make my own. Nothing worked. Nothing!! One very popular brand made me smell like I had rubbed raw onions on my armpits within 10 minutes of applying it. One made me break out in this horrible rash that left my armpits scarred and angry for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works very well for me and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. It isn&#x27;t flawless, and sometimes I have to wash again and reapply later... but it&#x27;s so much better for me than anything else. It says it lasts 3 months with typical usage. I think I&#x27;ve used it more than typical and I&#x27;m almost at 3 months and still have some left. I know people commented that it can leave a white mark on your skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t care if it made my armpits blue as long as it works! I will definitely be buying this again. And again. I am so happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others because I develop underarm rashes. This product is my favorite. The only change I had to make was getting used to using a roll on rather than a stick; totally worth it! Do not hesitate to try this great product.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. Within a few hours of using it, I began to smell. I sweat quite a bit, but was hopeful this would work.</li>
            <li> really, it works!  Great customer service as well</li>
            <li> I have lots of neck, shoulder and arm pain.  This has diminished since I started using a deodorant without aluminum!  I tried several products from other companies, but they were not effective antipersperants.  I am on my third bottle of DeodoMom and love it.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I live a very active lifestyle, and with constant transitioning from suit and tie to a workout wear and casual clothes... one would assume I use this deodorant multiple times a day, But, I don&#x27;t have to. Usually unless I take a long shower I don&#x27;t reapply, and it Always keeps me from smelling bad at my meetings and also at work, and even when I play soccer or workout (which is a Lot of sweating and cardio). So bottom line, I LOVE it. Yes I&#x27;m not a mother, nor will I ever be one as I&#x27;m a man but I appreciate products that are actually all natural as that was how my mother raised me, and as hard as I looked, I didn&#x27;t find a natural deodorant that actually worked until I found DeodoMom. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, and for all who are skeptical, (as I was at first) I suggest at least giving it a shot. It may be the permanent fix! It is for me, as long as I have it with me :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural deodorants, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  Many of the others don&#x27;t work, are really &#x27;wet&#x27;, or smell really funky.  This one doesn&#x27;t smell and it dries very quickly.  I do feel like I have to apply it a few times a day for it to work well, but at least it does.  It doesn&#x27;t have a fun smell, no smell at all really, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the harmful chemicals in.  The seller was great and very personal as well.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter just started using this. Only used it 3 or 4 days then today I noticed she had hives on her neck, arms, face &amp; torso and then later that day she had diarrhea. I asked her if she ate or put anything new on. She said no, the only new thing was this deodorant. She is still using the same hair/face products and ate nothing new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up the ingredient Magnesium Hydroxide which is in the product. It said it generally is safe but some can have an allergic reaction to it, hives &amp; diarrhea were listed as some of the signs. So I had her wash it off and take some antihistamine pills. I guess she is one of the few people. :(</li>
            <li> It works!  it kept me ordorless through high intensity workouts as well as a daily basis.  Other natural deordorants left me with a weird smell at the end of the day especially if I wore certain fabrics....very weird.  But this deordoarnt really works!</li>
            <li> If you are concerned on the widely used aluminum anti perspirant, try this great product as it stops odor and doesn&#x27;t create problems by blocking your toxins release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 19 August 2013&lt;br /&gt;After buying several products from Deodomom, I like how they send my deodorant personalised with my name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife started using this as her TOMS gave her broken skin, and this deodorant was gentle and it works. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This year I made a commitment to purchase safer, more natural personal care products.  But deodorant was one of the only items I was unsure about. I tried a number of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum or questionable chemicals like BHT.  NONE of them really worked, especially since we are used to stronger products.  I did find one that was sold on Amazon that was better than the others, but it didn&#x27;t last all day, and I would forget to bring it to work... Needless to say, I&#x27;m surprised my co-workers didn&#x27;t flee the area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read a glowing recommendation on Amazon about DeodoMom and thought, why not give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now, and I wanted to wait until I was sure that it would work all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say, I&#x27;ve finally found a natural deodorant that ACTUALLY WORKS!  All day.  In the summer.  In Texas.  And this roll-on does live up to its claim of not leaving behind a residue, which was always a problem with chemical deodorants.  I am telling all my friends about it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  My teenage daughter has many allergies, and we&#x27;ve had trouble finding a natural deodorant that is non-allergenic and effective.  She&#x27;s had reactions to other natural products, so this was a great find.  Expensive, but it seems to be lasting a long time.  Nice communication from the seller as well.</li>
            <li> We have two preteens and they needed some deodorant (:)  our preference was to use something with as few chemicals as possible.  after trying several other brands i stumbled upon this product and have to say it works great (we have the roll on).  i am a heavy stinky sweater and was thrilled to find this deodorant works for me as well.  hubby has sensitive underarms and many brands irritate him but not this one.  so i am so pleased to have one brand that meets everyone&#x27;s needs!  i recommend this deodorant to my friends.  great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago, along with other 2 natural deodorants (\\&quot;takes whiff\\&quot; being one of them). This is one is the only one that worked well. I always used strong deodorants, which had a ton of aluminum and other harmful chemicals.  Realizing how much it&#x27;s hurtful for me, I started looking for a natural deodorant. This is perfect. Considering the fact that even the strongest deodorants stopped working well on me, this one is literally a life saver. No matter if I&#x27;m on the sun, or stressed out, or running around all day, sometimes I only apply it in the morning, and it works well all day. I check throughout the day if I need to reapply, and I almost never need to. I know, I get surprised myself, every day.  If I would recommend a natural deodorant to anyone, I would definitely go with this one. But then again, there are different skin types and such... A few tips/heads up: at first you might get used to the smell, as it only contains two ingredients, and no scents. After a few days, your body gets used to it, and there is absolutely no smell. This thing is unscented. Which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;And another thing.. Sometimes after I reapply, I start smelling my BO, and I&#x27;ve noticed that many times it&#x27;s better not to reapply at all, if there is no need. I don&#x27;t know why, maybe its chemical structure gets messed up. But if you don&#x27;t smell anything and you&#x27;re fine, don&#x27;t reapply. It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Left me stinky.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teen daughter who develops rashes to anything but the Crystal products.  She was looking for something that worked like the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; product for sweating and body odors.  I think she may be asking to much for any natural product. My daughter reports that this product works about the same as the Crystal and hasn&#x27;t made her skin sticky.  Personally I think it works better then the other based on the way she smells (or lack of smell) at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I would rate this above 5 if I could...I have a hormone disorder so I have had to make big changes with what I put on my skin.  I started using natural deoderant among all my other personal care products to remove the preservatives and synthetic hormone disruptors from my system around 6 years ago, changing to a new brand each time a deoderant ran out because I never found one that worked.  I carried my deoderant in my purse that entire time because I sweat ALOT.  Then I ordered this reading through different websites and reviews.  FINALLY!!!  I found a product that is iron clad.  I have been using this only about 1 week but have not stunk during this time and I have liberated myself from carrying my deodedant and interrupting my day to reapply it.  This to me is the best product I have discovered in a long time.</li>
            <li> It works.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s consistent. I was shocked.  I have always struggled with sweating and used the harsh aluminum roll-on treatments to stop sweating.  Plus regular deodorant (Secret, Dove, Degree, etc.). I still struggled with smell--and it wasn&#x27;t necessarily body odor.  It was the aluminum that was built up in my pores.  It smelled like old deodorant. I would shower and be shocked at how much old residue would build up.  I just didn&#x27;t like it on my skin.  Trust me, run your fingers over your armpit after you&#x27;ve washed with soap, you&#x27;ll feel dry areas. Rub them and you&#x27;ll have old aluminum residue come off.&lt;br /&gt;Deodomom worked from the first use. I tested it harshly--first day was yardwork and second day was dancing at a wedding.  I not only did not smell but I was surprisingly dry.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love it and you&#x27;ll be surprised.  I am so thankful to have found this product. It has inspired me to try other natural beauty routines!</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I ever used.  Keeps me dry, and no perfume smell.&lt;br /&gt;No ingredients that would be of harm.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is amazing people still buy deodorant with aluminum and other potentially harmful ingredients. I recently picked up an order of 5 different types of deodorants, all natural, and so far 2 of them are almost as strong as the generic store bought, chemical brands. DeodoMom is one of the best. Highly recommend it for no smell and piece of mind.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product after reading quite a few good reviews. I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone! I used it for 3 days no problem. On the fourth day my husband says &amp;#34;I smell armpit!&amp;#34; :( I hadn&#x27;t even done anything to make me sweat that day either. I tried it a few more days when I was just at home and by the middle of the day I always reeked! So back to aluminum deodorant I go. I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people use it for a couple days and then it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I guess maybe some bodies get immune to it...?</li>
            <li> 1. it works, 2. it&#x27;s odorless, 3. no rash/reactions. enough said!</li>
            <li> Yep, it seriously works!  Absolutely NO scent to it at all.  It is water and magnesium only.  Come to think of it I could just use my spray bottle of magnesium oil (it does dry but leaves a white mark) that I got from the health food/vitamin store but I think this is nicer for the arm pits.  The magnesium oil spray is for muscle pain and also for a massage oil.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that has ever worked for me. I get about 8-10 hours of odor protection</li>
            <li> When they changed the formula of a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; unscented deodorant I had been using for nearly 20 years, I was forced to forage for a replacement. I quickly learned the hard way that &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean I won&#x27;t have a negative reaction. After dozens of products--some worked beautifully for weeks and THEN I started itching like crazy--and thousands of dollars for patch testing, I&#x27;ve learned that I have more contact allergies than most people. Fragrance is an issue, and propylene glycol is a big one (it&#x27;s in EVERYTHING). I have been using DeodoMom for two months now and am happy to say I have found my new staple. It doesn&#x27;t run (like Cleure&#x27;s), it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance (which can irritate my skin or make me smell like something I don&#x27;t like), AND it does a great job of keeping the stink at bay! Yes, I probably put on too much and it leaves a white residue on my black t-shirts, but I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s worth it! I wish the label was printed differently--the logo completely washed off the bottle and so it&#x27;s unmarked. So glad it comes in a bottle small enough for travel. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this stuff. I&#x27;ve even turned my dermatologist on to it so she can recommend it to her patients.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work. At all. Unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  Sticky, messy.</li>
            <li> So excited to finally find a natural deodorant that works! I&#x27;ve tried the roll on and although takes a few seconds to dry, it&#x27;s worth it.  Will definitely be ordering from now on.... Wish they sold this product thru Trader Joes or Sprouts so that it would be easier to pick up as needed.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. My armpits smelled &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; within a few hours  minus any rigorous activities. I do not know why there are so many 5-star reviews. It was as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any deodorant.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it works so well.  Not a big roll-on fan, but this stuff does a great job - no stains either.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this to me and thought I would give it a try.  It doesn&#x27;t keep me as dry as what I was used to, but does control any odor that might develop.  I really love knowing that it is a very healthy product to use, and I will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Leaves white residue but that is noted prior to purchase.  Works well,  better than I expected.  Smell is interesting though once applief.</li>
            <li> Two ingredients....simple. I like that. Made in the USA by a husband and wife team. I like that even more. I go out of my way to buy things made in the USA. My body has gotten overly sensitive to things that I put on it and in it. Rightfully so. Everything is made with chemicals any more. I happened by this on my search for a deodorant that won&#x27;t make my skin and lymph nodes scream. I was skeptical because I work in a hot environment. So far, no odor. Works great for me and my skin is happy. I recommend this for men and women because there is no scent. This allows for you to keep your own personal human being scent and not have your deodorant interfering with any other scents you might choose.    Update 10/21/14: I have been using this for over a month and it still works perfectly. I feel better as well. I gave one to my mother and she loves it. Do yourself a favor and try it. Your health is worth it and supporting a U.S. small business is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product--all natural and fragrance free. I was looking for a deodorant that did not contain aluminum. It is amazing that you can feel the difference. Most anti-perspirants mask or coat your underarms, which is not healthy for any woman.  This glides on, dries quickly and performs well. No funky odors like certain other deodorants that claim not to contain aluminum.  Give it a try. You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Okay Ill admit is I sweat big time and seriously doubted switching to natural deodorant but this stuff works well! I would say just as good if not slightly better than my dove that I used to use. Its not going to keep you from smelling forever obviously but if you want something natural and equal to the quality of your chemical filled deodorant this is the stuff and I did ALOT of research!! What I loved even more is they make a little label with your name and ordering date, I love when small businesses make things feel more personal... I know I will order more when I run out. Oh and whats great is I have the stinkiest 5 year old in the planet and today when he came home smelling like onions I remembered I finally had a deodorant I would use on him!</li>
            <li> Works great. I usually use it in combo with a baking soda deodorant but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a server and NEED to not smell all over my customers. I find that without it, though, my deodorants don&#x27;t last as long. I want to stay natural so I double up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a natural deodorant for a while. Something in the deodorant I used to use started irritating my underarms and my skin became brown and splotchy. Tom&#x27;s was terrible and Kiss My Face still caused a reaction for some reason. Figured with 2 ingredients I couldn&#x27;t really go wrong. Only used it a few times, but works well so far and I think it&#x27;s helping with the brown splotches. Doesn&#x27;t keep you dry, but keeps you from smelling. Held up at the gym. Knocked off a star because it definitely leaves white streaks, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to mark on clothing.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works really well! I have ordered it twice now. It lasts a long time. I have also given some to my friends and will continue to do so. It works so much better than the Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Trader Joes and similar products, though I know they mean well. I highly recommend DeodoMom. I get the roll on to avoid getting the cream product on my fingers. It takes a little time to dry, so only wish it could be made as a solid.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever written a product review but I felt the need to let people know what a great product this is.  I have been trying for years to get away from deodorants containing aluminum, however, I have extremely sensitive skin and have been stuck with one particular aluminum-containing deodorant/antiperspirant that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out in a rash.  I have tried many other products but they either didn&#x27;t work (I sure smelled &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;!) or irritated my skin. I saw DeodoMom mentioned on another product review and decided to give it a try. I have been using it for about two months and wish I had known about it sooner!  It doesn&#x27;t give me a sticky feeling during the day or irritate my skin and it really works - I have not had any problems with odor since I made the switch.  I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone to give it a try!  It does come in a roll on or cream and I do prefer the cream as it seems to go on a little better, although, the roll on is probably more convenient to take along when traveling.</li>
            <li> Through the years I have tried all of the major natural brands, from solid rock salts to products with lavender and calendula.  I live in Hawaii where is can get pretty humid and 87 degrees.  I have not had ANY under arm oder since I first started using this product.  I purchased my first order end of August and have probably at least another months use in the roll on.  Already ordered and received my second order.  Don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> DeodoMom works too keep my from smelling. I still perspire, but the smell isn&#x27;t as strong. We live in a very hot, humid area year-round. Sometimes it helps to reapply. I feel good knowing that I&#x27;m using an all-natural product during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for literally YEARS, (several years!), for something I don&#x27;t react to that works. I am very satisfied with this product. I normally stink pretty bad after a day&#x27;s work and now I am not so bad. I have been using the mineral salt rock for a couple of years because it&#x27;s the only thing that had any effect so far, but it really didn&#x27;t do much. I have tried maybe 15 different kinds of deodorants that make my underarms itch like crazy or don&#x27;t do a thing. I gave up on commercial brands a long time ago; started at the health food store and spent a fortune on stuff that I just threw away. I am using the roll-on and am very happy. No smell that makes me sick either! Love it! Quick delivery as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1 year later. Still working well for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s been a few years now since I&#x27;ve been using this and I still give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an Aluminum-free deodorant and I bought this one along with 2 other brands, DeodoMom proved to be the best, it is efficient all day long, even with more strenuous activities and has the advantage of being unscented, so you can wear the perfume you want. Plus it lasts long - I am using the roll on. I recommended it to many of my friends and they are happy with it. As long as it is on the market, I will keep reordering it.</li>
            <li> 35 yr old male looking into healthy alternatives for my products....this is the first natural deodorant that has really worked for me...Note:  you need to massage/rub in the lotion/cream so that it&#x27;s gets on the skin (if you have arm hair)</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from sweating excessively since my teenage years. I always had to buy the strongest antiperspirants, also prescription. Now that I am pregnant I wanted something without harsh chemicals. I tried mineral deodorant &amp;#34;Crystal Essence&amp;#34; lavender and white tea, which did not help me at all. After seeing many positive reviews of &#x27;DeodoMom&amp;#34;, I decided to try it out. Thumbs up for concealing the odor! I only use it when I go out or when I work. The odor is not there. Even though it does not completely keep my underarms dry, it seems to work even better than some of the strongest antiperspirants I used in the past. Besides it does not leave yellow residue on my shirts. Great product, will buy again!</li>
            <li> The best natural deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried them all--NOW, Lavanilla, Lavalin, Truly, Schmidt&#x27;s, Lush--this one is the only that is both non-messy and super effective. Schmidts is also highly effective, but a pain to put on. Same thing with Truly&#x27;s. DeodoMom doesn&#x27;t burn if you put in on after a shower, doesn&#x27;t have any smell, and works for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for an all-natural deoderant for my 10 yr old daughter, who started having underarm odor when she was 6.  We tried crystal and other deoderants made for kids, but they didn&#x27;t work consistently for her.  I was reluctant to use an adult deoderant on her, and though I was skeptical that this would do the job, decided to give it a try.  She&#x27;s been using DeodoMom for about 2 months now, and it&#x27;s been wonderful.  She only needs to apply in the morning before getting dressed, and then again at night after she showers, and she stays odor-free all day.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I gave it a try and this deodorant worked perfectly. It neutralizes body odor all day, and I add my own cologne.</li>
            <li> This does work! It is so great to find a natural, safe deodorant that really works. I loved that the deodorant came with a label on it with my name... a very nice personal touch. Like my bottle was prepared just for me.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would work a lot better but it rubs off really quickly and and I constantly have to reapply. I will continue searching for a natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> Order arrived prompt and as promised, good vendor.  More important my poor pits have been getting pretty read even with natural and hypoallergenic products.  As I age it seems my tolerance for chemicals and perfumes has waned almost wonder if it is due to years of over exposure building up.  Was hesitant but a little desperate when I ordered DeodoMoM deodorant.  Pleasantly surprised, pits don&#x27;t itch and are not red, assume it is working, no one passes out or anything when I stroll by and wife says I don&#x27;t stink........well that my pits don&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> I have tried other natural deodorants and none compare to DeodoMom.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for years for an effective deodorant. What a miracle! So simple: milk of magnesia and nothing else. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and it works like a champ. It&#x27;s an extra bonus that the skin will absorb the magnesium---something we are all, apparently, deficient in these days. Beats the heck out of aluminum and nasty additives. My friends are loving it as well.</li>
            <li> Very effective...no irritation...</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural deodorant that works for me for a very long time. I&#x27;ve been using it now for almost three months and it works wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About shipping: there was a problem with my initial order and USPS didn&#x27;t deliver my order until almost 4 weeks after I placed my order. 30SomeWeeks.com was very accommodating and sent a replacement after hearing about the delay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to someone who prefers to go with a hypoallergenic deodorant.  I have tried other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; deodorants which have limited ingredients and are aluminum-free.  However, I would unfortunately notice an odor after a few hours of wearing them.  I felt they did not work well after a couple hours or after sweating.  This one, however, I feel does.  I still sweat, as it is not an antiperspirant.  However, I sweat using the clinical strength deodorants too.  Another thing I like about this deodorant is that I feel like my shirts are easier to clean.  Deodorants with aluminum would leave a smell in the underarm area of the shirt which I had a hard time getting rid of when washing.  I do not notice that with DeodoMom. I would (and have) recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, especially since I paid $12 for it.  I gave it a go for about 5 days in a row and tried applying it all different ways.  But, sadly, by the end of the last day, after chasing after my toddler, I smell like a total hobo.  My husband is NOT thrilled.  And I&#x27;m sure if my daughter could say enough words to tell me I stink and go take a shower- she would.</li>
            <li> Great product for a pre-teen: it works!  I also love that it&#x27;s not overloaded with chemicals.</li>
            <li> The best that I have tried and it works! Last a long time too. It&#x27;s been a while since I wrote this review. This deodorant is still the best around. I really am amazed how well it works!  Congrats on making a quality product!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is for the most part the only one I use anymore.  That is saying a lot coming from someone who used to SWEAR she&#x27;d never not use an antiperspirant again.... (I tend to get smelly during that time of the month and when stressed or nervous)--however i think that finally ditching the chemical-laden stuff helped the smell a bit.  This is not magical, but it helps with about 80% of the smell when I do get hot or sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like some of the natural deodorants that are based on coconut oil, baking soda, and other essential oils, but they all turn my shirts yellowish from the oils :(  boo.  So while this one does not make me smell like flowers, i love that it&#x27;s simple and does NOT stain or leave discoloration on my shirts.  Drinking lots of water and eating a lot of raw food really helps, too.  But trust me, I know what it&#x27;s like to have naturally &amp;#34;fragrant&amp;#34; pits.  Good luck and try this super natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it can possibly work with only two ingredients but...IT WORKS!  I have tried several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants.  I had settled for one available at a local chain store and much less expensive but, well, it&#x27;s not very lady like but it didn&#x27;t do what I needed it to.  DeodoMom is a remarkable discovery.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I&#x27;ll most definitely be using this product for as long as the company will make it!!</li>
            <li> Goes on wet - a bit different from other roll ons.  No odor break through after workouts and I like that I&#x27;m not adding metals to my system daily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is legit. Rolls on clear, theres no, &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; scent, you really smell nothing, and it works all day.</li>
            <li> Sorry but this deo did not agree with me.  Caused itching and left a sour smell instead of&lt;br /&gt;masking odors as a deo should. Will not order it again.</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews but let me tell you I was shocked at how well this deodorant works. First of all I am a 35 year old male. I&#x27;ve tried several all natural deodorants and they either smell awful or don&#x27;t last very long (at least for men). I hate yellow stains on my shirts caused by the aluminum from the antiperspirant, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I work out 4 times a week. To test it out I put it on right before my workout, and I asked my trainer to let me know if I smelled bad. No bad armpit smell at all. After two hours of working out I did notice a little bit of the deo wearing off but who cares....if an all natural can hang in there that long I&#x27;m all in. For normal everyday wear it last all day. It seems to do ok for wetness, I only had one issue where I was in a one on one meeting with a really important person in the community and I was nervous at heck and I felt my underarms starting to sweat, but that was the only time I noticed wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weird thing is this has no scent. So don&#x27;t expect to smell like perfumes or flowers, its just an all natural unscented smell. What you don&#x27;t smell is that musty armpit smell. For me it lasted all day, the next morning I could tell it had wore off, but most shower and put new deodorant on daily so no problems there. I can&#x27;t believe this stuff just has two ingredients....why can&#x27;t he big corporations figure this out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it....it works.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product like this for a longggg time! I&#x27;ve tried so many different natural deodorants and they never fully work. I have found that I typically sweat still with natural products. Finally, deodomom was recommended to me and it really works! I&#x27;ve been using it a couple months now and never sweat/smell with it on. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I thought I would never find such a product but deodomom takes care of wetness and odour without all the chemicals and aluminum. It is not messy and it has no scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many natural deodorants and they don&#x27;t hold up for more than a few hours, so eventually I went back to the clinical strength, aluminum-loaded stuff. I saw the reviews for DeodoMom and decided to give natural deodorant one last try...and I&#x27;m so happy I did. This has only one ingredient besides water, so I can&#x27;t fathom how it works so well, but it does! It goes on completely clear and holds up through a 10 hour shift at my active job, a day in the sun, working out, etc, and at the very most I&#x27;ve ended up with a very slight odor by the end of the day (but this happens with regular clinical strength deodorant too). Love it and have been recommending it to all my friends and family :)</li>
            <li> So after reading the wonderful reviews for this product, I decided to try it out despite the ridiculous $12 price. The product arrived quickly and even had a label with my name on it.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have not gotten it to work.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried putting on a thin layer, I have tried putting on a thick layer, I have tried reapplying throughout the day. I&#x27;ve done it right out of the shower, I&#x27;ve done it at waking, and at night before sleeping- each at their own trials, and I even tried days where I did all of the above!!!&lt;br /&gt; I really don&#x27;t understand how to use this product, I&#x27;ve followed all the instructions provided. It&#x27;s in a nice container so it rolls easily onto the skin, but other than that it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I do not sweat excessively, and I only am basing it on daily wear. When it came to being at the gym, it obviously didn&#x27;t hold up there either.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry this product didn&#x27;t work, but even more confused as to all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Please, someone, tell me if I&#x27;m doing something wrong?&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the best aluminium free deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used is my boyfriend&#x27;s Speed Stick....can&#x27;t believe i lost $12 on this :/</li>
            <li> I have tried several aluminum free deodorants in the last month and so far this is the only one that works. I have no idea how it works but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little more inconvenient then my old secret because it goes on wet. I just pop my blow drier under each of my arms for a few seconds and good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly tell you is works as well it better than anti perspiration, without the Aluminum. Yay!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been nagging me forever to stop using over the counter deodorant&#x27;s because of their aluminum ingredient, which is toxic.  I&#x27;m sorry, but in the hot sweaty summer&#x27;s I would have rather had toxicity in my pores than smell like shitake mushrooms marinading over the hudson river.  I have been searching high and low for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; alternative and never came across a product I was happy with....until now.  When I began to breast feed after the birth of my daughter, I began to intensify my search for a toxic free deodorant.  I heard and read there are speculations of certain deo&#x27;s being toxic to the breast milk, no substantial evidence, but I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances.  I ordered a stick of DeodoMom roll-on and the cream.  I was skeptical at best, but to my surprise they both worked great!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  It works for a solid 24 hours and I even gave it a good test run with a hard workout and it works beautifully!!  In fact, works even better than the over the counter stuff which always made me feel like I needed 2 or 3 showers a day, depending on the season.  This product is truly wonderful and they even give it a personal touch with your name on a sticker.  I am recommending this to everyone I know, awesome product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 39 year old male. I shower daily, sometimes twice a day. I probably skew toward someone who is less smelly than others :) I work out daily (and sweat heavily as a result). I share this information because I think it&#x27;s important - if you&#x27;re a particularly smelly person (and you should know this), or you&#x27;re otherwise chemically different than I am, then perhaps this deodorant won&#x27;t work for you. But for me, it&#x27;s great. I ordered the roll-on a couple months ago, and then ordered another one because I finally found something that works. I tried several (4) other natural, aluminum free deodorants. All of them pretty much failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I think finding a good natural deodorant for YOU is simply trial and error. And DeodoMom (I do think they could use a better name!) is absolutely one you should give a try in your pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned above, I buy the roll-on. It rolls on a bit wet, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me much. Bottom line for me: it works.</li>
            <li> I have tried several options looking for an anti-allergic deodorant.  Without any good result.&lt;br /&gt;I just can tell you as simple as it is:  This works.  No allergic reaction at all.  No bad smell also.&lt;br /&gt;You feel a little wet, but no bad smell.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;When they asked me to write a review, I said &amp;#34;no sweat,&amp;#34; because this is a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;It works extremely well unlike other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorents that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin the way other deodorents that I&#x27;ve tried do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, but especially to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to have found DeodoMom&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant. I was pretty skeptical trying it (tried many deodorants that blocked odors but not wetness) but was happy to find that it does work! I use it daily and for normal activity, it works great. Keeps me pretty dry and definitely blocks odors. Under more stressful conditions (like when I&#x27;m nervous), however, I do feel wetness but no odor. That&#x27;s why the 4 star rating...but really, it&#x27;s such an improvement over anything else I&#x27;ve tried, that I&#x27;m very happy with the product. I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying this again. I&#x27;ll be curious to try the cream version, although I wonder if that&#x27;s going to be too messy. Roll-on is great! Thanks for making a great product that is toxin-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve tried two other natural deodorants since I&#x27;ve started using DeodoMom and DeodoMom is much better than the other two. I tried ClayDry and Primal Pit and though both prevent odor, neither of these act as an antiperspirant. The uncomfortable wetness is still there. I found that DeodoMom so far has been the best as both a deodorant and antiperspirant. While in really hot and humid climates, I still sweat and feel wetness, in cooler climates, DeodoMom has worked great for me. The only natural product that I have found so far that has been able to reduce wetness.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!  It does its job, and it does its job well!!  I have tried numerous &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; type deoderants, and this is the first one that completely does its job.  I stay dry and clean smelling all day.  LOVE it, I will be a long time customer!</li>
            <li> We tried several different deodorants for my 9 year old son. He has very sensitive skin, and other products still broke him out. Yet minutes after bathing his arm pits were stinking. Finally we tried DeodoMom. It has worked perfectly! No skin reaction and no odor!</li>
            <li> After trying many natural deodorants, and wasting a ton of money, I have to say that this one is by far the best. I love that there are only two ingredients, and it really does keep me dry and odor free. I finally found my deodorant!</li>
            <li> First of all, the amount you get for the price is simply not justifiable. Since this is a watery liquid it will run out pretty fast and it barely does the job. The dispenser is basically a bottle with a plastic ball stuck on the mouth. As you roll the ball some of the liquid inside will roll onto you. I used this without shaving my armpit and it pinched my hairs constantly since the ball would grab the hairs and trap it into the edges. DO NOT use this if you have longer armpit hairs. Some of the liquid spilled out during shipment and as it gets more empty you need to keep shaking it to get any liquid onto the ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself has hardly any scent and I can&#x27;t tell if it does anything at all. It&#x27;s just very watery and I can&#x27;t notice any smell changes before and after putting it on. If this is the quality of products and cost you have to put up with to avoid the cancer in regular deodorants then I guess I&#x27;ll stick with cancer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant because it was the purest one I could find, composed of only Water and Magnesium Hydroxide (milk of magnesia).  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it, moreso than deodorants I&#x27;ve used previously, even natural ones.  It keeps me dry and odorless all day and there is no underarm irritation. The directions say to use sparingly since not much is needed to do the job. I plan to order it again and can recommend it without reservation. Shipping was fast with no issues.</li>
            <li> Being pregnant, I wanted something safe to use. I&#x27;ve tried Toms of Maine, and although ok for the first hour, one ends up smelling pretty bad. I also tried the crystals, and that worked ok, but not ideal. I&#x27;ve been using DeodoMom now for almost a month, and am very happy with it. Yes, you still sweet, but you are supposed to, and there is very little odor by the end of the day. Now that the summer is here, I will put it to a real test, I do hope I will continue to use this for years to come.</li>
            <li> This seems to keep me pretty dry, as much as a natural deodorant can keep you dry. And I have tried a good number of natural deodorants. But I sweat A LOT, so it does pretty well considering. It does give me a little bit of rash if I shave my armpits and then put it on right away, so I have altered my morning routine a little bit. But my armpits have always been very sensitive because when I was younger I burned them using Drysol. I use this with another natural deodorant that has baking soda, coconut oil, and powdered sugar in it because if I use just this deodorant, I stink a little bit. So I use it in combination with the other deodorant to stay dry and not smelly. My mom tried this and it didn&#x27;t work for her, and my best friend uses a natural deodorant that she buys at the store that I have tried and doesn&#x27;t work for me. So I think when trying to find a natural deodorant, you have to find which works best for your body chemistry - one that works well for one person won&#x27;t necessarily work well for another.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work for me.  :(</li>
            <li> Having decided to live in a more &amp;#34;anti toxin&amp;#34; way, I&#x27;ve changed shampoo, toothpaste and now deodorant.  After reading many reviews and internet research, I decided to try this. It works more in harmony with how the body was intended to work.  It has a simple list of ingredients and, it works.  You need to follow directions of applying on dry skin and to let it dry, which is easy to do as it dries quickly I think.  The customer service is also excellent !  I like the personal touch of it being sealed with a sticker that has your name on it.</li>
            <li> I have finally found not only a natural but a vegan deodorant that works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other reviewers, I have tried several other natural deodorants and they failed miserably. I live in hot weather and would find within a few hours that I would be perspiring, sticky, and smelly. I went onto Amazon one day and think I typed &amp;#34;vegan deodorant&amp;#34; and DeodMom popped up. I read the reviews and figured I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DeodoMom works very well for me. Like natural deodorants, I do perspire a little now and then (and I mean it when I say little). When I do perspire, the deodorant quickly dries. I have even exercised wearing the deodorant and it holds up just as well as commercial products. To date, I have not seen any discoloration on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought DeodoMom for my boyfriend as well, also a long-time searcher for natural deodorants. He is impressed as well, knowing that after years of searching, he too has found a product that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted no two bodies are the same, but there are two enthusiastic thumbs up from this woman and man!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely unsatisfied of that for some reasons: 1) it&#x27;s look like the water there&#x27;s no smell, no color &amp; nothing.&lt;br /&gt;2) there is no information about ingredients or name of brand or complementary info about that.&lt;br /&gt;3) the role bites my armpits when I use it because it&#x27;s not standard</li>
            <li> Unbelievably amazing stuff! Absolutely have to try it for yourself and see if it works for you. Nothing all natural has ever worked for me, but this stuff is on point.</li>
            <li> Best aluminum free deoderant I&#x27;ve found so far.  Yes, I still sweat, but that is only natural, and I feel like this does help me sweat a little less.  The only time I feel I start to smell a little is when I&#x27;ve been sweating a lot.  But even then, this does a pretty good job.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used!! I uses to use the generic brands you buy at stores like dove and suave and clinical strength stuff, heck I even used men&#x27;s clinical strength deodorant( I am not a man, I am a girl) and non of them did what they claimed to do. They did not stop the sweating and didn&#x27;t held its smell. I decided to switch to natural deodorant because my armpits had become so sensitive because of all the chemicals that I put on them. I also tried all kinds of natural stuff like eo deodorant spray, arm and hammer natural deo, toms natural deo, lush coco deo, plain baking soda, and just plain coconut oil. With all of them I smelled so bad afterwards. While researching some more on amazon after my failed attempts with other deos, I came across this stuff. It is AMAZING!!! It does not stop the sweating, which it is not supposed to do, because sweating is actually good for you( I now know this after slathering my pits with chemicals for years). It does however have no smell and keeps the smell at bay. I can go through school and soccer practice and still not smell anything at all!! Even if you do start stinking, you just put a little more deo on and the smell goes away! Amazing!!! I highly recommend this. It does leave a white haze if you put too much, but you can just rub that in.</li>
            <li> This roll on deodorant is chemical-free, scentless, easy to apply, &amp; hasn&#x27;t left any residue on my clothes. I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to try a safe hypoallergenic product.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth.  I hate the idea of plugging my pores with aluminum but I also really don&#x27;t want to smell like some granola-eating hipee.  This deodorant provides a nice compromise, especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant.  Although it doesn&#x27;t provide the same protection/coverage as my name-brand clinical strength deodorant, this stuff seems to work well enough, and definitely better than Tom&#x27;s and all the other store brand natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;d say it has about a 6 hour life and then starts to fade.  I&#x27;m definitely ripe and ready for a shower the next morning, but most people probably are regardless of what deodorant they wore the day before!</li>
            <li> Must say I am very surprised how effective this product is. When I received it in the mail, it was leaking and came in a bottle without much of a label. I was worried at first that I&#x27;d made a mistake, but I was proven wrong.  I don&#x27;t have much of an issue with odor or perspiration, but since I&#x27;ve been pregnant, I&#x27;ve been looking for a safer alternative to aluminum. I&#x27;m not someone who goes overboard with trying to keep everything natural and organic, but I have been reading a lot about what products are safe to use while pregnant. I can almost hear my mom saying sarcastically &amp;#34;How did we ever survive before knowing what your generation knows.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s which didn&#x27;t work for me. I &#x27;ve tried Lavanila, which works better than Tom&#x27;s, but it contains Carrageenan which is a possible cancer causing ingredient... What isn&#x27;t though?! Anyway, this product works really well and is something that I can feel comfortable putting on, especially during pregnancy. I don&#x27;t love the rollerball application, but other than that, no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> Today was the big test--first day of using the deodorant. Having tried Tom&#x27;s, a nightmare, I was skeptical. This thing is magic. It works, for me. I applied it in the morning. No sweat. No odor. I am beyond thrilled.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of deodorant, but they always caused a rash, even the ones marked, &amp;quot;hypoallergenic.&amp;quot;  I finally went online and read about DeodoMom.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!  It&#x27;s gentle (my rash is completely gone) but still works, even through a challenging yoga class!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on chemical free, aluminum free, vegan deodorants.  I decided to try DeodoMom after reading about it on a blog.  What appealed to me most was that there are only 2 ingredients in this deodorant (BIG PLUS!).  Also, it comes in both a cream and roll-on, so I had my choice on which to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is completely unscented, which I LOVE.  Most scents give me a headache.  I bought the roll-on.  I shake it, apply a thin layer after my shower, and by the time I&#x27;m done putting on my face lotion (30 seconds, maybe?) it&#x27;s dry.  It has never left any kind of residue on any of my clothing, even when I wear black tops (which is a lot!).  I don&#x27;t notice any body odor and I&#x27;ve put this through MANY workouts during my lunch at work.  I&#x27;ve also asked my co-workers and sons if I smelled (after working out or at the end of the day) and the answer has always been no.  (I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now.)  It keeps me odor-free all day and night.  I&#x27;ve not had any irritation, even using it just after shaving.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have become very pro chemical-free/toxin-free lately.  Finding a deodorant that not only works, but works all day long has been a HUGE accomplishment for me.  I sweat moderately (I&#x27;m not a huge sweat ball), and I do sweat with this since it&#x27;s not an anti-persperant, but it&#x27;s not been a problem for me at all (and mostly I sweat after I work out).  Did I mention that I LOVE that it has absolutely NO SCENT?!?!?  :)  I&#x27;m not pregnant, I&#x27;m just a woman who wants better, more natural products.  However, I wish I would have had this when I was pregnant.  I would have used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone who is looking to reduce the number of chemicals/toxins that we are applying to our bodies.  Like most other people, I blindly applied lotions, anti-persperants, serums, etc. to my body without giving a thought to the toxins that came with those things.  This is a great step and will eliminate a TON of toxins when compared to regular deodorant or anti-persperant.  Try it!  You&#x27;ll like it! :)of toxins when compared to regular deodorant or anti-persperant.  Try it!  You&#x27;ll like it! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use harmful chemical deodorants anymore.  I tried the crystal stick and it worked well but made my armpits break out and itch so bad I could not sleep!  I was dismayed and wondering what to do??  ThenI discovered this product.  Life saver!  It works, it doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, and best of all, does not irritate my skin AT ALL.  HAPPY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks and it completely blocks any odor.  I&#x27;m a little surprised that it works so well.  It is light and goes on easily.  I wish I tried it sooner!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I have to say that I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best friend was diagnosed with breast cancer a little over a year ago, and it has influenced everyone who knows her.  Her doctors told her that she must use natural deodorant, and I was quick to jump on the bandwagon with her.  I have tried a few different brands, searching for something that actually works.  Some didn&#x27;t work at all.  One, I had to apply every day at noon.  I was willing to sacrifice that annoyance for the preventative measure of not getting breast cancer.  I kept searching though and found this one.  It SERIOUSLY works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shake it and apply in the morning.  I put a bit of it on.  Then I allow it to fully dry, and get dressed.  I live in a warm environment, and I sweat.  This seriously works.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Okay, So I have tried literally every single natural aluminum free deodorant. THIS IS AMAZING. I have school for 7 hours, then dances since 3. I don&#x27;t smell at all. And I usually have pretty bad BO after working out. You will  not be disappointed. Also since it doesnt have a scent..(would be nice if they made some that did) I just spray perfume on me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 6-8 months and this is the best natural deodorant I have ever used!  I had tried several popular brands of non anti-perspirant deodorants with no luck, they seemed to do nothing and I didn&#x27;t like my own smell.  I work out at a gym regularly and wanted something that kept me fresh and DeodoMom is definitely the answer for me!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural deodorant since giving up Secret. I even used Secret Clinical in the past and nothing has worked as well as DeodoMom!!! I&#x27;m so excited. I thought natural deodorant meant always having to worry about stinking until I found this. I&#x27;m so excited that this works and that I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals into my body. Please never go away DeodoMom!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever.  I am thankful to have tried this deodorant.  I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> The short &amp; simple, all you need to know about DeodoMom:  IT WORKS!  I&#x27;ve tried many products from my local whole grocery store and also a few online from the strange to the ordinary.  If you are looking at this page, you are no doubt on that same quest of trying to find a natural deodorant that really works.  Free of perfume, aluminum, salt, preservatives, parabens, etc.  Some of the ones I&#x27;ve tossed that claimed to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; were harsh, caused irritation, or simply stunk.  Pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Search no more.  This is it!  I recommend you try it.  It applies like a regular roll on.  And works all day.  I&#x27;ve cleaned my house, worked in the yard, gone for walks/runs, and no worries with odor.  I waited several weeks so that I could write an authentic review after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to shower each morning before applying, though.  Like all the other natural deodorants (well, as mentioned, better than others!), you won&#x27;t have success if you are in a rush and try to skip your morning routine.  It&#x27;s especially effective if you use a good, natural deodorant bar soap (like the one from Maine with &amp;#34;odor fighting sage&amp;#34;).  But definitely stick with DeodoMom for your deodorant -- beats the store brands by a mile!  My ultimate consumer compliment?  I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you my daughter is 10 years old and she no longer smells like strawberries (LOL) at any rate other brands she&#x27;s had an allergic reaction I mean even the ones that say for sensitive skin/hypo allergenic.  I was so frustrated that I wouldn&#x27;t find deodorant for my daughter;as a result we went weeks without deodorant (not good).  I started doing some research and Amazon has always been my go to and I found DeodoMom.  The results have been phenomenal!! We have been using it for 3 weeks now and no rash, irritation and her under pits no longer smell.  Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> I would say, for me, and I am a sweaty person, that this works as well as the antipersperants or deodorants that I used to use, and I love that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals that are harmful to me or my child.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside it that it&#x27;s kinda pricey.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this would be able to do the job as well as my old Addidas anti-perspirant, but it has well exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;m trying to detoxify my life right now, and it&#x27;s a relief to know that I can use something this natural without any unintended harmful side effects!</li>
            <li> I have a terrible itching reaction to deodorants even those with no fragrance.  So when I found this product at Amazon I decided to give it a try.  I have been using it for a few weeks not and it is amazing...no itching feeling at all.  It is the first deodorant that I have found that did not break me out.  I am grateful and will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this deodorant!  I think it works better on me than the commercial deodorants that have aluminum.  It holds up with only one application, and I workout every day! I told my husband about it and he wants me to order some for him next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a kidney removed a year ago so I am super protective of my one good kidney.  DeodoMom deodorant gives me peace of mind.  It&#x27;s a great product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> DeodoMom,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a great natural solution. I was about to start making my own (baking soda, corn starch...natural deodorant) when I found DeodoMom on Amazon. I ordered it immediately, having done some research and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best natural deodorant I tried. It lasts longer than any other one I had tried and the roll on is the easiest way to put it on (at least for me, as a man I don&#x27;t like to get my fingers in a jar and spread it under my armpits:-). Easy to apply, no smell of any kind, just a perfect organic solution to all the nasty aluminum products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a full day from one workout to the next, the following day. Which is quite impressive given that is totally natural and has no antiperspirant in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should just buy this. It&#x27;s the best product I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many happy stinking-less days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying another natural deodorant after trying quite a few that didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this one! I have never used a roll on before but the deodorant applies nicely and dries very quickly. I didn&#x27;t think about it throughout the day, it just worked! I am very happy with this product and will order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to to have finally found a deodorant that works without my body absorbing aluminum any more!</li>
            <li> Good product, works as it should without any irritation. How much can you say about an everyday product that works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have tried over 20 plus natural or organic deodorants over the past several years.  They either just did not work or I had a bad reaction to something in the formula. I was a bit skeptical when I first saw that this deodorant only had two ingredients (I tried the roll-on version) but this stuff WORKS.  It dries fairly quickly and if it leaves a bit of white residue, that washes easily out of clothing. It gives me about 6 to 8 hours of freshness before I notice a slight breakdown. Absolutely no irritation or painful red bumps with this product. This is the best I have found to date. Thanks for making a truly safe product that does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three or four natural deodorant products and was about to give up. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the exorbitant price for some of the other products advertised and thought I&#x27;d give Deodomom a shot as a last ditch effort. I love it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else. One application in the morning is enough to last all day and I feel good about putting it on. It really has no scent at all - I&#x27;m thinking about adding a drop or two of essential grapefruit oil just for fun. Of course, I can&#x27;t guarantee this product will work for everyone, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product highly enough.  I bought it because I have very sensitive skin, and try to put as few chemicals on it as possible.  Regular commercial deodorants tend to give me redness and irritation, yet the natural brands I&#x27;ve tried (Tom&#x27;s of Maine for example) don&#x27;t really work and need to be reapplied at least once during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, however, not only has very few ingredients, all of which are natural, but it actually WORKS.  One application in the morning, and I&#x27;m good.  It has no scent, so no artificial chemicals, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and is easily applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff, and is the only deodorant I plan on buying from now on.</li>
            <li> Not pleased. When I removed it from the package , it was leaking. Also does not work- better off rubbing water under your arms :/  And even after applying a very minimal amount, it still leaves a white film behind.</li>
            <li> i was looking for an aluminum free deodorant. i found this product, thanks to all the good reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using it for months now and i know that from now on i wont use any other deodorant on the market.&lt;br /&gt;this is the best natural deodorant i have ever tried!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different non-aluminum deodorants but this one Really helps with underarm odor. Love that it is Aluminum free. Good packaging.Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s all natural with only a few ingredients.  It worked well for the first few weeks, though it rolls on wet, so it needs time to dry.  On very hot days or days where I exerted myself, it did not work as well (and my underarms felt sticky).  The summer is ending soon, so hopefully it will work better for me in the fall when it&#x27;s cooler.  Although not perfect, I&#x27;ll keep using it as I doubt there&#x27;s a better aluminum-free product out there.</li>
            <li> I have probably tried every natural deodorant on the planet. When you read the labels, they always stick something in there that you don&#x27;t really want on your body . . like triclosan for one. Well, you can&#x27;t get any purer than Deodomom. All it contains is two ingredients: water and Magnesium Hydroxide. No artificial anything. But the best part is that it actually works. I live in Florida and am an avid gardener. Let me tell you, gardening and 90 degree weather with 80-90% humidity is  a test for any deodorant. The first time I took of my sweaty T-shirt and gave it the sniff test, I was amazed. Eureka! As long as they don&#x27;t change the formula, Deodomom has a customer for life.</li>
            <li> After trying many natural, aluminum free deo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve FINALLY found one that works for me!  I live in Florida where the heat and humidity are ridiculous and I still sweat with this deo, but no not stink! Th aks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural deodorants and each one either doesn&#x27;t work at all or makes my skin itch after prolonged use. This one is very gentle. It definitely neutralizes any odor right when you put it on. I have to apply it a few times a day but I&#x27;ve only used it during the summer so hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use it as much in the winter. I also use Weleda Wildrose Deodorant on top of it to get some extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so nice to have a safe product that works. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about aluminum and all those nasty side effects!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I am allergic to all of the strong regular deodorants you find in the drug stores.  If they are strong enough to protect me from body odor they cause ridiculous itching and I look like a monkey scraching my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that protects and doesn&#x27;t cause allergic reaction for me.</li>
            <li> Perspiration has never been an issue for me, so was glad that this is a deodorant only. Well, for me it doesn&#x27;t work. By noon I could smell what was telling me wasn&#x27;t working. I really was hoping to be able to get away from an aluminum based product. Will continue to look for one that works.</li>
            <li> Shocking how effective this is, and I&#x27;ve literally tried every natural underarm deodorant on the market! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Have tried many natural deodorants and this is the first product that actually works. Also love that it is completely fragrance free and truly all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a natural aluminum and paraben free deodorant for some time.  I&#x27;ve tried so many and none would work more than a few hours.  I searched online for one that got good reviews and didn&#x27;t expect much when I first ordered it, but I must say I LOVE this deodorant!  It actually works all day long.  Even if I do sweat, I don&#x27;t smell.  And I can put it on right after shaving - it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have never written an online review for a product, but I felt compelled because THIS STUFF WORKS.  I have seriously tried everything (Arm &amp; Hammer, Nourish Organics, Weleda, and even making my own) and I would always wind up smelling like B.O. within an hour or 2 of application.  I don&#x27;t even sweat a lot, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant to avoid the harmful chemicals.  I decided this was my last attempt before I switched back to antiperspirant, and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  It goes on very easily and dries within a minute, and even though it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant I&#x27;ve found that it stays pretty dry until I start to sweat.  I don&#x27;t mind sweating, I just get annoyed with deodorants that leave me feeling sticky - this does not.  I have been sniffing at the end of each day and this stuff lives up to the test!  No more stink, my pits literally smell like nothing, so this is perfect wearing perfume without worrying about the deodorant scent being overpowering.  I hope they make this stuff forever.  It really is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I thank my friend, Tricia, for recommending this product.  I&#x27;ve tried many of the other natural and aluminum- free deoderants, only to find that they were not effective, until I tried DeodoMom.  I was completely shocked to find that it stops bad, underarm b.o. and  actually neutralizes it, when it&#x27;s rubbed or rolled on.  I am thrilled to not have to use aluminum deoderants, and for the first time  since my teen years, I can confidently wear sleeveless tops.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had reactions to many &amp;#34;natural products&amp;#34;.  This deodorant is very gentle and extremely effective.  I have been using it for about a month and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  You can&#x27;t miss with this one!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for me... I get through a whole day smelling neutral and feeling pretty dry. It has been put to the test and I have bought it TWICE now. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have never been as happy with a deodorant!  This works better than deodorants that have the promise of helping with underarm smell, but also are laced with all kinds of scary bad stuff.  If you&#x27;d like to avoid adding toxic chemicals to your body, and have better protection, this is the by far the best!  I&#x27;ve tried other natural types of deodorants which don&#x27;t come close to the effectiveness of DedoMom Roll on. Well worth the price. Even my skeptic husband was surprised of the effectiveness when he tried it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I waited about three weeks before reviewing this product since, like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve found in the past that natural deodorants tend to only work for me for about a week or so, before they stop working.  The same was the case with this brand -- it worked well at first, but then left me feeling stinky and not very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it feels going on and it dries quickly, unlike some roll-ons.  It also has a light, pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work for a lot of people, but, unfortunately, I&#x27;m in that group for whom it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life? I love this. This is BETTER than the Secret deodorant I&#x27;ve been using my whole life without all the nasty chemicals. It goes on perfectly smooth and dries quickly. Keeps me feeling fresh all day, even in the humid Indiana summer.</li>
            <li> Over the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been on a quest to eliminate as much toxic environmental load as I can. As most of you know, gene expression (epigenetics) is key to understanding much of what ails us, can ameliorate symptoms, and how we might avoid ill health entirely. As healthy as I think I am, it&#x27;s really foolish to assume my lymph/detox system is as finely synced as it would have been in a pre-industrial environment. I suggest anyone interested in such a quest utilize the website of the Environmental Working Group website (www.ewg.org) to vet the various products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, chucking my Old Spice rose to the top of the list of changes that needed to be made. To be honest, I&#x27;d gotten rid of aluminum cookware at least 20 years ago, yet never even considered the difference between what constituted a deodorant  and an antiperspirant. Old Spice worked and that was that. I decided to purchase DeodoMom because its formula seemed the most innocuous. (I mean, if you can eat it, it&#x27;s got to be head of the class),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased in September 2013 and loved it. Unfortunately, I decided there must be other deodorants that are less expensive but which yield commensurate results. I tried first, Thai Crystal Stick but found it simply did not work for my body chemistry. It left an itchy feeling and didn&#x27;t have a lasting effect. Later, I purchased a deodorant made by Miessence. It&#x27;s okay. But didn&#x27;t last so well either. As the many dissenting reviews attest, so much of this is about finding a match for your personal body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, DeodoMom is definitely in the high range. But I&#x27;m coming back to it. The roll-on lasted almost exactly 3 months (as suggested by the company). It&#x27;s so easy to be penny-wise, pound-foolish and forget that it&#x27;s the difference between $1 and $4 a month. It&#x27;s just a choice. But for me, in analyzing this modern, toxic soup we&#x27;re all living in, what we put under our arms is a good place to start an eliminationquest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, DeodoMom is not listed at the Environmental Working Group site. But you can search for its only ingredient (magnesium hydroxide) and see that it scores a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;, a perfect score on its toxicity scale.  It&#x27;s essentially telling you, you could eat this. That said, I think it would serve the company well to be listed as a product with the Environmental Working Group.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of deodorant that is aluminum free.  Until I found this kind I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked.  I tired Pitpaste before this one. That brand worked well but irritated my arm pits so much and left stains on my clothes.  This stuff is amazing. I bought it in July and I now need another one in October.  If you are working out or outside a lot you will need to reapply halfway though the day. Otherwise amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this deodorant, good protection, no chemical stuff and no irritation at all. I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great!!!!  I wanted to go to a more natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it and so tried this.  I had tried several others on the market that I didn&#x27;t like as well...This really works!!!!!!</li>
            <li> deodomom worked better for me than Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  After awhile I felt the Tom&#x27;s was causing odor rather than helping.  I really like that is has no aluminum and a very short ingredient list.  It works pretty well.  It comes with your name on it :)  I think deodoMom needs to change the name though.</li>
            <li> Like many people trying to avoid harmful ingredients, I&#x27;ve tried countless natural antiperspirants like The Crystal and Tom&#x27;s with limited success. The Crystal, for example, was effective in the short term, but gave me really irritated skin after repeated use. Tom&#x27;s and other similar deodorants just made me armpits an immediate irritated mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually gave up my search for awhile and resigned myself to Secret Unscented, which wasn&#x27;t irritating, but had a long list of chemicals I was not a fan of. Finally, after an exhaustive search for top-rated antiperspirants, I gave this roll-on as well as the jar version a try. I am so thankful I did because both actually work just as well as my Secret Unscented! I prefer the roll-on most days because of the convenience factor, but when I have some time I do the jar as it allows me to put on a thicker coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this stuff is I can apply it after shaving with no irritation, which sets it apart from every other natural deodorant and antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:&lt;br /&gt;- Always let it try completely before putting on clothing. I am impatient, so I just use a hairdryer on the cool setting. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well.  I&#x27;ve tried several other natural deodorants, but they did not work well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: 1 MONTH OF USE: Since I&#x27;ve now used this deodorant for about a month I thought I&#x27;d do an update. I still love it, but as the weather has gotten hotter in NY I have had to reapply if I workout in the later part of the day. There have been times where I&#x27;ve found the deodorant doesn&#x27;t work: if I take a shower at night and don&#x27;t put deodorant on before I go to bed I tend to smell if I workout that morning. Also, I tend to wear a dress that needs to be dry-cleaned two or three times before dry cleaning. I have noticed that I don&#x27;t smell as fresh as I used to with commercial deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that I&#x27;ve found I love in the last month is how there is zero smell and how light the deodorant actually is. I used my old commercial deodorant once in the last month (when I had forgotten to apply deodomom before going to bed and I was going to the gym in the AM) and I couldn&#x27;t stand the very strong smell and the stickiness of the old deodorant. I don&#x27;t know how I used to live like that every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without question, after a month of use, I still give this 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to clean up my beauty products for a while and one of my last hold outs was deodorant. I&#x27;ve always been really skeptical of natural deodorants. Will they work? Will they have a strange smell (I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells)? Am I wasting my money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about any of that with DeodoMom, I am so impressed with it and highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about a week now and while we haven&#x27;t had any really hot days in NY this year the weather has been in the high-70s/low-80s and I&#x27;ve been sweating! And I haven&#x27;t smelled! I&#x27;ve worn this for a CrossFit class, a cardio kickboxing class, and a fire fusion (like Insanity) class and I&#x27;ve gotten very sweaty and I haven&#x27;t smelled AT ALL (and this is applying it around 6:30am and going to these classes in the evening without reapplying)! I&#x27;ll update if that changes when the weather gets really warm, but for now this will be my go-to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love how there is no scent at all, it feels very light on, and it hasn&#x27;t left any marks on my clothes. Also, they put a label with my name on the top of it so my deodorant looks like it&#x27;s named \\&quot;Maggie.\\&quot; It cracks me up every time I put it on (but I&#x27;m weird).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this. It&#x27;s expensive, but if it works and doesn&#x27;t kill me why not spend a few more dollars?the weather gets really warm, but for now this will be my go-to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love how there is no scent at all, it feels very light on, and it hasn&#x27;t left any marks on my clothes. Also, they put a label with my name on the top of it so my deodorant looks like it&#x27;s named \\&quot;Maggie.\\&quot; It cracks me up every time I put it on (but I&#x27;m weird).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this. It&#x27;s expensive, but if it works and doesn&#x27;t kill me why not spend a few more dollars?</li>
            <li> I first heard about DeodoMom from a blogger friend of mine who had given the deodorant cream a test drive and raved about it. As I had been looking for a non-toxic product that actually worked for a while (I have a \\&quot;graveyard\\&quot; of products that I disliked), I was willing to give DeodoMom a try based on her recommendation. I do not regret it and have purchased it twice, as well as recommended it to friends. Controls odor and wetness to some degree. The cream is better at keeping you dry than the roll-on, but the roll-on is so darn convenient.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me but might for someone else!</li>
            <li> After trying several different natural deodorants I came across DeodoMom and absolutely LOVE it!  I&#x27;ve finally been able to get rid of my old toxic antiperspirants.  It gives me such peace of mind to be using a deodorant with only 2 safe ingredients that work well with my body&#x27;s chemistry to eliminate odor and do not cause yellow staining on my clothes (a problem I had with other natural deodorants that I tried).  I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every natural deodorant product that sells online and in natural health food stores and none of them compare to this one! I apply it in the morning and I am good through the day. I perspire a lot and sometimes do the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; check throughout the day and I still don&#x27;t have an odor. This is an effective product and I love that is doesn&#x27;t have a scent to try to mask the stench. I have tried all forms of DeodoMom and they all work effectively..I personally like the roll on because it&#x27;s quick and easy. I hope they never stop selling the product..I even have my mom hooked:)!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product does not cause any itching on me.  It works very well to control odor as well.  I can go two days without reapplying it during the winter, but during the summer I need to use it every day.  The only thing that gives it  4 stars instead of 5 is that you have to flap your arms to get it to dry before putting your clothes on.  I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin or sensitivity to perfumes.  This product has no smell at all that I can tell.  I wish I could have found this product years ago!</li>
            <li> So many of my friend&#x27;s recommended this deodorant, I finally decided it was time to try it. I&#x27;m very glad that I did. It absolutely works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> After a long and arduous struggle through the trenches of buying and returning natural deodorants, my boyfriend told me about DeodoMom. Here&#x27;s the thing: it works. I&#x27;ve tried almost every type of natural deodorant and this literally is the only one that lasts all day and that I don&#x27;t stink when doing active things.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant after reading about it on some blog and web sites, I was kinda skeptical, so I ordered another one along with this one. Its little pricier, but def cheeper than dealing with breast cancer. I used it the first time, went to work, work in busy restaurant behind bar, came home and didn&#x27;t smelled myself. Since I been using it, haven&#x27;t have a problem with sweat even living in Florida. I was using crystal body deodorant stick, used it because thought Its aluminum free, but its not, they named it ammonium alum, just a different way to name aluminum. Sad! I even had a problem with smelling myself sometimes when I sweat. Full stars, because Ill be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> One of the only healthy women&#x27;s deodorants that works for my daughter and myself.</li>
            <li> It works.  It&#x27;s fast and easy and I love that its a roll on!</li>
            <li> I feel like I have tried a gazillion different brands of natural deodorant. With each new deodorant, after a few days, I break down and buy &amp;#34;real deodorant&amp;#34; because the natural brand just is not working.&lt;br /&gt;DeodoMom really works! I couldn&#x27;t believe such a simple product could work so well. My seemingly endless deodorant search is over!&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to try DeodoMom because I have tried so many brands and feel like I was just wasting money. But, I really wanted to find a deodorant that wasn&#x27;t full of nasty chemicals and one that really worked.&lt;br /&gt;I hope DeodoMom will work for you also. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have tried AT LEAST 10 different brands of aluminum free deodorants. Literally, I&#x27;ve tried everything! Have been using DeodoMom for a week now and love it! I had major armpit irritation with other brands. None with this product. And no odor at all. Very impressed</li>
            <li> I love this product. When I found out I was pregnant I started doing research on deodorants and realized the one I was using had aluminum in it which I didn&#x27;t feel safe using during the pregnancy. I at first opted to go au natural and I was sweating like crazy and didn&#x27;t feel clean at all. I did some more research and found great reviews on Deodomom Roll-on. I love this product, it works and it has like 3 ingredients all of which are perfectly safe. I don&#x27;t smell and I&#x27;m always dry trust me you need this especially if your pregnant during the summer months!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for YEARS for a natural deodorant. I went from rocks to gels to sprays to weird putty-like creams that I would slather under my arms hoping to find a natural solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if DeodoMom was working. I could slightly smell b.o. at times. I then started making it a point to shower beforehand..or at the very least, quickly wipe my underarms with a wet washcloth. Since, I have not had any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work out almost every day and don&#x27;t ever smell sweaty. The real test was wearing full sleeves in the blazing sun...and after 4 hours, I still didn&#x27;t smell bad! It&#x27;s a revelation when you realize underarms don&#x27;t have to smell like powder, flowers, or aftershave in order to be non-offensive - To not smell like anything is way better. Without any fragrance at all, it&#x27;s almost like DeodoMom neutralizes the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you have to watch out for is not putting too much on or your armpits will be super white. Other than that, there&#x27;s nothing I could find wrong with DeodoMom. It&#x27;s truly the best natural deodorant out there. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> I used this producted consistently for two weeks straight but it just didn&#x27;t work for me, I stayed pretty stinky. I tried to give my body&#x27;s ph time to adjust, but still didn&#x27;t work :/ I will have to keep using my dove until I can find a kind that works without aluminum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a quest for a long lasting natural deodorant for a loooong time and DeodoMom has emerged as the clear winner!! No funky smell, lasts all day with no problem.  Wish it were cheaper but I will continue to use it because it works so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a vegan deodorant for a long time that doesn&#x27;t break me out in hives (I have really sensitive skin) and lasts longer than a couple hours. DeodoMom has seems to do the trick. I&#x27;ve been using the product for several weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I did not break out in hives like I have from previous attempts with other vegan deodorant brands. I originally found this product while looking for deodorants safe for pregnant women (assuming many would be vegan). I like the fact that there are only two ingredients, one being water. I use the roll-on product once in the morning and it seems to last all day. I imagine if one does any exercise, you would probably have to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to any vegan or pregnant women (or pregnant vegan ladies)!</li>
            <li> Positive reviews convinced me to try DeodoMom. I have not been disappointed. It&#x27;s totally scent free and very comfortable on my skin. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still amazed every day at this product working.  It&#x27;s odor free, which is a big thing for me, because I don&#x27;t want to smell my deodorant as I go about my day.  I had thought I was being so &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; when I chose a salt roll-on probably 5 years ago that I&#x27;ve been using...and then I recently read an article to check the label even though it&#x27;s salt.  And, there it was...&amp;#34;alum&amp;#34;, a form of aluminum...just what I was trying to avoid!  I was shocked! I&#x27;ve been using DeodoMom since the first week in April, and while we haven&#x27;t yet had the warm weather we typically do here in the Deep South, DeodoMom has had it&#x27;s time to shine.  I&#x27;m active with exercise and working with our horses.  So glad I found it here on Amazon, and hope I can use it beyond 30 some weeks :)</li>
            <li> This is the deodorant I have been searching for... Only 2 ingredients and it WORKS!!! Thanks for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Deodomom in the jar for a number of years now. I decided to try the roll-on, even though I still had a couple full jars left. I can&#x27;t decide which I like the best. I guess both! This is the absolute best deoderant I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> Being vegan I&#x27;m always searching for a cruelty free deodorant that actually works and until DeodoMom I hadn&#x27;t found one.  I&#x27;m curious to see how well this works in the summer but in the winter it has been great.  I love how natural it is and I&#x27;m not clogging my pores with toxins and each one has lasted me about 2 1/2 months so even though they are a little more expensive then a store bought brand it kind of works out for how long each one lasts.  I also love that it&#x27;s a small company and they put a little printed sticker with your name and the date on each deodorant, very nice personal touch.  Above all... NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous natural deodorants and one by one they ended up no longer working. I am now on my second bottle of DeodoMom and I can say without hesitation that this is THE best natural deodorant I have found. Additionally, I&#x27;ve only had to apply it once a day! This is almost unheard of with a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant. I strongly recommend you giving this a try, and as far as the cost (with free shipping), it&#x27;s more than worth it for the peace of mind and frankly, the bottle lasts for months! Very, very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been actively looking for an effective deodorant without excessive chemicals for a VERY long time (years!).  Been through so many brands that purport to eliminate odor through natural and organic ingredients.  Forget Tom&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve tried Erbaviva, Pure Body Scents (surprisingly strong \\&quot;scent\\&quot; that exceeded any perfume I may have ever used), Lavanila, and Eau de Minimes.  I tried these based on online research and these lines were always the ones tested by reviewers.  I&#x27;ve used commercial brands (antiperspirants) and high end (Malin &amp; Goetz) ones.  I still love Donna Karan Cashmere Mist if I need an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when using the natural deodorants, the odor was still present but mixed into some lovely scents.  There is nothing more unattractive than that.  Like patchouli and sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DeodoMom surprised me.  It was not on anyone&#x27;s list.  I just went on a testing run with a whole series of natural deodorants.  DeodoMom popped up as an ad when I was ordering the latest test products. I ordered it on a whim &amp; out of pure frustration.  That was in the spring.  Not warm at all and all of the others failed except for DeodoMom.  First, it comes with a label with your name on it and the date you ordered it.  Very helpful as a sort of gauge as to how long it lasts and, perhaps, if you are so inclined, to set your own expiration date.  It worked.  No odor at all.  But I waited until the 88 degree day with 88% humidity.  Brutal.  It worked, though.  So, I&#x27;m not into writing reviews but feel compelled to write this.  I understand that it&#x27;s all about chemistry and DeodoMom just worked for me while none of the others did, and it could be my biochemical make up at the time.  My teen-aged daughter said it didn&#x27;t work on her but she is changing hormonally.  But it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the roll on.  I&#x27;ve read reviews that the solid does not work as well.  I&#x27;ve spent so much time and money on my experiments that I&#x27;m not willing to spend more money on aniffy solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give it a hearty thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I am 7 months pregnant and have ordered this twice so far throughout my pregnancy (2 bottles should last you at least 10 months)! I LOVE it and will continue to use it even after my pregnancy. It rolls on easily, has no smell and keeps me dry and smelling good all day. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked, but it does! Looking forward to continued use! Thanks for a great, safe product for mom and baby!</li>
            <li> The wife used this while pregnant and she says it wore off too soon.</li>
            <li> Drip some essential oils on the top for an added scent!  LOVE THIS and will buy again and again.  I get wet somewhat, but usually no odor.  Then it dries and no odor, no staining.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the concept. Have been searching for&lt;br /&gt; natural deodorants that work.  Loves that&lt;br /&gt;They put my name on it.  Love to support&lt;br /&gt;The independent companies.  I&#x27;m just disappointed&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work well.  Once you start to perspire I feel the deodorant&lt;br /&gt;Residue and feel sticky. Bummed</li>
            <li> I had hoped that this would be as great as the reviews sounded, but sadly, I was a bit disappointed - stopped working by midday ( and I don&#x27;t know how one reviewer could say &amp;#34; only had to reapply once&amp;#34; - I want to be able to get through ine whole day without reapplying it.)</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different kinds of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and I wanted this one to work SO BADLY!  Unfortunately, while I can tell it definitely makes a difference, it&#x27;s just not enough to keep me smelling fresh for an entire 8-hour day at work. (I work in an office- no manual labor or anything!)  Since it takes it a while to dry, it&#x27;s not practical to take it to work and reapply mid-day, either. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m back on conventional deodorant for work, however, I compromise by wearing DeodoMom to bed after my nighttime shower. I figure going &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; overnight has to be better than nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product is kind of expensive, I probably will not buy it again once my current bottle runs out, even for overnight use. The active ingredient is Magnesium Hydroxide so I think I will just re-fill the bottle with (much cheaper!) Milk of Magnesia since that&#x27;s exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> For all of us who are intolerant to the aluminum found in most deodorant antiperspirants this is a great product.</li>
            <li> We have been really happy with all of the products from this company. Only good things to say.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that I have found that keeps me dry.  I have tried so many products but never found anything that could stand up against the Florida heat and humidity.  I was surprised at how well this works.  I sometimes will layer another natural essential oil based deodorant over it for scent because this is unscented.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works better than the many other natural products I have tried. Just re-ordered a 5-pack so I don&#x27;t run out! My last bottle lasted me over 3 months - I recommend to anyone looking for a natural deodorant that really works!</li>
            <li> my husband loves this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I never had have a so bad deodorant before, smell really bad after awhile you have it on.</li>
            <li> Company offered me free product for my review, which could be a way of biasing reviews toward people who like the product and want more.  I prefer reviews without a conflict of interest, so I thought I&#x27;d mention it for others to decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the short list of ingredients, which is a plus.  But on the downside, the roll on applicator easily pulls arm hair.  The armpit pain wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 or 5 different natural and sensitive skin deodorants and they all gave my 10 year old daughter rash.  Finally found one that doesn&#x27;t.  It works great, I&#x27;m going to continue purchasing this product for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant to wear during my pregnancy. I decided to purchased this product because there are only 2 ingredients: water and magnesium hydroxide. I was skeptical about how effective it would be at keeping me dry and smelling good. I&#x27;ve been using the deodomom for 5 months and could not be happier! I love it. I&#x27;ve just about running out, so I purchased a 5 pack. However, I would prefer to purchase this item one at a time.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest to find a good natural deodorant that actually works. That quest has ended with DeodoMom. I have tried everything from Weleda Deodorant spray to Lifestinks and all of the natural deodorant crystals. Deodomom is a wonderful product that I would recommend to anyone seeking an all natural deodorant. I am so glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After trying many other natural brand deodorants, this one is definitely the best. It&#x27;s really effective, with no weird chemicals or scents and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I was on a mission to find an aluminum free, vegan deodorant.  After a ridiculous amount of research, I finally decided to give DeodoMom a try!  I&#x27;ve been using DeodoMom roll-on for a month now and I am very pleased with this product!  I tend to sweat a lot so I was worried about switching brands, but DeodoMom works great and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with odor!!  I will definitely continue using this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am pregnant and I am trying to eliminate chemicals going onto my body.  I am very pleased with the product.  I have had no odor what so ever and I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking for a chemical free product. I would purchase this deodorant again!</li>
            <li> Based on so many various reviews, both on and off Amazon, I was excited to try this product. I have heard a good amount of to-be-moms trying out toxin-free products and I figured I give it a shot. I live in California, specifically in San Francisco. The weather here is never too hot and even on our hottest days, it&#x27;s very beautiful with no humidity. I work full-time and do prenatal yoga 3x a week. I do not have a stressful job that involves very much movement around since it&#x27;s a desk job. Bottomline: I don&#x27;t sweat often if any at all, nor do I have a strong body odor. I am very sensitive to smells and cannot take the scent of B.O. from anyone, including myself. After using this product for 3-4 days, I was elated that it work. Then after the 4th day, I began to stink horribly by the end of the work day. I was not happy at all! I had to switch back to my old deodorant because I didn&#x27;t want to be a grown adult stinking. My clothes would wreak and I felt very uncomfortable. I am running to take a shower by the time I get home and it&#x27;s quite embarrassing. Since this company has a no-return policy, I consider this a complete loss.</li>
            <li> I have been using an antiperspirant for several years and one day it dawned on me that it wasn&#x27;t actually stopping me from sweating, only smelling. Thus, I decided to use deodorant instead. This proved to be harder than I anticipated. I tried several deodorants to no avail. This is the first (and thus only) product I found that can keep my armpits odor free for 24+ hours regardless of how much I sweat. I applied it liberally (all hairs were saturated). This causes me to consume a bottle in about a month unfortunately. I believe it to be worth it though. The product is thick enough not to run but thin enough to spread around as needed. It does not seem to stain clothing. This is one my only reviews (if not the only) and I have purchased hundreds of items on Amazon. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> All deodorants seem to give me a nasty rash under my arms, including the natural deodorant products.  Even the crystal based deodorants caused a rash.  The only one that worked was Almay, but I hated that it had aluminum in it.  I ordered DeodoMom based on previous reviews and I can say after two months of no rash and a hot summer this is the best deodorant I have ever used!  End of story.</li>
            <li> It was all OK, but I cannot use it: after allergic dermatitis it gives me a rush. No itch though. I believe as a chemical it is irritative.</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonderful product.  I recently found out that the ingredients in regular deodorant can have harmful effects on the body.  I immediately started looking for an alternative and thankfully I found deodomom.  Even though it only has two ingredients it works as well as, if not better than, my old deodorant.  I would recommend this product to any woman that I know.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> An amazing product. I have been looking for an effective aluminum free antiperspirant for a long time. I have used Deodomom for a few weeks, and it works! I am very sensitive about body odor. I do not like to emit offensive odors....i like to smell clean. So I am a tough customer and have tried many times to replace the aluminum for health reasons over the years. Nothing completely eliminated the odor till I used Deodomom!  I am very thankful to have found this and will now be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I like that this dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave too much residue on clothes and does a pretty good job of keeping me odor free. I wish it held up a little better when I get hot and sweaty. I definitely don&#x27;t notice a strong odor like I&#x27;ve had with the long list of other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried. I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a typical body odor smell, I just don&#x27;t smell as fresh/clean as I would expect a deodorant to keep me. Right now, this is the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or nasty chemicals, so I will be buying it again. I know magnesium hydroxide is safe enough to eat, which is comforting, but I would be interested to see if there are any side effects associated with long term topical application.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and works wonderfully.  I have the roll-on version and use it twice a day.  It protects well throughout the day and does not leave marks on my clothes.  The size also lends itself to a carry on when traveling</li>
            <li> This did not work for me&lt;br /&gt;Once I started to really sweat it wore off&lt;br /&gt;Really wanted it to work seems like a great idea</li>
            <li> Every other deodorant I have tried has given me irritation.  This product does not.  It is easy to apply and works.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sad to say I am too stinky for this deodorant. I live in Hawaii so I have hot and humidity working against me and with body chemistry this did absolutely nothing. It didn&#x27;t cause any skin irritation and it went on smoothly (hence the 2 stars) but this did nothing to keep the BO in check. I also bought the cream and had the same exact results (massive stank).</li>
            <li> Have tried everything else since deodorants starting giving me rashes and/or making me itch. Even the hypoallergenic crystal ones (rock and spray) have resulted in misery. This roll-on works without irritation. Only problem is roll-on head catching hair. Spray or glide would be great if translatable to those mechanisms.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the drugstore stuff, which is saying a lot for a deodorant without aluminium. No fragrance, doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume. The cost is justified by the results, plus it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I shave my armpits every day and keep them very clean. Still, this deodorant was the same as not using anything. I&#x27;m starting to suspect that the reviewers here who gave it 5 stars were paid by the deodorant&#x27;s company.</li>
            <li> Been looking for ANOTHER new deodorant because I was using Terra naturals Sports but they discontinued it. Of course they did. Because I liked it. haha Jerks. So bought another Tea Tree oil one from Jason and didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I saw this and saw how many good reviews it had. I like that it only has two ingredients. Try not to put chemicals into my body.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Works awesome. I don&#x27;t stink. I will reapply it if I&#x27;m going out for the night or something. Other than that once in the morning and lasts all day. So happy to find this. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product and really wanted to love it, but after trying it multiple times right after a shower, I had to give up.  I sweat a lot with it - which is to be expected with a natural deodorant, but it did absolutely nothing to mask the odor for me.  I use natural deodorant, and have found that typical &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; deodorants do keep me from smelling too strongly.  I love that this is a family-owned business and wish it had worked for me.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is hypoallergenic, not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have an odor but makes sure the person using it does not. I have purchased  this deodorant at least 4 or 5 times. I have been advised if the roll on the top of the bottle needs dry to use a little water to turn the roll a little. I do not use any other the deodorant since I have found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It has no fragrance, which is why I bought it. A bit expensive, but works very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how good this deodorant is. No Aluminum, either. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am new to the natural chemical free deodorant search, but as they say, third times a charm and I&#x27;ve found a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial plan was to progress towards using the crystal. I began with the Jason brand as an intended cross over to natural deodorants because it was both convenient and cheap. I very quickly became the smelly one in the office (or at least I felt that way as I sat reeking of b.o. at my desk). So I willed myself to spend a bit more to try others with better reviews. Lavanilla was a vast improvement from Jason but I was reapplying throughout the day (during lunch, after work, etc).  I was beginning to think I&#x27;d have to resign myself to some body odor if I were to continue the quest towards natural deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I had also ordered DeodoMom. I very quickly moved on from Lavanilla and haven&#x27;t looked back. DeodoMom rolls on easily, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t discolor my clothes, AND IT WORKS!! The deodorant is odorless and so am I! I think it&#x27;s incredible that it works so well with two simple ingredients.  I may be sweaty after spin class and runs but I don&#x27;t smell. My bluntly honest ten year old will verify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars only because of the price.  $12 is still a sticker shock to the recent natural deodorant converted. With it&#x27;s very simple packaging and minimal contents, I hope they can bring the price down. However, I will be repurchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a few months now and it has worked great for me. I don&#x27;t sweat all that much but when I do there is no smell. I also have very sensitive skin and have no problems there, and it hasn&#x27;t stainedy clothes.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t want to use too much, just a thin layer will do.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than I ever thought.  I like it better than the cream because I don&#x27;t have to get my hands dirty.  But the cream works just as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this natural product and its effectiveness but it turned out to work great!  Not only am I converting during the period we are pregnant and through breastfeeding, but I’ll be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I finally found a non toxic deo I like. I&#x27;m very happy with this product! It last a long time. Good protection svdn when it&#x27;s really hot outside</li>
            <li> The sample I had in the cooler climate seemed to work a but better. I still find myself applying this throughout the day to combat b.o. So not perfect but one of the better all natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> I recently found out that I am pregnant and definitely wanted to switch to a safer deodorant.  I have tried at least 5 other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and DeodoMom has been the best for keeping me BO-free the longest.  All of the other ones I have tried seemed like they were scented in an attempt to cover up smells and not eliminate them.  I do miss the dryness of my old antiperspirant, but for a healthy alternative, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
