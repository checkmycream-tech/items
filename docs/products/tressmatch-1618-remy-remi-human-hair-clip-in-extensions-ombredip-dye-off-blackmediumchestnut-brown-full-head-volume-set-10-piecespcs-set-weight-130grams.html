            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I was not quite sure when I bought this - there aren&#x27;t many reviews.</li>
            <li>I love to wear it curly.</li>
            <li>Love them...</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on these extensions.</li>
            <li>I love my extensions, I ordered the 20-22inch elite package.</li>
            <li>When they arrived in the mail I immediately tried them on, they were long silky beautiful and just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>so i love it.</li>
            <li>i was very excited..</li>
            <li>Love them but they tangle easily.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really blend in good</li>
            <li>I went with my gut and bought them, and they were awesome, they blended with my hair even though its more black then brown.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft,full,  and easy to put in.</li>
            <li>and you can style them easily</li>
            <li>I love that they give more thorough instructions on how to take care of it, the first time I ordered it, it just went to shambles but</li>
            <li>The price is amazing for a product like this, one would normally pay much more for extensions of this quality and amount.</li>
            <li>love the hair, its soft and i&#x27;m able to curl it with my curling iron at 420!</li>
            <li>Mine have personally lasted 1 to 2 years (with some washing and keeping up with them of course lol).</li>
            <li>Not thick at the top, but from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>when I saw the hair at first I was in love of the texture, so silk.</li>
            <li>what i expected they said so many good things</li>
            <li>extensions tangle if you don&#x27;t take special care of them.</li>
            <li>They blend well, look real and feel authentic.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and the amount of wefts and thickness is perfect.</li>
            <li>I followed EVERY instructions that came in the box towards washing and the results were fair and gross.</li>
            <li>I ordered them 5 months ago and are still silky and soft as new!&lt;br /&gt;All those reviews that say they tangle fast must take into account that the life spam of the extensions depends on taking good care of them.</li>
            <li>This is not the case and even when I decided to give it  try, it just requires too much effort to put each piece and make sure they are right</li>
            <li>Exactly what they were said to be!</li>
            <li>But I think I might need just a Iittle bit more to cover my head completely</li>
            <li>It seems 150g at this price worth a try</li>
            <li>They are true to color, easy to style and blend in with your natural hair.</li>
            <li>they got all tangled and the tangles came right out.</li>
            <li>Like they had been dyed right before shipment.</li>
            <li>It does not get tangled easily, and just looks very natural.</li>
            <li>The color is very pure.</li>
            <li>Oh the clips are sturdy and comfortable and easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was long</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the only thing i liked really.</li>
            <li>these extension were shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, especially for the summer when u don&#x27;t want to do your own.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My first set was purchased from Foxy Locks.</li>
            <li>I would say this is about the same quality hair, maybe even better.</li>
            <li>These are my first clip in hair extensions</li>
            <li>The length is a bit more for my actual hair lenght..</li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>It feels so comfortable and soft,</li>
            <li>After a day at work the bottom is always pretty tangled up, no matter how much I condition them.</li>
            <li>They are certainly a quality product</li>
            <li>more than I Expected.</li>
            <li>It holds the curl very well.</li>
            <li>I always treat my extensions very well -</li>
            <li>I was using heat protector and the whole 9 yards</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried coating them in oil before styling to really moisturize the hair but nothing has worked.</li>
            <li>it tangles really fast</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t even get very tangled.</li>
            <li>and afterwards they became VERY oily and they looked damaged and the hair started to split by the tracks and</li>
            <li>and I found myself playing with my hair trying to make it straight instead of a ball of hair.</li>
            <li>You REALLY need to have time to put these extensions.</li>
            <li>however you want and looks so real.</li>
            <li>Nice hair didn&#x27;t have my color black!</li>
            <li>The one good thing I can say about this hair is that it is thick, which was one of my main concerns.</li>
            <li>Love this hair, blends fantastically with my medium/shoulder length black hair.</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t get a new pair</li>
            <li>Overall, they look really pretty.</li>
            <li>Ive worn many times now and hardly any hair has come out.</li>
            <li>just like you would your natural hair.</li>
            <li>The hair is so silky and natural.</li>
            <li>It is so natural looking</li>
            <li>there is any complaint I&#x27;d say the top where the hair is sewn could be neater.</li>
            <li>hair is silky soft and the clip ins stay in place.</li>
            <li>They arent soft anymore</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t fond of her using her Christmas money to buy this, however, she is an adult</li>
            <li>Not thin and 100% real hair that I heat style nearly everyday.</li>
            <li>So I can overall say they weren&#x27;t worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li>they came 20 inches but not as black as I thought more of a dark brown</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as I expected because was 2 days shipping,</li>
            <li>Brushing them twice a day, washing them in a special way (taping the shampoo only) , do not comb while wet, applying conditioner, not drying them with a towel, you must hang them to dry, etc...</li>
            <li>No grey hair in the set.</li>
            <li>I get these all the time and they&#x27;re very soft and last for a very very long time!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and I get minimal fallout.</li>
            <li>Large pieces we&#x27;re missing -.- yah&#x27;ll</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I&#x27;ll update you on how long it takes before they are gross and unusable.</li>
            <li> I spent a couple weeks researching different extensions and when I came across these I decided to give em a shot?</li>
            <li> I was used to having 3 long pieces, all my hair covered and done.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I did notice at first was it wasnt very black more than just dark brown.</li>
            <li> I constantly had to comb out the knots throughout the day, and I could not have em curled due to that fact.</li>
            <li> Unlike other extensions I have had before, this one does not have grey hair.</li>
            <li> They are very thick, silky and very high quality.</li>
            <li> Not to mention they were leaking a pink and purple color when I was washing them.</li>
            <li> A week in, I noticed that when I would wear them they would get extremely tangled and it looked like I had endless knots in my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if they would give the same fullness if I didn&#x27;t already have the sewn in tracks.</li>
            <li> So, I got these extensions with the knowing that they may come with a bit of problems due to the feedback people have given.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am having a hard time with is the hair holding a curl.</li>
            <li> Tressmatch did not have the weird smell I got from Foxy Locks and also does not shed as much as foxy locks did.</li>
            <li> it says black but the color was dark brown</li>
            <li> The couple times I did curl them they fell out in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> I ordered Elite off black 20\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> black..  </li>
            <li> so I dyed them black.</li>
            <li> Oh and lets not forget the random red and white strings that are connected to the tracks and look odd?</li>
            <li> Usually I have to use two sets but this one single set does the trick!</li>
            <li> I will say that at times it can get a little tangly but you just have to take care of it</li>
            <li> they give me length and add fullness to the choppy parts of my hair.</li>
            <li> Not easy to brush out either.</li>
            <li> fits tight and the hair stays snug!</li>
            <li> Or at least send me a new pair of extensions without horrible results after washing, the funny part is</li>
            <li> I was looking online for awhile, but everything was almost $200 if not more.</li>
            <li> Cheaper prices hair tends to run a little thin but these were not..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick unruly hair.</li>
            <li> It is really thick.</li>
            <li> and they said for thick hair people to get the Elite that&#x27;s why i got that</li>
            <li> My hair is still too thick.</li>
            <li> (And I know how to curl hair, that&#x27;s why I purchased these because I had long hair but made the mistake of cutting it.)</li>
            <li> they are thick and don&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and shoulder length.</li>
            <li> i have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I already have hair extension sewn in and I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> but the hair is still thin</li>
            <li> But i tried everything else before, either they are too thin or too expensive or both!</li>
            <li> Also the hair is very thin</li>
            <li> The 2000 millions clips are soooo inconvenient.</li>
            <li> They smelled really bad of smoke from the bonfire</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;ll be extremely disappointed.</li>

            <li> This hair just makes me feel flawless and on my Beyonce tip. I will say that at times it can get a little tangly but you just have to take care of it just like you would your natural hair. I love that they give more thorough instructions on how to take care of it, the first time I ordered it, it just went to shambles but this second time I feel that the hair will last. Highly recommend, especially for the summer when u don&#x27;t want to do your own.</li>
            <li> It seems to be good. Shipping was fast as I expected because was 2 days shipping, when I saw the hair at first I was in love of the texture, so silk. But I think I might need just a Iittle bit more to cover my head completely</li>
            <li> Exactly what they were said to be! Not thin and 100% real hair that I heat style nearly everyday. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many extensions. I&#x27;ve got thick unruly hair. and decided to give these ones a shot. I ordered them 5 months ago and are still silky and soft as new!&lt;br /&gt;All those reviews that say they tangle fast must take into account that the life spam of the extensions depends on taking good care of them. Brushing them twice a day, washing them in a special way (taping the shampoo only) , do not comb while wet, applying conditioner, not drying them with a towel, you must hang them to dry, etc...&lt;br /&gt;If you take care of them , they will last a loooooot! It was a really good purchase.</li>
            <li> They blend well, look real and feel authentic.  Just wish there was more hair per clip.  Overpriced.</li>
            <li> Beautiful quality and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Second set of hair extensions. My first set was purchased from Foxy Locks. I would say this is about the same quality hair, maybe even better. Tressmatch did not have the weird smell I got from Foxy Locks and also does not shed as much as foxy locks did. I love the softness of the hair. It does not get tangled easily, and just looks very natural. The only thing I am having a hard time with is the hair holding a curl. It looks beautiful straight but I love to curl my hair. If anyone has any suggestions on this. I would gladly appreciate it. Overall, Great Buy!</li>
            <li> I get these all the time and they&#x27;re very soft and last for a very very long time! Mine have personally lasted 1 to 2 years (with some washing and keeping up with them of course lol). You won&#x27;t regret buying these!</li>
            <li> Superb Quality...more than I Expected. These are my first clip in hair extensions and I love it. The length is a bit more for my actual hair lenght.. but I will trim the extensions. Clips are light weight and hair are perfectly attached to the clips.</li>
            <li> I was looking online for awhile, but everything was almost $200 if not more. Great product! Definitely happy with the 150g.. getting lots of compliments. :)</li>
            <li> Love love love these! Super good quality and they are thick and don&#x27;t shed! Def a great purchase and I will buy more when needed!</li>
            <li> I was not quite sure when I bought this - there aren&#x27;t many reviews. But i tried everything else before, either they are too thin or too expensive or both! Or they shed to the point my vacumm is stuck! It seems 150g at this price worth a try so I went for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it couple days after I ordered. EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!! The hair is so silky and natural. No grey hair in the set. It is really thick. Not thick at the top, but from top to bottom. My hair is very thick and shoulder length. Usually I have to use two sets but this one single set does the trick! It is longer than the 20&#x27;&#x27; I used to get any where else! It is so natural looking that you CAN&#x27;T TELL I have extensions. I love to wear it curly. It holds the curl very well. Oh the clips are sturdy and comfortable and easy to open and close. And it does not shed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All extensions tangle if you don&#x27;t take special care of them. I always treat my extensions very well - I follow all instructions and use very good serum so I can use them for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is any complaint I&#x27;d say the top where the hair is sewn could be neater. But nobody can see it I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made product great price love love love!!!</li>
            <li> Love them... Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Best hair I&#x27;ve purchased yet! I love it so much. I even referred my best friend and she loves it as well. Blends perfectly and curls beautifully. I got the 150g set and it was enough for me. I get so many compliments on these extensions. I will be purchasing these from here on out.</li>
            <li> I love my extensions, I ordered the 20-22inch elite package. They&#x27;re so soft,full,  and easy to put in. The color matched my hair perfectly, and it blends well.</li>
            <li> Sucked! Tried contacting someone about it but had no luck!!! Large pieces we&#x27;re missing -.- yah&#x27;ll freaking suckkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is very good hair the best hair ive ever owned and ive been buying for 10 plus yrs! Ive worn many times now and hardly any hair has come out. Even wore the out drinking an they got all tangled and the tangles came right out. Could not be happier!</li>
            <li> Nice hair didn&#x27;t have my color black!</li>
            <li> They are true to color, easy to style and blend in with your natural hair. Would definitely buy from this seller again! Great hair.</li>
            <li> I spent a couple weeks researching different extensions and when I came across these I decided to give em a shot? When they arrived in the mail I immediately tried them on, they were long silky beautiful and just gorgeous. A week in, I noticed that when I would wear them they would get extremely tangled and it looked like I had endless knots in my hair.  I was using heat protector and the whole 9 yards so I had no idea why that was happening?! I constantly had to comb out the knots throughout the day, and I could not have em curled due to that fact. The couple times I did curl them they fell out in less than an hour. (And I know how to curl hair, that&#x27;s why I purchased these because I had long hair but made the mistake of cutting it.) So I can overall say they weren&#x27;t worth the money I spent. ): Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> These extensions are very nice. They are very thick, silky and very high quality. The price is amazing for a product like this, one would normally pay much more for extensions of this quality and amount. This is a good investment.</li>
            <li> Great hair! It feels so comfortable and soft, just the texture I love! I can do a lot styling with it. It curls well. The color is very pure. Unlike other extensions I have had before, this one does not have grey hair. It does not shed either. With this price I will rate it five stars!!!</li>
            <li> Not the best quality hair I have ever recieved but they do the trick.. After a day at work the bottom is always pretty tangled up, no matter how much I condition them. I&#x27;ve even tried coating them in oil before styling to really moisturize the hair but nothing has worked. The one good thing I can say about this hair is that it is thick, which was one of my main concerns. Cheaper prices hair tends to run a little thin but these were not.. However the tangling and the straw like feeling of some of the wefts will stop me from ordering from this company again.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the hair 6 months and I just had to replace it, from a different company of course. You can see the issues with the matted tangling in the photo. Not easy to brush out either. This hair literally feels like straw!</li>
            <li> I ordered Elite off black 20\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;not what i expected they said so many good things i was very excited.. I liked that it was long that&#x27;s the only thing i liked really. it tangles really fast and you can see like brown color i think i am gonna have to dye it black..  Also the hair is very thin i have very thick hair it doesn&#x27;t really blend in good and they said for thick hair people to get the Elite that&#x27;s why i got that on but the hair is still thin</li>
            <li> Love this hair, blends fantastically with my medium/shoulder length black hair. My hair is thick and the amount of wefts and thickness is perfect. I don&#x27;t even have to use them all. They&#x27;re very soft and I get minimal fallout.</li>
            <li> these extension were shipped very fast. they came 20 inches but not as black as I thought more of a dark brown so I dyed them black. hair is silky soft and the clip ins stay in place. they give me length and add fullness to the choppy parts of my hair. I already have hair extension sewn in and I have very thick hair so I&#x27;m not sure if they would give the same fullness if I didn&#x27;t already have the sewn in tracks. Overall, they look really pretty.</li>
            <li> So, I got these extensions with the knowing that they may come with a bit of problems due to the feedback people have given. I went with my gut and bought them, and they were awesome, they blended with my hair even though its more black then brown. The only bad thing I did notice at first was it wasnt very black more than just dark brown. BUMMER. I wore them a couple times to a bonfire and they were great and they didn&#x27;t even get very tangled. They smelled really bad of smoke from the bonfire so I had to wash them, I used Herbal Essence for the shampoo and repairing conditioner by Vidal Sassoon or whatever and afterwards they became VERY oily and they looked damaged and the hair started to split by the tracks and even the tracks were falling apart! Not to mention they were leaking a pink and purple color when I was washing them. Like they had been dyed right before shipment. They arent soft anymore so I decided to wash them again with different shampoo and this time I used Garnier hydracharge shampoo and conditioner and I still got the same result. HELP PLEASE. Or at least send me a new pair of extensions without horrible results after washing, the funny part is I followed EVERY instructions that came in the box towards washing and the results were fair and gross. If I don&#x27;t get a new pair then I&#x27;ll be extremely disappointed. Oh and lets not forget the random red and white strings that are connected to the tracks and look odd?</li>
            <li> it says black but the color was dark brown</li>
            <li> I chose to buy the the 10 piece set because it said it would look thicker and fuller. My hair is still too thick. You can tell I&#x27;m wearing extentions.</li>
            <li> The hair is beautiful and it will be like that for a couple of weeks. They do tangle a lot and I found myself playing with my hair trying to make it straight instead of a ball of hair. The 2000 millions clips are soooo inconvenient. You REALLY need to have time to put these extensions. I was used to having 3 long pieces, all my hair covered and done. This is not the case and even when I decided to give it  try, it just requires too much effort to put each piece and make sure they are right so they are not that evident.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t get them again.</li>
            <li> love the hair, its soft and i&#x27;m able to curl it with my curling iron at 420! so i love it. fits tight and the hair stays snug!</li>
            <li> Love them but they tangle easily. Still beautiful and you can style them easily however you want and looks so real.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t fond of her using her Christmas money to buy this, however, she is an adult and it&#x27;s her choice. She looks beautiful without them, but they look beautiful and very natural. She curls them and takes very good care of the. They are certainly a quality product and I&#x27;ll update you on how long it takes before they are gross and unusable. Yes, I covered her face for privacy, but as you can see they look very beautiful and natural. She takes them out and puts them in within minutes.</li>
