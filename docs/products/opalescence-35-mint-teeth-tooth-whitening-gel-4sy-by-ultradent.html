            <li>Great buy! :)</li>
            <li>Strong - and great product!</li>
            <li>This is very strong whitening gel!  </li>
            <li>but beware, it is very strong!</li>
            <li>Good, just don&#x27;t get it on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good price for this as well...</li>
            <li>Remember that what is good for one person is not for another.</li>
            <li>IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD DEAL...</li>
            <li>So since the price was so good, I decided to kick it up a couple of notches.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since you won&#x27;t be licking your lips or swallowing for a while, I like to apply a bit of chapstick to my lips, and have a good drink of water before getting</li>
            <li>Good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good as the one I get from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Works good as directed, good product.</li>
            <li>A good friend of mine who is also a dental hygienist recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li>and I know if it were good it would do</li>
            <li>Good product, works well, but a word of warning.</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using the 15% and was not getting the results I wanted, so I thought the 35% would be good.</li>
            <li>Works good on teeth do not get on Gums or put in a bleaching trays.</li>
            <li>have had good results with what I have purchased here and intend to buy again.</li>
            <li>I think once opened, the syringes are not as good, judging from the foaming and gum burn.  </li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>just as good as my dentist sells</li>
            <li>Vendor provided prompt delivery, and prduct received in excellent conditions with full instructions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome quick whitening trick.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results, and will definately reorder.</li>
            <li>I happily use the 40% gel I get from my dentist, but I will buy the 35% from Amazon for a better price and save a trip to the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>This whitener works great, just make sure it doesn&#x27;t get on your gums because it will burn and get irritated.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, just make sure you have the correct mouth pieces made or you will defiantly burn your gums.  </li>
            <li>Was very pleased with this product .</li>
            <li>, I thought it was just 2 , so I was very pleased with that surprise.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product for whitening,  but make sure you get some kind of sensitivity gel to use after.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this brand for about 7 years, love it!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic alternative!!  </li>
            <li>So glad Amazon carries them!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>After about two tubes of this, they&#x27;re amazingly brighter and whiter.  </li>
            <li>product is amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and effective.  </li>
            <li>This really is the best teeth bleach on the market in my opinion</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see how anyone could rate this product as effective.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that &amp;#34;use 35% for 30 minutes only&amp;#34; be highlighted.</li>
            <li>I always use this kind for my teeth</li>
            <li>Great for a really bright smile.</li>
            <li>I have always used this brand of whitener and have liked it.  </li>
            <li>But might not be as effective.</li>
            <li>That said, this is effective and got my shade where I wanted without day after day of treatment like the lighter strengths.</li>
            <li>That was my own fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice flavor.</li>
            <li>I witnessed this happening to my own tooth, as a temporary crown was placed on my tooth while the student-dentist (Baylor Dental College) took forever (2 months) to make the permanent one.  </li>
            <li>It was hardly touching my gums at all as I was good to wipe out the excess amount.</li>
            <li>Works great, but very powerful.  </li>
            <li>If you make your own teeth trays( the boil and suck kind) then consider drawing on them with a very fine point permanat marker along the gum line.</li>
            <li>First of all Opalescence is a very good product, it is the strength of this whitening solution that is the problem.</li>
            <li>Great product; wonderfully-priced; arrived quickly and undamaged! :-)</li>
            <li>Does a great job and is done quickly.  </li>
            <li>great product shipped quickly</li>
            <li>These worked great and in a quick time.</li>
            <li>This 35% is very strong.</li>
            <li>concentration of 35 % is very strong and gives sensitivity to teeth and it can burn ur gums if gel escape trays.</li>
            <li>Very easy to push out and to get it into the mold without making a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works but a very strong taste so that may off set the savings for some</li>
            <li>I have used this twice, and it is very strong.</li>
            <li>This gel is very strong.  </li>
            <li>This product costs so MUCH MORE whenever I&#x27;ve bought it at The Dentist&#x27;s Office, so I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to get it so inexpensively through mail order! :-)</li>
            <li>Opalescence is far and away the best tooth whitener on the market.  </li>
            <li>And you can count on this being an honest and truthful review.  </li>
            <li>Whiter smile, works great.</li>
            <li>One of the most amazing things about Opalescence besides the fact that it strengthens your teeth is how it makes the shine and glisten like pearls.</li>
            <li>It whitens to a nice, bright shade quickly, and with no irritation or burning of the gums.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is extremely strong!</li>
            <li>Have used the lower percentage gel with no problem, but this one is too strong, worry that it&#x27;s eating away my enamel!</li>
            <li>The 35% is really good as I find I do not have to whiten my teeth as often which is good because I do not want to run the risk of doing it too much.</li>
            <li>Have a REAL custom tray made of your teeth so that it is a perfect fit and does not overlap onto your gums.  </li>
            <li>I knew the price was to good to be true.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if something seems too good to be true......</li>
            <li>It is very important that you use this product with a mouth guard that is specifically made for your teeth or it will burn your gums because its not meant to go on your gums.</li>
            <li>Effective, tastes fine, doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of the top whitening systems and toothpastes, but this is probably the best you&#x27;ll find outside of a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody has though my teeth look like veneers, but I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in the whiteness.</li>
            <li>OK, so this product will whiten your teeth like nothing else for the money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again...this product works phenomenally well when used correctly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s incredibly potent strength.</li>
            <li>I accidentally overfilled my bleaching tray to where some of the gel squished out of the top and touched my gums.</li>
            <li>this price is much better  than my dentist sells it for.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I would use this seller again :)</li>
            <li>If so I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>, I was so glad that it was sold on amazon</li>
            <li>LOve</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest leaving product on for more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Do not leave the gel on for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Do not do more than one treatment in a day.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend the moldable trays since you can not keep the gel from touching your gums when you insert them.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, one of the mouth spreaders (lack of a better or correct word) like the dentists use is a much better device.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m staying with the lower percent solution and doing it more often.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into pain, so I plan on being much more conservative in my approach.  </li>
            <li>More is NOT always better.</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;ve used whitening strips from the store, that would be better than this.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>I could not wear this product for more than 5 mins.</li>
            <li>I am able to wear the 20% all night without any sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>Did cause sensitivity and I recommend using a mold able whitening tray.</li>
            <li>Works great and much cheaper to buy here than from the dentist</li>
            <li>I should have done more research on the percentages.</li>
            <li>overall very happy with product for the lower percentages.</li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>I seemed to have better luck with that one than this one that I bought.</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to buy as it has given me the best results of any teeth whitening product I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I worked in dental hygiene for many years and this is what we used as a whitening product for our patients.</li>
            <li>The latest purchase has an expiration date of D115 on the syringes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s time to switch to something more reliable.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when required as needed.</li>
            <li>it works better for me because you can do it while sleeping</li>
            <li>It is better than the $100+ stuff that your dentist sells you.</li>
            <li>make sure you do not have any periodontal gum issues.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Warnings:  As many others have stated, the 35% is not for the uneducated.  </li>
            <li>I will begin a more strict regimen of applying this stuff</li>
            <li>Buy it and you will love it.</li>
            <li>Would have given 5 stars if the percentages were better explained.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the bleaching gel.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t leave it on for more than one hour</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the highest quality after reading some of the reviews, but it surpassed my expectations.  </li>
            <li>and my teeth are now many shades whiter and brighter.  </li>
            <li>It is stronger and does irritate gums more than 20% but is Ok.</li>
            <li>one is more.</li>
            <li>This name brand is what all reputable dentists use.</li>
            <li>The company would be well advised to save money on the fancy packaging and give more product and maintain better quality control.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else i have used.  </li>
            <li>Works like a charm :)</li>
            <li>I like this whitening gel ok, but like others said, it does burn the gums some.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like 15% rather than 35%.  </li>
            <li>Can burn gums if not used with a well fitting custom tray.</li>
            <li>This identical product was recommended by my dentist and to me to me at more than 3x the price as Amazon.</li>
            <li>It would be great if the manufacturer put marks on the syringe which shows 30% / 50% marks to show how much you have expressed into the teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will perhaps post a follow up after I have used this for a couple more days.</li>
            <li>sure you start out at your dentist.  </li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t leave the tray in for more than 1 hour.  </li>
            <li>but i sure did notice the thickness of the gel.</li>
            <li>Much better deal going thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>I Will be buying more of this again</li>
            <li>Love this whitening gel.&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is an outstanding value.</li>
            <li>they all love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
            <li>Great, fast results.</li>
            <li>because I&#x27;m satisfied with the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to keep the 35% in my mouth for overnight use like I am with the 15%.  </li>
            <li>and i couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.  </li>
            <li>- the rest of your life is even better</li>
            <li>and I saw how my precious tooth darkened over time while I was waiting for this student to make the permanent crown.  </li>
            <li>I do not leave on for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Probably should have called to ask what an appropriate % is beforehand.  </li>
            <li>I first got it from my dentist and it cost me $150 for a four pack so the $10 or so price you can get it for on here IS A KILLER DEAL!!!</li>
            <li>But, honestly after the three days in a row i used it my teeth looked significantly whiter</li>
            <li>This stuff is actually pretty good.</li>
            <li>it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is so worth it!!</li>
            <li>A very good product, have been using it for ten yrs.</li>
            <li>The real strength is what others are complaining about; very strong!</li>
            <li>Be careful and happy smiling!</li>
            <li>On the syringe you will see (towards the top of the gel filled area, below the pump handle) a cryptic 4 digit number/letter combination.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good just don&#x27;t do it too much it burns your gums.</li>
            <li>Anything that burns your tissue this much cannot be good for it.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, beware of using too much because it can damage your gums.</li>
            <li>This product will cause significant pain along your gum line when used appropriately.</li>
            <li>The results are wonderful without the gum irritation you get with other brands.</li>
            <li>and it came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing how great it works and my teeth are super white.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I can appreciate a thicker gel as too runny would cause it to smear off easily on trays</li>
            <li>having used the 20% gel purchased from my dentist, I found the  35% gel too strong.  </li>
            <li>It is strong and has the ability to \\&quot;burn\\</li>
            <li>too strong.</li>
            <li>I know some reviews said it was really strong.</li>
            <li>35% is as strong as it comes.</li>
            <li>because I didn&#x27;t realize how strong this was.  </li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you buy the Strong stuff.  </li>
            <li>This opalescent 35% was a bit too strong.  </li>
            <li>I got this thinking why not go strong.</li>
            <li>Would never buy this strong again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong so</li>
            <li>Please beware, this is too strong,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a solution this strong.</li>
            <li>35% is way too strong, I don&#x27;t know how anyone can use this.</li>
            <li>It is as strong as the stuff from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Be warned, though, to keep it off of your gum&#x27;s as it is strong.</li>
            <li>This was way too strong of a product for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you have a hot date or special event and need to whiten super fast!!!</li>
            <li>Will review ASAP, but assume it&#x27;s going to be just fine.</li>
            <li>This time, it worked just fine for me and will buy again.  </li>
            <li>Product was &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; when I received it and worked fine.</li>
            <li>you apply sparingly, this formulation works fine.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly, price is very good, stock is fresh...have purchased the same item from cosmetic dentist for 3</li>
            <li>Yes it is strong and does work very well, but even if you follow all my advise, I will be honest</li>
            <li>Compared to the Watts 35% product in 10ml syringes, this is a huge ripoff.</li>
            <li>Works great, 4 tubes last 1 -1.5 applications per tube.</li>
            <li>People love to see my smile and comment</li>
            <li>results this product produces are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update if I think of anything else helpful or relevant..</li>
            <li>results this product produces are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update if I think of anything else helpful or relevant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet effective, unlike some harsher bleaches I have used.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It really is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I experienced no sensitivity on my teeth with the 35%, however; when the gel comes in contact with my gums, it burns and it turns it white.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, paint it on with a Q-tip, cover teeth with a tray or if nothing else, fit foil over them.</li>
            <li>My wife worked in a dental clinic and I got it free for years.</li>
            <li>This is extremely important.  </li>
            <li>This is important when buying online.  </li>
            <li>The price is great for that product, I&#x27;m using it for 4 days in the road and my tooth is already soo bright white ,I believe I will use only 2 more days .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to find it at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I bought one of this 35% before from different source and it worked great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I love that you only have to leave this product on for around 30 minutes and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>When I first used this, I thought, to myself &amp;#34;Well, 35% solution isn&#x27;t that strong, let&#x27;s go 3 hours.&amp;#34; There was a World&#x27;s Dumbest Marathon on TruTv, so I had nothing better to do, you know?</li>
            <li>Strong and super whitening</li>
            <li>very big thank you to Opalescence for giving me a new reason to smile! :D</li>
            <li>Overall this product was AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I was so excited while ordering this product</li>
            <li>Also, didn&#x27;t note remarkable difference is white.</li>
            <li>I have used Opalescence before and am very happy to be able to buy it online now as it is more expensive through my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it on amazon.</li>
            <li>I was originally given this product at my dentist&#x27;s office a five or six years ago, and decided that I&#x27;d like to brighten up the pearly whites again.  </li>
            <li>(GUARANTEED FRESH !)]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and had excellent results.  </li>
            <li>This product is MUCH too strong!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the gel (about 1/2 a syringe), I left it on for about 30 minutes and experienced very mild gum sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Great product, but don&#x27;t leave on teeth too long!</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and securely wrapped.</li>
            <li>The syringe makes it easy to put the product right where you want it.</li>
            <li>He will then take a special plastic that he heats up and vacume forms it on the mold.</li>
            <li>, the price is right!</li>
            <li>My teeth always look natural, vibrant, and like I&#x27;m really proud of them.</li>
            <li>Great , I see difference in the first application and it only took 30 min.</li>
            <li>My teeth look fabulous after just one treatment to brighten up my years of bleaching success.</li>
            <li>It as just as good as what you pay double for at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and am sure I will purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>and they gave me a full refund.  </li>
            <li>For those that aren&#x27;t sure of the expiration date coding, this quote is straight from Ultradent&#x27;s product sheet:  &amp;#34;Ultradent syringes have an expiration date stamped on the side of the syringe consisting of one letter and three numbers.  </li>
            <li>Aside from not working, toward the end I experienced very severe acute pain while using this, to the point that I threw away the remaining syringe and a half worth.</li>
            <li>This is pretty strong stuff.</li>
            <li>I had read the other reviews and thought this would be great for a quick alternative.</li>
            <li>Great product, but be very careful NOT to get it on your gums.  </li>
            <li>This one is faster, stronger, quick delivery, and affordable.</li>
            <li>you will get 16 uses which is enough to whiten both your top and bottom teeth 2 to 4 times more</li>
            <li>Make sure you have the time to apply appropriately and remove properly.</li>
            <li>Produce was shipped quickly and packaged well.    </li>
            <li>This particular product also has a mint taste - which is way better when pulling out of your mouth before brushing.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>Just be ceful and make sure the producty is fresh and real and that you keep it in the refridgerator.</li>
            <li>I get mild irritation on my gums for that duration.  </li>
            <li>Quick service too.</li>
            <li>The instructions that came with it said to leave 35% solution on for only 30 minutes, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe to leave it on for more than that.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and fast.</li>
            <li>It is much too strong and caused jolts of pain in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This gel is exactly what I was getting at my dentist and is a lot more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>A lil too strong but works very well.  </li>
            <li>The 35% is twice as strong and intense.  </li>
            <li>i love it so far!</li>
            <li>Thanks !!  </li>
            <li>The first two numbers are the month, and the third number is the last number of the year.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get smiling! :D</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this from my doctor at the triple the price!</li>
            <li>The price was much lower than my dentist wass going to charge me ($45 !! )</li>
            <li>that works great too, The directions say to leave it on 35 minutes, you can leave it a little longer, but it will bleach your gums, temporarily.</li>
            <li>the next day &amp; my teeth look amazing.  </li>
            <li>It definately has made my teeth more sensitive.   </li>
            <li>Nice to have an extra in case of a misfitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice to have an extra in case of a misfitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However i dont think that it was fresh, I didnt experience any of the burning or any pain that everyone keeps speaking of.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>oh well), my smile was like having your ipad brightness turned up to 100%.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>Mine were fresh as advertised.</li>
            <li>worth it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I use one tube once a month to keep my smile its brightest.  </li>
            <li>The most important number is the last - in this case &amp;#34;6&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>So powerful.</li>
            <li>The 35% if it is fresh will burn your gums off.</li>
            <li>Fresh</li>
            <li>Good way to clean your teething half the time.</li>
            <li>This does not seem like a fresh batch.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel fine again today, but the experience was highly concerning to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you use too much, the gel will ooze out and cause significant gum discomfort.</li>
            <li>I am using that right now.</li>
            <li>Returning right away.</li>
            <li>This whitening gel came right away, even with the holiday rush.</li>
            <li>Thank you, it came right away.</li>
            <li>more potent than your average whitening gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many of the reviewers, I was concerned by the apparent lack of the expiration date on the product packaging.</li>
            <li>The product arrives quickly, is exactly as advertised, and is fresh.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums get very sensitive for the rest of the day after doing it but after that I&#x27;m fine.  </li>
            <li>This is such an amazing product and is so much cheeper on amazon than the dentist.</li>
            <li>I like gentle products, even if it takes longer and more frequent use.</li>
            <li>After using it a few more times, I am now able to leave it on for about two hours with no sensitivity whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It takes more applications for the overall desired effect, but the pain management makes it absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>The product was fresh, and the gel had a better consistency than Venus White.</li>
            <li>It really brightens up my teeth, and quickly.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you see you dentist regularly to make sure there are no other dental problems before using.</li>
            <li>Very fast service.</li>
            <li>Here are some very simple tips for making sure it works for you without pain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first got this product from my dentist after coming off braces.</li>
            <li>I used up all 4 tubes at first.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried the 35% it burned my  gums .</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I applied it like I would the 15%.</li>
            <li>Try the 15% or 20% first.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase it from my dentist at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li>and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t (may be depending if I&#x27;ve eaten something hot that has irritated my gums already)</li>
            <li>and if you are a first time user</li>
            <li>I ordered the four pack this time to make sure that I was getting the correct thing and would definitely  recommend Opalescence products to anyone.</li>
            <li>Was amazed at how fast it got here!</li>
            <li>Exact product as pictured.</li>
            <li>Make sure to repeat this the next day or so.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give me extra sensitivity in the teeth, but be sure to wipe off with a tissue any accidental leaks on the gums.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off spending money on something over-the-counter from a big box store.</li>
            <li>I dug up some info on Ultradent&#x27;s website for another product line they have on the convention they use (and I&#x27;m presuming it is consistent across their product</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on how white my teeth are</li>
            <li>As many people have said my gums also turned white with blisters and took about 3days to heal...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad I gave this product a second chance.  </li>
            <li>too intense, burns your gums!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, it burned my gums..</li>
            <li>so i dont care much!</li>
            <li>Use it in your tray, and bleach for, at most 45 minutes, and your teeth will be pearly white.</li>
            <li>First, I forgot: I&#x27;m not a chemist.</li>
            <li>Well, the dentist said I am now in the top 1% of how white my teeth are compared to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased whitener on line.</li>
            <li>Leave it on for no longer than the recommended 30 minutes the first time to determine your sensitivity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My most recent order arrived May 30, 2014 and had R046 on the syringe, which means R&#x3D;Lot Identifier, 04&#x3D;April, and 6&#x3D;2016.  </li>
            <li>Product works exactly as decribed.  </li>
            <li>I always brush my teeth first with Sensodyne toothpaste to help with sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Only wish was that it came with better instructions and tips.</li>
            <li>My teeth were noticeably more white with Opalescence.</li>
            <li>First of all, the Opalescence Treatment should be started with a product called Boost.</li>
            <li>After it coms off the mold the dentist trims it to go to the gum line, exactly, which is why people are getting burned with home formed trays.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I use it</li>
            <li>This bleach really whitens the teeth!  </li>
            <li>I do believe this really works!  </li>
            <li>I got these after I got my first batch from my dentist.</li>
            <li>and I suggest that you read this if your interested in this product.  </li>
            <li>Be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are supposedly a higher percent than the syringes I received from my dentist.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and I&#x27;m aware that you are supposed to wipe off any access that gets onto your gums, but this is way easier said than done.</li>
            <li>After the first day I can see a difference.</li>
            <li>One tube and my teeth are very noticeably whiter!</li>
            <li>My teeth brighted up the first time.</li>
            <li>started whitening my top only to see if I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>This was a refill after getting the first pack from the dentist at three times the price.</li>
            <li>When all of us got together at the end and compared teeth, the Opalescence group looked far better than any of the other groups and of course better than the control group who just used whitening tooth paste.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re right on Ultradent&#x27;s website (a whole PDF file of instructions, in fact).</li>
            <li>Anyway, I assume that enamel is removed by using strong whitening products and the tooth will remain yellow if you drink coffee right afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was cleaning the tray well, but this product does have a nice gummy consistency, so I usually have to use a Qtip to clean my tray.  </li>
            <li>Very strong, be careful.</li>
            <li>careful it is VERY strong.</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The true instructions directly for the manufacturer and my dentist say anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>But as the other reviews said, it is very strong.</li>
            <li>The 35% product is very strong so you must be very careful</li>
            <li>I had used this product before, but not such a strong solution.  </li>
            <li>It is fast, easy, tastes good, very inexpensive, and gives me the exact results I want without fail.</li>
            <li>This is the first time using this particular brand and</li>
            <li>Loving this little whitening stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought some other whitening gel last year that I thought worked pretty good</li>
            <li>It worked like an absolute charm.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast.  </li>
            <li>Be warned, it can cause sensitive gums for 24-48 hours, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Works really well but stronge.</li>
            <li>This product is much stronger.</li>
            <li>My teeth are much whiter.</li>
            <li>This is very simular to what I get from the Dentist</li>
            <li>x&#x27;s as much</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I tried this whitening gel yesterday and was really upset.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommends a much lower % (11%).  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Just keep away from the gum line and enjoy whiter teeth in a very short period of time.</li>
            <li>This product really does whiten your teeth</li>
            <li>much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really does whiten your teeth</li>
            <li>much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really well have seen a difference already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this strength can be very tricky.  </li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and came well packaged.</li>
            <li>will keep buying it for the whole family.</li>
            <li>You put too much in.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 20% elsewhere that you could really feel the sting of the peroxide.</li>
            <li>My dentist gives me only 1 for free every 6 months.</li>
            <li>You absolutely need custom made dental trays for this stuff, as you don&#x27;t want it oozing up onto your gums.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seller:  Absolutely A+ for the company filling the order.  </li>
            <li>Ordering this online is so much cheaper than getting it from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>That way you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>This product works very well</li>
            <li>Then he will paint your gums with a fast setting polymer plastic that will protect your gums.</li>
            <li>It can work without the Boost, but it takes much longer and the results are not as uniform.</li>
            <li>I also went to College for Chemistry and know very well the dangers of 35% carbamide Peroxide which is like hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>This is a much cheaper route to take than the &amp;#34;white strips&amp;#34;  and works much better,  you get tons of uses out of it,  i  really only have to spend 40 dollars a year to keep a white smile after finding this product online.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than getting it from the dentist and lasts a longtime when refrigerated.  </li>
            <li>These are just like it and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Very unsure of the quality of this.  </li>
            <li>It works well but don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening difference.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much whitening going on</li>
            <li>made mine very sore and looked bleached out</li>
            <li>Perhaps the company that is shipping this isn&#x27;t the real deal or maybe they&#x27;ve changed their formula, either way don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>found.&lt;br /&gt;order came fast and will order again.</li>
            <li>I used water and my finger to wipe away the get fast off my gums.</li>
            <li>Very neatly packaged and expedited</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real dental office stuff.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>My dentist told me i shouldn&#x27;t whiten my teeth that much.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast as promised.  </li>
            <li>Really works...</li>
            <li>It does not take much so</li>
            <li>Also it has a thicker consistency which I really like as it stays on your teeth.</li>
            <li>If I put too much gel on my teeth, they start to burn.  </li>
            <li>The 35% gel definitely made my teeth more sensitive than the 15%</li>
            <li>It is very strong and my gums and teeth actually hurt today, from using it last night.</li>
            <li>Saw significant results after only a couple applications.</li>
            <li>And I received more comments in one month&#x27;s use with this product, than one month with the other brand.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t keep it on more than 30 minutes at a time due to sensitivity, but I do that</li>
            <li>At first it was very splochy and uneven, but the more I whitened them the nicer they looked.</li>
            <li>I like it even better than the other gel I purchased.  </li>
            <li>A great alternative to ZOOM which is pricey and doesn&#x27;t last very long, and I actually like the color this gives more---you can customize it.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well for the most part and isn&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
            <li>I only put a little bit into the tray thinking I&#x27;d avoid too much overflow and carefully wiped as best as I could the gum tissue.</li>
            <li>but the 35% is a little strong!</li>
            <li>This was very nice because I was anxious to try Opalescence after so, so results with Venus White Pro.</li>
            <li>Normally it doesn&#x27;t take much gel for it to overflow when I fill them.</li>
            <li>I love how fast this brand works, but I burn my gums nearly every time I use it - even after careful application.</li>
            <li>With the next syringe I&#x27;m going to try to put some cool wax on the tip before storing it in the fridge.  </li>
            <li>This whitiner left them more clean than starting but not white.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong, so less than 30</li>
            <li>Word if warning...be sure to clean any gel off of you gums because it does burn and make them white for a little while.  </li>
            <li>I live in CA and very close to wine country</li>
            <li>The company would do well to focus on quality control and spend less on the fancy packaging that probably costs more than the gel to manufacture.</li>
            <li>Why bother with the less potent version that you have to leave on longer?</li>
            <li>I never really got these kind of results from the white strips.  </li>
            <li>particular, it</li>
            <li>Also thought that I would more likely use the 35% especially if it only took 1 to 2 hours vs. the 8 hours overnight with the 20%.   </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the main benefits of using the stronger 35% solution: Reduced tray wear time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>4 of them to only be able to only use 2.  </li>
            <li>computer graphics LOL.I participated in a teeth whitening study and was lucky enough to get in the Opalescence group.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it so soooooo much more expensive from my Dentist.</li>
            <li>The main reasons people complain about this product on the reviews is because of the &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sizzling&amp;#34; they are feeling on their gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before with success but had gotten it straight from my dentist, same brand and strength and everything and never had this issue.</li>
            <li>As a smoker and coffee drinker who cares about his teeth (and overall appearance) I was looking for something to give me quick results without investing a lot of time or money.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Opalescence.</li>
            <li>But this one seems to be at too high of a percentage for me.</li>
            <li>defenitely i would not recommend for people with high sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt it.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it imediately after eating sharp foods like potato chips or after brushing your teeth when your gums are more sensitive.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to have worked but it was extremely too strong for my gums...  </li>
            <li>for the record, I have a very high pain tolerance (natural childbirth).</li>
            <li>Not for the faint at heart, but the result are great.  </li>
            <li>It works great and was not as expensive as the product I used to get from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>MY GUMS FELT NORMAL AGAIN.  </li>
            <li>I normally get my bleach from my Dentist but haven&#x27;t had time and ran out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waste in more ways than one.</li>
            <li>far as trays go, a standard custom mouth guard worked well, though obviously custom fitted trays from your dentist will work better.</li>
            <li>far as trays go, a standard custom mouth guard worked well, though obviously custom fitted trays from your dentist will work better.</li>
            <li>Be cautious getting it on your gums, it can really burn and turn the pink gum on top of your tooth white.  </li>
            <li>My teeth ended up very white, but make sure you watch how long you keep the trays in for.</li>
            <li>But its the same thing here it works just as good for much less!!</li>
            <li>However, the PDF instruction sheet that you can download directly from the Opalescence website, says specifically to not leave the 35% applied for more than a half an hour.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, each individual syringe lasts me at least five whitenings, and I only whiten maybe twice a month ~ making this a really good value!</li>
            <li>is better then the stiff we use</li>
            <li>I put it on and it started to brun my gums right away, I could only stand it for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The dentist will mix it right in front of you and it will turn red.</li>
            <li>but then the second and third time i used it my teeth were fine.</li>
            <li>I usually use once a month and it keeps my teeth looking a good, yet natural, white.</li>
            <li>..cant live without it.</li>
            <li>are my new notes for the 35% version:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>If you are new to teeth bleaching, I would suggest going with a weaker solution.</li>
            <li>Third, my teeth were so white that they light up a room.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it to anyone with very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Gums and teeth very sensitive after that.</li>
            <li>Can cause mild discomfort the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li>Dentist has exact same item for sale at $25 PER SYRINGE.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it irritates more sometimes</li>
            <li>First review I&#x27;ve written, but writing to warn people that there are only about 4 applications (1/tube) in this package.  </li>
            <li>first using the 35%, I left it on for about two hours, and I did experience some sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I feel so ripped off paying $20 per tube at the dentist for the EXACT same syringe!  </li>
            <li>Could see big improvement after first use.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this specific brand by my Dentist, and prefer the 35% compared to higher to limit pain during use.</li>
            <li>however your teeth may get sensitive!  </li>
            <li>As such you should get it the first time at the dentist where you will be taught how to use it.</li>
            <li>The syringes and box look exactly the same except for the tip.</li>
            <li>I have used 1 tube so far and it has whitened my teeth quite a bit already!</li>
            <li>Bought this to change it up from my normal teeth whitening gel, I&#x27;m not missing out on anything.</li>
            <li>My dentist supplies this same exact whitening gel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s higher in potency that what your dentist probably provided with those custom trays that ended up setting you back $350.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The solution is really strong, so if you have sensitive gums, I would suggest going with something a bit less in percentage.  </li>
            <li>This is very strong and powerful stuff, my gums are burning and it&#x27;s rather uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>My husband tried the gel and realized only then that he had a sensitive tooth he wasn&#x27;t aware of.</li>
            <li>This is so strong that it took the skin on a few layers off my gumsand hurt like hell as a chemical burn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m having a hard time getting my teeth nice and white, as I hoped for with the Opalescence and they are slightly yellow after 8 syringes of the 16% and 3 syringes of the 35% -- much better than before, but definitely not \\&quot;The Rock\\&quot; white.</li>
            <li>I eventually got a little paintbrush and painted the gel on my teeth and that seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li>My gums turned extremely white and I could not get it off quick enough.</li>
            <li>This is pretty powerful stuff, especially compared to the last time I whitened my teeth with Day White 7%.  </li>
            <li>I just got my braces off and got clear retainers</li>
            <li>but I must make clear that I use the  custom made trays from the dents office.</li>
            <li>Spend the $50 or so as a one time fee at your dentist and have a professional molded tray made of your teeth to use with this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought the same product from my dentist who charged me 4 times as much.  </li>
            <li>This product really works, however I think there should be very definite warnings about</li>
            <li>The pain was considerable, albeit short-lived.</li>
            <li>you risk damaging your gums &amp; having to deal with sensitive teeth for a while.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too much work to find uninterrupted 30 min of tooth cleaning where you can&#x27;t eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li>Just a note that the instructions for the Opalescence 35% direct the user to keep this product on their teeth for 30 minutes (one-half hour).</li>
            <li>Your teeth will be a bit sensitive immediately upon application.</li>
            <li>Try to get the professional strips from your dentist, if you rather spare yourself the expense of custom trays.</li>
            <li>Gel will naturally move to cover teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a big deal really.</li>
            <li>(The reason being I have nerve damage on my front tooth that ZOOM made too apparent, and it tools months for my teeth to look normal again.</li>
            <li>My real concern came later as my teeth were aching (it felt like the pain was radiating all the way to the roots)</li>
            <li>I am a dental professional, and have this product in lower dose in office .</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums, but the gel didn&#x27;t bother them at all.</li>
            <li>Using sensitive toothpaste before and after helps reduce sensitivity.</li>
            <li>So you teeth are whiter but still look natural.</li>
            <li>A professional tray helps keep the gel off the gums rather than a store bought tray.  </li>
            <li>It may be an old batch that has lost it&#x27;s potency.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth (but I have been using this product for years) and leave mine in for about 15-20 mins.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth be prepared for some pain after bleaching.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend getting some sensitive toothpaste to use BEFORE and AFTER bleaching.  </li>
            <li>U dont need much- just a tiny dot over each tooth.</li>
            <li>When I purchase it from my dentist it is clearly marked with an expression date and this one had none.  </li>
            <li>Or they put too much in the tray and don&#x27;t wipe off the extra that comes out onto your gums after putting the tray onto your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had my trays made professionally years ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this directly from the dentist office before for 5x&#x27;s the price.  </li>
            <li>It really burns your gums if you use it for the entire time you are suppose to.</li>
            <li>Unless you have been advised by a professional dentist I would recommend using the 20%.</li>
            <li>will be so sensitive after.</li>
            <li>WOW .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using an old tray that was fitted by a dentist.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Any dentist will explain to you that bleach at this concentration WILL burn your soft tissue (gums &amp; tongue).</li>
            <li>I tried the gel again a few days later and made DARN sure none of it touched my gums.  </li>
            <li>The 35 % is not meant to be left on for more than 30 minutes a round</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m just curious if this was fresh or not.</li>
            <li>The other important thing is the following.  </li>
            <li>2 days later my healthy gums are still bleeding and my lips are still blistered, raw, and swollen.</li>
            <li>Pick these up at more than half that cost!!!</li>
            <li>, I only put the product in the trays for the top 6 and bottom 6 teeth and put in very little</li>
            <li>This is the exact same brand and worked the same as the gel I received for the dentist!</li>
            <li>Be sure, when using the 35% gel, that you only leave it on with the tray for no more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Opalescence PF has a high amount of floride in it and has been shown in studies to be the only whitener that strenthens enamel and reduces sensitivity.</li>
            <li>This whitens like no other!</li>
            <li>I was able to use the gel since it was too strong and my gum and tongue was burning really bad.</li>
            <li>You do have to be super careful not to get this on your gums as it burns instantly.</li>
            <li>Bad economy, but beautiful teeth.</li>
            <li>I am finally back to normal.  </li>
            <li>It can cause a little sensitivity, which has happened to me, but the sensitivity decreases quickly.  </li>
            <li>People asked me what if I was using a new lipstick today - my lips were so swollen and red.</li>
            <li>If it takes 12-20 weeks, at least it is easy to maintain after you get to the desired whiteness.</li>
            <li>I have only left in on for 15-20 minutes &amp; it works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather go for the less powerful system that I can use overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>At first it made my gums sensative but after about using it twice it subsided, long store short</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth you may want to go with 20% as this will definitely bleach your gums and make them sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, it goes away after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are still the same color they used to be my gum are now burn and teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I initially thought it was hurting, but after chilling out for about 30 seconds I noticed that it was more of a generally funny feeling and that it didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li>The 35% is ONLY for a quick, 1 hour or less, touch up before a date or whatever.</li>
            <li>After reading a lot of other positive reviews here, I decided to purchase a 4-pack along with a molded mouth-guard to try them out.</li>
            <li>It is much stronger than the OTC stuff and should be dealt with carefully.</li>
            <li>if one is not careful.  </li>
            <li>and it did not make my teeth sensitive until later on during the day.</li>
            <li>Just be careful about how much product that you place in the tray each time and you won&#x27;t burn your mouth.</li>
            <li>It can make your teeth sensitive but that is short lived.</li>
            <li>So far, the only visible change is the sore on my bleached gums...</li>
            <li>I received this item much faster than the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>cleaned professionally first or youwill end up bleaching placque and when it gets scraped off you will have a dark spot underneath.</li>
            <li>But if you know you have sensitive teeth, might opt for something different!</li>
            <li>My last whitening was 4 years ago when I had a professional tray made and my Dentist recommended and gave me 35% Opalescence.  </li>
            <li>I have also used a Q-Tip to apply the product to my front teeth without a tray, early on when my gums were really red.</li>
            <li>I spent $25 a tube for exactly the same product at my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I did not use the full amount of one because my teeth are small.</li>
            <li>and have always noticed mediocre results while being kind of a PITA to use.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a major difference and had several positive comments from friends/family after doing the 2nd round of 10 days.</li>
            <li>I originally got 16% product from the dentist, which did hardly anything.  </li>
            <li>It worked fast and was extremely affordable.</li>
            <li>Need to be very careful with the 35% so that you don&#x27;t fill the trays with too much product.  </li>
            <li>Fast acting with minimal time required to keep it on your teeth.</li>
            <li>For the next day, whenever I managed to grin and bare through the pain (get it!</li>
            <li>and I would recommend using it at least two days before a special event.  </li>
            <li>It was expensive, so when I found the brand at such cheap prices here on Amazon, I thought I&#x27;d found a real bargain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:I barely used enough to cover the inside of the teeth mold.</li>
            <li>The product is no doubt past the sell-by date or it wouldn&#x27;t be so heavily discounted, but when my gumlime immediately began to tingle - then sting - with first use, I thought that meant the product was fresh enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend the product to other people.</li>
            <li>This product and really burn your gums if you leave it on over a half an hour.</li>
            <li>Did not feel like it was doing much because my previous experience had me feeling a tingle in the gums</li>
            <li>A small driblet goes a long way; I apply a drop of about 0.5-1 mm on each tooth, and each syringe allows me about 3 full mouth applications.</li>
            <li>I normally kept the 15% on my teeth overnight but had to remove the 35% within 30 minutes due to the pain and discomfort.</li>
            <li>The 35% solution is much stronger than the other versions, and hence, you don&#x27;t need to leave it applied for so long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the gels before and it should not burn you no matter how little or how much you use.</li>
            <li>It is a little too intense for me, burns my gums if any touches them.  </li>

            <li> The seller was very nice and answered my question within 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it was very effective.</li>
            <li> Works very nicely.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> This is a remarkable deal and one I will continue to take advantage of.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product because it produces great results.</li>

            <li> Great buy! :)</li>
            <li> Strong - and great product!</li>
            <li> This is very strong whitening gel!  </li>
            <li> but beware, it is very strong!</li>
            <li> Good, just don&#x27;t get it on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good price for this as well...</li>
            <li> Remember that what is good for one person is not for another.</li>
            <li> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD DEAL...</li>
            <li> So since the price was so good, I decided to kick it up a couple of notches.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since you won&#x27;t be licking your lips or swallowing for a while, I like to apply a bit of chapstick to my lips, and have a good drink of water before getting</li>
            <li> Good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good as the one I get from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Works good as directed, good product.</li>
            <li> A good friend of mine who is also a dental hygienist recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> and I know if it were good it would do</li>
            <li> Good product, works well, but a word of warning.</li>
            <li> good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using the 15% and was not getting the results I wanted, so I thought the 35% would be good.</li>
            <li> Works good on teeth do not get on Gums or put in a bleaching trays.</li>
            <li> have had good results with what I have purchased here and intend to buy again.</li>
            <li> I think once opened, the syringes are not as good, judging from the foaming and gum burn.  </li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> just as good as my dentist sells</li>
            <li> Vendor provided prompt delivery, and prduct received in excellent conditions with full instructions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome quick whitening trick.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results, and will definately reorder.</li>
            <li> I happily use the 40% gel I get from my dentist, but I will buy the 35% from Amazon for a better price and save a trip to the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> This whitener works great, just make sure it doesn&#x27;t get on your gums because it will burn and get irritated.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, just make sure you have the correct mouth pieces made or you will defiantly burn your gums.  </li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this product .</li>
            <li> , I thought it was just 2 , so I was very pleased with that surprise.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product for whitening,  but make sure you get some kind of sensitivity gel to use after.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this brand for about 7 years, love it!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic alternative!!  </li>
            <li> So glad Amazon carries them!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> After about two tubes of this, they&#x27;re amazingly brighter and whiter.  </li>
            <li> product is amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and effective.  </li>
            <li> This really is the best teeth bleach on the market in my opinion</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see how anyone could rate this product as effective.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that &amp;#34;use 35% for 30 minutes only&amp;#34; be highlighted.</li>
            <li> I always use this kind for my teeth</li>
            <li> Great for a really bright smile.</li>
            <li> I have always used this brand of whitener and have liked it.  </li>
            <li> But might not be as effective.</li>
            <li> That said, this is effective and got my shade where I wanted without day after day of treatment like the lighter strengths.</li>
            <li> That was my own fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice flavor.</li>
            <li> I witnessed this happening to my own tooth, as a temporary crown was placed on my tooth while the student-dentist (Baylor Dental College) took forever (2 months) to make the permanent one.  </li>
            <li> It was hardly touching my gums at all as I was good to wipe out the excess amount.</li>
            <li> Works great, but very powerful.  </li>
            <li> If you make your own teeth trays( the boil and suck kind) then consider drawing on them with a very fine point permanat marker along the gum line.</li>
            <li> First of all Opalescence is a very good product, it is the strength of this whitening solution that is the problem.</li>
            <li> Great product; wonderfully-priced; arrived quickly and undamaged! :-)</li>
            <li> Does a great job and is done quickly.  </li>
            <li> great product shipped quickly</li>
            <li> These worked great and in a quick time.</li>
            <li> This 35% is very strong.</li>
            <li> concentration of 35 % is very strong and gives sensitivity to teeth and it can burn ur gums if gel escape trays.</li>
            <li> Very easy to push out and to get it into the mold without making a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works but a very strong taste so that may off set the savings for some</li>
            <li> I have used this twice, and it is very strong.</li>
            <li> This gel is very strong.  </li>
            <li> This product costs so MUCH MORE whenever I&#x27;ve bought it at The Dentist&#x27;s Office, so I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to get it so inexpensively through mail order! :-)</li>
            <li> Opalescence is far and away the best tooth whitener on the market.  </li>
            <li> And you can count on this being an honest and truthful review.  </li>
            <li> Whiter smile, works great.</li>
            <li> One of the most amazing things about Opalescence besides the fact that it strengthens your teeth is how it makes the shine and glisten like pearls.</li>
            <li> It whitens to a nice, bright shade quickly, and with no irritation or burning of the gums.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely strong!</li>
            <li> Have used the lower percentage gel with no problem, but this one is too strong, worry that it&#x27;s eating away my enamel!</li>
            <li> The 35% is really good as I find I do not have to whiten my teeth as often which is good because I do not want to run the risk of doing it too much.</li>
            <li> Have a REAL custom tray made of your teeth so that it is a perfect fit and does not overlap onto your gums.  </li>
            <li> I knew the price was to good to be true.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if something seems too good to be true......</li>
            <li> It is very important that you use this product with a mouth guard that is specifically made for your teeth or it will burn your gums because its not meant to go on your gums.</li>
            <li> Effective, tastes fine, doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of the top whitening systems and toothpastes, but this is probably the best you&#x27;ll find outside of a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody has though my teeth look like veneers, but I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in the whiteness.</li>
            <li> OK, so this product will whiten your teeth like nothing else for the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again...this product works phenomenally well when used correctly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s incredibly potent strength.</li>
            <li> I accidentally overfilled my bleaching tray to where some of the gel squished out of the top and touched my gums.</li>
            <li> this price is much better  than my dentist sells it for.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I would use this seller again :)</li>
            <li> If so I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> , I was so glad that it was sold on amazon</li>
            <li> LOve</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest leaving product on for more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Do not leave the gel on for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Do not do more than one treatment in a day.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend the moldable trays since you can not keep the gel from touching your gums when you insert them.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, one of the mouth spreaders (lack of a better or correct word) like the dentists use is a much better device.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m staying with the lower percent solution and doing it more often.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into pain, so I plan on being much more conservative in my approach.  </li>
            <li> More is NOT always better.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;ve used whitening strips from the store, that would be better than this.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> I could not wear this product for more than 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I am able to wear the 20% all night without any sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> Did cause sensitivity and I recommend using a mold able whitening tray.</li>
            <li> Works great and much cheaper to buy here than from the dentist</li>
            <li> I should have done more research on the percentages.</li>
            <li> overall very happy with product for the lower percentages.</li>
            <li> I love this product .</li>
            <li> I seemed to have better luck with that one than this one that I bought.</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue to buy as it has given me the best results of any teeth whitening product I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I worked in dental hygiene for many years and this is what we used as a whitening product for our patients.</li>
            <li> The latest purchase has an expiration date of D115 on the syringes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to switch to something more reliable.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when required as needed.</li>
            <li> it works better for me because you can do it while sleeping</li>
            <li> It is better than the $100+ stuff that your dentist sells you.</li>
            <li> make sure you do not have any periodontal gum issues.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> Warnings:  As many others have stated, the 35% is not for the uneducated.  </li>
            <li> I will begin a more strict regimen of applying this stuff</li>
            <li> Buy it and you will love it.</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars if the percentages were better explained.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the bleaching gel.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it on for more than one hour</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the highest quality after reading some of the reviews, but it surpassed my expectations.  </li>
            <li> and my teeth are now many shades whiter and brighter.  </li>
            <li> It is stronger and does irritate gums more than 20% but is Ok.</li>
            <li> one is more.</li>
            <li> This name brand is what all reputable dentists use.</li>
            <li> The company would be well advised to save money on the fancy packaging and give more product and maintain better quality control.</li>
            <li> It works better than anything else i have used.  </li>
            <li> Works like a charm :)</li>
            <li> I like this whitening gel ok, but like others said, it does burn the gums some.  </li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like 15% rather than 35%.  </li>
            <li> Can burn gums if not used with a well fitting custom tray.</li>
            <li> This identical product was recommended by my dentist and to me to me at more than 3x the price as Amazon.</li>
            <li> It would be great if the manufacturer put marks on the syringe which shows 30% / 50% marks to show how much you have expressed into the teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will perhaps post a follow up after I have used this for a couple more days.</li>
            <li> sure you start out at your dentist.  </li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t leave the tray in for more than 1 hour.  </li>
            <li> but i sure did notice the thickness of the gel.</li>
            <li> Much better deal going thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I Will be buying more of this again</li>
            <li> Love this whitening gel.&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is an outstanding value.</li>
            <li> they all love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
            <li> Great, fast results.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m satisfied with the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to keep the 35% in my mouth for overnight use like I am with the 15%.  </li>
            <li> and i couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the performance.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.  </li>
            <li> - the rest of your life is even better</li>
            <li> and I saw how my precious tooth darkened over time while I was waiting for this student to make the permanent crown.  </li>
            <li> I do not leave on for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Probably should have called to ask what an appropriate % is beforehand.  </li>
            <li> I first got it from my dentist and it cost me $150 for a four pack so the $10 or so price you can get it for on here IS A KILLER DEAL!!!</li>
            <li> But, honestly after the three days in a row i used it my teeth looked significantly whiter</li>
            <li> This stuff is actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> it worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is so worth it!!</li>
            <li> A very good product, have been using it for ten yrs.</li>
            <li> The real strength is what others are complaining about; very strong!</li>
            <li> Be careful and happy smiling!</li>
            <li> On the syringe you will see (towards the top of the gel filled area, below the pump handle) a cryptic 4 digit number/letter combination.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good just don&#x27;t do it too much it burns your gums.</li>
            <li> Anything that burns your tissue this much cannot be good for it.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, beware of using too much because it can damage your gums.</li>
            <li> This product will cause significant pain along your gum line when used appropriately.</li>
            <li> The results are wonderful without the gum irritation you get with other brands.</li>
            <li> and it came very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing how great it works and my teeth are super white.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> I can appreciate a thicker gel as too runny would cause it to smear off easily on trays</li>
            <li> having used the 20% gel purchased from my dentist, I found the  35% gel too strong.  </li>
            <li> It is strong and has the ability to \\&quot;burn\\</li>
            <li> too strong.</li>
            <li> I know some reviews said it was really strong.</li>
            <li> 35% is as strong as it comes.</li>
            <li> because I didn&#x27;t realize how strong this was.  </li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you buy the Strong stuff.  </li>
            <li> This opalescent 35% was a bit too strong.  </li>
            <li> I got this thinking why not go strong.</li>
            <li> Would never buy this strong again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong so</li>
            <li> Please beware, this is too strong,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a solution this strong.</li>
            <li> 35% is way too strong, I don&#x27;t know how anyone can use this.</li>
            <li> It is as strong as the stuff from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Be warned, though, to keep it off of your gum&#x27;s as it is strong.</li>
            <li> This was way too strong of a product for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you have a hot date or special event and need to whiten super fast!!!</li>
            <li> Will review ASAP, but assume it&#x27;s going to be just fine.</li>
            <li> This time, it worked just fine for me and will buy again.  </li>
            <li> Product was &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; when I received it and worked fine.</li>
            <li> you apply sparingly, this formulation works fine.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, price is very good, stock is fresh...have purchased the same item from cosmetic dentist for 3</li>
            <li> Yes it is strong and does work very well, but even if you follow all my advise, I will be honest</li>
            <li> Compared to the Watts 35% product in 10ml syringes, this is a huge ripoff.</li>
            <li> Works great, 4 tubes last 1 -1.5 applications per tube.</li>
            <li> People love to see my smile and comment</li>
            <li> results this product produces are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update if I think of anything else helpful or relevant..</li>
            <li> results this product produces are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update if I think of anything else helpful or relevant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet effective, unlike some harsher bleaches I have used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It really is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I experienced no sensitivity on my teeth with the 35%, however; when the gel comes in contact with my gums, it burns and it turns it white.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, paint it on with a Q-tip, cover teeth with a tray or if nothing else, fit foil over them.</li>
            <li> My wife worked in a dental clinic and I got it free for years.</li>
            <li> This is extremely important.  </li>
            <li> This is important when buying online.  </li>
            <li> The price is great for that product, I&#x27;m using it for 4 days in the road and my tooth is already soo bright white ,I believe I will use only 2 more days .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to find it at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I bought one of this 35% before from different source and it worked great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I love that you only have to leave this product on for around 30 minutes and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I thought, to myself &amp;#34;Well, 35% solution isn&#x27;t that strong, let&#x27;s go 3 hours.&amp;#34; There was a World&#x27;s Dumbest Marathon on TruTv, so I had nothing better to do, you know?</li>
            <li> Strong and super whitening</li>
            <li> very big thank you to Opalescence for giving me a new reason to smile! :D</li>
            <li> Overall this product was AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I was so excited while ordering this product</li>
            <li> Also, didn&#x27;t note remarkable difference is white.</li>
            <li> I have used Opalescence before and am very happy to be able to buy it online now as it is more expensive through my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I was originally given this product at my dentist&#x27;s office a five or six years ago, and decided that I&#x27;d like to brighten up the pearly whites again.  </li>
            <li> (GUARANTEED FRESH !)]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and had excellent results.  </li>
            <li> This product is MUCH too strong!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the gel (about 1/2 a syringe), I left it on for about 30 minutes and experienced very mild gum sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Great product, but don&#x27;t leave on teeth too long!</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and securely wrapped.</li>
            <li> The syringe makes it easy to put the product right where you want it.</li>
            <li> He will then take a special plastic that he heats up and vacume forms it on the mold.</li>
            <li> , the price is right!</li>
            <li> My teeth always look natural, vibrant, and like I&#x27;m really proud of them.</li>
            <li> Great , I see difference in the first application and it only took 30 min.</li>
            <li> My teeth look fabulous after just one treatment to brighten up my years of bleaching success.</li>
            <li> It as just as good as what you pay double for at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and am sure I will purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> and they gave me a full refund.  </li>
            <li> For those that aren&#x27;t sure of the expiration date coding, this quote is straight from Ultradent&#x27;s product sheet:  &amp;#34;Ultradent syringes have an expiration date stamped on the side of the syringe consisting of one letter and three numbers.  </li>
            <li> Aside from not working, toward the end I experienced very severe acute pain while using this, to the point that I threw away the remaining syringe and a half worth.</li>
            <li> This is pretty strong stuff.</li>
            <li> I had read the other reviews and thought this would be great for a quick alternative.</li>
            <li> Great product, but be very careful NOT to get it on your gums.  </li>
            <li> This one is faster, stronger, quick delivery, and affordable.</li>
            <li> you will get 16 uses which is enough to whiten both your top and bottom teeth 2 to 4 times more</li>
            <li> Make sure you have the time to apply appropriately and remove properly.</li>
            <li> Produce was shipped quickly and packaged well.    </li>
            <li> This particular product also has a mint taste - which is way better when pulling out of your mouth before brushing.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> Just be ceful and make sure the producty is fresh and real and that you keep it in the refridgerator.</li>
            <li> I get mild irritation on my gums for that duration.  </li>
            <li> Quick service too.</li>
            <li> The instructions that came with it said to leave 35% solution on for only 30 minutes, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe to leave it on for more than that.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and fast.</li>
            <li> It is much too strong and caused jolts of pain in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This gel is exactly what I was getting at my dentist and is a lot more reasonable.  </li>
            <li> A lil too strong but works very well.  </li>
            <li> The 35% is twice as strong and intense.  </li>
            <li> i love it so far!</li>
            <li> Thanks !!  </li>
            <li> The first two numbers are the month, and the third number is the last number of the year.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get smiling! :D</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this from my doctor at the triple the price!</li>
            <li> The price was much lower than my dentist wass going to charge me ($45 !! )</li>
            <li> that works great too, The directions say to leave it on 35 minutes, you can leave it a little longer, but it will bleach your gums, temporarily.</li>
            <li> the next day &amp; my teeth look amazing.  </li>
            <li> It definately has made my teeth more sensitive.   </li>
            <li> Nice to have an extra in case of a misfitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice to have an extra in case of a misfitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However i dont think that it was fresh, I didnt experience any of the burning or any pain that everyone keeps speaking of.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li> oh well), my smile was like having your ipad brightness turned up to 100%.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> Mine were fresh as advertised.</li>
            <li> worth it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use one tube once a month to keep my smile its brightest.  </li>
            <li> The most important number is the last - in this case &amp;#34;6&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> So powerful.</li>
            <li> The 35% if it is fresh will burn your gums off.</li>
            <li> Fresh</li>
            <li> Good way to clean your teething half the time.</li>
            <li> This does not seem like a fresh batch.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel fine again today, but the experience was highly concerning to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you use too much, the gel will ooze out and cause significant gum discomfort.</li>
            <li> I am using that right now.</li>
            <li> Returning right away.</li>
            <li> This whitening gel came right away, even with the holiday rush.</li>
            <li> Thank you, it came right away.</li>
            <li> more potent than your average whitening gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers, I was concerned by the apparent lack of the expiration date on the product packaging.</li>
            <li> The product arrives quickly, is exactly as advertised, and is fresh.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums get very sensitive for the rest of the day after doing it but after that I&#x27;m fine.  </li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product and is so much cheeper on amazon than the dentist.</li>
            <li> I like gentle products, even if it takes longer and more frequent use.</li>
            <li> After using it a few more times, I am now able to leave it on for about two hours with no sensitivity whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It takes more applications for the overall desired effect, but the pain management makes it absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> The product was fresh, and the gel had a better consistency than Venus White.</li>
            <li> It really brightens up my teeth, and quickly.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you see you dentist regularly to make sure there are no other dental problems before using.</li>
            <li> Very fast service.</li>
            <li> Here are some very simple tips for making sure it works for you without pain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first got this product from my dentist after coming off braces.</li>
            <li> I used up all 4 tubes at first.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried the 35% it burned my  gums .</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I applied it like I would the 15%.</li>
            <li> Try the 15% or 20% first.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase it from my dentist at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t (may be depending if I&#x27;ve eaten something hot that has irritated my gums already)</li>
            <li> and if you are a first time user</li>
            <li> I ordered the four pack this time to make sure that I was getting the correct thing and would definitely  recommend Opalescence products to anyone.</li>
            <li> Was amazed at how fast it got here!</li>
            <li> Exact product as pictured.</li>
            <li> Make sure to repeat this the next day or so.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me extra sensitivity in the teeth, but be sure to wipe off with a tissue any accidental leaks on the gums.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off spending money on something over-the-counter from a big box store.</li>
            <li> I dug up some info on Ultradent&#x27;s website for another product line they have on the convention they use (and I&#x27;m presuming it is consistent across their product</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on how white my teeth are</li>
            <li> As many people have said my gums also turned white with blisters and took about 3days to heal...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad I gave this product a second chance.  </li>
            <li> too intense, burns your gums!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it burned my gums..</li>
            <li> so i dont care much!</li>
            <li> Use it in your tray, and bleach for, at most 45 minutes, and your teeth will be pearly white.</li>
            <li> First, I forgot: I&#x27;m not a chemist.</li>
            <li> Well, the dentist said I am now in the top 1% of how white my teeth are compared to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased whitener on line.</li>
            <li> Leave it on for no longer than the recommended 30 minutes the first time to determine your sensitivity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My most recent order arrived May 30, 2014 and had R046 on the syringe, which means R&#x3D;Lot Identifier, 04&#x3D;April, and 6&#x3D;2016.  </li>
            <li> Product works exactly as decribed.  </li>
            <li> I always brush my teeth first with Sensodyne toothpaste to help with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Only wish was that it came with better instructions and tips.</li>
            <li> My teeth were noticeably more white with Opalescence.</li>
            <li> First of all, the Opalescence Treatment should be started with a product called Boost.</li>
            <li> After it coms off the mold the dentist trims it to go to the gum line, exactly, which is why people are getting burned with home formed trays.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I use it</li>
            <li> This bleach really whitens the teeth!  </li>
            <li> I do believe this really works!  </li>
            <li> I got these after I got my first batch from my dentist.</li>
            <li> and I suggest that you read this if your interested in this product.  </li>
            <li> Be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are supposedly a higher percent than the syringes I received from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and I&#x27;m aware that you are supposed to wipe off any access that gets onto your gums, but this is way easier said than done.</li>
            <li> After the first day I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> One tube and my teeth are very noticeably whiter!</li>
            <li> My teeth brighted up the first time.</li>
            <li> started whitening my top only to see if I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li> This was a refill after getting the first pack from the dentist at three times the price.</li>
            <li> When all of us got together at the end and compared teeth, the Opalescence group looked far better than any of the other groups and of course better than the control group who just used whitening tooth paste.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re right on Ultradent&#x27;s website (a whole PDF file of instructions, in fact).</li>
            <li> Anyway, I assume that enamel is removed by using strong whitening products and the tooth will remain yellow if you drink coffee right afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was cleaning the tray well, but this product does have a nice gummy consistency, so I usually have to use a Qtip to clean my tray.  </li>
            <li> Very strong, be careful.</li>
            <li> careful it is VERY strong.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The true instructions directly for the manufacturer and my dentist say anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> But as the other reviews said, it is very strong.</li>
            <li> The 35% product is very strong so you must be very careful</li>
            <li> I had used this product before, but not such a strong solution.  </li>
            <li> It is fast, easy, tastes good, very inexpensive, and gives me the exact results I want without fail.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this particular brand and</li>
            <li> Loving this little whitening stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought some other whitening gel last year that I thought worked pretty good</li>
            <li> It worked like an absolute charm.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast.  </li>
            <li> Be warned, it can cause sensitive gums for 24-48 hours, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Works really well but stronge.</li>
            <li> This product is much stronger.</li>
            <li> My teeth are much whiter.</li>
            <li> This is very simular to what I get from the Dentist</li>
            <li> x&#x27;s as much</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I tried this whitening gel yesterday and was really upset.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends a much lower % (11%).  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Just keep away from the gum line and enjoy whiter teeth in a very short period of time.</li>
            <li> This product really does whiten your teeth</li>
            <li> much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really does whiten your teeth</li>
            <li> much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works really well have seen a difference already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this strength can be very tricky.  </li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and came well packaged.</li>
            <li> will keep buying it for the whole family.</li>
            <li> You put too much in.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 20% elsewhere that you could really feel the sting of the peroxide.</li>
            <li> My dentist gives me only 1 for free every 6 months.</li>
            <li> You absolutely need custom made dental trays for this stuff, as you don&#x27;t want it oozing up onto your gums.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seller:  Absolutely A+ for the company filling the order.  </li>
            <li> Ordering this online is so much cheaper than getting it from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> That way you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> This product works very well</li>
            <li> Then he will paint your gums with a fast setting polymer plastic that will protect your gums.</li>
            <li> It can work without the Boost, but it takes much longer and the results are not as uniform.</li>
            <li> I also went to College for Chemistry and know very well the dangers of 35% carbamide Peroxide which is like hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> This is a much cheaper route to take than the &amp;#34;white strips&amp;#34;  and works much better,  you get tons of uses out of it,  i  really only have to spend 40 dollars a year to keep a white smile after finding this product online.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than getting it from the dentist and lasts a longtime when refrigerated.  </li>
            <li> These are just like it and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Very unsure of the quality of this.  </li>
            <li> It works well but don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much whitening going on</li>
            <li> made mine very sore and looked bleached out</li>
            <li> Perhaps the company that is shipping this isn&#x27;t the real deal or maybe they&#x27;ve changed their formula, either way don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> found.&lt;br /&gt;order came fast and will order again.</li>
            <li> I used water and my finger to wipe away the get fast off my gums.</li>
            <li> Very neatly packaged and expedited</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real dental office stuff.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me i shouldn&#x27;t whiten my teeth that much.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast as promised.  </li>
            <li> Really works...</li>
            <li> It does not take much so</li>
            <li> Also it has a thicker consistency which I really like as it stays on your teeth.</li>
            <li> If I put too much gel on my teeth, they start to burn.  </li>
            <li> The 35% gel definitely made my teeth more sensitive than the 15%</li>
            <li> It is very strong and my gums and teeth actually hurt today, from using it last night.</li>
            <li> Saw significant results after only a couple applications.</li>
            <li> And I received more comments in one month&#x27;s use with this product, than one month with the other brand.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t keep it on more than 30 minutes at a time due to sensitivity, but I do that</li>
            <li> At first it was very splochy and uneven, but the more I whitened them the nicer they looked.</li>
            <li> I like it even better than the other gel I purchased.  </li>
            <li> A great alternative to ZOOM which is pricey and doesn&#x27;t last very long, and I actually like the color this gives more---you can customize it.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for the most part and isn&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
            <li> I only put a little bit into the tray thinking I&#x27;d avoid too much overflow and carefully wiped as best as I could the gum tissue.</li>
            <li> but the 35% is a little strong!</li>
            <li> This was very nice because I was anxious to try Opalescence after so, so results with Venus White Pro.</li>
            <li> Normally it doesn&#x27;t take much gel for it to overflow when I fill them.</li>
            <li> I love how fast this brand works, but I burn my gums nearly every time I use it - even after careful application.</li>
            <li> With the next syringe I&#x27;m going to try to put some cool wax on the tip before storing it in the fridge.  </li>
            <li> This whitiner left them more clean than starting but not white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong, so less than 30</li>
            <li> Word if warning...be sure to clean any gel off of you gums because it does burn and make them white for a little while.  </li>
            <li> I live in CA and very close to wine country</li>
            <li> The company would do well to focus on quality control and spend less on the fancy packaging that probably costs more than the gel to manufacture.</li>
            <li> Why bother with the less potent version that you have to leave on longer?</li>
            <li> I never really got these kind of results from the white strips.  </li>
            <li> particular, it</li>
            <li> Also thought that I would more likely use the 35% especially if it only took 1 to 2 hours vs. the 8 hours overnight with the 20%.   </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one of the main benefits of using the stronger 35% solution: Reduced tray wear time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4 of them to only be able to only use 2.  </li>
            <li> computer graphics LOL.I participated in a teeth whitening study and was lucky enough to get in the Opalescence group.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it so soooooo much more expensive from my Dentist.</li>
            <li> The main reasons people complain about this product on the reviews is because of the &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sizzling&amp;#34; they are feeling on their gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before with success but had gotten it straight from my dentist, same brand and strength and everything and never had this issue.</li>
            <li> As a smoker and coffee drinker who cares about his teeth (and overall appearance) I was looking for something to give me quick results without investing a lot of time or money.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Opalescence.</li>
            <li> But this one seems to be at too high of a percentage for me.</li>
            <li> defenitely i would not recommend for people with high sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt it.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it imediately after eating sharp foods like potato chips or after brushing your teeth when your gums are more sensitive.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to have worked but it was extremely too strong for my gums...  </li>
            <li> for the record, I have a very high pain tolerance (natural childbirth).</li>
            <li> Not for the faint at heart, but the result are great.  </li>
            <li> It works great and was not as expensive as the product I used to get from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> MY GUMS FELT NORMAL AGAIN.  </li>
            <li> I normally get my bleach from my Dentist but haven&#x27;t had time and ran out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste in more ways than one.</li>
            <li> far as trays go, a standard custom mouth guard worked well, though obviously custom fitted trays from your dentist will work better.</li>
            <li> far as trays go, a standard custom mouth guard worked well, though obviously custom fitted trays from your dentist will work better.</li>
            <li> Be cautious getting it on your gums, it can really burn and turn the pink gum on top of your tooth white.  </li>
            <li> My teeth ended up very white, but make sure you watch how long you keep the trays in for.</li>
            <li> But its the same thing here it works just as good for much less!!</li>
            <li> However, the PDF instruction sheet that you can download directly from the Opalescence website, says specifically to not leave the 35% applied for more than a half an hour.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, each individual syringe lasts me at least five whitenings, and I only whiten maybe twice a month ~ making this a really good value!</li>
            <li> is better then the stiff we use</li>
            <li> I put it on and it started to brun my gums right away, I could only stand it for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The dentist will mix it right in front of you and it will turn red.</li>
            <li> but then the second and third time i used it my teeth were fine.</li>
            <li> I usually use once a month and it keeps my teeth looking a good, yet natural, white.</li>
            <li> ..cant live without it.</li>
            <li> are my new notes for the 35% version:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> If you are new to teeth bleaching, I would suggest going with a weaker solution.</li>
            <li> Third, my teeth were so white that they light up a room.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to anyone with very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Gums and teeth very sensitive after that.</li>
            <li> Can cause mild discomfort the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> Dentist has exact same item for sale at $25 PER SYRINGE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it irritates more sometimes</li>
            <li> First review I&#x27;ve written, but writing to warn people that there are only about 4 applications (1/tube) in this package.  </li>
            <li> first using the 35%, I left it on for about two hours, and I did experience some sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I feel so ripped off paying $20 per tube at the dentist for the EXACT same syringe!  </li>
            <li> Could see big improvement after first use.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this specific brand by my Dentist, and prefer the 35% compared to higher to limit pain during use.</li>
            <li> however your teeth may get sensitive!  </li>
            <li> As such you should get it the first time at the dentist where you will be taught how to use it.</li>
            <li> The syringes and box look exactly the same except for the tip.</li>
            <li> I have used 1 tube so far and it has whitened my teeth quite a bit already!</li>
            <li> Bought this to change it up from my normal teeth whitening gel, I&#x27;m not missing out on anything.</li>
            <li> My dentist supplies this same exact whitening gel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s higher in potency that what your dentist probably provided with those custom trays that ended up setting you back $350.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The solution is really strong, so if you have sensitive gums, I would suggest going with something a bit less in percentage.  </li>
            <li> This is very strong and powerful stuff, my gums are burning and it&#x27;s rather uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> My husband tried the gel and realized only then that he had a sensitive tooth he wasn&#x27;t aware of.</li>
            <li> This is so strong that it took the skin on a few layers off my gumsand hurt like hell as a chemical burn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m having a hard time getting my teeth nice and white, as I hoped for with the Opalescence and they are slightly yellow after 8 syringes of the 16% and 3 syringes of the 35% -- much better than before, but definitely not \\&quot;The Rock\\&quot; white.</li>
            <li> I eventually got a little paintbrush and painted the gel on my teeth and that seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li> My gums turned extremely white and I could not get it off quick enough.</li>
            <li> This is pretty powerful stuff, especially compared to the last time I whitened my teeth with Day White 7%.  </li>
            <li> I just got my braces off and got clear retainers</li>
            <li> but I must make clear that I use the  custom made trays from the dents office.</li>
            <li> Spend the $50 or so as a one time fee at your dentist and have a professional molded tray made of your teeth to use with this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought the same product from my dentist who charged me 4 times as much.  </li>
            <li> This product really works, however I think there should be very definite warnings about</li>
            <li> The pain was considerable, albeit short-lived.</li>
            <li> you risk damaging your gums &amp; having to deal with sensitive teeth for a while.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too much work to find uninterrupted 30 min of tooth cleaning where you can&#x27;t eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li> Just a note that the instructions for the Opalescence 35% direct the user to keep this product on their teeth for 30 minutes (one-half hour).</li>
            <li> Your teeth will be a bit sensitive immediately upon application.</li>
            <li> Try to get the professional strips from your dentist, if you rather spare yourself the expense of custom trays.</li>
            <li> Gel will naturally move to cover teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a big deal really.</li>
            <li> (The reason being I have nerve damage on my front tooth that ZOOM made too apparent, and it tools months for my teeth to look normal again.</li>
            <li> My real concern came later as my teeth were aching (it felt like the pain was radiating all the way to the roots)</li>
            <li> I am a dental professional, and have this product in lower dose in office .</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums, but the gel didn&#x27;t bother them at all.</li>
            <li> Using sensitive toothpaste before and after helps reduce sensitivity.</li>
            <li> So you teeth are whiter but still look natural.</li>
            <li> A professional tray helps keep the gel off the gums rather than a store bought tray.  </li>
            <li> It may be an old batch that has lost it&#x27;s potency.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth (but I have been using this product for years) and leave mine in for about 15-20 mins.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth be prepared for some pain after bleaching.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend getting some sensitive toothpaste to use BEFORE and AFTER bleaching.  </li>
            <li> U dont need much- just a tiny dot over each tooth.</li>
            <li> When I purchase it from my dentist it is clearly marked with an expression date and this one had none.  </li>
            <li> Or they put too much in the tray and don&#x27;t wipe off the extra that comes out onto your gums after putting the tray onto your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had my trays made professionally years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this directly from the dentist office before for 5x&#x27;s the price.  </li>
            <li> It really burns your gums if you use it for the entire time you are suppose to.</li>
            <li> Unless you have been advised by a professional dentist I would recommend using the 20%.</li>
            <li> will be so sensitive after.</li>
            <li> WOW .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using an old tray that was fitted by a dentist.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Any dentist will explain to you that bleach at this concentration WILL burn your soft tissue (gums &amp; tongue).</li>
            <li> I tried the gel again a few days later and made DARN sure none of it touched my gums.  </li>
            <li> The 35 % is not meant to be left on for more than 30 minutes a round</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m just curious if this was fresh or not.</li>
            <li> The other important thing is the following.  </li>
            <li> 2 days later my healthy gums are still bleeding and my lips are still blistered, raw, and swollen.</li>
            <li> Pick these up at more than half that cost!!!</li>
            <li> , I only put the product in the trays for the top 6 and bottom 6 teeth and put in very little</li>
            <li> This is the exact same brand and worked the same as the gel I received for the dentist!</li>
            <li> Be sure, when using the 35% gel, that you only leave it on with the tray for no more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Opalescence PF has a high amount of floride in it and has been shown in studies to be the only whitener that strenthens enamel and reduces sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This whitens like no other!</li>
            <li> I was able to use the gel since it was too strong and my gum and tongue was burning really bad.</li>
            <li> You do have to be super careful not to get this on your gums as it burns instantly.</li>
            <li> Bad economy, but beautiful teeth.</li>
            <li> I am finally back to normal.  </li>
            <li> It can cause a little sensitivity, which has happened to me, but the sensitivity decreases quickly.  </li>
            <li> People asked me what if I was using a new lipstick today - my lips were so swollen and red.</li>
            <li> If it takes 12-20 weeks, at least it is easy to maintain after you get to the desired whiteness.</li>
            <li> I have only left in on for 15-20 minutes &amp; it works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather go for the less powerful system that I can use overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> At first it made my gums sensative but after about using it twice it subsided, long store short</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth you may want to go with 20% as this will definitely bleach your gums and make them sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, it goes away after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are still the same color they used to be my gum are now burn and teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I initially thought it was hurting, but after chilling out for about 30 seconds I noticed that it was more of a generally funny feeling and that it didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li> The 35% is ONLY for a quick, 1 hour or less, touch up before a date or whatever.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of other positive reviews here, I decided to purchase a 4-pack along with a molded mouth-guard to try them out.</li>
            <li> It is much stronger than the OTC stuff and should be dealt with carefully.</li>
            <li> if one is not careful.  </li>
            <li> and it did not make my teeth sensitive until later on during the day.</li>
            <li> Just be careful about how much product that you place in the tray each time and you won&#x27;t burn your mouth.</li>
            <li> It can make your teeth sensitive but that is short lived.</li>
            <li> So far, the only visible change is the sore on my bleached gums...</li>
            <li> I received this item much faster than the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> cleaned professionally first or youwill end up bleaching placque and when it gets scraped off you will have a dark spot underneath.</li>
            <li> But if you know you have sensitive teeth, might opt for something different!</li>
            <li> My last whitening was 4 years ago when I had a professional tray made and my Dentist recommended and gave me 35% Opalescence.  </li>
            <li> I have also used a Q-Tip to apply the product to my front teeth without a tray, early on when my gums were really red.</li>
            <li> I spent $25 a tube for exactly the same product at my dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I did not use the full amount of one because my teeth are small.</li>
            <li> and have always noticed mediocre results while being kind of a PITA to use.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a major difference and had several positive comments from friends/family after doing the 2nd round of 10 days.</li>
            <li> I originally got 16% product from the dentist, which did hardly anything.  </li>
            <li> It worked fast and was extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> Need to be very careful with the 35% so that you don&#x27;t fill the trays with too much product.  </li>
            <li> Fast acting with minimal time required to keep it on your teeth.</li>
            <li> For the next day, whenever I managed to grin and bare through the pain (get it!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend using it at least two days before a special event.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive, so when I found the brand at such cheap prices here on Amazon, I thought I&#x27;d found a real bargain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:I barely used enough to cover the inside of the teeth mold.</li>
            <li> The product is no doubt past the sell-by date or it wouldn&#x27;t be so heavily discounted, but when my gumlime immediately began to tingle - then sting - with first use, I thought that meant the product was fresh enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend the product to other people.</li>
            <li> This product and really burn your gums if you leave it on over a half an hour.</li>
            <li> Did not feel like it was doing much because my previous experience had me feeling a tingle in the gums</li>
            <li> A small driblet goes a long way; I apply a drop of about 0.5-1 mm on each tooth, and each syringe allows me about 3 full mouth applications.</li>
            <li> I normally kept the 15% on my teeth overnight but had to remove the 35% within 30 minutes due to the pain and discomfort.</li>
            <li> The 35% solution is much stronger than the other versions, and hence, you don&#x27;t need to leave it applied for so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the gels before and it should not burn you no matter how little or how much you use.</li>
            <li> It is a little too intense for me, burns my gums if any touches them.  </li>
            <li> The other  thing is that Opalescence leaves some of the natural variation in color that teeth have unless you over use it.</li>
            <li> Some of the tubes contained whitening gel that indeed seemed to be of advertised strength and other tubes were duds causing no foaming action or whitening at all</li>
            <li> would recommend that new users keep the solution on for less time in the beginning, gradually building up tolerance.</li>
            <li> target specific stains, I add a little extra to that spot on the tray, and I apply a bit of solution directly to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Same results, but far less pain.</li>
            <li> I have relatively \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot; gums and I am not sensitive at all, but if your gums are sensitive then you may want to do one of the others such  22 % os less and just leave them on for longer.</li>
            <li> Well, first and second try there was a slightly noticeable difference, BUT it was waaaaay tooooo strong for my gums, and they burned for about 2 weeks, and it was really painful to brush my teeth because my gums were pretty raw.  </li>
            <li> The higher percentage is stronger, which is confusing if you don&#x27;t understand math.</li>
            <li> Works if you are consistent at using it at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried product yet; am not completely out of prior supply.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is pretty thick</li>
            <li> I just used them less frequently.  </li>
            <li> I tried again using minimal bleech same thing happened with sore white gums for days.  </li>
            <li> I kept it on about 15 minutes the first time and a little less</li>
            <li> Some always accidentally gets on your gingiva (gums) and my gums were burning so bad that I couldnt keep it on more than 5min!</li>
            <li> so...just put a little bit of old fashioned Vaseline on your gums to protect them.  </li>
            <li> The bleach in the produt apparently burned my gums so badly that I couldn&#x27;t keep the trays in for more than about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The whiteners that use lasers and ultraviolet light tend to turn your teeth so white that they look like a bad set of dentures, as they also take the natural shine away from your teeth.</li>
            <li> Second, my teeth and gums hurt so bad, it hurt to talk (which I am sure my husband just loved---having a silent wife for an evening).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems using over the counter gels in the past because my teeth are really sensitive, so I finally went in to my Dentist and had custom trays made.</li>
            <li> I FELT A STRANGE TINGLING COMING FROM MY GUMS.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if your teeth are blackened or grey from eating soot, then this may be your product.</li>
            <li> it can cause tooth sensitivity if kept on tooo long..</li>
            <li> I will use this product for as long as Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> I will use this product for as long as Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product  which was recommended by my dentist, for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was old and seemed dried up.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions for application,  If you leave it on too long it can burn your gums.</li>
            <li> (thats how long they lasted)</li>
            <li> It took that long for my teeth to stop hurting.</li>
            <li> I wonder how long it has been sitting around.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks before my gums turned back to pink.  </li>
            <li> PDF instruction sheet from the Opalescence website also states that you should use approximately one third to one half (total) of a syringe worth of solution to fill both trays.</li>
            <li> Must be careful if you have sensitive teeth/gums, just use less time.  </li>
            <li> definitely 1-2 shades lighter and only half of the product used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The white areas did fade within a short time once I rinsed the gel off, but the next time I use this strength, I will paint it on with a small brush and not chance it getting on the gums.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this seller and this product..just dont get solution on gums or fingers as it burns and hard to remove..</li>
            <li> If I just lay this into my retainers, sure enough it will get on my gums and BURN so bad.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous and very unsafe.</li>
            <li> When this gets on your gums, it is pretty painful for the first 10 minutes, then the pain goes away.  </li>
            <li> My gums were pink again the next morning but please be careful with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Thank heaven the whiteness faded after an hour or so, but it was replaced by a dark red area that looks like a cigarette burn on skin.</li>
            <li> Tip - I have had my teeth professionally whitened in the past and have the fitted trays to use</li>
            <li> I am using just a small drop of this in the crease of my dentist-made plastic whitening trays -- nowhere near 1/3 or 1/2 of a syringe.  </li>
            <li> Just like with every bleach kit, be careful you don&#x27;t leave this on for too long.</li>
            <li> It works well, just be careful not to keep on teeth too long and use sparingly.</li>
            <li> My gum line was BLACK up against my WHITE teeth.  </li>
            <li> Only used this product for a half hour with bleaching trays I already had, teeth were noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> I use this product and it works well and cost less than buying at a regular store.  </li>
            <li> So maybe it is that the 35% gel gets the same results in less time.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter, and I am only through half of the treatment, thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful not to leave on very long, will burn your gums!</li>
            <li> However even the little bit of gum that is in between my teeth turned bleached white.</li>
            <li> Still some yellowing at the base of the teeth that I hope to clear, but my dentist says that in older (?!) adults, that could be the dentin (naturally yellowish layer beneath the enamel) showing through.  </li>
            <li> On the bright side (ha-ha---just dropping bad puns all day here), I did manage to lose a few pounds because of the soreness in my mouth prevented me from eating or drinking anything for a few days.</li>
            <li> It tingles, but no pain for me, and I saw results instantly, as it had been at least a year since I last used Opalescence.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with your gums.</li>
            <li> The next time I used a much smaller amount and tired to thoroughly wipe off any excess, yet it still burned the gum area above one tooth which took about 4 days to heal.  </li>
            <li> There is no reason whatsoever to waste your time and money on store bought white strips, solutions, toothpaste, or mouthwash.</li>
            <li> There is no reason whatsoever to waste your time and money on store bought white strips, solutions, toothpaste, or mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this 35% solution....  </li>
            <li> Just be careful to not get the gel on your gums.</li>
            <li> the product does work, just need to be careful on your gums.  </li>
            <li> so be careful .....</li>
            <li> Lastly after putting the trays with the gel in them on,press tham onto your teeth and wipe any gell that oozes out off your gums with a cloth, a cotton cloth, not a paper towel.</li>
            <li> After only a few minutes my gums were burning.  </li>
            <li> I only had the trays in a few minutes to see if the burning would go away, it did not.</li>
            <li> Tried this one, but it did not work as I expected</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you are using this.</li>
            <li> Not light pink, but WHITE.</li>
            <li> After reading all the other reviews, especially the negative reviews talking about gum issues (burning, etc) and doing some extensive reasearch, I have come to find why people are complaining and what they have done wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have roots exposed should use sensitive paste for few weeks before ......use no more than 1/3 tube each time ......</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The following night (and this may sound crazy), I applied a thin layer of Vaseline to my gums prior to placing the trays on my teeth.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d say buy this gel but be extremely careful with it!</li>
            <li> When I removed the tray, my gums were extremely irritated and inflamed.</li>
            <li> Please, whatever you do, get one of those mouth opening devices that some of the other teeth whitening systems come with.</li>
            <li> This may cause extreme sensitivity to your teeth and could cause damage in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> But be careful!</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this product due to the price.  </li>
            <li> Other purchases have resulted in gum pain but almost no whitening after 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li> other than heat the tray ....</li>
            <li> which is how I chose to interpret other reviewers&#x27; warnings.</li>
            <li> One of the other reviews recommended puting them on your teeth and not use the trays..</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to try that as long as I keep the product off my lips and gums, will see how that works, but that will be in a few days..</li>
            <li> used to work over past years now the last 2-3 orders I receive do not seem to give any results…wonder if they changed the formula or went &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Getting tons of compliments on my teeth, so other people are noticing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works well, but I would have to agree with the other reviewer, that custom trays are a must.  </li>
            <li> and she said \\&quot;she expected that it would turn dark because the took underneath the temporary crown wasn&#x27;t sealed completely\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recommending it to other people too.</li>
            <li> Be VERY careful with this.</li>
            <li> Left on for several seconds to see if stop...just got worse.  </li>
            <li> This is offered as 35% active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Burnt my gums in less than 15 sec</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I&#x27;m afraid to aggravate the burn by using even a mild whitening product.</li>
            <li> My gums are stark dead white after 2 uses - 30 minutes each time, 1/4 tube in each tray.</li>
            <li> I still felt a little irritation but not nearly as much as I did the night before.</li>
            <li> I use this product occasionally when I feel that my teeth are looking dull.  </li>
            <li> I also heard a crackle when I first put them in, umm that is a little scary.</li>
            <li> The pain of the 35% solution is not worth it.</li>
            <li> small amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> Stick to milk and white foods after using for at least 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Dark foods and drinks can soak into the dentin tubules, causing the tooth to turn dark permanently.  </li>
            <li> I bought whitening gel from Amazon because it&#x27;s so expensive straight from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Works just like I expected, took my teeth a few shades lighter.</li>
            <li> but theres such a thing as too thick</li>
            <li> The get is shipped in a beautiful but useless plastic dome package with the syringes inserted upside down in a plastic base onto which a sturdy plastic dome is attached.</li>
            <li> , I just do 30 minutes twice a day for a week then taper it down to maintain</li>
            <li> I will use it three times a week about twice a year to keep the stains down - coffee, tea, wine etc.</li>
            <li> I notice in two very small spots of my gums it turned it white.</li>
            <li> if u leave them in too long, they irritate your gums pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> Holy Cow!</li>
            <li> my experience makes using the product a bit easier and less intimidating for you.</li>
            <li> my experience makes using the product a bit easier and less intimidating for you.</li>
            <li> Previous purchases have worked as described with 25 minutes about all I can take of gum and tooth pain.</li>
            <li> I had a slight crack in my front tooth.</li>
            <li> The price, here, is much less than at my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Previous experience with Opalesence gel was at the 15% strength purchased from the dentist who made my trays.</li>
            <li> This goes away when I take it out, but then after each treatment I experience serious tooth sensitivity for the 24 hours following.</li>
            <li> iF YOU WANT TO LEAVE it ON OVERNIGHT, USE THE 20% GEL (OR LESS).</li>
            <li> I bought the 20 or 25% hoping for less burn.  </li>
            <li> This solution does not burn my gums, it is less liquid</li>
            <li> whitening product blows EVERYTHING I&#x27;ve used previously out of the water.</li>
            <li> After half an hour I couldn&#x27;t take the burn anymore and took them out.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon a few times and it was not fresh</li>
            <li> The problem is the tubes are very small and only have a few days of whitening per order.    </li>
            <li> A little bit got on my upper lip and tip of tongue as I tried rinsing my mouth and my upper lip actually burnt so bad it started to bleed a bit.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on other strengths or brands...go for the gold that works after 1 use!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few days ago and it was delivered ver quickly, no complaints there.</li>
            <li> And if you can stand a little pain with the 35 %</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended to put little dots of it in the tray instead of a line so that the tray doesn&#x27;t overflow.  </li>
            <li> A little sensitivity</li>
            <li> I tried putting a little gel in the tray just on the tooth part, but when I put them in the gel pushes around and gets on my gums and starts burning within minutes.  </li>
            <li> within seconds of putting them in, I felt a little bit of tingling on my gums like a bubbling type of tingly.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about teeth sensitivity, but I learned the hard way that you must be careful not to let the product overrun the trays and get on your gums.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was on the shelf too long, but it was no good.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME.</li>
            <li> Thereafter, I had to wait a few days to let my gums heal before trying again.  </li>
            <li> TWO OF THE FOUR TUBES HAD THE SAFETY SEAL MISSING, SO</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is a sign of it being not fresh or what.</li>
            <li> It took every night for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced anything like it, not with national brand strips, generic whitening strips or dentist provided gel for trays.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t drink coffee for a few days or your in trouble.</li>
            <li> However, after using the product for a few weeks in a row, sleeping with the inserts, I found myself waking up with excruciating teeth pain.  </li>
            <li> This was dried up, and could not use it.</li>
            <li> I decided it was time for another round.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years, every since I got a custom mouth piece made.</li>
            <li> once every few weeks</li>
            <li> I had previously used the 15% strength, and what a difference the 35% strength is!</li>
            <li> then take them out and use a very sharp small set of scissors to cut them to not go past your teeth and over your gums.</li>
            <li> But, while using it yes, the first time it is painful</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for 2 hours a few times a week.</li>
            <li> The gel is really thick and not very strong at all.  </li>
            <li> so keeping white teeth is some what difficult.</li>
            <li> not sure)</li>
            <li> but, I have used the 10% in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have the trays from my dentist and have used the gels in the past with out having any burns.  </li>
            <li> Thus it was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Usually with 1 use, you get results.  </li>
            <li> Just put a small amount in the lining of the mouth tray because it will spread.</li>
            <li> I paid the dentist 400$ for whitening that was no better than this.</li>
            <li> I used the 15% in the past and decided to see if 35% would get a faster result.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of teeth whitening products in the past; everything from 5 Minute Whitening, Crest Strips, etc.</li>
            <li> Add a small amount to your trays and remove after about an hour.</li>
            <li> Have been useing for past couple years and won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> The syringes themselves contain very little gel as they are very thin and tiny.</li>
            <li> Also only apply the gel to tray where it will touch the front of your teeth, no one will see behind your teeth and the tralys can&#x27;t be trimmed acurately for behind your teeth.</li>
            <li> In the past, others were at least twi.</li>
            <li> At least it did seem to tingle as if it were working and did result in gum irritation, but still very little results, hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heals in about a day which was fine, but now I&#x27;m too afraid to try the treatment again!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend just using the 30 minute time frame for now unless  your hard core or you have built up some type of immunity to it.</li>
            <li> Learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> The Opalescence is for take home for touch ups to get a lighter shade than the Boost gave you, for smokers and for people who&#x27;s teeth are hard to bleach.</li>
            <li> product is either fake or just plain weak, and I have a hard time believing it&#x27;s weak, because these things can be tested for their strength, obviously.</li>
            <li> This product is 35%, so it should have been at least on par with what I know was legitimate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, for those who complained about the lack of instructions, well-</li>
            <li> I used at least 12 tubes.</li>
            <li> I kept it in for at least 1 hour because I did not have teeth sensitivity</li>
            <li> I suggest waiting at least an hour after eating or burshing before using this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several whitening gel&#x27;s over the year&#x27;s and this is by far the worst .I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to leaving trays in for at least an hour.  </li>
            <li> The effects only lasted a few hours but it was painful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> and today my lips were raw, ripped open, blistered and painful....</li>
            <li> For example, A055 would mean an expiration date of May 2015.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I say &amp;#34;burn,&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t mean &amp;#34;This will sting a bit,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I mean burned as in injured.</li>
            <li> made my mouth taste horrible and in general made occasional teeth whitening something I dreaded.</li>
            <li> I barely used this for ten minutes and my gums burned it was awful experience.  </li>
            <li> I seriously *burned*</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I tried 15% several years ago, and just ended up not really using it because I hated having the trays in my mouth</li>
            <li> it was was stronger and much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I seriously recommend it as a dental assistant.</li>
            <li> Its nearly impossible to not get ANY on your gums on at and yet still cover your teeth enough.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this inexpensive teeth</li>
            <li> Product was very thick and hard to keep in each crevice of the tray.</li>
            <li> Too bad I found it on amazon for less then half.</li>
            <li> I used this one time, left it on for 30 minutes and it burned really bad.  </li>
            <li> After only 10 (painful) minutes my gums were literally throbbing....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink coffee which stains teeth worst but do drink (hot) tea.</li>
            <li> Every single bad review with the exception of about 2 are because of the lack of care on the consumers part and NOT the product itself.</li>
            <li> BUT IT JUST GOT WORSE.  </li>
            <li> Even so I had a burn reaction in approximately 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Gel should be placed in a thin line at the junction of the bottom and front of the mouthpiece, not smeared all over it.</li>
            <li> game with 4 syringes all with caps except one but</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> Eating crunchy cereal now hurts the palate just behind my front teeth, like the sting of a paper cut.</li>
            <li> The pain and rawness have gotten worse throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My teeth are seriously whiter!</li>
            <li> It was painful and my gums were a mess.</li>
            <li> I feel a little burning, but it&#x27;s not that bad and goes away within 10 minutes after I remove the trays.  </li>
            <li> WRONG CHOICE, IT BLISTERED MY GUMS AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTS</li>
            <li> Scary item  </li>
            <li> Now that being said, my neighbor confessed that she&#x27;s so obsessed with whitening her teeth</li>
            <li> DONT GET ME WRONG, the product itself is goo</li>
            <li> If you are careless, it will sting a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a frightening product.</li>
            <li> This company is selling expired or fake whitening gel.</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable and so concerning that I washed the stuff off my teeth immediately.</li>
            <li> Very irritating.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY.  </li>
            <li> Took out after 30 seconds and immediately started rinsing mouth with cold water.  </li>
            <li> When I have it in, it feels like needles are stabbing my gums.</li>
            <li> Burns dangerously like CRAZY.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I looked very silly until it</li>
            <li> Disappointing :(</li>
            <li> but I just think maybe i got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been a bit sporadic) and hope to find that it&#x27;s staining from a lifetime of bad habits.  </li>
            <li> so badly that I could not eat for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Badly.</li>
            <li> Burns the gums something bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with directions.</li>
            <li> I even used a q-tip to apply shea butter to my gums but it still hurt really bad.  </li>
            <li> SO IT BECAME PAINFUL</li>
            <li> It is SEVERELY painful on my lips and gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with the way this was sent to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond disappointed</li>
            <li> Sorry for my terrible typing/spelling.</li>
            <li> :-(((</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate to say &amp;#34;it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I always felt like the strips were annoying and time consuming,</li>
            <li> Very painful experience using this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Results:  I just quit smoking after 20 years, and my teeth were horribly yellowed.  </li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> Bloody burn gums ouch!.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is actually pretty good. I&#x27;ve used lots of the top whitening systems and toothpastes, but this is probably the best you&#x27;ll find outside of a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody has though my teeth look like veneers, but I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in the whiteness. This will be the product I use from now on.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time. Works great. I can do one treatment and it lasts for weeks !</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT  CAME WITHOUT ANY INSTRUCTIONS. SO I ASSUMED IT WAS THE SAME AS WHAT I HAD PURCHASED FROM MY DENTIST. WRONG CHOICE, IT BLISTERED MY GUMS AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTS EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT OVER FILL MY TRAYS. I ALSO PAID $11.00 FOR EXPEDTED SHIPPING AND IT TOOK 10 DAYS TO GET IT.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product. I will never but store boughten products again! This did wonders!</li>
            <li> OK, so this product will whiten your teeth like nothing else for the money.  Here are some very simple tips for making sure it works for you without pain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Spend the $50 or so as a one time fee at your dentist and have a professional molded tray made of your teeth to use with this product.  If you do not, you will probably be one of the people on here giving the product one star thinking it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If the product comes in contact with your gums IT WILL SIZZLE...so...just put a little bit of old fashioned Vaseline on your gums to protect them.  Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Leave the product in for one hour so it gets a chance to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again...this product works phenomenally well when used correctly.  FYI I first got it from my dentist and it cost me $150 for a four pack so the $10 or so price you can get it for on here IS A KILLER DEAL!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, 4 tubes last 1 -1.5 applications per tube. Starts to burn after 1 hr. I would only leave it on 60 min max.</li>
            <li> Very painful experience using this product.  I would suggest a lower percentage unless you can deal with the pain from burn!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING WHITENING GEL FROM MY DENTIST FOR YEARS.  FOR PRICE AND CONVENIENCE I DECIDED TO TRY THIS PRODUCT OUT.  WELL WITHIN SECONDS I FELT A STRANGE TINGLING COMING FROM MY GUMS.  AFTER A MINUTE OR SO IT BECAME PAINFUL, I WAITED FOR IT TO SUBSIDE BUT IT JUST GOT WORSE.  AT ABOUT 4 MINUTES I PULLED MY TRAYS OUT OF MY MOUTH AND RINSED THOROUGHLY.  MY GUMS LOOKED LIKE HAMBURGER AROUND THE GUM LINE.  I HAD TO RINSE WITH PEROXYL FOR DAYS , AFTER A WEEK MY GUMS FELT NORMAL AGAIN.  TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME.</li>
            <li> I use to pay my dentist $58 for this set of four gels. Pick these up at more than half that cost!!! How do these dentists sleep at night?</li>
            <li> This is a very good deal and a fraction of the price the dentist charges!  Not stingy and does the job.</li>
            <li> I bought the same product from my dentist who charged me 4 times as much.  This one is faster, stronger, quick delivery, and affordable.</li>
            <li> This product really works, however I think there should be very definite warnings about it&#x27;s incredibly potent strength. If you make the mistake of allowing this to touch your gums, woe be to you! I accidentally overfilled my bleaching tray to where some of the gel squished out of the top and touched my gums. The burning set in a short time later, prompting me to rip out the tray and start rinsing. My gums turned white and looked like something out of a horror movie. It took about three days to heal.  My husband tried the gel and realized only then that he had a sensitive tooth he wasn&#x27;t aware of. The pain was considerable, albeit short-lived. I tried the gel again a few days later and made DARN sure none of it touched my gums.  It worked like an absolute charm. My teeth look fabulous after just one treatment to brighten up my years of bleaching success. So I&#x27;d say buy this gel but be extremely careful with it!</li>
            <li> This works great.  Shipment was fast.  Be warned, it can cause sensitive gums for 24-48 hours, but well worth it.  Would repurchase.</li>
            <li> This product works great. Whitens your teeth and this price is much better  than my dentist sells it for. Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is my third time to get this product as touch up.  People love to see my smile and comment I have white teeth.  I first got this product from my dentist after coming off braces. I used up all 4 tubes at first.  My teeth stayed white even after a year.  Saw the difference before then after using it. Searched this product on Amazon and bought another 4 tubes (a year later after my furst treatment).  I also purchased the tooth paste with whitening on it. I would higly recommend this product.  I don&#x27;t drink coffee which stains teeth worst but do drink (hot) tea. I just have this in hand for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Opalescence is far and away the best tooth whitener on the market.  Be advised you must have CUSTOM tooth trays which only a dentist can provide.  Dentist has exact same item for sale at $25 PER SYRINGE.  Amazon provides exellent value at 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with your gums.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the 35% it burned my  gums . Now I paint the whitening on my teeth with a tiny  paint brush and then put the trays on my teeth  &amp; no  burning  they can stay on for 2 hours with no problem.</li>
            <li> having used the 20% gel purchased from my dentist, I found the  35% gel too strong.  The tooth and gum sensitivity lasts for ONE WEEK! Perhaps if your teeth are blackened or grey from eating soot, then this may be your product.</li>
            <li> Good, just don&#x27;t get it on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it with a q-tip, teeth only and then put the tray on.&lt;br /&gt;Works well.</li>
            <li> I had used this product before, but not such a strong solution.  I was concerned about teeth sensitivity, but I learned the hard way that you must be careful not to let the product overrun the trays and get on your gums.  And, in fact, I believe it states in the directions that you are to wipe off any excess.  Having used the product before and having had no problem with this, I didn&#x27;t read the directions prior to applying. Big mistake. The bleach in the produt apparently burned my gums so badly that I couldn&#x27;t keep the trays in for more than about 20 minutes.  Thereafter, I had to wait a few days to let my gums heal before trying again.  The next time I used a much smaller amount and tired to thoroughly wipe off any excess, yet it still burned the gum area above one tooth which took about 4 days to heal.  I have not tried Opalesence again.</li>
            <li> Works really well but stronge. You may experience sensitivity. I did two 30 minute sessions and I was done. My teeth were noticably whiter.    I never really got these kind of results from the white strips.  I could have gone even lighter but I don&#x27;t like that over processed look.    Good price for this as well...</li>
            <li> It as just as good as what you pay double for at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Keeps my teeth noticeably white! Easy to use and fast.</li>
            <li> Great stuff..cant live without it.</li>
            <li> Like battery acid on your gums.  Holy Cow!</li>
            <li> Great product; wonderfully-priced; arrived quickly and undamaged! :-) This product costs so MUCH MORE whenever I&#x27;ve bought it at The Dentist&#x27;s Office, so I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to get it so inexpensively through mail order! :-)</li>
            <li> I have used this product before but always used 20%. I decided to try 35% this time. The first time I tried it, I applied it like I would the 15%. Big mistake. This product is much stronger. I normally kept the 15% on my teeth overnight but had to remove the 35% within 30 minutes due to the pain and discomfort. When I removed the tray, my gums were extremely irritated and inflamed. I did not re-apply that night. The following night (and this may sound crazy), I applied a thin layer of Vaseline to my gums prior to placing the trays on my teeth. I still felt a little irritation but not nearly as much as I did the night before. My teeth are much whiter. I do recommend this product but I do not recommend the 35% version. Try the 15% or 20% first. You will thank me later.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and effective.  Combine the gel plus mouth trays, and you&#x27;ll end up saving $300 at the dentist.  Watch the amount you use, or you&#x27;ll experience gum sensitivity.  Otherwise, the product works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it works well.  No complaints.  The seller was very nice and answered my question within 2 hours.</li>
            <li> First of all Opalescence is a very good product, it is the strength of this whitening solution that is the problem. It is much too strong and caused jolts of pain in my teeth.  The discomfort lasted about 16 hours decreasing in pain over time, but it still woke me up throughout the night. I would recommend the 20%. I am using that right now. It takes longer to reach the desired whiteness but causes no pain. But be warned, the pain was almost intolerable with the 35%!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums.  I used to purchase it from my dentist at a much higher cost. Was so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works. And you can count on this being an honest and truthful review.  I put it in the trays (you can find these on amazon for around $3.00, I  bought the sports ones) and try to leave the trays in my mouth for an hour.  Sometimes this is not possible as it will irritate the gums.  I&#x27;m not sure why it irritates more sometimes and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t (may be depending if I&#x27;ve eaten something hot that has irritated my gums already), just take the trays out if it starts to irritate you.  You can get about 4 uses out of each vial so all together you will get 16 uses which is enough to whiten both your top and bottom teeth 2 to 4 times more that what you started out with.  I would definitely recommend this product to others and already have.</li>
            <li> This product works as it is labeled. I have used this before, but purchased the item from the dentist. Do understand that it is thw 35% and will cause some discomfort. I have relatively \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot; gums and I am not sensitive at all, but if your gums are sensitive then you may want to do one of the others such  22 % os less and just leave them on for longer. The 35 % is not meant to be left on for more than 30 minutes a round, I just do 30 minutes twice a day for a week then taper it down to maintain and I regularly use a pen for touch ups. I live in CA and very close to wine country so keeping white teeth is some what difficult. I suggest you use the product once a day and if you are a first time user them give it a test run and wait 24 hours to see if you develop sensitivity.  I ordered the four pack this time to make sure that I was getting the correct thing and would definitely  recommend Opalescence products to anyone. Remember that what is good for one person is not for another. Make sure that you see you dentist regularly to make sure there are no other dental problems before using. I would use this seller again :)</li>
            <li> Awesome! This whitens like no other! I have only left in on for 15-20 minutes &amp; it works really well. I only used it twice to get my teeth whiter than white. I will save the rest for future touch ups.</li>
            <li> I spent $25 a tube for exactly the same product at my dentist&#x27;s office.  This is a remarkable deal and one I will continue to take advantage of.</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand for about 7 years, love it! One word of warning, READ the enclosed directions and only allow the product to stay on the recommended length of time or else you risk damaging your gums &amp; having to deal with sensitive teeth for a while. Otherwise, this product works wonders to whiten my teeth and I am always getting compliments on how white they are, I tell everyone about this product!</li>
            <li> I just got my braces off and got clear retainers so I decided to give this whitening system a try.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it&#x27;s too much work to find uninterrupted 30 min of tooth cleaning where you can&#x27;t eat or drink anything. I&#x27;d rather go for the less powerful system that I can use overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Also, sometimes you can feel the burn on your gums. Luckily, it goes away after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not be buying this again</li>
            <li> I normally get my bleach from my Dentist but haven&#x27;t had time and ran out.  This is very simular to what I get from the Dentist and it came very quickly.  Haven&#x27;t seen the results yet but tastes and feels the same so I&#x27;m hopeful.  If so I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Have been using various whitening gels for several years.  As soon as I put the gel in my teeth trays in my mouth, starting burning.  Left on for several seconds to see if stop...just got worse.  Took out after 30 seconds and immediately started rinsing mouth with cold water.  Gums were burning and white!  Felt like they were going to blister.  Kept rinsing.  Scary item  Returning right away.</li>
            <li> Just a note that the instructions for the Opalescence 35% direct the user to keep this product on their teeth for 30 minutes (one-half hour). This is pretty strong stuff. Also, the user should not overdo the amount used as it will get onto the gums which should be avoided.</li>
            <li> First review I&#x27;ve written, but writing to warn people that there are only about 4 applications (1/tube) in this package.  Compared to the Watts 35% product in 10ml syringes, this is a huge ripoff.</li>
            <li> TWO OF THE FOUR TUBES HAD THE SAFETY SEAL MISSING, SO I&#x27;M SCARED TO USE THIS PRODUCT.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD DEAL...BUT CAN&#x27;T USE IT!</li>
            <li> Was amazed at how fast it got here! Extremely happy with order!!! Exact product as pictured. This really is the best teeth bleach on the market in my opinion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with the way this was sent to me. I was so excited while ordering this product but once i got it i couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it!! It came with no instructions so now its just sitting there. Can someone explain how this product works???</li>
            <li> These work awesome and best price around.</li>
            <li> This product works! I had received this gel from my dentist and I was amazed that it actually whitened my teeth! Months passed and I wanted to whiten my teeth again, I was so glad that it was sold on amazon and it was even a stronger formula (35%), I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product and is so much cheeper on amazon than the dentist. I payed 300 for this product once, never again ha. LOve this and the shipping was great as well.</li>
            <li> this product works excellent!  arrived quickly, price is very good, stock is fresh...have purchased the same item from cosmetic dentist for 3 x&#x27;s as much: ouch!!! highly recommend this seller and this product..just dont get solution on gums or fingers as it burns and hard to remove..also keep to a schedule cause it can cause tooth sensitivity if kept on tooo long..</li>
            <li> The same stuff my dentist uses.  Works great.  Can cause mild discomfort the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> Really works. I don&#x27;t suggest leaving product on for more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware! This stuff is extremely strong! (I purchased the trays with this product as well...)  I tried this whitening gel yesterday and was really upset. As soon as it made contact with my gums it immediately gave me ulcers. My gums turned extremely white and I could not get it off quick enough. It was literally burning my gums around my teeth. A little bit got on my upper lip and tip of tongue as I tried rinsing my mouth and my upper lip actually burnt so bad it started to bleed a bit. Please, whatever you do, get one of those mouth opening devices that some of the other teeth whitening systems come with. Like the ones the dentists use to hold back your lips and expose only your teeth. Then simply paint the gel on your teeth with a Q-tip. Do not make contact with your gums, lips, tongue, etc. Your teeth will be a bit sensitive immediately upon application. Do not leave the gel on for more than 30 minutes. Make sure to repeat this the next day or so. Do not do more than one treatment in a day. This may cause extreme sensitivity to your teeth and could cause damage in my opinion.  In any case, my teeth are whiter - I give it that. My gums were pink again the next morning but please be careful with this stuff. It is much stronger than the OTC stuff and should be dealt with carefully. I do not recommend the moldable trays since you can not keep the gel from touching your gums when you insert them. As mentioned, one of the mouth spreaders (lack of a better or correct word) like the dentists use is a much better device.  If you are looking for something to give you istant results, this is your stuff. But be careful! Make sure you have the time to apply appropriately and remove properly.</li>
            <li> My neighbor uses the 35% solution, so I though I would try it.  My dentist recommends a much lower % (11%).  So since the price was so good, I decided to kick it up a couple of notches.  Well, first and second try there was a slightly noticeable difference, BUT it was waaaaay tooooo strong for my gums, and they burned for about 2 weeks, and it was really painful to brush my teeth because my gums were pretty raw.  Sooo, lesson learned.  I&#x27;m staying with the lower percent solution and doing it more often.  Now that being said, my neighbor confessed that she&#x27;s so obsessed with whitening her teeth, she just tolerates the sore gums afterwards.  I&#x27;m not into pain, so I plan on being much more conservative in my approach.  More is NOT always better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Saw significant results after only a couple applications. A small driblet goes a long way; I apply a drop of about 0.5-1 mm on each tooth, and each syringe allows me about 3 full mouth applications. It didn&#x27;t give me extra sensitivity in the teeth, but be sure to wipe off with a tissue any accidental leaks on the gums. The package I received is well within its expiration date (18 months from now on).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two different batches of this product. Both were within the expiration periods, so they should have worked. I have used 22% Nite White whitening gel from a dentist&#x27;s office once, and so I can compare that with this. This product is 35%, so it should have been at least on par with what I know was legitimate. It wasn&#x27;t even close. I would have been better off spending money on something over-the-counter from a big box store. Aside from not working, toward the end I experienced very severe acute pain while using this, to the point that I threw away the remaining syringe and a half worth. That was probably my fault for continuing to try to get results despite the product failing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is either fake or just plain weak, and I have a hard time believing it&#x27;s weak, because these things can be tested for their strength, obviously. The manufacturer does state that they only guarantee their product if it is sold from a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see how anyone could rate this product as effective. Even if you&#x27;ve used whitening strips from the store, that would be better than this. At least it did seem to tingle as if it were working and did result in gum irritation, but still very little results, hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s a waste in more ways than one. Try to get the professional strips from your dentist, if you rather spare yourself the expense of custom trays. Or just use something over the counter.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and is done quickly.  I&#x27;ve passed it on to friends and relatives.  We love it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Same stuff the dentist gets!!  Works great!</li>
            <li> Works really well. I always get compliments on my teeth from everyone, including the dentist.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers, I was concerned by the apparent lack of the expiration date on the product packaging. Was I wasting hours wearing the trays with the product that may have expired ?&lt;br /&gt;Well, there&#x27;s an expiration date after all, except it&#x27;s not very obvious. I dug up some info on Ultradent&#x27;s website for another product line they have on the convention they use (and I&#x27;m presuming it is consistent across their product lines).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The expiration date is indicated as \\&quot;ZMMY\\&quot;, where Z is a product lot letter, MM is the month and Y is the year. For example, A055 would mean an expiration date of May 2015.&lt;br /&gt;So look closely on your syringe for these characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those who complained about the lack of instructions, well- they&#x27;re right on Ultradent&#x27;s website (a whole PDF file of instructions, in fact). ultradent.com/en-us/Product Instruction Documents/Opalescence Tooth Whitening.pdf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular, it says-&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Wear Opalescence 10% for 8-10 hours&lt;br /&gt;or overnight, Opalescence 15% for 4-6 hours, Opalescence&lt;br /&gt;20% for 2-4 hours, and Opalescence 35% for 30 minutes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So keep on smiling with your (hopefully brighter) smiles !</li>
            <li> Works great!  I get so many compliments on how white my teeth are but I must make clear that I use the  custom made trays from the dents office.</li>
            <li> I received no instructions with my teeth whitener and had it in for several hours.  It ulcerated my gums and I could not brush my teeth for over two weeks.  I am finally back to normal.  People winced when they saw what it did to my mouth.</li>
            <li> Works almost too well</li>
            <li> People noticed a difference shortly after starting using this product.  It is strong and has the ability to \\&quot;burn\\&quot; your gums if one is not careful.  Awesome product if one uses as it is directed. Just keep away from the gum line and enjoy whiter teeth in a very short period of time.</li>
            <li> Works so well to whiten in only 15 minutes!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good just don&#x27;t do it too much it burns your gums. It is amazing how great it works and my teeth are super white. I say anyone else but it!!</li>
            <li> too strong. I have used several similar products with no problem. This product will cause significant pain along your gum line when used appropriately. I would recommend you use something else</li>
            <li> This product seemed to have worked but it was extremely too strong for my gums...  As many people have said my gums also turned white with blisters and took about 3days to heal... I plan to try this product in the future but a much smaller dosage. (Buyer error but I feel the company could have sent a warning panthlet or something)</li>
            <li> I was able to use the gel since it was too strong and my gum and tongue was burning really bad.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried product yet; am not completely out of prior supply.  Will review ASAP, but assume it&#x27;s going to be just fine.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that &amp;#34;use 35% for 30 minutes only&amp;#34; be highlighted.</li>
            <li> My last purchase of the same item (but possibly from different company? not sure) didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  No problem since it didn&#x27;t damage my teeth or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I gave this product a second chance.  This time, it worked just fine for me and will buy again.  I like gentle products, even if it takes longer and more frequent use.</li>
            <li> Beware. I could not wear this product for more than 5 mins. Burn the heck out of my gums. Ouch</li>
            <li> Why spend all the money at a dentist when you can do it yourself. Do take care to not get any of this product on your gum line!</li>
            <li> Produce was shipped quickly and packaged well.    I was hesitant to purchase the 35%. I prefer to use the 20%. I am able to wear the 20% all night without any sensitivity issues. I was thinking \\&quot;if it&#x27;s not broke, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot;. I had read the other reviews and thought this would be great for a quick alternative. Also thought that I would more likely use the 35% especially if it only took 1 to 2 hours vs. the 8 hours overnight with the 20%.   As for the results, I have used the 35% several times now. I am building up to the 2 hours gradually. It definately has made my teeth more sensitive.   Very pleased with the results, and will definately reorder.</li>
            <li> Same product sold at dental offices. Product was &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; when I received it and worked fine. Did cause sensitivity and I recommend using a mold able whitening tray.</li>
            <li> This product works great. The 35% solution is much stronger than the other versions, and hence, you don&#x27;t need to leave it applied for so long. The unofficial directions I received with my order said you can leave on the 35% Opalescence for up to two hours. However, the PDF instruction sheet that you can download directly from the Opalescence website, says specifically to not leave the 35% applied for more than a half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that new users keep the solution on for less time in the beginning, gradually building up tolerance. The PF version also contains fluoride to help control sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first using the 35%, I left it on for about two hours, and I did experience some sensitivity. The sensitivity went away in a day or two, no problem. After using it a few more times, I am now able to leave it on for about two hours with no sensitivity whatsoever. I cannot imagine trying to sleep with trays in, because you definitely don&#x27;t want to swallow any of this stuff. That&#x27;s one of the main benefits of using the stronger 35% solution: Reduced tray wear time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you won&#x27;t be licking your lips or swallowing for a while, I like to apply a bit of chapstick to my lips, and have a good drink of water before getting started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PDF instruction sheet from the Opalescence website also states that you should use approximately one third to one half (total) of a syringe worth of solution to fill both trays. Good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To target specific stains, I add a little extra to that spot on the tray, and I apply a bit of solution directly to my teeth. The syringe makes it easy to put the product right where you want it. Don&#x27;t bother putting solution on the back of the trays, because no one is going to look at the back of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The date codes were explained to me this way: The numbers indicate a month and year of expiration. For instance, V023 indicates that the product expires in February of 2013. The seller I bought from was Jawtooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as trays go, a standard custom mouth guard worked well, though obviously custom fitted trays from your dentist will work better. The mouth guards can be had for about a buck a piece in retail stores, but if you buy them on Amazon, you get three for under two bucks. Nice to have an extra in case of a misfitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results this product produces are fantastic. I had a dentist ask me if my teeth were caps. (they&#x27;re not) No kidding. I will use this product for as long as Amazon sells it. There is no reason whatsoever to waste your time and money on store bought white strips, solutions, toothpaste, or mouthwash. This product really does whiten your teeth much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my experience makes using the product a bit easier and less intimidating for you. I&#x27;ll update if I think of anything else helpful or relevant..

            <li> Works great and much cheaper to buy here than from the dentist</li>
            <li> Works really well have seen a difference already.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few days ago and it was delivered ver quickly, no complaints there. However i dont think that it was fresh, I didnt experience any of the burning or any pain that everyone keeps speaking of. Not sure if that is a sign of it being not fresh or what. I was using the 20% before i bought the 35% and that burned so i&#x27;m just curious if this was fresh or not. DONT GET ME WRONG, the product itself is goo but I just think maybe i got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Used once. Within seconds this product was burning my gums and turning them white. Caused bleeding. Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> too intense, burns your gums! Go for a lower %!!!</li>
            <li> I put the product in a mouth tray and within seconds of putting it in my mouth I heard a crackling noise. Took it out to find my gum line completely white, bleeding and burned. Ridiculous and very unsafe.</li>
            <li> If I just lay this into my retainers, sure enough it will get on my gums and BURN so bad. But, if I use a paint brush and brush it onto my teeth I have had no problems. Works good!</li>
            <li> The product was just as it says so no complaints there. I only used it for 30 minutes and to me that is all I needed. I was at a 20% before I tried this. I used it for 30  minutes and it did not make my teeth sensitive until later on during the day. I would recommend just using the 30 minute time frame for now unless  your hard core or you have built up some type of immunity to it.</li>
            <li> I drink quite a bit of coffee and red wine so my teeth need a whitener.  This whitiner left them more clean than starting but not white.</li>
            <li> I feel so ripped off paying $20 per tube at the dentist for the EXACT same syringe!  This is a fantastic alternative!!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Burned my gums.. 35% is not recommended for home use.  Using 15% is the safest for in home. Learned the hard way. I have fitted trays from my dentist. Normally it doesn&#x27;t take much gel for it to overflow when I fill them. Even so I had a burn reaction in approximately 2 minutes. I should have done more research on the percentages. 35% I would not recommend.. overall very happy with product for the lower percentages.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good as the one I get from the dentist.  I will keep buying this product due to the price.  We will see how it turns out.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it burned my gums.. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and no longer apply the bleach onto the tray but use a q tip to apply it onto my teeth instead. I usually leave it on for 2 hours a few times a week. This is so worth it!! I will continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> bought this as a refill for my opalescence kit which cost hundreds from my dentist.  This is the same stuff, at a fraction of the cost.  It tingles, but no pain for me, and I saw results instantly, as it had been at least a year since I last used Opalescence.</li>
            <li> Worked as well in my home as it did in my dentists office - only at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product . I have used  before . It arrived  like when I purchased from the dentist sealed and  in tact . I will reorder .</li>
            <li> I have tried this same product, but bought it from my dentist. I seemed to have better luck with that one than this one that I bought. It works pretty well for the most part and isn&#x27;t too harsh. I know some reviews said it was really strong. My dentist recommened to take some motrin before using the product.</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of people complaining about this burning their gums. It is very important that you use this product with a mouth guard that is specifically made for your teeth or it will burn your gums because its not meant to go on your gums. It worked fast and was extremely affordable. Will definitely continue to buy as it has given me the best results of any teeth whitening product I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I worked in dental hygiene for many years and this is what we used as a whitening product for our patients. I have always loved this product because it produces great results.</li>
            <li> Have used the lower percentage gel with no problem, but this one is too strong, worry that it&#x27;s eating away my enamel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 20% Opalescence for years with no problem, and thought the 35% would be similar, just quicker.  I&#x27;ve found this strength can be very tricky.  It actually bleached parts of my gums where it oozed out of the trays, and I only had the trays in for approx. 20 min.  Believe me, I was freaking out, since I had a big event that evening.  The white areas did fade within a short time once I rinsed the gel off, but the next time I use this strength, I will paint it on with a small brush and not chance it getting on the gums.</li>
            <li> Perfect and cheaper than my dentist</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years with varying degrees of success. The latest purchase has an expiration date of D115 on the syringes. I just used this on my teeth for an hour with no whitening at all (not even any gum irritation!). Previous purchases have worked as described with 25 minutes about all I can take of gum and tooth pain. Other purchases have resulted in gum pain but almost no whitening after 30-45 minutes. It&#x27;s time to switch to something more reliable.</li>
            <li> 35% is as strong as it comes. I would not recommend it to anyone with very sensitive gums. Got my teeth three shades whiter in a matter of weeks. Shipment was fast and came well packaged.</li>
            <li> Works great! but the 35% is a little strong! Be careful not to leave on very long, will burn your gums!</li>
            <li> Be careful with this 35% solution....  I seriously *burned* my gum line because I didn&#x27;t realize how strong this was.  My gum line was BLACK up against my WHITE teeth.  Yeah, I looked very silly until it healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ordering the weaker solutions &amp; sleeping in them......  DO NOT DO THAT WITH THIS SOLUTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more than 35 minutes &amp; your teeth are freakin&#x27; perfect!!  I noticed a difference after the 1st treatment.  Did another treatment the next day &amp; my teeth look amazing.  So happy with this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Can I give 10 STARS?!?!?!****</li>
            <li> This whitening gel is one of the best I have ever used.  It whitens to a nice, bright shade quickly, and with no irritation or burning of the gums.  I really like this product and am sure I will purchase it again.  However, each individual syringe lasts me at least five whitenings, and I only whiten maybe twice a month ~ making this a really good value!</li>
            <li> This works well. Just be careful about how much product that you place in the tray each time and you won&#x27;t burn your mouth. Gel should be placed in a thin line at the junction of the bottom and front of the mouthpiece, not smeared all over it. Gel will naturally move to cover teeth.</li>
            <li> Works good as directed, good product. Could see big improvement after first use. I will buy more when required as needed.</li>
            <li> this product was as advertised.  just personal preference but, I have used the 10% in the past.  it works better for me because you can do it while sleeping</li>
            <li> i love it so far! game with 4 syringes all with caps except one but its the one that fell out of the holder so i dont care much!</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price. unbeatable. Excellent results. will keep buying it for the whole family. Recommended by my dentist.Thank you</li>
            <li> I happily use the 40% gel I get from my dentist, but I will buy the 35% from Amazon for a better price and save a trip to the dentist&#x27;s office. If you follow the instructions, you will have no problems. If you are careless, it will sting a bit. I&#x27;d rather have it sting than have yellow teeth.  Just sayin.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and securely wrapped. But I would not purchase this again. I&#x27;ve used Opal essence before and never had a problem. I have the trays from my dentist and have used the gels in the past with out having any burns.  But this one ... I had it in my mouth for only 3 minutes and my gum line was starting to turn white and burn. I&#x27;ve used the gels before and it should not burn you no matter how little or how much you use. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again</li>
            <li> I have been using this product  which was recommended by my dentist, for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This 35% is very strong. It burns if left on longer than the recommended time. It made my gums tender because I left it on about an hour. Don&#x27;t sleep in it either. It&#x27;s great if you have a hot date or special event and need to whiten super fast!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect. It is better than the $100+ stuff that your dentist sells you. Use it in your tray, and bleach for, at most 45 minutes, and your teeth will be pearly white. And that is just after one bleaching. Don&#x27;t overdo it though or you will be in agony. When I first used this, I thought, to myself &amp;#34;Well, 35% solution isn&#x27;t that strong, let&#x27;s go 3 hours.&amp;#34; There was a World&#x27;s Dumbest Marathon on TruTv, so I had nothing better to do, you know? Several BIG mistakes. First, I forgot: I&#x27;m not a chemist. As it turns out, 35% solution is like looking God in the face. You just don&#x27;t do it. Second, my teeth and gums hurt so bad, it hurt to talk (which I am sure my husband just loved---having a silent wife for an evening). Third, my teeth were so white that they light up a room. Seriously. For the next day, whenever I managed to grin and bare through the pain (get it! GRIN AND...oh well), my smile was like having your ipad brightness turned up to 100%. On the bright side (ha-ha---just dropping bad puns all day here), I did manage to lose a few pounds because of the soreness in my mouth prevented me from eating or drinking anything for a few days. So, in short, don&#x27;t be like me. Just buy the product and use for 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> A good friend of mine who is also a dental hygienist recommended this product to me. I love that you only have to leave this product on for around 30 minutes and you&#x27;re good to go. Just be careful to not get the gel on your gums. You will definitely feel a burning, numbing sensation.</li>
            <li> I got to my goal and then went 5 years without using this. This time I had to get my veneers replaced with crowns and wanted to get really white this time. Well, the dentist said I am now in the top 1% of how white my teeth are compared to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my new notes for the 35% version:&lt;br /&gt;1. This time I knew how to apply it and never burned my gums. If you burned your gums, you did not apply it correctly. You put too much in. All you need is a bead of gel, or even a drop where each tooth is in the tray. AND USE ONLY CUSTOM TRAYS FROM YOUR DENTIST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also make sure you do not have any periodontal gum issues. If you do, I would get that taken care of first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I was patient. It took every night for a few weeks. I used at least 12 tubes. Maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your teeth are real yellow, I suggest starting with 12 tubes, and use every night if possible. If it takes 12-20 weeks, at least it is easy to maintain after you get to the desired whiteness. Be patient. It is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I kept it in for at least 1 hour because I did not have teeth sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed my teeth by several shades. It works if done correctly. I am also in my 50&#x27;s, so I had years of coffee, wine, and no dental appointments.</li>
            <li> Whiter smile, works great. Only used this product for a half hour with bleaching trays I already had, teeth were noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> My dentist charges me $60  for this product. Too bad I found it on amazon for less then half. And nothing gets your teeth whiter than this product. And if you can stand a little pain with the 35 % your teeth will be really white after one time use. I promise you this.</li>
            <li> Not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased whitener on line. This is offered as 35% active ingredient. I repeat her doubt it. I have purchased 20% elsewhere that you could really feel the sting of the peroxide. With this &amp;#34;35%&amp;#34;, nothing. Also, didn&#x27;t note remarkable difference is white.</li>
            <li> Opalescence 35% at the recommended application time does not seem to have the same whitening power as the 20% at its recommended application time.  It seems it should.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a big deal really.</li>
            <li> Great product, would def buy this again.  however, when I received it, there were four syringes only 2 out of the four had the protective cap on them.  two were open.  I did email them to let them know and they gave me a full refund.  I def would use this again!  I didn&#x27;t pay for 4 of them to only be able to only use 2.  the product does work, just need to be careful on your gums.  they will turn white but will go away in just a very short time.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!! My orders always correct and its a great price. I work at a dentist office and opalesence is better then the stiff we use</li>
            <li> Thanks !!  Your product has helped me look great and for a good price.  I will buy your stuff again!</li>
            <li> I put it on and it started to brun my gums right away, I could only stand it for 5 minutes.  I will get 20% never 35% again, ouch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems using over the counter gels in the past because my teeth are really sensitive, so I finally went in to my Dentist and had custom trays made. I was recommended this specific brand by my Dentist, and prefer the 35% compared to higher to limit pain during use. It takes more applications for the overall desired effect, but the pain management makes it absolutely worth it. For use, I only keep this on for 20-30 minutes rather than overnight, and take the trays off when the &amp;#34;zinging&amp;#34; gets to the point where I don&#x27;t want to feel it anymore. A great alternative to ZOOM which is pricey and doesn&#x27;t last very long, and I actually like the color this gives more---you can customize it. (The reason being I have nerve damage on my front tooth that ZOOM made too apparent, and it tools months for my teeth to look normal again. This bleach I never have that problem with). My teeth always look natural, vibrant, and like I&#x27;m really proud of them.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. My dentist gives me only 1 for free every 6 months. So glad Amazon carries them!</li>
            <li> Warnings:  As many others have stated, the 35% is not for the uneducated.  Read The Factory Manual.  You absolutely need custom made dental trays for this stuff, as you don&#x27;t want it oozing up onto your gums.  Leave it on for no longer than the recommended 30 minutes the first time to determine your sensitivity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:  I just quit smoking after 20 years, and my teeth were horribly yellowed.  After about two tubes of this, they&#x27;re amazingly brighter and whiter.  I use about a third of a tube per each application even doing ALL of my teeth both inside AND out (yes, I have OCD).  Still some yellowing at the base of the teeth that I hope to clear, but my dentist says that in older (?!) adults, that could be the dentin (naturally yellowish layer beneath the enamel) showing through.  I will begin a more strict regimen of applying this stuff (I&#x27;ve been a bit sporadic) and hope to find that it&#x27;s staining from a lifetime of bad habits.  If you&#x27;re considering 35% versus a lower strength, consider in terms of your patience and/or desire to sleep with trays in your mouth.  I tried 15% several years ago, and just ended up not really using it because I hated having the trays in my mouth overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller:  Absolutely A+ for the company filling the order.  The product arrives quickly, is exactly as advertised, and is fresh.  My most recent order arrived May 30, 2014 and had R046 on the syringe, which means R&#x3D;Lot Identifier, 04&#x3D;April, and 6&#x3D;2016.  So I&#x27;ve got about two years to use this stuff!  For those that aren&#x27;t sure of the expiration date coding, this quote is straight from Ultradent&#x27;s product sheet:  &amp;#34;Ultradent syringes have an expiration date stamped on the side of the syringe consisting of one letter and three numbers.  The letter is a lot number used for manufacturing purposes and the three numbers are the expiration date. The first two numbers are the month, and the third number is the last number of the year.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get smiling! :D</li>
            <li> works as it&#x27;s described and def. worth the price. Buy it and you will love it. I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> Mine were fresh as advertised. Have been using them for over a year with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just watch your gums!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!  My dentist wanted 4 times this amount for the same item.  I spend enough with him.</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as decribed.  Vendor provided prompt delivery, and prduct received in excellent conditions with full instructions.</li>
            <li> It bleaches your teeth. Whiter. The higher percentage is stronger, which is confusing if you don&#x27;t understand math. Would have given 5 stars if the percentages were better explained.</li>
            <li> The products are great. I always use this kind for my teeth and I love it. The sender is awesome! Very fast service. Overall 5 Stars for everyone.</li>
            <li> Strong - and great product!</li>
            <li> great product good price !!!!</li>
            <li> Ordering this online is so much cheaper than getting it from the dentist.  Works if you are consistent at using it at least once a week.  35% is the strongest.  If you can handle this strength, it&#x27;s the one you should use for whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in March of 2017 and I&#x27;ve been using it and have also kept in the refrigerator. I&#x27;ve noticed that it hasn&#x27;t been working at all since I got it. I just looked at the expiration date and it expired in February!!!!! I&#x27;m beyond disappointed and I know if it were good it would do it&#x27;s job. NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> Experienced some burning of the gums, otherwise this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased whitening gels from my dentist for years but thought I would try this to save money. After only 10 (painful) minutes my gums were literally throbbing....for the record, I have a very high pain tolerance (natural childbirth). My real concern came later as my teeth were aching (it felt like the pain was radiating all the way to the roots) so badly that I could not eat for the rest of the day. My teeth feel fine again today, but the experience was highly concerning to me. I have never experienced anything like it, not with national brand strips, generic whitening strips or dentist provided gel for trays.</li>
            <li> Love the bleaching gel. It does an excellent job whitening my teeth. The price was great and I would highly recommend the product to other people.</li>
            <li> Made my gums become irritated.  Took tray ourt and did not use again.  Would not buy again after this experence!</li>
            <li> This is a second time I have purchased this product.  I purchased this strength because I wanted visible results in a short amount of time.  And that&#x27;s what you get from this product.  Fast acting with minimal time required to keep it on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!  This is sold at my dentist office for $60.  Works great, best gel around.  Great buy! :)</li>
            <li> Loving this little whitening stuff. 35 percent is the best way to go...however your teeth may get sensitive!  Just don&#x27;t drink coffee for a few days or your in trouble.</li>
            <li> great product shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it on for more than one hour or it could bleach your gums too! I always brush my teeth first with Sensodyne toothpaste to help with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great whitening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been whitening my teeth for years People are used to it but I used this for one week and everyone starting asking me again about how I was getting my teeth so white.</li>
            <li> This worked the best for me and good thing I found it here at Amazon! I first purchased this from my doctor at the triple the price! I&#x27;ve always had great results.</li>
            <li> I have used Opalescence before and am very happy to be able to buy it online now as it is more expensive through my dentist.  The 35% is really good as I find I do not have to whiten my teeth as often which is good because I do not want to run the risk of doing it too much.</li>
            <li> Made my teeth pearly white.  However, after using the product for a few weeks in a row, sleeping with the inserts, I found myself waking up with excruciating teeth pain.  I just used them less frequently.  Not for the faint at heart, but the result are great.  I actually tried Zune.  Same results, but far less pain.</li>
            <li> This is very strong whitening gel!  My hygienist recommended to put little dots of it in the tray instead of a line so that the tray doesn&#x27;t overflow.  If it touches the gums, it will burn them a bit.  However, it heals up in a couple of days.  Another tip - do it ever day for 3 days and don&#x27;t drink anything that stains when you are whitening, including coffee, tea or soda!</li>
            <li> Did not work that well</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! Same as my Orthodontist used to give me. A must have!</li>
            <li> I paid $60 for identical item at dentist office. Have used this product for years and it is a Very good product. Use with care so you don&#x27;t burn your gums.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed using this product for a long time.  Effective, tastes fine, doesn&#x27;t burn.  Have nothing&lt;br /&gt;else to say that I haven&#x27;t already said.</li>
            <li> Love it! But as the other reviews said, it is very strong. You will find out if you have a cavity if you use it, that is how I found out I had a slight crack in my front tooth. In the reviews someone said to paint it on..genius, That way you don&#x27;t use too much. I have been painting it on the inside of my trays, that works great too, The directions say to leave it on 35 minutes, you can leave it a little longer, but it will bleach your gums, temporarily.</li>
            <li> I will order this again.  Extra whitening.  Trays do not come with it so you have to order separately.  But still a good price and excellent results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brand before with only 20%.  You had to leave them in longer and I paid $55 from my dentist&#x27;s office.  I decided to check if Amazon sold it and to my surprise it was was stronger and much less expensive.  This particular product also has a mint taste - which is way better when pulling out of your mouth before brushing.</li>
            <li> works great, been using for years</li>
            <li> Love it. It works. Only wish was that it came with better instructions and tips. I had to consult my dentist, friends and online to know the amount to use, how to get it into the retainer, etc.</li>
            <li> This product works very well</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before, purchased from my dentist.  I like the flavor and it seems to work quite quickly.  The price, here, is much less than at my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s gentle yet effective, unlike some harsher bleaches I have used. I only have to use it once a week, and I&#x27;m a moderate coffee drinker.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the price is right!</li>
            <li> I just followed the directions and within 30 minutes my teeth were back white. A little sensitivity but, nothing that was unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  The solution is really strong, so if you have sensitive gums, I would suggest going with something a bit less in percentage.  Overall this product was AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Terrible! Burnt my gums in less than 15 sec</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. You use it with the molds you get from your dentist only instead of paying your dentist fifty bucks for a refill, buy this on amazon for a fraction of the cost. I store mine in the ice box and use it every couple of months for a touch up. Works great and you only have to use it once, not multiple days. It can make your teeth sensitive but that is short lived.</li>
            <li> Product was very thick and hard to keep in each crevice of the tray.</li>
            <li> I am a dental professional, and have this product in lower dose in office . I bought this 35% on amazon ....I have a fitted tray .....no instructions come with this package as to how to use .....other than heat the tray ....so be careful .....trim the tray so it fits close and not on gum .....place vaseline on gums ....do not need to place gel on back teeth as you do not see these ......If you have roots exposed should use sensitive paste for few weeks before ......use no more than 1/3 tube each time ......keep in for 30-60 min.  spit out excess rinse and brush and rinse tray well for next time use.  Keep gel in refrigerator . If it is burning that means it is on your gums .</li>
            <li> These worked great and in a quick time. I used this about 2 weeks out from my wedding. Easy to use and I didn&#x27;t have any teeth sensitivity after. I have sensitive gums, but the gel didn&#x27;t bother them at all. Will use again.</li>
            <li> Burns your gums. Badly. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I ordered it on Friday, Dec 5 and got it the next day!!!  Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the highest quality after reading some of the reviews, but it surpassed my expectations.  I followed all the instructions for the 35% gel, with the exception of leaving on for only 30 mins. (I left it on for 60 mins instead)......and my teeth are now many shades whiter and brighter.  I would recommend this product and will order again.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well, but a word of warning. Don&#x27;t use it imediately after eating sharp foods like potato chips or after brushing your teeth when your gums are more sensitive. I suggest waiting at least an hour after eating or burshing before using this product.</li>
            <li> It left my teeth blotchy all over.  It was old and seemed dried up.  I do not recommend to purchase...</li>
            <li> Works great, but very powerful.  Follow the directions for application,  If you leave it on too long it can burn your gums.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and undamaged. good stuff. It is stronger and does irritate gums more than 20% but is Ok. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was dried up, and could not use it. I would not recommend from this company.</li>
            <li> Great product, but don&#x27;t leave on teeth too long!</li>
            <li> Use the lower strength that requires overnight wear, or be prepared to burn your gums where they touch the tray. When I say &amp;#34;burn,&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t mean &amp;#34;This will sting a bit,&amp;#34; which is how I chose to interpret other reviewers&#x27; warnings. I mean burned as in injured. Used this as directed four times on upper teeth, to see if I could tell a difference between upper and lower after several treatments. No noticeable difference yet, and I&#x27;m suspending use until my gums and palate heal. There was a snow-white area of my gums above a front tooth when I removed the tray after the fourth use - blindingly white, the way you&#x27;d like your teeth to be, but on your gums it looks like you have a disease. Thank heaven the whiteness faded after an hour or so, but it was replaced by a dark red area that looks like a cigarette burn on skin. Eating crunchy cereal now hurts the palate just behind my front teeth, like the sting of a paper cut. Oragel helps. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m afraid to aggravate the burn by using even a mild whitening product. Previous experience with Opalesence gel was at the 15% strength purchased from the dentist who made my trays. It was expensive, so when I found the brand at such cheap prices here on Amazon, I thought I&#x27;d found a real bargain. The product is no doubt past the sell-by date or it wouldn&#x27;t be so heavily discounted, but when my gumlime immediately began to tingle - then sting - with first use, I thought that meant the product was fresh enough to get the job done. So far, the only visible change is the sore on my bleached gums... Some reviewers say they protected their gums by applying Vaseline, but I was specifically trying to whiten the yellow area just along the gumline, so I didn&#x27;t try that.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Must be careful if you have sensitive teeth/gums, just use less time.  But definately a great product!</li>
            <li> I received this item much faster than the expected delivery date. This was very nice because I was anxious to try Opalescence after so, so results with Venus White Pro. The product was fresh, and the gel had a better consistency than Venus White. My teeth were noticeably more white with Opalescence. And I received more comments in one month&#x27;s use with this product, than one month with the other brand. I highly recommend Opalescence. I use 35, up to 2hrs. Using sensitive toothpaste before and after helps reduce sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Some people spend a lot on getting bleach from the dentist. But its the same thing here it works just as good for much less!! This is awesome stuff! I seriously recommend it as a dental assistant.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price</li>
            <li> Very good. I use regularly.</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve used it before. However, one of the syringes was opened and that should be something the supplier checks before sending to the customer.</li>
            <li> This gel is exactly what I was getting at my dentist and is a lot more reasonable.  It whitens teeth and does not hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> I have been using the 15% and was not getting the results I wanted, so I thought the 35% would be good. It is very strong and my gums and teeth actually hurt today, from using it last night. One of the other reviews recommended puting them on your teeth and not use the trays.. I think I&#x27;m going to try that as long as I keep the product off my lips and gums, will see how that works, but that will be in a few days..Be VERY careful with this.</li>
            <li> I like the price and the service</li>
            <li> I bought these as refills for my trays provided by my dentist. This is the exact same brand and worked the same as the gel I received for the dentist!</li>
            <li> As such you should get it the first time at the dentist where you will be taught how to use it. First of all, the Opalescence Treatment should be started with a product called Boost. It HAS to be applied by a dentist. It is 40% plus a booster. The dentist will mix it right in front of you and it will turn red. Before it is applied he will use a device to keep your mouth open and lips out of the way. Then he will paint your gums with a fast setting polymer plastic that will protect your gums. Once set he will apply the Boost to your teeth leave it for 20 minutes and suction it off, then apply another tube. After suctioning that off he or she will remove the polymer and you will brush your teeth. And POOF beautiful Shiney Whiter Teeth. The Opalescence is for take home for touch ups to get a lighter shade than the Boost gave you, for smokers and for people who&#x27;s teeth are hard to bleach. The dentist will determine by the amount of whitening that occures from the Boost and what your goals are what % Oplalescence to give you. The 35% is ONLY for a quick, 1 hour or less, touch up before a date or whatever. The other important thing is the following.  Before any of this happenes your dentist will take a mold of your teeth and then make a plaster posotive from it. He will then take a special plastic that he heats up and vacume forms it on the mold. After it coms off the mold the dentist trims it to go to the gum line, exactly, which is why people are getting burned with home formed trays.Opalescence PF has a high amount of floride in it and has been shown in studies to be the only whitener that strenthens enamel and reduces sensitivity. The other  thing is that Opalescence leaves some of the natural variation in color that teeth have unless you over use it. So you teeth are whiter but still look natural. The whiteners that use lasers and ultraviolet light tend to turn your teeth so white that they look like a bad set of dentures, as they also take the natural shine away from your teeth. Giving you that look that you see on TV where it looks like the actors had their teeth painted in or colored after the movie was shot by computer graphics LOL.I participated in a teeth whitening study and was lucky enough to get in the Opalescence group. When all of us got together at the end and compared teeth, the Opalescence group looked far better than any of the other groups and of course better than the control group who just used whitening tooth paste. It really is a fantastic product. It must, however, be used correctly. It can work without the Boost, but it takes much longer and the results are not as uniform. If you make your own teeth trays( the boil and suck kind) then consider drawing on them with a very fine point permanat marker along the gum line. then take them out and use a very sharp small set of scissors to cut them to not go past your teeth and over your gums. Also only apply the gel to tray where it will touch the front of your teeth, no one will see behind your teeth and the tralys can&#x27;t be trimmed acurately for behind your teeth. Lastly after putting the trays with the gel in them on,press tham onto your teeth and wipe any gell that oozes out off your gums with a cloth, a cotton cloth, not a paper towel. This is how my dentist explained the use of this product to me. I also went to College for Chemistry and know very well the dangers of 35% carbamide Peroxide which is like hydrogen peroxide. One of the most amazing things about Opalescence besides the fact that it strengthens your teeth is how it makes the shine and glisten like pearls. The price can&#x27;t be beat either. Zoom costs $150 for a touch up 4 times a year, I don&#x27;t know what the ibitial application costs and the Laser  one is more. Just be ceful and make sure the producty is fresh and real and that you keep it in the refridgerator. Sorry for my terrible typing/spelling. Be careful and happy smiling! P.S. - Don&#x27;t forget to get you teeth cleaned professionally first or youwill end up bleaching placque and when it gets scraped off you will have a dark spot underneath.</li>
            <li> Burns the gums something bad. Sends shockwaves into the tooth.</li>
            <li> I am use to whitening my teeth. Ive used this name brand often. But this one seems to be at too high of a percentage for me. Some always accidentally gets on your gingiva (gums) and my gums were burning so bad that I couldnt keep it on more than 5min! There was no time to be affective! Thus it was a waste of money! :-((( Next time... back to a lower a percentage. This name brand is what all reputable dentists use.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 15 minutes each time, four times. My teeth are seriously whiter! However, it causes A LOT of sensitivity in my gums and teeth. When I have it in, it feels like needles are stabbing my gums. This goes away when I take it out, but then after each treatment I experience serious tooth sensitivity for the 24 hours following. I hate to say &amp;#34;it&#x27;s worth it&amp;#34;, but beauty is pain and this is the only product I have found that actually got my teeth whiter. But if you know you have sensitive teeth, might opt for something different!</li>
            <li> Some of the tubes contained whitening gel that indeed seemed to be of advertised strength and other tubes were duds causing no foaming action or whitening at all and they were all in the same package! The company would do well to focus on quality control and spend less on the fancy packaging that probably costs more than the gel to manufacture. The get is shipped in a beautiful but useless plastic dome package with the syringes inserted upside down in a plastic base onto which a sturdy plastic dome is attached. The syringes themselves contain very little gel as they are very thin and tiny. The company would be well advised to save money on the fancy packaging and give more product and maintain better quality control. The gel that worked worked well to whiten my teeth and the gel that didn&#x27;t did virtually nothing - hence three stars.</li>
            <li> after years of abuse with cigarettes and coffee, i decided to purchase the opalescence 35% teeth whitening gel. At first it made my gums sensative but after about using it twice it subsided, long store short it worked pretty good. My teeth arent hollywood white but my girlfriend can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I used to get this same product from my dentist and pay $40.00 for the same amount.Bad economy, but beautiful teeth.Great deal, will continue buying this product here.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product for whitening,  but make sure you get some kind of sensitivity gel to use after.  This is a much cheaper route to take than the &amp;#34;white strips&amp;#34;  and works much better,  you get tons of uses out of it,  i  really only have to spend 40 dollars a year to keep a white smile after finding this product online.</li>
            <li> It works better than anything else i have used.  I use it for 30 minute treatments. I get mild irritation on my gums for that duration.  Not an issue.  The value is excellent.</li>
            <li> My last whitening was 4 years ago when I had a professional tray made and my Dentist recommended and gave me 35% Opalescence.  It worked well.  A professional tray helps keep the gel off the gums rather than a store bought tray.  I decided it was time for another round.  I purchased this a week or so ago and it came with no instructions or expiration date. The syringes and box look exactly the same except for the tip. The one I received has a pull off tip that you can&#x27;t reseal; unlike the one I received from my dentist. It is definately not the same strength, nor is it working the same. It may be an old batch that has lost it&#x27;s potency. So, you may get a hit or miss with this company.  The real strength is what others are complaining about; very strong! 1 hour is sufficient per use. I had this batch in for two hours and the only tingle I felt was from the mint flavoring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years, every since I got a custom mouth piece made. Just like with every bleach kit, be careful you don&#x27;t leave this on for too long. I have sensitive teeth (but I have been using this product for years) and leave mine in for about 15-20 mins. I use it maybe once a month. Works like a charm :)</li>
            <li> Burned my gums. Yikes!!!</li>
            <li> I like this whitening gel ok, but like others said, it does burn the gums some.  The consistency is pretty thick so you can&#x27;t just put the gel on the tooth before putting your trays in. I tried putting a little gel in the tray just on the tooth part, but when I put them in the gel pushes around and gets on my gums and starts burning within minutes.  I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you buy the Strong stuff.  I eventually got a little paintbrush and painted the gel on my teeth and that seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li> Works just like I expected, took my teeth a few shades lighter. I just love this product. This is not the first time I use it and I will continue to use...better than the one my dentist gave me.</li>
            <li> It was just as advertised.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about expired product and I have a feeling that&#x27;s what I got.  The gel is really thick and not very strong at all.  It&#x27;s more like 15% rather than 35%.  Disappointing :(</li>
            <li> This bleach really whitens the teeth!  But....OUCH!  If you have sensitive teeth be prepared for some pain after bleaching.  I would recommend getting some sensitive toothpaste to use BEFORE and AFTER bleaching.  It helps.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than getting it from the dentist and lasts a longtime when refrigerated.  Can burn gums if not used with a well fitting custom tray.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it was very effective. For some reason this batch did not help at all. I used all 4 tubes at different times.  Usually with 1 use, you get results.  Not with this batch.  I don&#x27;t know if it was on the shelf too long, but it was no good. I will go to a different seller.</li>
            <li> Great service, received this product on time. This opalescent 35% was a bit too strong.  Next time I will go for 20%.</li>
            <li> I experienced no sensitivity on my teeth with the 35%, however; when the gel comes in contact with my gums, it burns and it turns it white. But it heals within a day or two. I have used 1 tube so far and it has whitened my teeth quite a bit already!</li>
            <li> Works good on teeth do not get on Gums or put in a bleaching trays. This is so strong that it took the skin on a few layers off my gumsand hurt like hell as a chemical burn. Bloody burn gums ouch!.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I use one tube once a month to keep my smile its brightest.  It is fast, easy, tastes good, very inexpensive, and gives me the exact results I want without fail.</li>
            <li> Well, it could be me, but I did get some gum irritation.  This happened the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> concentration of 35 % is very strong and gives sensitivity to teeth and it can burn ur gums if gel escape trays. defenitely i would not recommend for people with high sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have tried several whitening gel&#x27;s over the year&#x27;s and this is by far the worst .I used it once for&lt;br /&gt;30 minutes as directed and my teeth were sore for 2 day&#x27;s. I recommend Colgate Whitening Gel.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it so soooooo much more expensive from my Dentist.</li>
            <li> This is the best / whitens my teeth within 20 minutes ... no need to reuse day after day.</li>
            <li> i should have bought 2!</li>
            <li> I use this product occasionally when I feel that my teeth are looking dull.  i have a tray that I use, and wear the gel for about 30 minutes, which is what the instructi;ons call for.  It really brightens up my teeth, and quickly. It can cause a little sensitivity, which has happened to me, but the sensitivity decreases quickly.  Great for a really bright smile.</li>
            <li> It works great and was not as expensive as the product I used to get from my dentist.  Yes, I&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This identical product was recommended by my dentist and to me to me at more than 3x the price as Amazon. It works. I usually use once a month and it keeps my teeth looking a good, yet natural, white.</li>
            <li> This gel works great! After just one use, my teeth had coffee &amp; tobacco stains that were totally gone!! Tastes minty. U dont need much- just a tiny dot over each tooth. Dont waste your money on other strengths or brands...go for the gold that works after 1 use!  but the bleach tubes seem to have SHRUNK since my last order!! 😡</li>
            <li> I have always used this brand of whitener and have liked it.  You do have to be super careful not to get this on your gums as it burns instantly.</li>
            <li> Great product, but be very careful NOT to get it on your gums.  I love how fast this brand works, but I burn my gums nearly every time I use it - even after careful application.</li>
            <li> By gosh, by golly...I do believe this really works!  No burning, no sensitivity. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with directions. - like am I using it too often??  Anyhow, paint it on with a Q-tip, cover teeth with a tray or if nothing else, fit foil over them. Leave it on for 15 minutes at a time, and voil&amp;agrave;, those tea stains start disappearing immediately!</li>
            <li> This product works well. I only leave it on for 30 minutes. Have not had any problems with it burning my gums. Why bother with the less potent version that you have to leave on longer? Tip - I have had my teeth professionally whitened in the past and have the fitted trays to use, I only put the product in the trays for the top 6 and bottom 6 teeth and put in very little so it doesn&#x27;t ooze out of the trays. I will use it three times a week about twice a year to keep the stains down - coffee, tea, wine etc.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking why not go strong. well now I know.... This product and really burn your gums if you leave it on over a half an hour. Would never buy this strong again</li>
            <li> I got these after I got my first batch from my dentist. These are just like it and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have tried gels and they do not  get my teeth as white as opalescent !!the best on the market!!</li>
            <li> Very unsure of the quality of this.  When I purchase it from my dentist it is clearly marked with an expression date and this one had none.  Did not feel like it was doing much because my previous experience had me feeling a tingle in the gums</li>
            <li> Great for bleaching teeth. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! Be sure, when using the 35% gel, that you only leave it on with the tray for no more than an hour. DO NOT LEAVE IT ON OVERNIGHT, YOU CAN IRRITATE YOUR GUMS. iF YOU WANT TO LEAVE it ON OVERNIGHT, USE THE 20% GEL (OR LESS).</li>
            <li> used to work over past years now the last 2-3 orders I receive do not seem to give any results…wonder if they changed the formula or went &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Put this on my teeth molds and put it in about 20 minutes ago. Will be taking them out shortly. Here are my initial reactions.&lt;br /&gt;1. within seconds of putting them in, I felt a little bit of tingling on my gums like a bubbling type of tingly. I initially thought it was hurting, but after chilling out for about 30 seconds I noticed that it was more of a generally funny feeling and that it didn&#x27;t hurt, it was just different.&lt;br /&gt;2. I do pick up a bit of mintiness from this.&lt;br /&gt;3. It would be great if the manufacturer put marks on the syringe which shows 30% / 50% marks to show how much you have expressed into the teeth mold.&lt;br /&gt;4. Very easy to push out and to get it into the mold without making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will perhaps post a follow up after I have used this for a couple more days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same stuff my dentist sold me but for 1/4 the price.  It works well but don&#x27;t use too much or it burns your gums.  Also you do need to have the forms made by your dentist</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. My wife worked in a dental clinic and I got it free for years. Now, I have to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I have had good results with what I have purchased here and intend to buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my personal story and I suggest that you read this if your interested in this product.  After reading all the other reviews, especially the negative reviews talking about gum issues (burning, etc) and doing some extensive reasearch, I have come to find why people are complaining and what they have done wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you start out at your dentist.  Have a REAL custom tray made of your teeth so that it is a perfect fit and does not overlap onto your gums.  This is extremely important.  The main reasons people complain about this product on the reviews is because of the &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sizzling&amp;#34; they are feeling on their gums.  You will see that 99% of the time these people have used the self / made at home tray.  Or they put too much in the tray and don&#x27;t wipe off the extra that comes out onto your gums after putting the tray onto your teeth.  If you don&#x27;t wipe off the excess than you will feel burning, and it will hurt quite a bit.  Also, don&#x27;t leave the tray in for more than 1 hour.  The true instructions directly for the manufacturer and my dentist say anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes. Personally, I put them on before I got to bed, watch a 1 hour TV show and then take them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to know about is the expiration dates.  This is important when buying online.  On the syringe you will see (towards the top of the gel filled area, below the pump handle) a cryptic 4 digit number/letter combination.  For instance (Y036).  The most important number is the last - in this case &amp;#34;6&amp;#34;.  &amp;#34;6&amp;#34; means that it expires in 2016.  The two numbers before that are the month.  So in this case Y036 expires March 2016.  Be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally use the 35%.  Yes it is strong and does work very well, but even if you follow all my advise, I will be honest I feel a little burning, but it&#x27;s not that bad and goes away within 10 minutes after I remove the trays.  If you are concerned about this, start off witha lower dose.  But I would definitely recommend this product.  Happy Whitening!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after using this product 10 days. I really noticed a major difference and had several positive comments from friends/family after doing the 2nd round of 10 days.</li>
            <li> These are supposedly a higher percent than the syringes I received from my dentist. I highly doubt it. I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed much whitening difference.</li>
            <li> Bought this to change it up from my normal teeth whitening gel, I&#x27;m not missing out on anything. Didn&#x27;t notice much whitening going on but i sure did notice the thickness of the gel. It&#x27;s so thick it doesn&#x27;t want to spread on the tooth surface it just clumps. I can appreciate a thicker gel as too runny would cause it to smear off easily on trays but theres such a thing as too thick it wont cover the surface required</li>
            <li> if u leave them in too long, they irritate your gums pretty bad.  made mine very sore and looked bleached out</li>
            <li> This whitener works great, just make sure it doesn&#x27;t get on your gums because it will burn and get irritated. Just put a small amount in the lining of the mouth tray because it will spread. This whitener gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and I&#x27;m aware that you are supposed to wipe off any access that gets onto your gums, but this is way easier said than done. I only put a little bit into the tray thinking I&#x27;d avoid too much overflow and carefully wiped as best as I could the gum tissue. After only 3 minutes it was stinging and burning, so I took the tray out only to find some still got onto my gums and burned them. Its nearly impossible to not get ANY on your gums on at and yet still cover your teeth enough. Garbage and its going in the trash. I&#x27;ve used this product before with success but had gotten it straight from my dentist, same brand and strength and everything and never had this issue. Perhaps the company that is shipping this isn&#x27;t the real deal or maybe they&#x27;ve changed their formula, either way don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> This product did the trick, it whitens teeth well, will definitely order again&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it to brighten up those pearly whites!!</li>
            <li> Product was just like what I get from the dentist for a fraction of the price.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Works but a very strong taste so that may off set the savings for some but I&#x27;m going to use it up.</li>
            <li> A lil too strong but works very well.  Can burn your gums &amp; temporarily turn them white but it goes away.  Writing this 11 mos later (thats how long they lasted) I bought the 20 or 25% hoping for less burn.  But might not be as effective.</li>
            <li> Burns dangerously like CRAZY. My gums are stark dead white after 2 uses - 30 minutes each time, 1/4 tube in each tray. Not light pink, but WHITE. It is SEVERELY painful on my lips and gums. I&#x27;ve used the 20% for years off and on and it&#x27;s great. Used this for 30 minutes last night on upper and lower teeth and today my lips were raw, ripped open, blistered and painful....felt like acid was on them. The pain and rawness have gotten worse throughout the day. People asked me what if I was using a new lipstick today - my lips were so swollen and red. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. Tonight I put the trays in again and the burning pain is unbearable. Anything that burns your tissue this much cannot be good for it. The 20% solution works great and I would recommend it highly. The pain of the 35% solution is not worth it. I had my trays made professionally years ago and now I do a touch up for about 4-5 days every couple years. After the first day I can see a difference. But after using this 35% solution twice, I can see no difference.  This is a frightening product. Why would it turn gums white?  EDIT: 2 days later my healthy gums are still bleeding and my lips are still blistered, raw, and swollen.</li>
            <li> Works very nicely.  It&#x27;s strong so don&#x27;t get it on your gums.</li>
            <li> I used to get this stuff when I was dental assisting,  opalescent sent us samples of it all the time and I loved it! I was so excited to get it on amazon. It&#x27;s an awesome quick whitening trick. Wouldn&#x27;t keep it on more than 30 minutes at a time due to sensitivity, but I do that once every few weeks and it maintains the whiteness of my teeth. I get comments all the time on how white my teeth are. Be warned: this will burn your gums. I use it with custom trays that have a well for the product to go in.</li>
            <li> It works as promised!</li>
            <li> This product is MUCH too strong!  After only a few minutes my gums were burning.  I immediately took it out and my gums are burnt, they are literally white where the gel touched them.  I did not use a lot in the tray, can&#x27;t imagine if I had.  Please beware, this is too strong, do not buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this directly from the dentist office before for 5x&#x27;s the price.  This stuff works great, just make sure you have the correct mouth pieces made or you will defiantly burn your gums.  My teeth and gums get very sensitive for the rest of the day after doing it but after that I&#x27;m fine.  One tube and my teeth are very noticeably whiter!</li>
            <li> Great , I see difference in the first application and it only took 30 min.The price is great for that product, I&#x27;m using it for 4 days in the road and my tooth is already soo bright white ,I believe I will use only 2 more days .</li>
            <li> I use it once every 3 months for 3 hours for the  35% and I leave it for 6-8 hours if I use the 20%</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a solution this strong. It really burns your gums if you use it for the entire time you are suppose to. I kept it on about 15 minutes the first time and a little less the following times.&lt;br /&gt;It DOES whiten the teeth, also the gums! but beware, it is very strong!</li>
            <li> This is very strong and powerful stuff, my gums are burning and it&#x27;s rather uncomfortable.  Unless you have been advised by a professional dentist I would recommend using the 20%.</li>
            <li> I was originally given this product at my dentist&#x27;s office a five or six years ago, and decided that I&#x27;d like to brighten up the pearly whites again.  Much better deal going thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well. Was very pleased with this product . I Will be buying more of this again</li>
            <li> Love this whitening gel.&lt;br /&gt;a small amount goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;this is the best whitener I have found.&lt;br /&gt;order came fast and will order again.</li>
            <li> I use this product and it works well and cost less than buying at a regular store.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Very strong, be careful. Works well</li>
            <li> I did not use the full amount of one because my teeth are small. Of course it still got on my gums causing burning sensations.I used water and my finger to wipe away the get fast off my gums. I also heard a crackle when I first put them in, umm that is a little scary. I notice in two very small spots of my gums it turned it white. I only had the trays in a few minutes to see if the burning would go away, it did not. I will take the gross flavor, cheaper ones that I used years ago any day and just pay the ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:I barely used enough to cover the inside of the teeth mold. It worked and no burning. My teeth brighted up the first time. AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> 35% is way too strong, I don&#x27;t know how anyone can use this. It was painful and my gums were a mess. I will stick with the 10% my dentist gives me.</li>
            <li> I do not think it works. I used to buy whitening gel from my dentist and it had lower viscosity and it would burn my gums, but it would whiten my teeth. This solution does not burn my gums, it is less liquid and it does not have any effect on my teeth color.</li>
            <li> This whitening gel came right away, even with the holiday rush. I didn&#x27;t know I was getting 4 needles of gel, I thought it was just 2 , so I was very pleased with that surprise.The price was much lower than my dentist wass going to charge me ($45 !! ).I will be ordering for this product again on loone from this seller and never getting it from my dentist again!  It is the same stuff!</li>
            <li> dont use after flossing, burns and whites out gums-yuk</li>
            <li> So powerful. DO NOT go bananas and leave this in for 2 hours trying to get power white, you&#x27;re teeth will be so sensitive after. That said, this is effective and got my shade where I wanted without day after day of treatment like the lighter strengths.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It is as strong as the stuff from the dentist. Of course you must purchase mouth trays. It is an outstanding value. I paid the dentist 400$ for whitening that was no better than this. And you get 4 syringes of the bleach. Be warned, though, to keep it off of your gum&#x27;s as it is strong.</li>
            <li> I had previously used the 15% strength, and what a difference the 35% strength is! You only have to leave it on for 30 min. instead of 2 hrs.  Be cautious getting it on your gums, it can really burn and turn the pink gum on top of your tooth white.  Went away the next day...but just don&#x27;t overfill your trays as it squished upward.  Only 4 days and I can tell a difference in whiteness as opposed to the 15% stength which took about a month and was so gradual the dentist had to show me my before and after chip for me to see the difference.  K[[ASIN:B001D0MECI Opalescence Pf 35% Teeth Whitening 4 pk (GUARANTEED FRESH !)]]</li>
            <li> I have to use sensitivity toothpaste afterwards. Ouch!</li>
            <li> WOW . takes some time but it def works.Getting tons of compliments on my teeth, so other people are noticing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started whitening my top only to see if I could tell a difference. At first it was very splochy and uneven, but the more I whitened them the nicer they looked. I bought this gel for 3 of my girl friends they all love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be careful it is VERY strong. I left it on and forgot (I wear my retainers at night regardless) my gums were bleeding and white the next day. That was my own fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used for 5 treatments and when I examine my teeth I can see a difference.  Can&#x27;t tell a big difference from any distance.  I think once opened, the syringes are not as good, judging from the foaming and gum burn.  With the next syringe I&#x27;m going to try to put some cool wax on the tip before storing it in the fridge.  The last syringe I sealed in a snack size Ziploc bag.  I haven&#x27;t tried to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; Vaseline on my gum line, that&#x27;s next also.  I&#x27;m using an old tray that was fitted by a dentist.  I thought I was cleaning the tray well, but this product does have a nice gummy consistency, so I usually have to use a Qtip to clean my tray.  I have also used a Q-Tip to apply the product to my front teeth without a tray, early on when my gums were really red.</li>
            <li> Great, fast results. Used this with invisalign trays and exceeded the recommended time. Don&#x27;t do that. Gums and teeth very sensitive after that. Use as directed and you should be happy.</li>
            <li> Whitens your teeth gradually, without the sensitivity. A little goes a long way. Very neatly packaged and expedited</li>
            <li> A very good product, have been using it for ten yrs. it&#x27;s nice to find it at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> OPALESCENCE is great. It&#x27;s the real dental office stuff. The 20% whitens well without burning my gums . The 35% if it is fresh will burn your gums off. I bought this on Amazon a few times and it was not fresh so I didn&#x27;t know. So it is best to use the 20% and check the expiration date. The problem is the tubes are very small and only have a few days of whitening per order.    Insider tip. My uncle is a dentist and he told me [[ASIN:B00JOW50I2 Ultra White 22%]] is made by ultradent the makers of OPALESCENCE . But the tubes are about 3times larger. So now I am using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought one of this 35% before from different source and it worked great. Tried this one, but it did not work as I expected...feel like it&#x27;s not whitening my teeth at all. disappointed.</li>
            <li> My dentist supplies this same exact whitening gel.  Except they charge a LOT more!!!</li>
            <li> I used the 15% in the past and decided to see if 35% would get a faster result.  Results are the same which is o.k. because I&#x27;m satisfied with the whiteness of my teeth.  I wasn&#x27;t able to keep the 35% in my mouth for overnight use like I am with the 15%.  So maybe it is that the 35% gel gets the same results in less time.  The 35% gel definitely made my teeth more sensitive than the 15% and I would recommend using it at least two days before a special event.  It took that long for my teeth to stop hurting.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Strong and super whitening but it hurts my teeth after</li>
            <li> I have used this twice, and it is very strong. It works well, just be careful not to keep on teeth too long and use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product....works great...!!!! I used it with my custom trays from the dentist</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth so i was a bit iffy about ordering this product. But, while using it yes, the first time it is painful but then the second and third time i used it my teeth were fine. My dentist told me i shouldn&#x27;t whiten my teeth that much. But, honestly after the three days in a row i used it my teeth looked significantly whiter and i couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product. It does a great job!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the performance. I have seen noticeable improvement. My teeth get tingly, that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working!!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast as promised.  It is a little too intense for me, burns my gums if any touches them.  I&#x27;ll do a lesser strength next time but it will be from this supplier.</li>
            <li> As a smoker and coffee drinker who cares about his teeth (and overall appearance) I was looking for something to give me quick results without investing a lot of time or money. I&#x27;ve used lots of teeth whitening products in the past; everything from 5 Minute Whitening, Crest Strips, etc. and have always noticed mediocre results while being kind of a PITA to use. I always felt like the strips were annoying and time consuming, made my mouth taste horrible and in general made occasional teeth whitening something I dreaded. After reading a lot of other positive reviews here, I decided to purchase a 4-pack along with a molded mouth-guard to try them out. The first time I used the gel (about 1/2 a syringe), I left it on for about 30 minutes and experienced very mild gum sensitivity. Two days later, I decided to up my time to 45 minutes and had no issues with burning or sensitivity. Now on my second syringe, I&#x27;m keeping the gel on for 1 hour every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results? AMAZING. Seriously, this inexpensive teeth whitening product blows EVERYTHING I&#x27;ve used previously out of the water. I noticed results after just one use, and after a third... definitely 1-2 shades lighter and only half of the product used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very big thank you to Opalescence for giving me a new reason to smile! :D</li>
            <li> Every single bad review with the exception of about 2 are because of the lack of care on the consumers part and NOT the product itself. Any dentist will explain to you that bleach at this concentration WILL burn your soft tissue (gums &amp; tongue). The product is NOT supposed to touch them, only your teeth are to come in contact with the gel. Use the product correctly and as intended and you will get the results you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Really works... don&#x27;t get it on your gums</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and I used all 4. My teeth are still the same color they used to be my gum are now burn and teeth are very sensitive. This company is selling expired or fake whitening gel. I knew the price was to good to be true.</li>
            <li> This was a refill after getting the first pack from the dentist at three times the price. Quick service too.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years from my dentist. It makes my teeth sparkle. But not this product. It&#x27;s just not the same formula.  Sometimes if something seems too good to be true......</li>
            <li> Thank you, it came right away. Fresh</li>
            <li> Good way to clean your teething half the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong, so less than 30 min. is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> This is pretty powerful stuff, especially compared to the last time I whitened my teeth with Day White 7%.  My teeth are noticeably whiter, and I am only through half of the treatment, thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well, but I would have to agree with the other reviewer, that custom trays are a must.  When this gets on your gums, it is pretty painful for the first 10 minutes, then the pain goes away.  Your gums also turn solid white for about an hour where the gel has made contact.  This is why I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating, but that&#x27;s the nature of the beast, I guess.</li>
            <li> Each tube is onlyvone application. In the past, others were at least twi. Otherwise fine--works as well as others. Nice flavor.</li>
            <li> I bought some other whitening gel last year that I thought worked pretty good but I have heard of Opalescense and when I saw it online I thought I would try it.  I like it even better than the other gel I purchased.  I will be buying more.  Word if warning...be sure to clean any gel off of you gums because it does burn and make them white for a little while.  It does not take much so don&#x27;t ovet do with the amount you use.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am using just a small drop of this in the crease of my dentist-made plastic whitening trays -- nowhere near 1/3 or 1/2 of a syringe.  It will mix with saliva and move upward on the front and back of my teeth to cover all.  When I take the trays off, there is still a ton of product in my mouth, like it&#x27;s concentrated.  I originally got 16% product from the dentist, which did hardly anything.  The 35% is twice as strong and intense.  The instructions that came with it said to leave 35% solution on for only 30 minutes, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe to leave it on for more than that.  Stick to milk and white foods after using for at least 2 weeks - the rest of your life is even better so you don&#x27;t have to go through this whitening torture again.  I read that whiteners will remove the enamel temporarily, exposing the tooth dentin.  Dark foods and drinks can soak into the dentin tubules, causing the tooth to turn dark permanently.  I witnessed this happening to my own tooth, as a temporary crown was placed on my tooth while the student-dentist (Baylor Dental College) took forever (2 months) to make the permanent one.  The temporary crown was prone to coming off and I saw how my precious tooth darkened over time while I was waiting for this student to make the permanent crown.  I questioned her about it and she said \\&quot;she expected that it would turn dark because the took underneath the temporary crown wasn&#x27;t sealed completely\\&quot;.  Anyway, I assume that enamel is removed by using strong whitening products and the tooth will remain yellow if you drink coffee right afterwards.  I read a post by a dentist that stated the enamel will return, after whitening, by the saliva in our mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m having a hard time getting my teeth nice and white, as I hoped for with the Opalescence and they are slightly yellow after 8 syringes of the 16% and 3 syringes of the 35% -- much better than before, but definitely not \\&quot;The Rock\\&quot; white.</li>
            <li> This whitening product works great.  I have my trays I use from the dentist and buy my gel online.  This is the first time using this particular brand and its been awhile since I have bleached my teeth.  This gel is very strong.  If you have sensitive teeth you may want to go with 20% as this will definitely bleach your gums and make them sensitive.  A little goes a long way.  I do not leave on for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the best product bar non for teeth whitening.  Need to be very careful with the 35% so that you don&#x27;t fill the trays with too much product.  The 35% product is very strong so you must be very careful or you will burn your gums.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this stuff. It&#x27;s higher in potency that what your dentist probably provided with those custom trays that ended up setting you back $350.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you apply sparingly, this formulation works fine. Add a small amount to your trays and remove after about an hour. The advantage is that you don&#x27;t need to use these over night, or for extended periods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you use too much, the gel will ooze out and cause significant gum discomfort.</li>
            <li> more potent than your average whitening gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend shorter durations of use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good value</li>
            <li> Product as promised. Good value.</li>
            <li> This was way too strong of a product for me.  I only left it in 30 mins and it burned my gums.  Be careful if you are using this.</li>
            <li> I have used this at the dentists office with great results. This does not seem like a fresh batch. I wonder how long it has been sitting around. I&#x27;ve used two viles with minimum results</li>
            <li> I barely used this for ten minutes and my gums burned it was awful experience.  I tried again using minimal bleech same thing happened with sore white gums for days.  Very irritating. Never use again</li>
            <li> I bought whitening gel from Amazon because it&#x27;s so expensive straight from the dentist.  Probably should have called to ask what an appropriate % is beforehand.  I&#x27;m used to leaving trays in for at least an hour.  After half an hour I couldn&#x27;t take the burn anymore and took them out.  My gums burned and were bleached white!  The effects only lasted a few hours but it was painful.  My teeth ended up very white, but make sure you watch how long you keep the trays in for.</li>
            <li> It left a chemical burn on my gum line. It was hardly touching my gums at all as I was good to wipe out the excess amount. However even the little bit of gum that is in between my teeth turned bleached white. It was uncomfortable and so concerning that I washed the stuff off my teeth immediately. It heals in about a day which was fine, but now I&#x27;m too afraid to try the treatment again!!!</li>
            <li> I used this one time, left it on for 30 minutes and it burned really bad.  I even used a q-tip to apply shea butter to my gums but it still hurt really bad.  Then when I took it off, it had bleached a portion of my gums between two teeth and left it white.  It took about 2 weeks before my gums turned back to pink.  If you are new to teeth bleaching, I would suggest going with a weaker solution.</li>
            <li> This is really an excellent product. Probably the best I&#x27;ve used. I will reorder this again in the future. Also it has a thicker consistency which I really like as it stays on your teeth. Best of all it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and had excellent results.  A little goes a long way.  If I put too much gel on my teeth, they start to burn.  The gel works, you start seeing results after only a couple of uses. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to other people too.</li>
            <li> Have been useing for past couple years and won&#x27;t buy anything else. The results are wonderful without the gum irritation you get with other brands.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, beware of using too much because it can damage your gums.</li>
            <li> just as good as my dentist sells</li>
