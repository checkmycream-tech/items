            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE PRODUCTS......</li>
            <li>I will be getting more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it as often as most people</li>
            <li>but I sure would like to give it more time before I decide if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews before I bought these items.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m extremely pleased that there is almost no smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the &#x27;my hair grew like magic&#x27; reviews</li>
            <li>but I was looking for something healthy for my braids.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more castor oil but skipping the pimento.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lost more hair instead.</li>
            <li>It locks in most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>And its perfect for deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>love it.. :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I see the changes and I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with JBCO</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Love it ,makes my hair grow</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair oil</li>
            <li>Love these two products, must have for hair growth</li>
            <li>We are glad that our Aunt told us about this oil.</li>
            <li>My hair has been growing more then ever.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>So, I will continue to use it and allow more time.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working, but I need more time to really be sure.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed both products and they have done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I have purchased it more than once.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>These two oils are great for natural hair!</li>
            <li>I stated using the oil and my hair is growing back very good.</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair though.</li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just strong</li>
            <li>I chose these 2 products because after the results I got from my 1st bottle of jbco, I had to try the strong roots pimento oil also.</li>
            <li>the amber color gives off a nice vibration and we even like the earthy smell, it&#x27;s mild and disappears quickly...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>These oils and my vitamins are making a huge difference in my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a light earthy smell though.</li>
            <li>The castor oil helps to keep my twist moisturized between washes and the red pimento is great for those thinning areas.</li>
            <li>Great experience; will buy from this company in the future.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s been working really good</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Very useful for her hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing new growth in temple area and in nape of neck Love it!</li>
            <li>and now my hair is just simply filling in ... amazing!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a deterent; compared to original shea butter, it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li>I used this product while I had braids in was worth it!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure im allergic to BJCO.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see my edges coming in  again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product arrived quickly and securely.  </li>
            <li>The Pimento oil has a strong smell that I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li>This an amazing product because is a natural product.</li>
            <li>Good for deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>Very hopeful for results already pleased that there is no overpowering odor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product may be a good buy, but ENTIRELY to greasy.  </li>
            <li>This product is used as recommended, but more time is needed before I&#x27;ll really evaluate it.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving the castor oil</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with my progress, that I sent for another bottle and also the red Pimento who really stimulates the scalp.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, in a few months I will be able to give a more detailed review!</li>
            <li>The smell of the castor oil is kind of skunky, if you mix it with other oils it will be much better.</li>
            <li>And the seller sent the items very fast!  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell if my hair grew or not ( the reason I brought it ) but it makes my hair easy to comb out</li>
            <li>Love this oil so far!</li>
            <li>The JBCO is a no-brainer: I love it, and it&#x27;s a staple product for caring for my 4b/4c natural hair!</li>
            <li>PUT THE OIL ON A PATCH OF HAIR FIRST TO SEE If YOUR HAIR WILL FALL OUT!</li>
            <li>really works!!</li>
            <li>I like this oil, not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>I Make my own deep conditioner</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is the smell lol for both of them is really loud.</li>
            <li>I love it, very impress with the fast shipping...</li>
            <li>and I look forward to hearing about the hair growth experience so many women has witnessed in the natural hair community in the US.</li>
            <li>So far I love everything about both products.  </li>
            <li>Sticky, however if it helps my hair, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair oil is more stronger, I tend to do the hot oil treatment once a month using this product</li>
            <li>but my hair still looked pretty fresh from the relaxer.  </li>
            <li>Waiting see results,  but certainly  been using it faithful in my hair care routine!  </li>
            <li>You might want to soak the amount you will use in hot water first</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>I started using the two oils the first week of July after already being about 6 weeks post relaxer.</li>
            <li>and I liked how the smell was minimal</li>
            <li>First of all, these products did not come in any package at all.  </li>
            <li>I think I need my money back for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love these products, my edges are growing back...  </li>
            <li>love the way it was packed will definitely order again</li>
            <li>I use the other oil with my deep conditioning treatments on my natural hair and it is awesome!</li>
            <li>This was a great product and I received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>it feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the strong roots red pimento, so far so good I like the tingle it leaves on my scalp due to itchy scalp,I like the smell.</li>
            <li>I used the red pimento oil as a deep conditioner and it did great far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>oil is heavy however if you warm it prior to application there is more control over how much you use.  </li>
            <li>not sure what this is really suppose to do, it didn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to use, so that isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>Its pure oil which helps moisturize the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Great product and love the applicator bottle can be used to mix and apply Jamaican Black Castor Oil mixed with other oils and essential oils to easily apply to o the scalp and hair as a treatment or leave in.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seem any progress from the growth oil in my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking pictures and the results of my hairline is very noticible.</li>
            <li>I love this combo, but I&#x27;ve not really seen any results yet.</li>
            <li>In fact I still seem to be losing as much hair as before.</li>
            <li>the pimento oil is kool, I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference yet, and I&#x27;m almost out the bottle between my hair and my 3 yo daughter&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the Pimento Oil that sparks some real concern.</li>
            <li>then I wash it out with a Follicle Cleansing shampoo, my hair smells fresh, but soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>the oil absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li>Really???</li>
            <li>I will Absolutely buy again and continue to buy.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like a lot of oil on my head because of pimples.</li>
            <li>Do not use to much.</li>
            <li>Too much for me.</li>
            <li>I can.t really say that I have seen any change in hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I have never seen my hair growing so fast.</li>
            <li>Since I have started using these products my hair is much softer and growing.</li>
            <li>and this really helped.</li>
            <li>it really do what it says my hair has grown a lot and gotten thicker</li>
            <li>I use these two products together for fast hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on my hair.</li>
            <li>and I am really liking it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the strong roots red pimento hair growth oil and Jamaican black castor oil twice so far and love both.  </li>
            <li>I saw so many different brands of Jamaican Castor Oils on Amazon, however i took my chance with this brand because it came with the Red Pimento oil.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft!</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING BLACK JAMAICAN CASTOR OIL AND HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH  COMBINATION OF RED PIMENTO HAIR GROWTH.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>Still trying out the Red Pimento Growth oil: I haven&#x27;t used it as consistently as I ought to, so I can&#x27;t say too much on the product yet.</li>
            <li>Anyone who doesn&#x27;t understand the benefits of this essential oil, it would be worth the time to do some research.</li>
            <li>Hope it will grow after few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing I have 1-1 1/2 inches of new growth in 30 days.</li>
            <li>Well, since this is a new product for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how much new growth I have.  </li>
            <li>But its new and I&#x27;m  going to stick with it.</li>
            <li>Did not see any new growth.</li>
            <li>I really think the black castor oil works better than the Red Pimento.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying it out only because i don&#x27;t really have much to lose (except for my hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years &amp; it really helps to keep my scalp dandruff free and it makes my hair grow in thicker.</li>
            <li>I apply the red pimento oil twice/week on wash days to my scalp when DC&#x27;ing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just been a month now since adding the oils to my hair regimen and I have so much new growth!!!</li>
            <li>I am surprised that my hair grew as quickly and as long as it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not used the Black Castor oil yet, but I have tried it in the past and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I joined a JBCO challenge there and have been applying to my scalp pretty much daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and it does exactly as seller describes.  </li>
            <li>I use the red pimento oil as a hot oil treatment.  </li>
            <li>I use it in my hair, on my naturally sparse eyebrows and on my lashes as a conditioner at night and under mascara</li>
            <li>As a person who frequently wears weaves, this oil helps keep my hair underneath moisturized and my edges from breaking off.</li>
            <li>and after I wash my natural hair.</li>
            <li>You cannot use this daily as a moisturiser (it smells funky and is very oily).</li>
            <li>My babies edges are growing back and her hair is much healthier.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of delivery.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning to natural hair.</li>
            <li>so far nothing.  </li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s done nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I use the oils daily and both really keep my scalp from drying out.</li>
            <li>My hair is always so soft after I use them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for five years now and stumbled onto this</li>
            <li>, I really like the Red Pimento when I was my hair</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if its working yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>tHANKS FOR BRINGING THIS TO THE PUBLIC.  </li>
            <li>I think that this has helped in my natural hair journey</li>
            <li>and the effects it is having on mu hair so far.</li>
            <li>Works very well helped grow my hair back and will be &#x27;re ordering!</li>
            <li>The castor oil is good, but be careful not to put a lot in your hair since its so thick</li>
            <li>I have seen tremendous growth of my eyelash and eyebrow since using black castor oil directly .  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the Black Castor Oil because the Strong Roots Red Pimento Hail Growth Oil already has it in it, along with coconut and wheat germ oil.  </li>
            <li>Love both products..always use black castor oil came pretty quick and ill purchase again.</li>
            <li>hair was so rough and after my first use it was soft.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a little smaller than it appears online, but I am sure it will last the ladies for a while.</li>
            <li>New growth can be seen after weeks of use, 2x daily</li>
            <li>this is my first time using this product don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve used it long enough to say yet.</li>
            <li>The Jamaican Black Castor Oil was fine, but no different than the regular Castor Oil.</li>
            <li>its not better then the original oil.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and as a hot oil treatment twice a month.</li>
            <li>Be very careful with this product, and test a patch of hair first.</li>
            <li>Only had it a short time however;can already detect some new growth esp.</li>
            <li>has a calm lavender fragrance massage into scalp allow15-30min shampoo as usual.</li>
            <li>This helps strip hair of harsh chemicals when used as a hot oil treatment every 2 weeks.</li>

            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE PRODUCTS......</li>
            <li> I will be getting more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it as often as most people</li>
            <li> but I sure would like to give it more time before I decide if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews before I bought these items.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m extremely pleased that there is almost no smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the &#x27;my hair grew like magic&#x27; reviews</li>
            <li> but I was looking for something healthy for my braids.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more castor oil but skipping the pimento.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lost more hair instead.</li>
            <li> It locks in most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> And its perfect for deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> love it.. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> but I see the changes and I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with JBCO</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Love it ,makes my hair grow</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair oil</li>
            <li> Love these two products, must have for hair growth</li>
            <li> We are glad that our Aunt told us about this oil.</li>
            <li> My hair has been growing more then ever.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> So, I will continue to use it and allow more time.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be working, but I need more time to really be sure.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed both products and they have done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I have purchased it more than once.</li>
            <li> I love these products.</li>
            <li> These two oils are great for natural hair!</li>
            <li> I stated using the oil and my hair is growing back very good.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair though.</li>
            <li> It was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just strong</li>
            <li> I chose these 2 products because after the results I got from my 1st bottle of jbco, I had to try the strong roots pimento oil also.</li>
            <li> the amber color gives off a nice vibration and we even like the earthy smell, it&#x27;s mild and disappears quickly...</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> These oils and my vitamins are making a huge difference in my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a light earthy smell though.</li>
            <li> The castor oil helps to keep my twist moisturized between washes and the red pimento is great for those thinning areas.</li>
            <li> Great experience; will buy from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s been working really good</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Very useful for her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing new growth in temple area and in nape of neck Love it!</li>
            <li> and now my hair is just simply filling in ... amazing!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a deterent; compared to original shea butter, it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> I used this product while I had braids in was worth it!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure im allergic to BJCO.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see my edges coming in  again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product arrived quickly and securely.  </li>
            <li> The Pimento oil has a strong smell that I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li> This an amazing product because is a natural product.</li>
            <li> Good for deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> Very hopeful for results already pleased that there is no overpowering odor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product may be a good buy, but ENTIRELY to greasy.  </li>
            <li> This product is used as recommended, but more time is needed before I&#x27;ll really evaluate it.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving the castor oil</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with my progress, that I sent for another bottle and also the red Pimento who really stimulates the scalp.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, in a few months I will be able to give a more detailed review!</li>
            <li> The smell of the castor oil is kind of skunky, if you mix it with other oils it will be much better.</li>
            <li> And the seller sent the items very fast!  </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell if my hair grew or not ( the reason I brought it ) but it makes my hair easy to comb out</li>
            <li> Love this oil so far!</li>
            <li> The JBCO is a no-brainer: I love it, and it&#x27;s a staple product for caring for my 4b/4c natural hair!</li>
            <li> PUT THE OIL ON A PATCH OF HAIR FIRST TO SEE If YOUR HAIR WILL FALL OUT!</li>
            <li> really works!!</li>
            <li> I like this oil, not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> I Make my own deep conditioner</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is the smell lol for both of them is really loud.</li>
            <li> I love it, very impress with the fast shipping...</li>
            <li> and I look forward to hearing about the hair growth experience so many women has witnessed in the natural hair community in the US.</li>
            <li> So far I love everything about both products.  </li>
            <li> Sticky, however if it helps my hair, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair oil is more stronger, I tend to do the hot oil treatment once a month using this product</li>
            <li> but my hair still looked pretty fresh from the relaxer.  </li>
            <li> Waiting see results,  but certainly  been using it faithful in my hair care routine!  </li>
            <li> You might want to soak the amount you will use in hot water first</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li> I started using the two oils the first week of July after already being about 6 weeks post relaxer.</li>
            <li> and I liked how the smell was minimal</li>
            <li> First of all, these products did not come in any package at all.  </li>
            <li> I think I need my money back for sure.  </li>
            <li> I love these products, my edges are growing back...  </li>
            <li> love the way it was packed will definitely order again</li>
            <li> I use the other oil with my deep conditioning treatments on my natural hair and it is awesome!</li>
            <li> This was a great product and I received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> it feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the strong roots red pimento, so far so good I like the tingle it leaves on my scalp due to itchy scalp,I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I used the red pimento oil as a deep conditioner and it did great far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> oil is heavy however if you warm it prior to application there is more control over how much you use.  </li>
            <li> not sure what this is really suppose to do, it didn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to use, so that isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> Its pure oil which helps moisturize the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Great product and love the applicator bottle can be used to mix and apply Jamaican Black Castor Oil mixed with other oils and essential oils to easily apply to o the scalp and hair as a treatment or leave in.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seem any progress from the growth oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking pictures and the results of my hairline is very noticible.</li>
            <li> I love this combo, but I&#x27;ve not really seen any results yet.</li>
            <li> In fact I still seem to be losing as much hair as before.</li>
            <li> the pimento oil is kool, I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference yet, and I&#x27;m almost out the bottle between my hair and my 3 yo daughter&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the Pimento Oil that sparks some real concern.</li>
            <li> then I wash it out with a Follicle Cleansing shampoo, my hair smells fresh, but soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> the oil absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li> Really???</li>
            <li> I will Absolutely buy again and continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like a lot of oil on my head because of pimples.</li>
            <li> Do not use to much.</li>
            <li> Too much for me.</li>
            <li> I can.t really say that I have seen any change in hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen my hair growing so fast.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using these products my hair is much softer and growing.</li>
            <li> and this really helped.</li>
            <li> it really do what it says my hair has grown a lot and gotten thicker</li>
            <li> I use these two products together for fast hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on my hair.</li>
            <li> and I am really liking it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the strong roots red pimento hair growth oil and Jamaican black castor oil twice so far and love both.  </li>
            <li> I saw so many different brands of Jamaican Castor Oils on Amazon, however i took my chance with this brand because it came with the Red Pimento oil.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING BLACK JAMAICAN CASTOR OIL AND HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH  COMBINATION OF RED PIMENTO HAIR GROWTH.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> Still trying out the Red Pimento Growth oil: I haven&#x27;t used it as consistently as I ought to, so I can&#x27;t say too much on the product yet.</li>
            <li> Anyone who doesn&#x27;t understand the benefits of this essential oil, it would be worth the time to do some research.</li>
            <li> Hope it will grow after few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I have 1-1 1/2 inches of new growth in 30 days.</li>
            <li> Well, since this is a new product for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how much new growth I have.  </li>
            <li> But its new and I&#x27;m  going to stick with it.</li>
            <li> Did not see any new growth.</li>
            <li> I really think the black castor oil works better than the Red Pimento.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep trying it out only because i don&#x27;t really have much to lose (except for my hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years &amp; it really helps to keep my scalp dandruff free and it makes my hair grow in thicker.</li>
            <li> I apply the red pimento oil twice/week on wash days to my scalp when DC&#x27;ing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just been a month now since adding the oils to my hair regimen and I have so much new growth!!!</li>
            <li> I am surprised that my hair grew as quickly and as long as it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used the Black Castor oil yet, but I have tried it in the past and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I joined a JBCO challenge there and have been applying to my scalp pretty much daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and it does exactly as seller describes.  </li>
            <li> I use the red pimento oil as a hot oil treatment.  </li>
            <li> I use it in my hair, on my naturally sparse eyebrows and on my lashes as a conditioner at night and under mascara</li>
            <li> As a person who frequently wears weaves, this oil helps keep my hair underneath moisturized and my edges from breaking off.</li>
            <li> and after I wash my natural hair.</li>
            <li> You cannot use this daily as a moisturiser (it smells funky and is very oily).</li>
            <li> My babies edges are growing back and her hair is much healthier.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of delivery.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning to natural hair.</li>
            <li> so far nothing.  </li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s done nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I use the oils daily and both really keep my scalp from drying out.</li>
            <li> My hair is always so soft after I use them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for five years now and stumbled onto this</li>
            <li> , I really like the Red Pimento when I was my hair</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if its working yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tHANKS FOR BRINGING THIS TO THE PUBLIC.  </li>
            <li> I think that this has helped in my natural hair journey</li>
            <li> and the effects it is having on mu hair so far.</li>
            <li> Works very well helped grow my hair back and will be &#x27;re ordering!</li>
            <li> The castor oil is good, but be careful not to put a lot in your hair since its so thick</li>
            <li> I have seen tremendous growth of my eyelash and eyebrow since using black castor oil directly .  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Black Castor Oil because the Strong Roots Red Pimento Hail Growth Oil already has it in it, along with coconut and wheat germ oil.  </li>
            <li> Love both products..always use black castor oil came pretty quick and ill purchase again.</li>
            <li> hair was so rough and after my first use it was soft.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little smaller than it appears online, but I am sure it will last the ladies for a while.</li>
            <li> New growth can be seen after weeks of use, 2x daily</li>
            <li> this is my first time using this product don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve used it long enough to say yet.</li>
            <li> The Jamaican Black Castor Oil was fine, but no different than the regular Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> its not better then the original oil.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and as a hot oil treatment twice a month.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product, and test a patch of hair first.</li>
            <li> Only had it a short time however;can already detect some new growth esp.</li>
            <li> has a calm lavender fragrance massage into scalp allow15-30min shampoo as usual.</li>
            <li> This helps strip hair of harsh chemicals when used as a hot oil treatment every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil really doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> i dobt know the growth difference between the two,but i can say my hait is much thicker and longer these past months i have been using them.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t use the product long enough yet, but I have seen an inch of growth in my hair so forth.</li>
            <li> I could not bare it.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if your looking for a good Jamaican Castor Oil..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost certain my hair is growing due to me using both oils and massaging them into my scalp in addition to me taking black seed oil orally.</li>
            <li> We use the castor oil for our bodies mainly..when using the oil , especially the pimento, be sure to cover your head before laying on your pillow case ;/ and we usually purchase a 32 oz of clear castor oil for about 15$( no they&#x27;re not the same in response to some reviews) ..and although the black is moor expensive, I would like the option of purchasing a larger bottle...</li>
            <li> I have very dry, fragile hair.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that my hair grew 1 inch long wearing braids.  </li>
            <li> Really works hair has become thick.</li>
            <li> I MEAN, STRETCH YOUR HAIR STRANDS AND SEE HOW MUCH HAIR WILL EXPEL FROM YOUR SCALP.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use due its part of my daily hair and eyelash regiment.  </li>
            <li> other essential oils.</li>
            <li> This product I have been using for over 2 months now because over the summer I suffer from dry scalp, so  I mix this product with EMU Oil or (Isoplus-Oil Moisturizer).</li>
            <li> The smell is smoky as expected which is why i bought other essential oils to mask the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong the smell not really bad</li>
            <li> I had to cut them down really low and try again without this product and it grew out again.</li>
            <li> and I use the red pimento oil every few days</li>
            <li> I will give you an update in 3 months when my hair has grown longer than expected (hopefully).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for a few months (i&#x27;m on my second bottle) and</li>
            <li> This really does help thin hair to thicken up.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> have only had it a few weeks, seems like it may be working</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp because my hair is currently in yarn twists.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for growing thick natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> we will continue to purchase the castor oil, not certain about the pimento oil yet...</li>
            <li> I started using in for the past few weeks, so far not seen any drastic difference.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> However, Im skeptical because of the color and consistently.</li>
            <li> , I believe I see little fuzz of hair where its been missing in the middle of my head.</li>
            <li> My scalp has been especially dry this winter and these oils have helped to combat the dryness.  </li>
            <li> This oil is thick so mixing with other essential oils is an option or just massaging it into my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least three months, both the JBC and the Red Pimento Hair Growth.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to stretch my relaxer until November which would be 6 months, but I&#x27;m planning on relaxing next weekend because my NG is so thick now.</li>
            <li> it will melt down your neck.</li>
            <li> I had to take my hair down because my hair grew within a matter of 2 months.</li>
            <li> I saw results in less than a month.</li>
            <li> You will nead an applicator bottle for the black oil which can be picked up at any beauty supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I used the black caster oil about 3 times a week</li>
            <li> Ive used it 3 times and I already started noticing less shedding.</li>
            <li> The black castor Oil</li>
            <li> I used it the first couple of times and my scalp itched like crazy</li>
            <li> also helping  my hair line/edges get little thicker.....  </li>
            <li> I also had trouble with my edges</li>
            <li> I had hair thinning and a few bald spot in my head.</li>
            <li> I am going to be patient and update in a few months.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my edges since I bought it</li>
            <li> i tried this oil a few times and each time i got the worse pounding headache about an  hour later, will never purchase again</li>
            <li> In the past the JBCO oils I have used was thicker and darker, almost black.</li>
            <li> The black castor oil is thick  </li>
            <li> The Black Castor oil is extremely thick</li>
            <li> In temple area.it&#x27;s a little thick</li>
            <li> Not sure about growth aiding properties</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> The price for the both of these was absolutely unbelievable.</li>
            <li> it grew at least 1.5 inches in 2 months</li>
            <li> My scalp sucks it up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it at least six months.  </li>
            <li> I already have thick hair</li>
            <li> slow,</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is the smell :/</li>
            <li> The castor oil is too thick for my thin caucasian hair</li>
            <li> It is very thick.</li>
            <li> and it grows very slow.</li>
            <li> The crown part I was trying got worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;around my thin areas....</li>
            <li> I use them weekly to grow my thin hair</li>
            <li> Oil as such has a very bad smell</li>
            <li> (sorry</li>
            <li> weird burnt smell from the jamacian oil.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical before buying this product.</li>
            <li> Desperate times call for desperate measures.</li>
            <li> Both of these oils are growing my hair like crazy.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing mad.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair itch badly.</li>
            <li> My hair was falling so bad</li>
            <li> I will be disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and it don&#x27;t have a terrible smell</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent.  My edges are growing back.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seem any progress from the growth oil in my hair. The castor oil is good, but be careful not to put a lot in your hair since its so thick it will melt down your neck. You might want to soak the amount you will use in hot water first</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly. However, Im skeptical because of the color and consistently. It seems like there is something else mixed in with the JBCO. In the past the JBCO oils I have used was thicker and darker, almost black. It also made my hair itch badly. JBCO has antifungal properties so that maybe why. Im just on the fence with this distributor. I brought a double pack of both but will probably not be using this distributor again.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE PRODUCTS......VERY GOOD NURISHMENT FOR MY NATURALHAIR</li>
            <li> I love this product ! Works great!</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell if my hair grew or not ( the reason I brought it ) but it makes my hair easy to comb out</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone! I&#x27;ve been using the products for 2 weeks and can visibly see a difference!</li>
            <li> I like this oil, not crazy about the smell but it has worked for my purpose. I will be getting more</li>
            <li> Loving this nice combo for my hair treatment. I&#x27;m taking pictures and the results of my hairline is very noticible.</li>
            <li> I love this combo, but I&#x27;ve not really seen any results yet. In fact I still seem to be losing as much hair as before. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using it as often as most people but I sure would like to give it more time before I decide if it&#x27;s working or not. I use it once a week and I&#x27;m already halfway thru the bottles! Fingers crossed</li>
            <li> I like the castor oil alot...not too sticky..the amber color gives off a nice vibration and we even like the earthy smell, it&#x27;s mild and disappears quickly...We use the castor oil for our bodies mainly..when using the oil , especially the pimento, be sure to cover your head before laying on your pillow case ;/ and we usually purchase a 32 oz of clear castor oil for about 15$( no they&#x27;re not the same in response to some reviews) ..and although the black is moor expensive, I would like the option of purchasing a larger bottle...the pimento oil is kool, I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference yet, and I&#x27;m almost out the bottle between my hair and my 3 yo daughter&#x27;s..we both have dreadlocks...it does feel good when going on, it temporarily moisturizes..we will continue to purchase the castor oil, not certain about the pimento oil yet...I  will say both oils are great combined for an all over hot oil hair treatment! The company shipped very fast and nicely packaged! And this is a great deal to give the pimento oil a try!</li>
            <li> My oil doesn&#x27;t stink. It does have a light earthy smell though. Kinda woody and nutty. Not sure about growth aiding properties but I will update. Shipped fast. Great value. I use it in my hair, on my naturally sparse eyebrows and on my lashes as a conditioner at night and under mascara</li>
            <li> Love this oil so far! Waiting see results,  but certainly  been using it faithful in my hair care routine!  Definitely  be back if my edges come back, since  nothing else have worked!</li>
            <li> Love this combination! I use it on my edges and especially in my nape area. As a person who frequently wears weaves, this oil helps keep my hair underneath moisturized and my edges from breaking off. I use the Jamaican castor oil every day and I use the red pimento oil every few days and after I wash my natural hair.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast! The packaging was great too, they made it so it doesn&#x27;t fall out of get busted of bruised. The smell is smoky as expected which is why i bought other essential oils to mask the fragrance. All in all I will be a returning customer.</li>
            <li> Good for deep conditioning treatments. The &amp;#34;hair growth&amp;#34; part is yet to be tested. You cannot use this daily as a moisturiser (it smells funky and is very oily). But I use it weekly as a treatment before my &#x27;wash &amp; blowdry&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Both products work great,since i use them together or a day after eachother i dobt know the growth difference between the two,but i can say my hait is much thicker and longer these past months i have been using them.</li>
            <li> The JBCO is a no-brainer: I love it, and it&#x27;s a staple product for caring for my 4b/4c natural hair! Still trying out the Red Pimento Growth oil: I haven&#x27;t used it as consistently as I ought to, so I can&#x27;t say too much on the product yet. Hopefully, in a few months I will be able to give a more detailed review!</li>
            <li> The Jamaican Black Castor Oil was fine, but no different than the regular Castor Oil. It&#x27;s the Pimento Oil that sparks some real concern. THIS IS A WARNING!!!!!!!! PUT THE OIL ON A PATCH OF HAIR FIRST TO SEE If YOUR HAIR WILL FALL OUT! I MEAN, STRETCH YOUR HAIR STRANDS AND SEE HOW MUCH HAIR WILL EXPEL FROM YOUR SCALP. I put this oil all over my head on my scalp, and as I was detangling my hair with my hands, I noticed that my hair strands was sliding out. This was not just shed hair, but my healthy hair too! OMG!!! My hair was gliding out of my head! I tried to hurry and rinse the oil out, but the damage was already done. Be very careful with this product, and test a patch of hair first. I&#x27;m not stating that this will happen to every head, but it will happen to SOME.</li>
            <li> I started using the two oils the first week of July after already being about 6 weeks post relaxer. I already have thick hair but my hair still looked pretty fresh from the relaxer.  I heard about JBCO from hairlista.com , a great hair site for women, esp. AA, wanting to take better care of their own hair. I joined a JBCO challenge there and have been applying to my scalp pretty much daily. I apply the red pimento oil twice/week on wash days to my scalp when DC&#x27;ing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just been a month now since adding the oils to my hair regimen and I have so much new growth!!! I was trying to stretch my relaxer until November which would be 6 months, but I&#x27;m planning on relaxing next weekend because my NG is so thick now. I&#x27;m guessing I have 1-1 1/2 inches of new growth in 30 days. The JBCO is now a staple!&lt;br /&gt;This really works!! I was happy with the shipping speed and the packaging as well (one is a glass bottle).</li>
            <li> I really love these products! My hair is growing longer and stronger than before. I will continue to use these products.</li>
            <li> hair getting stronger</li>
            <li> Works really good with bleach dryed out hair.</li>
            <li> Just started using them &amp; like how it makes my hair feel, will keep using this product! And some of the others as well</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I saw results in less than a month. i definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;ll be a life time buyer from now on. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product I have been using for over 2 months now because over the summer I suffer from dry scalp, so  I mix this product with EMU Oil or (Isoplus-Oil Moisturizer). Its pure oil which helps moisturize the scalp.  I also use as a hot-oil treatment. During the summer I wear braids and I noticed that my hair grew 1 inch long wearing braids.  I had to take my hair down because my hair grew within a matter of 2 months. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair oil is more stronger, I tend to do the hot oil treatment once a month using this product then I wash it out with a Follicle Cleansing shampoo, my hair smells fresh, but soft and silky feeling. I also had trouble with my edges and I notices that my edges grew back healthier.</li>
            <li> I had hair thinning and a few bald spot in my head. The use of these product have made my thinning hair thicker and the bald spots have fill in with hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t use the product long enough yet, but I have seen an inch of growth in my hair so forth. Need to reorder the product.</li>
            <li> Well, since this is a new product for me.  I&#x27;m still on the fence about it.  It is supposed to stimulate my roots.. So I&#x27;ll give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> Not to please with the fact that the products arrived without a protective seal on the outside of the cap, nor was there a circle protective seal on the opening undertow cap of either bottle, which makes me question the quality and integrity of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned that the product could be tampered with or another customer purchased and returned the product.</li>
            <li> It works.... simple as that! My babies edges are growing back and her hair is much healthier. This is a must have for natural hair.</li>
            <li> This is helping my edges grow back after having them pulled out my braids. I really think the black castor oil works better than the Red Pimento.</li>
            <li> The castor oil helps to keep my twist moisturized between washes and the red pimento is great for those thinning areas.</li>
            <li> The deliver was on point !!&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m happy with my the product&lt;br /&gt;My hair was so rough and after my first use it was soft.</li>
            <li> It arrived in 3 days. I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of delivery. The black castor oil is thick  but it&#x27;s not a deterent; compared to original shea butter, it&#x27;s alright. I will give you an update in 3 months when my hair has grown longer than expected (hopefully).</li>
            <li> I used this product while I had braids in was worth it! it grew at least 1.5 inches in 2 months</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews before I bought these items.  Its too soon to report anything about growth but I&#x27;m extremely pleased that there is almost no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is heavy however if you warm it prior to application there is more control over how much you use.  You will nead an applicator bottle for the black oil which can be picked up at any beauty supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the oil absorbs really well.  Very hopeful for results already pleased that there is no overpowering odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/14/13 Update.  My hair has grown a good 2 inches.  I&#x27;m amazed at how much new growth I have.  The Pimento oil has a strong smell that I&#x27;m not crazy about so I only used it on Friday evenings when I didn&#x27;t have to work.  However, I used the black caster oil about 3 times a week and I liked how the smell was minimal (sorry but I&#x27;m sticking to this) and how it made my braids look.  I didn&#x27;t buy the &#x27;my hair grew like magic&#x27; reviews but I was looking for something healthy for my braids.  I am surprised that my hair grew as quickly and as long as it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works.  I will be ordering more castor oil but skipping the pimento.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
            <li> I love this!!!! I am transitioning to natural hair. This helps strip hair of harsh chemicals when used as a hot oil treatment every 2 weeks. I Make my own deep conditioner and i add both oils, just awesome how mositure remains in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for a few months (i&#x27;m on my second bottle) and so far nothing.  I&#x27;ll keep trying it out only because i don&#x27;t really have much to lose (except for my hair) but so far it&#x27;s done nothing for me.  I&#x27;m not expecting a miracle, but I am expecting to notice something visually which I haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp and mixed in with my conditioner sometimes. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years &amp; it really helps to keep my scalp dandruff free and it makes my hair grow in thicker.</li>
            <li> excellent product and excellent service!!</li>
            <li> Love these products ! They are amazing for moisturizing</li>
            <li> I ordered the heat cap to use with the oils to grow my hair back. Will keep you posted on the results.</li>
            <li> I use the oils daily and both really keep my scalp from drying out. My hair is always so soft after I use them and I will probably continue using them as 2 of my staple products.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it said it will do. It grows the hair and it actually do not have a medicine scent to it.</li>
            <li> First of all, these products did not come in any package at all.  I was supposed to feel a tingling with the one with the cayenne pepper; but nothing. The crown part I was trying got worse.  I lost more hair instead. I think I need my money back for sure.  Very disappointed.  Who knows what the seller put in the bottle?  Only Yeshua knows.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for growing thick natural curly hair. This oil is thick so mixing with other essential oils is an option or just massaging it into my scalp. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t understand the benefits of this essential oil, it would be worth the time to do some research.</li>
            <li> Red Pimento caused my hair to show up in strands within 7 days! ... i was like OMGosh! Really??? and now my hair is just simply filling in ... amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using but I can&#x27;t tell yet I have to give it some time before I can say it works for me. But I can say that it came in the mail on time.</li>
            <li> It has already nourished my hair and progressed the growth rate! I will Absolutely buy again and continue to buy.</li>
            <li> not sure what this is really suppose to do, it didn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to use, so that isn&#x27;t good. how will you know what kind of results you should be looking for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for five years now and stumbled onto this and so far it&#x27;s okay.  I really don&#x27;t like a lot of oil on my head because of pimples. A little goes a long way for me. The smell of the castor oil is kind of skunky, if you mix it with other oils it will be much better. almond oil or one with a stronger fragrance.</li>
            <li> They have been saying for years that castor oil makes your hair grow. Not really, it definitely does retain hair length. It locks in most moisturizers. And its perfect for deep conditioners. I use the castor oil on my ends every night and the pimento oil on my scalp twice a week. Mainly on deep conditions and co wash days. Do not use to much. It is very thick.</li>
            <li> These two oils are great for natural hair! My hair loves it and it has helped my edges grow a lot! I even put some of the castor oil on my eyelashes and I have seen a lot of growth there! I use the other oil with my deep conditioning treatments on my natural hair and it is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product may be a good buy, but ENTIRELY to greasy.  I had to give it away.  Too much for me.</li>
            <li> Great product......it works.....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it works as of yet, but I definitely have dandruff now. Will update later if I see a difference</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least three months, both the JBC and the Red Pimento Hair Growth.  I can.t really say that I have seen any change in hair growth.  Maybe it is still too soon.  I am going to be patient and update in a few months.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel great and it don&#x27;t have a terrible smell, I really like the Red Pimento when I was my hair it feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome. My hair is growing mad. I put the Jamaican oil around the edge of my hairline, The hair was getting then around the edge. I stated using the oil and my hair is growing back very good.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, fragile hair. The JBCO added a layer of protection that has allows my hair to grow.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.I have never seen my hair growing so fast. I can see the change...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just love it.. :)</li>
            <li> Really works hair has become thick.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is helping to grow back my edges. slow, but I see the changes and I am pleased.  I would recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> This an amazing product because is a natural product. I like the deliver because I don&#x27;t have any problem with USPS because I always received my package with the USPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your customer service.</li>
            <li> Very good hair products</li>
            <li> Your hair will grow in days.  Great for your edges to stay healthy.</li>
            <li> I like trying oils on my scalp and locks. My scalp sucks it up so I oil my scalp every 2-3 days in the morning. Thought I&#x27;d try these&lt;br /&gt;around my thin areas....temples and edges.  Too early to tell if its working yet.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived quickly and securely.  If it works I&#x27;ll reorder form them.</li>
            <li> 2nd time ordering the same product. GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> My mom loves it. Very useful for her hair.</li>
            <li> This really does help thin hair to thicken up.  Great product!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT.  tHANKS FOR BRINGING THIS TO THE PUBLIC.  keep them coming.  hAS TRULY HELPED MY HAIR</li>
            <li> Since I have started using these products my hair is much softer and growing.I would tell everyone I know about these products.</li>
            <li> Not sure. If it work I have been using my hair still fall.ay be I have to giveore time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with JBCO</li>
            <li> I like it it&#x27;s good for sealing moisture in your hair that&#x27;s for sure. Only thing is the smell lol for both of them is really loud. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the smell not really bad it&#x27;s just strong so I wouldn&#x27;t put it in my hair before i go out or anything. I liketo  sit under a heating cap with the oil for 15 mins and leave it in to keep the moisture my hair and so far it&#x27;s been working really good my hair getting thicker and stronger</li>
            <li> Easy to use and have an ok scent, price was great</li>
            <li> Love it ,makes my hair grow</li>
            <li> I love these products, my edges are growing back...  I also used it for swelling and it works great.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great product and love the applicator bottle can be used to mix and apply Jamaican Black Castor Oil mixed with other oils and essential oils to easily apply to o the scalp and hair as a treatment or leave in.</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to try this!! Ive used it 3 times and I already started noticing less shedding. My hair was falling so bad and this really helped. Only bad thing is the smell :/ it is just undescribable, but what can I say? Desperate times call for desperate measures.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair oil it really do what it says my hair has grown a lot and gotten thicker I recommend this to anyone! I have fine hair I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and boy their hair is growing as wel</li>
            <li> This was a great product and I received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> weird burnt smell from the jamacian oil. i would have rather bought regular castor oil then this oil. its not better then the original oil.</li>
            <li> MY LOCS (HAIR) NEVER LOOKED AND FELT STRONGER!!</li>
            <li> i tried this oil a few times and each time i got the worse pounding headache about an  hour later, will never purchase again</li>
            <li> Love these two products, must have for hair growth</li>
            <li> I love it, very impress with the fast shipping... I will be ordering again...</li>
            <li> Pretty sure im allergic to BJCO. I used this on my edges to make them grow out, instead the broke out dramatically. I had to cut them down really low and try again without this product and it grew out again. :/</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING BLACK JAMAICAN CASTOR OIL AND HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH  COMBINATION OF RED PIMENTO HAIR GROWTH.</li>
            <li> I do hair and this oil is heaven sent all my clients are seeing results</li>
            <li> Both of these oils are growing my hair like crazy. I saw so many different brands of Jamaican Castor Oils on Amazon, however i took my chance with this brand because it came with the Red Pimento oil. I&#x27;m almost certain my hair is growing due to me using both oils and massaging them into my scalp in addition to me taking black seed oil orally. The Black Castor oil is extremely thick so i only use on the weekends and then wash my hair on Monday mornings. You will not be disappointed if your looking for a good Jamaican Castor Oil..</li>
            <li> This is a great product and my sister &amp; I love it. We are glad that our Aunt told us about this oil.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Works like a charm. I was a bit skeptical before buying this product. I just bought it off the reviews of others. But I do not regret it one bit.</li>
            <li> I use these two products together for fast hair growth.  Your hair will grow in faster and thicker if you use it on a regular basis.  The product arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this combination! I use it every other day and as a hot oil treatment twice a month. These oils and my vitamins are making a huge difference in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;#sohappy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell.  I haven&#x27;t seen the results that was promoted.  I&#x27;m going to give it at least six months.  I do know that head itches a lot which I dislike. This product is used as recommended, but more time is needed before I&#x27;ll really evaluate it.</li>
            <li> My hair has been growing more then ever. This stuff is heaven sent , the pimento is refreshing to my scalp and the castor oil is the best ! Great buy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëçüëç</li>
            <li> I chose these 2 products because after the results I got from my 1st bottle of jbco, I had to try the strong roots pimento oil also. So far so good. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results of both products.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair grow rapidly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and it does exactly as seller describes.  New growth can be seen after weeks of use, 2x daily</li>
            <li> Love both products..always use black castor oil came pretty quick and ill purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I have seen an improvement in my edges. I have 4C hair and it grows very slow. I was excited to see my edges coming in  again. I think that this has helped in my natural hair journey</li>
            <li> Only had it a short time however;can already detect some new growth esp.In temple area.it&#x27;s a little thick so i place bottle to soak in warm water has a calm lavender fragrance massage into scalp allow15-30min shampoo as usual.Leaves. hair soft,shiny smelling nice</li>
            <li> Works great. I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I have used these products before and was looking for an alternative place to order. I will reorder again soon.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little smaller than it appears online, but I am sure it will last the ladies for a while. I am taking this with me to Kenya and I look forward to hearing about the hair growth experience so many women has witnessed in the natural hair community in the US.</li>
            <li> Items delivered on time; and as described. Great experience; will buy from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> This is very good hair oil. I received them timely within 3 days. I would recommend this product. Does measure up to its standards.</li>
            <li> I started using in for the past few weeks, so far not seen any drastic difference. In fact I see moer hair shedding when appliying to the hair. Hope it will grow after few more weeks. Will continue to use and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oil as such has a very bad smell and I always wash after keeping it for 1 or 2 hours...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the strong roots red pimento hair growth oil and Jamaican black castor oil twice so far and love both.  My hair is softer and easier to comb through my hair.  So far I love everything about both products.  And the seller sent the items very fast!  I&#x27;m very pleased with the seller and the products I purchased.</li>
            <li> Still trying to product. I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews on the product. Have only been using for about a week. I use the red pimento by itself in my hair as a deep conditioner. The castor oil is too thick for my thin caucasian hair so I actually use it for my eye brows instead. It was delivered very quickly. Hopefully it will work for me as well as it has for everyone else.</li>
            <li> Since using these oils my hair has grown like wildfire.  I use the red pimento oil as a hot oil treatment.  My scalp has been especially dry this winter and these oils have helped to combat the dryness.  Love them.</li>
            <li> The price for the both of these was absolutely unbelievable. I hurried up and bought these babies! I used the red pimento oil as a deep conditioner and it did great far as I can tell. My hair looks very healthy. I will continue to purchase this product also. It has a nice smell to it too. Almost like a peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> Thought I try product after noticing hair thinning around temple areas.  Great Product! I&#x27;m seeing new growth in temple area and in nape of neck Love it!</li>
            <li> Works really well on my hair. Has helped it grow tremendously!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the strong roots red pimento, so far so good I like the tingle it leaves on my scalp due to itchy scalp,I like the smell. and its been only three weeks or so, I believe I see little fuzz of hair where its been missing in the middle of my head. So, I will continue to use it and allow more time.  The black castor Oil I will continue to use due its part of my daily hair and eyelash regiment.  I have seen tremendous growth of my eyelash and eyebrow since using black castor oil directly .  also helping  my hair line/edges get little thicker.....  I recommend both procducts .</li>
            <li> this is my first time using this product don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve used it long enough to say yet. but i like how it oil my skin</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Black Castor Oil because the Strong Roots Red Pimento Hail Growth Oil already has it in it, along with coconut and wheat germ oil.  The Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil really doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  It seems to be working, but I need more time to really be sure.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> Great product! Does what it proclaims.</li>
            <li> I jost start using it to soon toto give a feed back</li>
            <li> have only had it a few weeks, seems like it may be working</li>
            <li> Too oily and messes up my nail polish so I have to wear a glove when using this. Great for natural hair though.</li>
            <li> Will keep this as my hair routine. Daily moisture with red pimento oil for increased hair length.  I reuse red piomento oil bottle n add jbco n other essential oils. Works great for me..</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed both products and they have done wonders for my hair. I definitely would recommend these products.</li>
            <li> great product I use this product to help with healing of the scalp and growth of the hair it adds moisture.</li>
            <li> Love this. Smells different  than anything I&#x27;ve  purchased. But its new and I&#x27;m  going to stick with it.</li>
            <li> This oil will actually make your hair thicker, shinier, and grow. I recommend you all to try it. I have purchased it more than once. You can use it on your children hair as well.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving the castor oil and I am really liking it and the effects it is having on mu hair so far. I will keep you posted</li>
            <li> I was so happy with my progress, that I sent for another bottle and also the red Pimento who really stimulates the scalp.</li>
            <li> I started using this on wash days to oil my scalp twice a week. I used it the first couple of times and my scalp itched like crazy I could not bare it. I will try again in about a week or two if it starts back I will be disappointed but things happen...</li>
            <li> I love these products. I use them weekly to grow my thin hair</li>
            <li> Am still using it.  Sticky, however if it helps my hair, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Will know when I am finished with the 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my edges since I bought it and it seems that my edges are growing back. I&#x27;m liking the results and would purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Caused my scalp to itch like I had fleas. Did not see any new growth.</li>
            <li> Works very well helped grow my hair back and will be &#x27;re ordering!</li>
            <li> love the way it was packed will definitely order again</li>
            <li> This was a good value for the price. I use this on my scalp because my hair is currently in yarn twists. I like the smell of the Red Pimento oil. I have not used the Black Castor oil yet, but I have tried it in the past and it worked great.</li>
