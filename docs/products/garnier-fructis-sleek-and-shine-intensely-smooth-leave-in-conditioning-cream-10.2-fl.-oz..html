            <li>I am always happy to help out a stranger with curls because I know what it&#x27;s like to cry with frustration over hair with a mind of its own!</li>

            <li>Try it, on your own hair!</li>
            <li>For years, I have gone through so many bottles of leave-in conditioners trying to find a perfect product--from the exorbitantly priced to the humblest $2.50/bottle.  </li>
            <li>Best part is it&#x27;s cheap for college students like me!</li>
            <li>In this case it worked spectacular!</li>
            <li>Affordable and effective!  </li>

            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>It smells really good too.</li>
            <li>This one bottle has lasted over a year and does a good job of softening up my hair.</li>

            <li>Good stuff will continue to use.</li>

            <li>A Happy and Appreciative Amazon Customer</li>
            <li>But ever since I began using this product I have noticed healthier looking hair, I get lots of compliments on how good my hair looks &amp; on how good it smells.</li>
            <li>It was breaking and thinning, I had to cut a good portion of it off.</li>
            <li>I decided that I wasn&#x27;t going to let that happen again, so I set out to find good products to prevent the damage from happening.</li>
            <li>I like products that smell really good and</li>
            <li>It is good stuff.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s a super great deal to purchase on here.  </li>
            <li>It washes out very easily.</li>
            <li>garnier me and others love it! :))</li>
            <li>I use a lot of leave in products, but by far this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair smell so good and smooth</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my best friend whose daughter has naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best leave-in conditioner that I have used, hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can feel the tangles work their way out as I slip my fingers easily through my hair!</li>
            <li>Otherwise it disappears quickly, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>smells good, does what&#x27;s supposed to do, buy nothing special</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, texture is not too thick, can be used to make a perfectly smooth ponytail with no flyaways, leaves hair feeling wonderful!  </li>
            <li>The smell is great and this is really affordable!</li>
            <li>This is great conditioner its my first time buying it</li>
            <li>It works great for detangling hair, as my hair can get pretty tangly.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair very smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was HIGHLY impressed with the packaging/securing the product, and the SUPER FAST DELIVERY service.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get better for the price.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m completely in love with this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>In the morning most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to gel my hair because this stays in it well, but doesn&#x27;t get crunchy or sticky like gel.</li>
            <li>The seller got it to me on time as well. :)</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this leave in-conditioner I will buy again</li>
            <li>I have used coconut oil and Aragon oil and while I like using them with this,i think this product works better than they do.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>It does an ok job</li>
            <li>Honestly, a much better hand lotion than leave-in hair condioner.</li>
            <li>After I use Garnier&#x27;s Triple Nutrition shampoo and conditioner, I wring the water out of my hair and put a bit more than a quarter-sized amount of this product through, focusing more on the ends.</li>
            <li>Go lightly with this!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this leave in condition even started my boyfriend to using it.</li>
            <li>this review helped :)&lt;br /&gt;Pablo &amp; Susie</li>
            <li>I love love love this leave in.</li>
            <li>I love this product I always buy this.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly for my hair, last all day.</li>
            <li>Save your $$$ for a better product.</li>
            <li>This had more of a chemically smell than apricot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was hesitant to add more conditioner after a shower.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much more I&#x27;m getting out of this stuff...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much more I&#x27;m getting out of this stuff...</li>
            <li>This requires more than the quarter size they recommend (maybe two quarters) for my shoulder blades-length hair.</li>
            <li>I have been receiving many compliments since then</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my hair</li>
            <li>This is an ok product.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it more than I do believe it or not.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure about this product.</li>
            <li>I love Garnier products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Also, most styling gels are do not nourish hair/scalp..</li>
            <li>this is ok and does hydrate my hair</li>
            <li>its not horrible though</li>
            <li>so i would need to apply more than a quarter size of the product on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my hair is more smoother.</li>
            <li>and i love love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product and my hair</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it includes the accented Argan Oil from Morocco and Apricot oil, and smells</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy for $3.00!!!!!</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this product in 2010 &amp; immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>At three bucks, I will be picking up more.</li>
            <li>and they all love it too.</li>
            <li>Better than any gel or mousse</li>
            <li>Looks better than going without ANYTHING, but didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li>ok, thought it would make my hair a lot softer</li>
            <li>OH MY GOD, I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shinier, easier to deal with, but most importantly--healthier.</li>

            <li>I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>This is much better than my $20 Nexus Headdress leave-in.  </li>
            <li>Most people are probably not going to need to put this on their roots.</li>
            <li>than I thought for a product thats so cheap!</li>
            <li>I just make sure to put my hair up at night, awake...</li>

            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth without all the frizz.</li>
            <li>My hair is damaged by all the bleach from highlights and this conditioner makes it easy to comb thru my hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps them soft and smooth and it does a great job at managing my frizz.</li>
            <li>But since then I&#x27;ve found an easy routine that works for</li>
            <li>I recommend you use a strong neutralizing shampoo to get it out of your hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong it gave me a headache.</li>

            <li>And, it&#x27;s super cheap!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smelling amazing until next wash which of course I love!</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better for thick hair, but if you have fine hair, this is not the best product.</li>
            <li>The Seller has described this product accurately.  </li>
            <li>Also, cheap.</li>
            <li>Hair feels silkky smooth.</li>

            <li>Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth Leave-</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>light frizz control.</li>
            <li>It also, makes my hair silky, manageable, and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price and much better quality</li>
            <li>Which is understandable, since the leave in was designed to keep hair frizz free and fight against humidity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Great when used with the same shampoo, which I do.</li>
            <li>Here is my routine for anyone who liked my photos I submitted and wants to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I would not buy it again, feels cheap.</li>
            <li>and it does smooth the cuticle of the hair and makes it shine.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this, and thought \\&quot;It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>so I switched to one of Fructis light gel product instead.</li>
            <li>I will also let my family know how thankful I am that they referred this wonderful product to me, and I finally tried the product, am very satisfied/happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Beware though: only use about a nickel size amount because too much of good product can be overwhelming</li>
            <li>like I Just got out of the shower and it smells so good and makes my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is very economical.</li>
            <li>Works great, lasts for most if not a full day.</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine ringlets and waves, and they get greasy quickly</li>
            <li>are excited about the Argan oil from Morocco products for their hair regimen treatment.  </li>
            <li>by putting some in your hair, then using a towel to swipe your hair in the direction you want it to stay and it works like a charm once the conditioner is fully absorbed!</li>
            <li>Started adding this after showers and her hair is no healthy and looks great!</li>
            <li>Without it, my hair is significantly poofier.</li>
            <li>Hence, I was really happy to have tried this product on because not only is it &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; &amp; natural, it also does a pretty good job of holding my hair in place while imparting flexibility &amp; softness (does not make it</li>
            <li>I was previously using the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Balm, and while it worked great, at about $18 a bottle, I would wear my hair in a bun more often to save the dough.</li>
            <li>The fuller body and more natural look comes when you keep using your hands to make sure you&#x27;re moving the conditioner through.</li>
            <li>It smells like delicious green apple candy when freshly squeezed out of the bottle and the scent diffuses as you rub it in</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to perfume and this has a very light fruity smell that didn&#x27;t cause me to sneeze.</li>
            <li>Good low price leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>but this is good as my back up</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>hair has never looked better, and a lot of it is thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>You also get a lot in the bottle, so it&#x27;ll last you a good while.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Garnier!you&#x27;re going to wash it OUT of your hair, don&#x27;t add any more on day 2.</li>
            <li>This product works REALLY well to smooth out my tangles!</li>
            <li>I love Garnier products but the sleek and shine ones are too intense for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was good until I brushed through it.</li>
            <li>was nice on my extensions but not on my natural hair</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smelling good Till next wash.</li>
            <li>It smell sweet like fruit.</li>
            <li>Used it all up and ready to buy more.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using so many products and it didn&#x27;t take away the tangle or frizz very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am really suprised at what Garnier did with this product, and I will be buying more of this until it discontinues.</li>
            <li>I use only this with the Garnier flexible hairspray and I am good to go for the day.</li>
            <li>The Fructis leave-in smelled pleasant and it made my curls very springy, soft and defined.  </li>
            <li>I go pretty easy on this stuff as it provides the strongest hold of all these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I go pretty easy on this stuff as it provides the strongest hold of all these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great non heavy leave in conditioner works for my fine hair</li>
            <li>Used it in extreme heat in the desert and my curls looked great.</li>
            <li>Citrusy, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li>I use it for my dry ends to add a bit of moisture and a pleasant scent to my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m biracial and have super curly hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my niece who is two and has no patience for rinsing out shampoo  AND conditioner but her super curly hair needs conditioning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it many MANY times and will probably continue to buy it especially at this price.  </li>
            <li>The combination of these two products leaves my hair frizz-free and super shiny.</li>
            <li>Sure it smells decent, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it makes my hair very soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually pretty light.</li>
            <li>If that happens just scrunch it again and it will become smooth and pretty.  </li>
            <li>I first found out about this product when one of my friends brought it to a pool party and told me she used it on her hair after she got out of the pool to make it smooth and untangle it.</li>
            <li>I was at first reluctant to buy this since it was so cheap</li>
            <li>But perfect for us girls with super thick hair!</li>
            <li>Not only does it help detangle her unruley hair but also leaves soft, shiny and beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, my hair is usually very easy to manage (straight, thick, and healthy).</li>
            <li>and this is exactly what my hair needs!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely brand loyal to this cream!</li>
            <li>Great smell, reduces the frizz, hair not too heavy after applying.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ve just color-treated, it will take a bit extra to do the job, but the results are totally amazing.</li>
            <li>This product really does smooth your hair and leaves it</li>
            <li>Not only does this smell amazing</li>
            <li>My whole life I&#x27;ve been stopped by women with curly hair (and without) to ask what I do to my hair to get it frizz free and defined.  </li>
            <li>great product to use everyday on curly hair.</li>
            <li>It turned out soft, shiny, smooth and bouncy!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>i have 2 young daughters and they love it.</li>
            <li>frizz free and soft and light.</li>
            <li>After using this leave-in,  my hair is soft, healthier and more manageable.</li>
            <li>The damaged ends look as good as can be expected</li>
            <li>I use it after swimming or the beach after getting out of the water and sometimes after I shower just because i love how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>OMG such a fantastic product keeps hair smooth, silky and shinny!</li>
            <li>Def worth the price</li>
            <li>so I end up washing my hair far more than I should</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have such a inexpensive product that works so well and doesn&#x27;t make their hair crunchy like gel does.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this product advertised in my Seventeen magazine, and on TV, I decided to give the Garnier company another chance to prove itself useful.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say price doesn&#x27;t always mean the product will be effective.  </li>
            <li>With extremely damaged hair I went to the store and decided to buy all these hair products, top brands and not so top brands that claimed to repair damaged hair.</li>
            <li>The price is incredible and the bottle has lasted me a long time, it&#x27;s still pretty full even after two months of using it almost daily.</li>
            <li>This product was perfect - a little bit of weight to make it lie down better, and it made my hair shiny and silky.</li>
            <li>If you have thick curly hair and want to try this, I say good luck!</li>
            <li>If you have thick curly hair and want to try this, I say good luck!</li>
            <li>I apply it right after I shower.</li>
            <li>along with the leave-in conditioner right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Curls always will have a mind of their own, you can only do so much!</li>
            <li>Best hair product for my hair black African hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy who has shortish hair that I usually part to the side, this product works great for me.</li>
            <li>I use an old t-shirt to sop up the extra water (towels seem to make my hair more frizzy) and then blow-dry it most of the way.  </li>
            <li>Usually buy it in stores, but they had a great deal and coupon so couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product make my hair look un-frizzed, calm, and shiny, but it&#x27;s probably my FAVORITE scent right now.</li>
            <li>It feels so good when you use it on wet hair because you can really feel how moisturizing it is</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy on your hair and the smell is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sensitive to strong fragrances)</li>
            <li>It leaves hair very soft and smooth, and controls frizz.</li>
            <li>It got rid of my tangles and made my hair very soft and smooth.  </li>

            <li>Soft and light.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really hope they never discontinue it!</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance I don&#x27;t mind at all, it smells natural and goes away.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had used too much at first, but I worked pea size amounts into 1 inch sections.  </li>
            <li>I was taken back how silky, shiny, and frizz free my hair was for once!</li>
            <li>when I did that for the first time and it worked, it was like I could hear angels singing ;)</li>
            <li>when I did that for the first time and it worked, it was like I could hear angels singing ;)</li>
            <li>Thanks Garnier!</li>
            <li>Leaves it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li>Really does help with tangled hair!</li>
            <li>and my hair is pretty silky and shinny in a non-weird sticky way.</li>
            <li>ditch the higher end leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy even in humidity!</li>
            <li>Great smell, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Love it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I decided to pull the product that I first started with out again.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look really greasy!</li>
            <li>and then I will apply Big Sexy Hair Root Pump or Root Pump</li>
            <li>Some days I don&#x27;t need the Big Sexy Hair</li>
            <li>I only used it on days I didn&#x27;t shampoo or condition and mostly after getting out of the pool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impress with this product!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have pretty severely damaged, porous hair, and using this on damp hair after washing my hair is a godsend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have always loved it.</li>
            <li>Good smell and isn&#x27;t too heavy in my hair.</li>
            <li>My new favorite product for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>but I figured since I was mostly black and the texture of my hair had totally changed those products were ideal.</li>
            <li>and I use it almost daily (still on my first bottle!!!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use a bunch on fine hair and not have it feel heavy.</li>
            <li>Not pleased at all was hoping with the great price and decent reviews it would work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of conditioners my whole life</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to do because I love my hair long, below my shoulders.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shinny, not greasy (though don&#x27;t use too much), long and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it will work for you if the texture of your hair is more fine.</li>
            <li>I recently heard on Dr. Oz that women with fine, course hair should use a product that has water listed as the first ingredient which is why I bought this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty good in my blonde dry hair .</li>
            <li>makes my hair so much easier to comb out, gives it a healthy shine and helps hydrate it in dry, hot california.</li>
            <li>I had previously used this product before the catastrophe and it worked amazing</li>
            <li>My hair loves it, it feels super soft and it keeps my hair hydrated</li>
            <li>Love that it can be used on dry or damp hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this leave in conditioner for my dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>but I had switched to another product shortly before I did the unthinkable that worked good as well.</li>
            <li>Great for thick curly hair!</li>
            <li>my new favorite Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler I straighten and curl at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>I have straight, my husband curly hair.</li>
            <li>Smells like berries and really gets your hair sleek.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really leave a lot of buildup.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t recommend using that much.</li>
            <li>This conditioner woeks very well.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I also use a straightening balm so using the both is probably too much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>very healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a paddle brush to gently brush out the hair and distribute the conditioner from root to tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>combing it really makes the difference too...</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve only just seen this available on Amazon for $4 which is a non-sale price.)  </li>
            <li>This product really has been a solution to a problem that I did not realize I had until I tried it.</li>
            <li>I got this for my son and he says it works really well.</li>
            <li>(very fussy)...</li>
            <li>if you apply too much it will have a hairspray sort of side effect.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much difference this made on my hair til I went without it.  </li>
            <li>The leave in conditioner really works.</li>
            <li>in the morning, i can brush her hair so much easier than before i used this conditioner.</li>
            <li>really well&lt;br /&gt;etc</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this to try a straight style yet, but will update my review once I do so.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for years for my curly hair and as a detangler for my daughter&#x27;s straight hair.</li>
            <li>I use this on my daughters&#x27; hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li>have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Can be VERY frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any SLEEKness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it just got to be too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my whole life.</li>
            <li>However, I thought it was light enough to use each day, but it&#x27;s suppose to be used every 3 days.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use this unless I need it for straight styles or to condition extensions.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and soft...like ringlets.</li>
            <li>(I really don&#x27;t understand this)</li>
            <li>When hair is very damp, apply Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine leave-in conditioner very liberally and evenly.</li>
            <li>had to write a review because I depend on them so much myself.</li>
            <li>Either way, my hair feels so much smoother and manageable.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very silky.</li>
            <li>Use in on my son whose hair is very curly.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type, but I don&#x27;t really see the difference if I use this</li>
            <li>If your hair is sticky or greasy from this, may be that you are using too much.</li>
            <li>I used this back when the old formula was around and this formula is so much better.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so smooth and soft regardless if I straighten or keep it natural.  </li>
            <li>So easy and makes long hair manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely damaged from many years of bleaching and coloring and I will continue to buy this product to help the appearance of it.</li>
            <li>Lol a little goes a long way with him.</li>
            <li>I use this every other day to detangle and condition my hair after showering and I love it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and makes my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair super soft and shiny and it locks in all of the natural moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li>Others have complained about the smell being too strong, but I think it is perfect and only lasts a small while.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture for my hair, even when I tried using a palm full of product.</li>
            <li>Other than minor scalp itching, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>It is amazing what it can do to smooth your hair down, without the weight of dragging it down.  </li>
            <li>, a little amount (pea-size) is good enough for me</li>
            <li>live without it!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few years because nothing else was good enough.</li>
            <li>I am definitely adding this to my regular routine. :)</li>
            <li>However, many times you can keep your eyes open in the Sunday paper for coupons occasionally and use it with a sale that can be sometimes found at Walmart or CVS.  </li>
            <li>I just recently also purchased chi silk infusion which is another leave in conditioner/ heat protector and comparing them both I actually perfer the Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Leave-in conditioner better.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a product in my hair consistently (besides regular shampoo and conditioner).</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike some other leave-in conditioners, this product is very light and doesn&#x27;t way down my fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen this in the store lately when I&#x27;ve gone to replenish my stock, but I am glad to see it&#x27;s here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend,</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product,  </li>
            <li>The oil is highly recommended, and I have seen a difference in my hair since using products with these</li>
            <li>After it dried I combed it again and my hair is very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It will cause build up because amodimethicone is placed high in the product&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li>, I decided to purchase this producet based on high reviews.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My #1 go to product for my naturally curly hair!!</li>
            <li>I received my shipment on time and paid a reasonable price a lot cheaper then in the stores near me.</li>
            <li>This is a leave in that also offers shine, much like the Bio-Silk serum, but cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always use a very generous amount of this product and it leaves my hair so soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the only thing that helps me with my curls.</li>
            <li>Using this product after I shower not only makes my hair smell extra nice, but it also keeps in extra moisture as it dries.</li>
            <li>Before I did that, I stopped by the store and grabbed a few more products to give it them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to apply before the beach or pool because it won&#x27;t make your hair dry or hard.</li>
            <li>This cream is almost the only thing that can make my hair lay right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a cosmetic and hair-product junkie, so I&#x27;m always looking for something new.</li>
            <li>This is our new must have for hair that is always tangled...</li>
            <li>I use Suave Mint &amp; Eucalyptus anti-dandruff shampoo (this is new</li>
            <li>Really helped my two year old&#x27;s curly frizzy hair stay soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Indeed, it kept my damaged hair smooth, but when I tried to cleanse it from my healthy transitioning hairs it was difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>It keeps my curls in place and it keeps them very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>(I mean for real curly not kinky) and don&#x27;t want to be bothered with oils or grease in your hair or face, you will love this.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>After co-washing my hair I put this baby in and my hair become instantaniously soft and moisturized again!</li>
            <li>This product makes my usually dry, brittle hair super soft throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I am fourteen years old, and I have very healthy, pin-straight, but VERY thick hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to be going into the humid, hot summers of the North East knowing that I won&#x27;t have bad hair day every day.</li>
            <li>Smooth hair and gives a slight shine, but oily look after one day.</li>
            <li>Natural hair products tend to be very expensive, but this worked better than most of them.</li>
            <li>Better than even super expensive brands.</li>
            <li>but it might be that with fine hair it seems too heavy.</li>
            <li>My only complaint: I wish there were more in the bottle!</li>
            <li>This, along with the other sleek and shine products, are the only thing I have found that work well with my super curly hair in very humid SE Texas.  </li>
            <li>Having naturally dry, frizzy hair is something that most if not all black people have to live with.</li>
            <li>Although I use a rinse out conditioner every time I shampoo, I have naturally curly hair that tends to get a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li>and I have natural 4b shoulder length kinky hair.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair soft and shiny as well as keeping my frizz under control.</li>
            <li>It adds shimmer and makes your hair really soft and doesn&#x27;t leave any build up or residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>The combination leaves my natural hair soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and it actually works!</li>
            <li>have 2 young daughters and keeping their hair in check is a chore that has been made 100 times easier with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just condition my hair and it leaves it soft and conditioned for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>For as much hair as I have, I slightly double.</li>
            <li>a while I couldn&#x27;t find this creme anywhere, I think it had gone on sale and sold out in a flash and stores were not restocking fast enough!</li>
            <li>It also enhances natural waves and curls.</li>
            <li>well it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and have had to use styling gels that would stiffen to keep my hair styled properly...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Its not a heavy leave in</li>
            <li>I like how this product keeps my hair soft, but it also irritates my hands when I rub it into my fingers before I distribute it into my hair.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received this product, I put the leave-in conditioner in my hair, I could feel my scalp and hair being sensitively treated from scalp to roots, it makes your hair feel softer while you are processing this leave-in conditioner in your hair.  </li>
            <li>After drying my hair it was manageable enough for me to either curl or leave straight.  </li>
            <li>and I finally tried the product, am very satisfied/happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>If you have a natural wave to your hair all you have to do is just scrunch your hair with the product BUT DON&#x27;T OVERDO it or else it can become crunchy...</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this treatment and honestly do not want to be without it.</li>
            <li>The Fructis is 100% natural, based on apricots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s slightly coarse and very frizzy.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling smooth for a few days.</li>
            <li>My natural curls are well defined and shiny.</li>
            <li>I know women who wear their hair  natural also don&#x27;t like to use shampoo with sulfates in them, but I&#x27;ve not had any problem using the shampoo from this line.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, which is frizzy and unruly.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my naturally curly hair from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li>Even yesterday, when the relative humidity in the air was 88%, my hair was shiny and sleek the whole day, without an ounce of frizz.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised when I saw all these reviews from people with curly hair.</li>
            <li>I used to try and use a brush to move products through, but all that did was make my hair stick close to my head on top and then fall in thick ringlets toward the bottom...</li>
            <li>The conditioner is thick, so unless you&#x27;re going to wash it OUT of your hair, don&#x27;t add any more on day 2.</li>
            <li>Because of that I also use a light application of this leave in conditioner and it helps keep my hair soft and helps tame the frizz.</li>
            <li>I usually apply it while still standing in the shower, so if I sense that I&#x27;ve used too much, I just quickly give my hair a spray of water, and</li>
            <li>You can actually style your hair slightly (I&#x27;m not talking spikes, it&#x27;s not that intense)</li>
            <li>is starting to fix up :) not only this but every other Garnier item &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Super pretty ringlets and very little frizz!</li>
            <li>I have spent YEARS looking for the right leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner reduces frizz and makes my hair super soft without weighing it down or making it greasy.</li>
            <li>No more knots and so easy to brush through.  </li>
            <li>While my hair was still damp I put a very small amount on my hair in sections trying to get it mostly on the damaged ends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, beware of using this product too frequently: it causes a lot of build-up on my hair and had to use clarifying products multiple times to make my hair feel normal again.</li>
            <li>But after I blowdry my hair, I dislike the frizziness on the edges of everything and wish it would calm down and be shiny without waiting for the natural oils to catch up.</li>
            <li>Works very well for my dry curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>To the person who said the smell was overpowering you used too much and or didn&#x27;t let it dry.</li>
            <li>Next, after squeezing as much excess moisture out as possible, I apply a leave-in conditioner followed by Tresemme mousse for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, at least give it a try, I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>It also made my hair very sticky, which makes it more difficult to detangle.  </li>
            <li>which is a major plus for me because my hair drinks water like it&#x27;s nothing.</li>
            <li>This mousse is not bad about getting hard and flaky, just be sure to apply it evenly, with only a small portion in your hands at a time.</li>
            <li>the shoulder length, thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, frizzy hair that won&#x27;t curl or hang straight.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this would be better for very thick 4a/4c hair types.</li>
            <li>(That being said, it worked amazingly, but you can imagine I needed a lot of it, hence it was a bit of an expense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of the Garnier, but I use their shampoo and conditioner in the shower, and I like it.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very scented but not much softer.</li>
            <li>lastly, I have noticed a marked improvement in the smoothness &amp; shine of my hair since I have started using it...</li>
            <li>My routine is to wash my hair with Redken All Soft shampoo, deep condition with Redken Color Extend, rinse and apply Frizz ease serum to damp hair.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to add too much or your hair can get greasy.</li>
            <li>I was just using regular conditioner in my daughter&#x27;s ultra curly hair to keep the curls soft, and manageable, and thought this would do just as well without the greasy feel.</li>
            <li>looks like I have my old hair back!  </li>
            <li>I put this in my hair directly out of the shower and my frizz is instantly tamed!</li>
            <li>Fine, thick, thin, course, long and short all of their hair types look fabulous with this quick, simple conditioner.</li>
            <li>I shampooed and conditioned my hair as usual, rinsing with cool water.</li>
            <li>if this product works,I can&#x27;t get past the sickly sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I also love how it dosen&#x27;t leave any unnecessary buildup in my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually wait until my hair is slightly more dry (about and hour later)</li>
            <li>I just keep finger combing it through my hair, and it coats it all evenly without making it heavy, or drying crunchy or sticky (make sure to apply it while your hair is slightly damp, then let it air dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finger-</li>
            <li>Just because it&#x27;s cheap doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how to use a leave in conditioner in the past, but due to experience I am better with it.  </li>
            <li>I used it as I would normally use a leave in... by the way I have natural African American hair, but in the morning when I took out my two strand twists my hair looked dry and frizzy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I used too much product or if my hair wasn&#x27;t wet enough when I put the product in.</li>
            <li>It also has a problem with leaving white residue in your hair so be careful not to put too much.</li>
            <li>I am African American and I wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li>However, if you wet it a little and fluff it some more it&#x27;ll get softer in no time.</li>
            <li>He has slight (oily) waves in the front of his hair and super dry curls in the back.</li>
            <li>I showered as normal and then put about 2 quarter size dollops all throughout my wet hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all, in my opinion, and it is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>If your hair is weighed down you are probably using too much.</li>
            <li>If you put too much, your hair will feel weighed down.</li>
            <li>I have very thick curly hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>careful not to use too much or your hear will be as stiff as a board.i guess that would depend on the length of your hear as to how much to use.other then</li>
            <li>Since my hair was a little sticky,  it tangled more often than usual during the day.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it combined with their Moroccan oil or some other gel, but this is my main hair cream.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t let it dry naturally without a ton of products in it.  </li>
            <li>I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>but I like it so far for my dry flaky scalp &amp; product build-up) Step 2</li>
            <li>, I wake up the next morning and it barely looks any different.</li>
            <li>You may feel that it takes a little longer to blow dry your hair, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair you may want to use sparingly, as I can tell this product might be a little heavy or sticky if applied too liberally.  </li>

            <li> For years, I have gone through so many bottles of leave-in conditioners trying to find a perfect product--from the exorbitantly priced to the humblest $2.50/bottle.  </li>

            <li> But ever since I began using this product I have noticed healthier looking hair, I get lots of compliments on how good my hair looks &amp; on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> It was breaking and thinning, I had to cut a good portion of it off.</li>
            <li> I decided that I wasn&#x27;t going to let that happen again, so I set out to find good products to prevent the damage from happening.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a super great deal to purchase on here.  </li>
            <li> It washes out very easily.</li>

            <li> I use a lot of leave in products, but by far this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair smell so good and smooth</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my best friend whose daughter has naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best leave-in conditioner that I have used, hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can feel the tangles work their way out as I slip my fingers easily through my hair!</li>

            <li> smells good, does what&#x27;s supposed to do, buy nothing special</li>

            <li> This is great conditioner its my first time buying it</li>
            <li> It works great for detangling hair, as my hair can get pretty tangly.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair very smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was HIGHLY impressed with the packaging/securing the product, and the SUPER FAST DELIVERY service.  </li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m completely in love with this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> In the morning most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to gel my hair because this stays in it well, but doesn&#x27;t get crunchy or sticky like gel.</li>
            <li> The seller got it to me on time as well. :)</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in-conditioner I will buy again</li>
            <li> I have used coconut oil and Aragon oil and while I like using them with this,i think this product works better than they do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> My favorite hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> It does an ok job</li>
            <li> Honestly, a much better hand lotion than leave-in hair condioner.</li>
            <li> After I use Garnier&#x27;s Triple Nutrition shampoo and conditioner, I wring the water out of my hair and put a bit more than a quarter-sized amount of this product through, focusing more on the ends.</li>
            <li> Go lightly with this!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this leave in condition even started my boyfriend to using it.</li>
            <li> this review helped :)&lt;br /&gt;Pablo &amp; Susie</li>
            <li> I love love love this leave in.</li>
            <li> I love this product I always buy this.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my hair, last all day.</li>
            <li> Save your $$$ for a better product.</li>
            <li> This had more of a chemically smell than apricot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was hesitant to add more conditioner after a shower.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much more I&#x27;m getting out of this stuff...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much more I&#x27;m getting out of this stuff...</li>
            <li> This requires more than the quarter size they recommend (maybe two quarters) for my shoulder blades-length hair.</li>
            <li> I have been receiving many compliments since then</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my hair</li>
            <li> This is an ok product.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it more than I do believe it or not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about this product.</li>
            <li> I love Garnier products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Also, most styling gels are do not nourish hair/scalp..</li>
            <li> this is ok and does hydrate my hair</li>
            <li> its not horrible though</li>
            <li> so i would need to apply more than a quarter size of the product on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair is more smoother.</li>
            <li> and i love love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product and my hair</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it includes the accented Argan Oil from Morocco and Apricot oil, and smells</li>
            <li> Overall a great buy for $3.00!!!!!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product in 2010 &amp; immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> At three bucks, I will be picking up more.</li>
            <li> and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> Better than any gel or mousse</li>
            <li> Looks better than going without ANYTHING, but didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> ok, thought it would make my hair a lot softer</li>
            <li> OH MY GOD, I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shinier, easier to deal with, but most importantly--healthier.</li>
            <li> Everything from the wonderful smell, to the how soft and smooth it makes my hair look</li>
            <li> I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> This is much better than my $20 Nexus Headdress leave-in.  </li>
            <li> Most people are probably not going to need to put this on their roots.</li>
            <li> than I thought for a product thats so cheap!</li>
            <li> I just make sure to put my hair up at night, awake...</li>
            <li> : I condition my hair most days</li>
            <li> Okay, for one, it makes your hair look and feel so smooth and silky!  </li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I have gotten fabulous results!</li>
            <li> I use pantene&#x27;s curl gel on my hair, and was always pleased with the curl support it provided, but I still had issues with frizz.  </li>
            <li> It feels healthy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this one just smelled OKAY.</li>
            <li> This product is one of my favorite Garnier products on the market</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and the feel.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell, too.</li>
            <li> I was astonishingly suprised with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> I love that it is so inexpensive as I use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance though, a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product...</li>
            <li> This one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> (biracial, curly/wavy and super frizzified) and his hair started to look AMAZING one day.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, hydrated, moisturize and smells great.</li>
            <li> I then gently run my fingers through the top of my hair once or twice to smooth it out, and I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend using it on wet hair for best results.</li>
            <li> Works great on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product to help keep my hair managable and shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> so i need something that will make it smooth and more manageable...</li>
            <li> /&gt;it makes their hair much easier to brush, smells good, and keeps the freezies down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work for me: it smells so good, but it didn&#x27;t help define my curls at all.</li>
            <li> This style conditioner is very good quality, hair wash clean with it, very smooth, after the next time will buy, ha ha</li>
            <li> Good conditioner, good for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft and mmm, I love the smell!!</li>
            <li> My husband and brother in law have very nice, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Love the scent of it, it smells fresh and lovely.</li>
            <li> Creamy consistency which I like and easy to apply on the hair, not sticky.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth without all the frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged by all the bleach from highlights and this conditioner makes it easy to comb thru my hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps them soft and smooth and it does a great job at managing my frizz.</li>
            <li> But since then I&#x27;ve found an easy routine that works for</li>
            <li> I recommend you use a strong neutralizing shampoo to get it out of your hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I have been using products with the Argan oil from Morocco since I first heard about this amazing ingredient for beaut y enhancement,</li>

            <li> And, it&#x27;s super cheap!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smelling amazing until next wash which of course I love!</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work better for thick hair, but if you have fine hair, this is not the best product.</li>
            <li> The Seller has described this product accurately.  </li>
            <li> Also, cheap.</li>

            <li> My curls go frizz free almost every time I use this product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great price and it makes it possible to brush her hair without tears.</li>
            <li> Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth Leave-</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> light frizz control.</li>
            <li> It also, makes my hair silky, manageable, and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price and much better quality</li>
            <li> Which is understandable, since the leave in was designed to keep hair frizz free and fight against humidity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>

            <li> I would not buy it again, feels cheap.</li>
            <li> and it does smooth the cuticle of the hair and makes it shine.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this, and thought \\&quot;It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> so I switched to one of Fructis light gel product instead.</li>
            <li> I will also let my family know how thankful I am that they referred this wonderful product to me, and I finally tried the product, am very satisfied/happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Beware though: only use about a nickel size amount because too much of good product can be overwhelming</li>
            <li> like I Just got out of the shower and it smells so good and makes my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is very economical.</li>
            <li> Works great, lasts for most if not a full day.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine ringlets and waves, and they get greasy quickly</li>
            <li> are excited about the Argan oil from Morocco products for their hair regimen treatment.  </li>
            <li> by putting some in your hair, then using a towel to swipe your hair in the direction you want it to stay and it works like a charm once the conditioner is fully absorbed!</li>
            <li> Started adding this after showers and her hair is no healthy and looks great!</li>
            <li> Without it, my hair is significantly poofier.</li>
            <li> Hence, I was really happy to have tried this product on because not only is it &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; &amp; natural, it also does a pretty good job of holding my hair in place while imparting flexibility &amp; softness (does not make it</li>
            <li> I was previously using the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Balm, and while it worked great, at about $18 a bottle, I would wear my hair in a bun more often to save the dough.</li>
            <li> The fuller body and more natural look comes when you keep using your hands to make sure you&#x27;re moving the conditioner through.</li>
            <li> It smells like delicious green apple candy when freshly squeezed out of the bottle and the scent diffuses as you rub it in</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to perfume and this has a very light fruity smell that didn&#x27;t cause me to sneeze.</li>
            <li> Good low price leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> but this is good as my back up</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> hair has never looked better, and a lot of it is thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> You also get a lot in the bottle, so it&#x27;ll last you a good while.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Garnier!you&#x27;re going to wash it OUT of your hair, don&#x27;t add any more on day 2.</li>
            <li> This product works REALLY well to smooth out my tangles!</li>
            <li> I love Garnier products but the sleek and shine ones are too intense for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was good until I brushed through it.</li>
            <li> was nice on my extensions but not on my natural hair</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling good Till next wash.</li>
            <li> It smell sweet like fruit.</li>
            <li> Used it all up and ready to buy more.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using so many products and it didn&#x27;t take away the tangle or frizz very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am really suprised at what Garnier did with this product, and I will be buying more of this until it discontinues.</li>
            <li> I use only this with the Garnier flexible hairspray and I am good to go for the day.</li>
            <li> The Fructis leave-in smelled pleasant and it made my curls very springy, soft and defined.  </li>
            <li> I go pretty easy on this stuff as it provides the strongest hold of all these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I go pretty easy on this stuff as it provides the strongest hold of all these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great non heavy leave in conditioner works for my fine hair</li>
            <li> Used it in extreme heat in the desert and my curls looked great.</li>
            <li> Citrusy, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li> I use it for my dry ends to add a bit of moisture and a pleasant scent to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biracial and have super curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my niece who is two and has no patience for rinsing out shampoo  AND conditioner but her super curly hair needs conditioning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it many MANY times and will probably continue to buy it especially at this price.  </li>
            <li> The combination of these two products leaves my hair frizz-free and super shiny.</li>
            <li> Sure it smells decent, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it makes my hair very soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually pretty light.</li>
            <li> If that happens just scrunch it again and it will become smooth and pretty.  </li>
            <li> I first found out about this product when one of my friends brought it to a pool party and told me she used it on her hair after she got out of the pool to make it smooth and untangle it.</li>
            <li> I was at first reluctant to buy this since it was so cheap</li>
            <li> But perfect for us girls with super thick hair!</li>
            <li> Not only does it help detangle her unruley hair but also leaves soft, shiny and beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, my hair is usually very easy to manage (straight, thick, and healthy).</li>
            <li> and this is exactly what my hair needs!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely brand loyal to this cream!</li>
            <li> Great smell, reduces the frizz, hair not too heavy after applying.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve just color-treated, it will take a bit extra to do the job, but the results are totally amazing.</li>
            <li> This product really does smooth your hair and leaves it</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell amazing</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve been stopped by women with curly hair (and without) to ask what I do to my hair to get it frizz free and defined.  </li>
            <li> great product to use everyday on curly hair.</li>
            <li> It turned out soft, shiny, smooth and bouncy!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> i have 2 young daughters and they love it.</li>
            <li> frizz free and soft and light.</li>
            <li> After using this leave-in,  my hair is soft, healthier and more manageable.</li>
            <li> The damaged ends look as good as can be expected</li>
            <li> I use it after swimming or the beach after getting out of the water and sometimes after I shower just because i love how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> OMG such a fantastic product keeps hair smooth, silky and shinny!</li>
            <li> Def worth the price</li>
            <li> so I end up washing my hair far more than I should</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have such a inexpensive product that works so well and doesn&#x27;t make their hair crunchy like gel does.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this product advertised in my Seventeen magazine, and on TV, I decided to give the Garnier company another chance to prove itself useful.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say price doesn&#x27;t always mean the product will be effective.  </li>
            <li> With extremely damaged hair I went to the store and decided to buy all these hair products, top brands and not so top brands that claimed to repair damaged hair.</li>
            <li> The price is incredible and the bottle has lasted me a long time, it&#x27;s still pretty full even after two months of using it almost daily.</li>
            <li> This product was perfect - a little bit of weight to make it lie down better, and it made my hair shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> If you have thick curly hair and want to try this, I say good luck!</li>
            <li> If you have thick curly hair and want to try this, I say good luck!</li>
            <li> I apply it right after I shower.</li>
            <li> along with the leave-in conditioner right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Curls always will have a mind of their own, you can only do so much!</li>
            <li> Best hair product for my hair black African hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who has shortish hair that I usually part to the side, this product works great for me.</li>
            <li> I use an old t-shirt to sop up the extra water (towels seem to make my hair more frizzy) and then blow-dry it most of the way.  </li>
            <li> Usually buy it in stores, but they had a great deal and coupon so couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product make my hair look un-frizzed, calm, and shiny, but it&#x27;s probably my FAVORITE scent right now.</li>
            <li> It feels so good when you use it on wet hair because you can really feel how moisturizing it is</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy on your hair and the smell is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sensitive to strong fragrances)</li>
            <li> It leaves hair very soft and smooth, and controls frizz.</li>
            <li> It got rid of my tangles and made my hair very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Soft and light.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really hope they never discontinue it!</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance I don&#x27;t mind at all, it smells natural and goes away.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had used too much at first, but I worked pea size amounts into 1 inch sections.  </li>
            <li> I was taken back how silky, shiny, and frizz free my hair was for once!</li>
            <li> when I did that for the first time and it worked, it was like I could hear angels singing ;)</li>
            <li> when I did that for the first time and it worked, it was like I could hear angels singing ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks Garnier!</li>
            <li> Leaves it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li> Really does help with tangled hair!</li>
            <li> and my hair is pretty silky and shinny in a non-weird sticky way.</li>
            <li> ditch the higher end leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy even in humidity!</li>
            <li> Great smell, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I decided to pull the product that I first started with out again.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look really greasy!</li>
            <li> and then I will apply Big Sexy Hair Root Pump or Root Pump</li>
            <li> Some days I don&#x27;t need the Big Sexy Hair</li>
            <li> I only used it on days I didn&#x27;t shampoo or condition and mostly after getting out of the pool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impress with this product!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have pretty severely damaged, porous hair, and using this on damp hair after washing my hair is a godsend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have always loved it.</li>
            <li> Good smell and isn&#x27;t too heavy in my hair.</li>
            <li> My new favorite product for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> but I figured since I was mostly black and the texture of my hair had totally changed those products were ideal.</li>
            <li> and I use it almost daily (still on my first bottle!!!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use a bunch on fine hair and not have it feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Not pleased at all was hoping with the great price and decent reviews it would work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of conditioners my whole life</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to do because I love my hair long, below my shoulders.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shinny, not greasy (though don&#x27;t use too much), long and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it will work for you if the texture of your hair is more fine.</li>
            <li> I recently heard on Dr. Oz that women with fine, course hair should use a product that has water listed as the first ingredient which is why I bought this leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty good in my blonde dry hair .</li>
            <li> makes my hair so much easier to comb out, gives it a healthy shine and helps hydrate it in dry, hot california.</li>
            <li> I had previously used this product before the catastrophe and it worked amazing</li>
            <li> My hair loves it, it feels super soft and it keeps my hair hydrated</li>
            <li> Love that it can be used on dry or damp hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this leave in conditioner for my dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> but I had switched to another product shortly before I did the unthinkable that worked good as well.</li>
            <li> Great for thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> my new favorite Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler I straighten and curl at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> I have straight, my husband curly hair.</li>
            <li> Smells like berries and really gets your hair sleek.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really leave a lot of buildup.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t recommend using that much.</li>
            <li> This conditioner woeks very well.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I also use a straightening balm so using the both is probably too much for my hair.  </li>
            <li> very healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a paddle brush to gently brush out the hair and distribute the conditioner from root to tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> combing it really makes the difference too...</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only just seen this available on Amazon for $4 which is a non-sale price.)  </li>
            <li> This product really has been a solution to a problem that I did not realize I had until I tried it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son and he says it works really well.</li>
            <li> (very fussy)...</li>
            <li> if you apply too much it will have a hairspray sort of side effect.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much difference this made on my hair til I went without it.  </li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner really works.</li>
            <li> in the morning, i can brush her hair so much easier than before i used this conditioner.</li>
            <li> really well&lt;br /&gt;etc</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this to try a straight style yet, but will update my review once I do so.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years for my curly hair and as a detangler for my daughter&#x27;s straight hair.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters&#x27; hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li> have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Can be VERY frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any SLEEKness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it just got to be too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my whole life.</li>
            <li> However, I thought it was light enough to use each day, but it&#x27;s suppose to be used every 3 days.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use this unless I need it for straight styles or to condition extensions.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and soft...like ringlets.</li>
            <li> (I really don&#x27;t understand this)</li>
            <li> When hair is very damp, apply Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine leave-in conditioner very liberally and evenly.</li>
            <li> had to write a review because I depend on them so much myself.</li>
            <li> Either way, my hair feels so much smoother and manageable.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very silky.</li>
            <li> Use in on my son whose hair is very curly.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type, but I don&#x27;t really see the difference if I use this</li>
            <li> If your hair is sticky or greasy from this, may be that you are using too much.</li>
            <li> I used this back when the old formula was around and this formula is so much better.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so smooth and soft regardless if I straighten or keep it natural.  </li>
            <li> So easy and makes long hair manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely damaged from many years of bleaching and coloring and I will continue to buy this product to help the appearance of it.</li>
            <li> Lol a little goes a long way with him.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day to detangle and condition my hair after showering and I love it.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and makes my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair super soft and shiny and it locks in all of the natural moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> Others have complained about the smell being too strong, but I think it is perfect and only lasts a small while.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture for my hair, even when I tried using a palm full of product.</li>
            <li> Other than minor scalp itching, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is amazing what it can do to smooth your hair down, without the weight of dragging it down.  </li>
            <li> , a little amount (pea-size) is good enough for me</li>
            <li> live without it!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years because nothing else was good enough.</li>
            <li> I am definitely adding this to my regular routine. :)</li>
            <li> However, many times you can keep your eyes open in the Sunday paper for coupons occasionally and use it with a sale that can be sometimes found at Walmart or CVS.  </li>
            <li> I just recently also purchased chi silk infusion which is another leave in conditioner/ heat protector and comparing them both I actually perfer the Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Leave-in conditioner better.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a product in my hair consistently (besides regular shampoo and conditioner).</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike some other leave-in conditioners, this product is very light and doesn&#x27;t way down my fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this in the store lately when I&#x27;ve gone to replenish my stock, but I am glad to see it&#x27;s here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product,  </li>
            <li> The oil is highly recommended, and I have seen a difference in my hair since using products with these</li>
            <li> After it dried I combed it again and my hair is very smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It will cause build up because amodimethicone is placed high in the product&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li> , I decided to purchase this producet based on high reviews.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My #1 go to product for my naturally curly hair!!</li>
            <li> I received my shipment on time and paid a reasonable price a lot cheaper then in the stores near me.</li>
            <li> This is a leave in that also offers shine, much like the Bio-Silk serum, but cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always use a very generous amount of this product and it leaves my hair so soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the only thing that helps me with my curls.</li>
            <li> Using this product after I shower not only makes my hair smell extra nice, but it also keeps in extra moisture as it dries.</li>
            <li> Before I did that, I stopped by the store and grabbed a few more products to give it them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to apply before the beach or pool because it won&#x27;t make your hair dry or hard.</li>
            <li> This cream is almost the only thing that can make my hair lay right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a cosmetic and hair-product junkie, so I&#x27;m always looking for something new.</li>
            <li> This is our new must have for hair that is always tangled...</li>
            <li> I use Suave Mint &amp; Eucalyptus anti-dandruff shampoo (this is new</li>
            <li> Really helped my two year old&#x27;s curly frizzy hair stay soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Indeed, it kept my damaged hair smooth, but when I tried to cleanse it from my healthy transitioning hairs it was difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> It keeps my curls in place and it keeps them very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> (I mean for real curly not kinky) and don&#x27;t want to be bothered with oils or grease in your hair or face, you will love this.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> After co-washing my hair I put this baby in and my hair become instantaniously soft and moisturized again!</li>
            <li> This product makes my usually dry, brittle hair super soft throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I am fourteen years old, and I have very healthy, pin-straight, but VERY thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to be going into the humid, hot summers of the North East knowing that I won&#x27;t have bad hair day every day.</li>
            <li> Smooth hair and gives a slight shine, but oily look after one day.</li>
            <li> Natural hair products tend to be very expensive, but this worked better than most of them.</li>
            <li> Better than even super expensive brands.</li>
            <li> but it might be that with fine hair it seems too heavy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint: I wish there were more in the bottle!</li>
            <li> This, along with the other sleek and shine products, are the only thing I have found that work well with my super curly hair in very humid SE Texas.  </li>
            <li> Having naturally dry, frizzy hair is something that most if not all black people have to live with.</li>
            <li> Although I use a rinse out conditioner every time I shampoo, I have naturally curly hair that tends to get a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li> and I have natural 4b shoulder length kinky hair.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair soft and shiny as well as keeping my frizz under control.</li>
            <li> It adds shimmer and makes your hair really soft and doesn&#x27;t leave any build up or residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> The combination leaves my natural hair soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and it actually works!</li>
            <li> have 2 young daughters and keeping their hair in check is a chore that has been made 100 times easier with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just condition my hair and it leaves it soft and conditioned for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> For as much hair as I have, I slightly double.</li>
            <li> a while I couldn&#x27;t find this creme anywhere, I think it had gone on sale and sold out in a flash and stores were not restocking fast enough!</li>
            <li> It also enhances natural waves and curls.</li>
            <li> well it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and have had to use styling gels that would stiffen to keep my hair styled properly...</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Its not a heavy leave in</li>
            <li> I like how this product keeps my hair soft, but it also irritates my hands when I rub it into my fingers before I distribute it into my hair.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this product, I put the leave-in conditioner in my hair, I could feel my scalp and hair being sensitively treated from scalp to roots, it makes your hair feel softer while you are processing this leave-in conditioner in your hair.  </li>
            <li> After drying my hair it was manageable enough for me to either curl or leave straight.  </li>
            <li> and I finally tried the product, am very satisfied/happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> If you have a natural wave to your hair all you have to do is just scrunch your hair with the product BUT DON&#x27;T OVERDO it or else it can become crunchy...</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this treatment and honestly do not want to be without it.</li>
            <li> The Fructis is 100% natural, based on apricots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s slightly coarse and very frizzy.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling smooth for a few days.</li>
            <li> My natural curls are well defined and shiny.</li>
            <li> I know women who wear their hair  natural also don&#x27;t like to use shampoo with sulfates in them, but I&#x27;ve not had any problem using the shampoo from this line.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, which is frizzy and unruly.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my naturally curly hair from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> Even yesterday, when the relative humidity in the air was 88%, my hair was shiny and sleek the whole day, without an ounce of frizz.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised when I saw all these reviews from people with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I used to try and use a brush to move products through, but all that did was make my hair stick close to my head on top and then fall in thick ringlets toward the bottom...</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick, so unless you&#x27;re going to wash it OUT of your hair, don&#x27;t add any more on day 2.</li>
            <li> Because of that I also use a light application of this leave in conditioner and it helps keep my hair soft and helps tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it while still standing in the shower, so if I sense that I&#x27;ve used too much, I just quickly give my hair a spray of water, and</li>
            <li> You can actually style your hair slightly (I&#x27;m not talking spikes, it&#x27;s not that intense)</li>
            <li> is starting to fix up :) not only this but every other Garnier item &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Super pretty ringlets and very little frizz!</li>
            <li> I have spent YEARS looking for the right leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner reduces frizz and makes my hair super soft without weighing it down or making it greasy.</li>
            <li> No more knots and so easy to brush through.  </li>
            <li> While my hair was still damp I put a very small amount on my hair in sections trying to get it mostly on the damaged ends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, beware of using this product too frequently: it causes a lot of build-up on my hair and had to use clarifying products multiple times to make my hair feel normal again.</li>
            <li> But after I blowdry my hair, I dislike the frizziness on the edges of everything and wish it would calm down and be shiny without waiting for the natural oils to catch up.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my dry curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> To the person who said the smell was overpowering you used too much and or didn&#x27;t let it dry.</li>
            <li> Next, after squeezing as much excess moisture out as possible, I apply a leave-in conditioner followed by Tresemme mousse for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, at least give it a try, I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair very sticky, which makes it more difficult to detangle.  </li>
            <li> which is a major plus for me because my hair drinks water like it&#x27;s nothing.</li>
            <li> This mousse is not bad about getting hard and flaky, just be sure to apply it evenly, with only a small portion in your hands at a time.</li>
            <li> the shoulder length, thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair that won&#x27;t curl or hang straight.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this would be better for very thick 4a/4c hair types.</li>
            <li> (That being said, it worked amazingly, but you can imagine I needed a lot of it, hence it was a bit of an expense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of the Garnier, but I use their shampoo and conditioner in the shower, and I like it.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very scented but not much softer.</li>
            <li> lastly, I have noticed a marked improvement in the smoothness &amp; shine of my hair since I have started using it...</li>
            <li> My routine is to wash my hair with Redken All Soft shampoo, deep condition with Redken Color Extend, rinse and apply Frizz ease serum to damp hair.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to add too much or your hair can get greasy.</li>
            <li> I was just using regular conditioner in my daughter&#x27;s ultra curly hair to keep the curls soft, and manageable, and thought this would do just as well without the greasy feel.</li>
            <li> looks like I have my old hair back!  </li>
            <li> I put this in my hair directly out of the shower and my frizz is instantly tamed!</li>
            <li> Fine, thick, thin, course, long and short all of their hair types look fabulous with this quick, simple conditioner.</li>
            <li> I shampooed and conditioned my hair as usual, rinsing with cool water.</li>
            <li> if this product works,I can&#x27;t get past the sickly sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I also love how it dosen&#x27;t leave any unnecessary buildup in my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually wait until my hair is slightly more dry (about and hour later)</li>
            <li> I just keep finger combing it through my hair, and it coats it all evenly without making it heavy, or drying crunchy or sticky (make sure to apply it while your hair is slightly damp, then let it air dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finger-</li>
            <li> Just because it&#x27;s cheap doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how to use a leave in conditioner in the past, but due to experience I am better with it.  </li>
            <li> I used it as I would normally use a leave in... by the way I have natural African American hair, but in the morning when I took out my two strand twists my hair looked dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I used too much product or if my hair wasn&#x27;t wet enough when I put the product in.</li>
            <li> It also has a problem with leaving white residue in your hair so be careful not to put too much.</li>
            <li> I am African American and I wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li> However, if you wet it a little and fluff it some more it&#x27;ll get softer in no time.</li>
            <li> He has slight (oily) waves in the front of his hair and super dry curls in the back.</li>
            <li> I showered as normal and then put about 2 quarter size dollops all throughout my wet hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all, in my opinion, and it is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> If your hair is weighed down you are probably using too much.</li>
            <li> If you put too much, your hair will feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> careful not to use too much or your hear will be as stiff as a board.i guess that would depend on the length of your hear as to how much to use.other then</li>
            <li> Since my hair was a little sticky,  it tangled more often than usual during the day.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it combined with their Moroccan oil or some other gel, but this is my main hair cream.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t let it dry naturally without a ton of products in it.  </li>
            <li> I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> but I like it so far for my dry flaky scalp &amp; product build-up) Step 2</li>
            <li> , I wake up the next morning and it barely looks any different.</li>
            <li> You may feel that it takes a little longer to blow dry your hair, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair you may want to use sparingly, as I can tell this product might be a little heavy or sticky if applied too liberally.  </li>
            <li> And among the other products I tried, the one that came closest was much harder to work into my hair so the results were very</li>
            <li> Sometimes he just wants to tame it a bit.</li>
            <li> The product really helps tame the frizz, and leaves my hair softy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Garnier&#x27;s leave in treatment has become one half of my normal morning treatment.  </li>
            <li> Every other day I put this in my hair after I shower and it feels so soft and moisturizer now</li>
            <li> I have very short, very straight, thick hair</li>
            <li> I usually use conditioner but believe if in a hurry this shampoo is gentle enough to still get the comb through without conditioning.</li>
            <li> Just a few quick mists of water and a little finger combing.</li>
            <li> Just a few quick mists of water and a little finger combing.</li>
            <li> After I saturate my hair with this leave in conditioner, I spray JF Dream curls, and my curls come out really defined with very little frizz.</li>
            <li> I use it with a flat iron and sometimes a curling</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have long bleached blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my color treated hair shiny and keeps away any frizz that keep the ends from laying flat.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty thick</li>
            <li> First of all, the product is thick, so then they say use a \\&quot;quarter size\\&quot; dollop, trust them.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, annoyingly frizzy hair with multiple textures (coils near face, spirals near crown and almost straight near the neck).  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling (and looking) dry, damaged, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> But...if you have to use it to condition your dry tresses daily.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry so flat.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry so flat.</li>
            <li> Love this product - I always use it in the winter to cure any static-y hair from the winter dryness and cold.</li>
            <li> ive used alot of leave in conditioners from expensive to cheap brands (ive bleached my hair n made it purple.</li>
            <li> I had a good wavy grade of hair before I did something really stupid to experiment and dyed + permed my hair 3 consecutive times in a row.</li>
            <li> So in the long run you save money on one product.</li>
            <li> smaller size bottle seems like it will last forever as you only need a few drops or your hair gets greasy.</li>
            <li> you have kids with long hair, get this once</li>
            <li> My hair is color-treated, long and curly/wavy.</li>
            <li> my hair is frizzier and not nearly as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it for my long hair goatee and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not a fan of Garnier shampoo or conditioner, I use this product daily, specifically on my wet curls.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for something to tame my wild, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed that my hair is less oily and has less build up that was caused by normal conditioners.</li>
            <li> I will be a long time subscriber!  </li>
            <li> I tend to use this product as a replacement to gel or mousse, this product gives just enough hold for my hair throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t give the shine or stickiness as other products.</li>
            <li> A must have for my daughter&#x27;s long hair!</li>
            <li> No greasy feeling like other similar products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve told all of my other friends that have similar hair, or have kids with curly hair</li>
            <li> I got this stuff for 2.99 from a local store, and it&#x27;s worked better than some of the expensive leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all day long AND requests for my step-by-step process!</li>
            <li> I have dry hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> I get really dry and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;--Blow dry my hair using paddle brush to about 80% dry</li>
            <li> some experimentation, the way I use this conditioner which works for me is that I just towel dry my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt make my hair feel dry or oily.</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have wavy, dry hair with some frizzy graying bits.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> Then I combed my hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry or tangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 6 year olds hair was so dry.</li>
            <li> I have really dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> : this doesn&#x27;t help much when I want to air-dry my hair, and actually makes my hair feel a bit worse than it would otherwise.</li>
            <li> I use it every single time I wash my hair whether I blow dry it or not.</li>
            <li> It went a little more smoothly on wet hair vs dry, but it was still difficult.  </li>
            <li> I use it every single time after washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have not purchased this from Amazon due to the problems with getting the shampoo and conditioner shipped and having a big mess to deal with, but I do buy this at the local grocery store.  </li>
            <li> ; my wife says that her hair is so soft ; and no many products do that to her hair.</li>
            <li> Mix between spiral and loose curls.</li>
            <li> the Garnier Fructis leave-in conditioner from about the middle of the hair down.</li>
            <li> And to perk it back up, all I do is spray it down with a water bottle and then finger comb it again.</li>
            <li> I am an African American male and I purchased a couple bottles of these during a very slick coupon deal on Amazon almost 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a thick, creamy, luxurious and moisturizing conditioning treatment I now can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> It cleaned my very long hair without that stripped, tangly rough feeling.  </li>
            <li> I still have about  half a bottle left</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on dry hair as well as wet hair.</li>
            <li> I am a male and mostly black.</li>
            <li> It says a quarter sized squeeze, but I use less because my hair is short.</li>
            <li> I got this at target for about $3.75 and you only need a little bit so the bottle has lasted me a very long time.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that a little does go a long way -so if you pile too much on, it may make your hair a little hard.</li>
            <li> I still have a ways to go w/ this mess I made but this product is a big help along the way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While my hair is drying, which usually takes a long, long time, I am constantly flipping my hair over and side to side</li>
            <li> /&gt;While my hair is drying, which usually takes a long, long time, I am constantly flipping my hair over and side to side</li>
            <li> I dye my hair blonde at Aveda and use a round brush blow dry to style.  </li>
            <li> I mix the Garnier Fructis with extra virgin olive oil and a little water (this helps with detangling)</li>
            <li> Try squirting out the tiniest amount possible, rubbing it into your palms a little then running your hands over your ends in sections.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put it in for a little extra hold.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit, and it works well.</li>
            <li> I have badly damaged hair like a bird&#x27;s nest due to frequent hair color, Japanese perm, and hot tools for styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not eye-watering bad, but you&#x27;d expect more of a fruity smell with apricot in the mix.  </li>
            <li> left the leave-in conditioner in my hair for at least ½ hour, washed my hair, and it was softer, smoother, and definitely shinier.  </li>
            <li> and you can feel your hair softening on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Left my hair limp and did not give it a shine.</li>
            <li> use it like gel almost to hold my gray shaggy hair back in a random pattern to hide the thin area on top.  </li>
            <li> I use 2 pumps of the product and distribute it evenly throughout my hair with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> After I wash my hair and comb it through with a wide tooth comb, I add this</li>
            <li> It is excessively curly near my face and tends to frizz if I don&#x27;t weigh it down and condition it liberally with product.</li>
            <li> I have long hair down to my waist which means it gets tangled a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be posting this under the other two products I use in my routine also.for a little extra hold.</li>
            <li> I had been using a dry oil, but needed something to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have a toddler with very curly hair and needless to say the search for a product to help her hair was a long one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting for years to find products that will tame my thick, wavy, frizzy hair, which seems to be getting dryer as I get older</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Does not build up and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> , a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, basically straight hair with a slight wave to it.</li>
            <li> and it turns to a dry, frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> it has been looking totally fried after I wash it and dry it lately.</li>
            <li> every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wanted to find something that would help it do one or the other.  </li>
            <li> Other curly haired girls will probably understand,</li>
            <li> Other curly haired girls will probably understand,</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff instead of gel or other hair products.  </li>
            <li> There are some that complain about the price but a little bit of this product goes a LONG way!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d I use in conjunction with other moisturizers it works well  to keep the frizz at bay</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at any grocery store for a similar price.</li>
            <li> My hair had become extremely damaged from using my straightener, curling iron, and dying it every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> but I just have to give credit where credit is due.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged after I stopped.</li>
            <li> In the past, I would have to rewet daily (which dries the hair out).</li>
            <li> With all the products in my hair, if I didn&#x27;t do this I would have absolutely no body!</li>
            <li> With all the products in my hair, if I didn&#x27;t do this I would have absolutely no body!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be posting this under the other two products I use in my routine also.</li>
            <li> I also use the other products in the Sleek &amp; Shine line.</li>
            <li> Using the leave in every other day makes my hair softer without feeling greasy, and gives me the slightest bit of hold without looking or feeling like gel.  </li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s barely anything in comparison to what I&#x27;m used to, it&#x27;s thick, and keeps spreading out for what seems like forever.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry, which may cause it look a little stringy.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product, my hair was dry and had little shine.</li>
            <li> (nothing really makes them go away entirely except cutting them off).</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that tends to get really dry and straw-like in harsh weather.  </li>
            <li> then I blow dry her hair using a round brush, then flat iron her hair in small sections and her hair is transformed.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this to my damp hair, after I use my Suave Naturals Mango Mandarin Shampoo and Conditioner, or my Suave Naturals Juicy Green Apple Shampoo and Conditioner, and, It makes my already straight, shiny, and thick hair shine like glass, and easier to style and manage.</li>
            <li> Black men usually just opt to chop off the naps and keep it low.</li>
            <li> No fun.  </li>
            <li> my hair is already thick enough</li>
            <li> What I like about this conditioner is that it is thick enough to do</li>
            <li> I usually have a little clip to put my hair half up to get \\&quot;into the thick\\&quot; of the back of the hair.</li>
            <li> use it just on the end of my hair (about from my ears down) after my hair has dried from my shower and before combing through it with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> It helps to lock in moisture without weighing my hair down or making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Cut down SOME frizz?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : weighed hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair is not weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> I turn my head upside down while applying this to get the under side of my hair.</li>
            <li> it settled down, silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product, and all other sleek and shine garnier products, work wonders on curly hair!</li>
            <li> I do admit that I add other products while styling, but what a difference!</li>
            <li> I suppose just use LESS product to cut down on the waxy feel.</li>
            <li> using so much less and paying so much less for the same, if not better results!?</li>
            <li> using so much less and paying so much less for the same, if not better results!?</li>
            <li> For my length hair I use a dime- or nickel-sized dollop, rub it between my hands and then start running my hands through the bottom half of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an odd look.</li>
            <li> and this helps keep it less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it also cost less than chi silk infusion.</li>
            <li> Mind you these were all black products, which never worked for my hair to begin w/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many products over the years, and was about to give in and buy an expensive product (expensive to me is over $15)</li>
            <li> very stiff when it dry .</li>
            <li> I am normally very active</li>
            <li> I hope to someday find my holy grail hair product that will allow me to have frizz free curls till then I will manage :(</li>
            <li> Made my hair go from frizzy mess to sleek defined curls and waves that people can&#x27;t help but want to touch.</li>
            <li> and I normally use expensive salon brands.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that tends to get really dry.  </li>
            <li> And it makes his hair a little shiny.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would be too heavy since it&#x27;s a cream</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now</li>
            <li> I also use it to touch up my tips during the day if they get dried out.</li>
            <li> Oily residue left behind</li>
            <li> so I use conditioner in the shower and then apply this after my hair has dried.</li>
            <li> i blowdried my hair 80% thro , then put this in my hair and dried the rest.</li>
            <li> and I used this after shampooing as my hair air dried.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doenst make your hair heavy at all&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt make it look greasy&lt;</li>
            <li> It tames and smooths my few unruly grays</li>
            <li> It was also kinda heavy and greasy and crunchy in my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday as a leave in conditioner after i co wash my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> When I used this in my hair it just made my hair some-what stiff with no additional shine.</li>
            <li> I use this product to tame my fizzy roots and ends.</li>
            <li> I keep thinking im applying it wrong because every time i used it, my hair gets weighed down, tangled, sticky and definitely not smoother.</li>
            <li> But during that time, I tried other products including my husband&#x27;s Moroccan oil, and other products which cost seriously 10x this product!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I bought this bottle in April and almost August and still have a half of a bottle left!</li>
            <li> Plus, their \\&quot;serving size\\&quot; suggestion of a few small pumps never tamed my mass of frizzy curls, and I&#x27;d end up needing about 20 pumps (no exaggeration) to get the result I needed.</li>
            <li> on the market, and all had made my hair a grimy, greasy, and dull mess.</li>
            <li> Sticky and dried hard</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> There are also NO parabens in this formula which are usually in a lot of hair products (linked to breast cancer).</li>
            <li> I usually like the Garnier products</li>
            <li> bottle is small</li>
            <li> However, when I have this product on hand, I just use a small amount, rub it onto the palms of my hands and distribute it through.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to feel about this product.</li>
            <li> There was no top on this when I received this.</li>
            <li> I usually keep conditioners in my hair longer than the instructed time suggested on the container of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People</li>
            <li> &amp; there&#x27;s no magic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a fan of garnier frutis products, but this one is ...eh..</li>
            <li> Turns out none of them worked and it actually made my hair worse!</li>
            <li> Well I was wrong and after countless trial and error periods</li>
            <li> I put no more than a quarter size amount on my damp hair which is just below my shoulders and that is plenty.</li>
            <li> I usually part my hair how I want it and begin applying Tresemme Climate Control Mousse.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, silky hair, but it has been slightly unhealthy and dry lately, so it gets a little frizzy on the ends during the day.</li>
            <li> had been going along watching it get worse and worse and trying different products that I happened to have in my cabinet.  </li>
            <li> Also makes it stiff as if I had used hairspray!</li>
            <li> (Sorry this is so long!)</li>
            <li> (Sorry this is so long!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find products that my hair likes</li>
            <li> This has a tendency to make my hair hard.</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to manage during and after a wash because it&#x27;s thick and its proned to tangle.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s now).</li>
            <li> but when I do condition, I use Queen Helene Cholesterol Hair Conditioning Cream and leave it in for at least 15-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> Before I review this, let me say how frizzy and thick</li>
            <li> I have thick, chin-length  3a/3b hair that falls in ringlets.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s got thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> My hair gets horribly tangled when its wet so much so that I cant even brush through it</li>
            <li> This stuff is creamy and a bit thick.</li>
            <li> and I do mean touch of coconut oil rubbed though my hair.</li>
            <li> The Moroccan oil just could not cope past lunch time!</li>
            <li> Sorry, but i&#x27;ll stick with Garnier&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> And I mean nothing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> It was  no good.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair that requires a lot of upkeep.</li>
            <li> I use this daily as a base to gel and mouse.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exhausting having curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d go around all day smelling like an apricot, but that goes away a few minutes after it is applied.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it makes my hair frizz even worse</li>
            <li> however i hate the way it feels and makes my hair feel taky when 9i put it in dry..</li>
            <li> Or, I put it in before I blow dry the crap out of my hair.</li>
            <li> This weighed my hair down :(</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spreading it through my hair was so difficult.  </li>
            <li> For me, that makes it useless as a leave-in.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s work, but not too viscous that it&#x27;s difficult to work into hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And that stuff was (it&#x27;s now discontinued) a bottle of chemicals, some of which I&#x27;ve found scary stuff on the Web.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> People even ask if my hair is fake.</li>
            <li> I have thin, wavy hair which can be very difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 3a/3b and it weighed me down so bad!!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s weird!</li>
            <li> The bottle is a bit annoying because you can never get every drop of product out, but like I said, for the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> it is impossible to get a comb through it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is bad too.  </li>
            <li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t too disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!!</li>
            <li> I know, idiot move.</li>
            <li> When I wash it, it sometimes tangles very, very badly.</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> It also helps that the price is insanely affordable.</li>
            <li> I have outrageously frizzy and curly hair.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This might be my 20th bottle of this product. I&#x27;m obsessed!! It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Good low price leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> Works great to detangle and make hair smooth. I have straight, my husband curly hair. Works great on both. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Smells like berries and really gets your hair sleek. Doesn&#x27;t really leave a lot of buildup.</li>
            <li> Although I use a rinse out conditioner every time I shampoo, I have naturally curly hair that tends to get a bit frizzy. Because of that I also use a light application of this leave in conditioner and it helps keep my hair soft and helps tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft and mmm, I love the smell!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is nice. It smells good. It cleaned my very long hair without that stripped, tangly rough feeling.  I usually use conditioner but believe if in a hurry this shampoo is gentle enough to still get the comb through without conditioning. I would recommend this shampoo and am likely to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local Target. This product is very economical. A little bit goes a long way. I still have about  half a bottle left and it&#x27;s been over a year. It is very moisturizing. I&#x27;ve used it on dry hair as well as wet hair. It feels so good when you use it on wet hair because you can really feel how moisturizing it is and you can feel your hair softening on wet hair. The con I would say for me is that something in this product does make my scalp itch shortly after use. I&#x27;m thinking it may be the apricot considering I&#x27;ve never used any hair products with apricot in it. However, it could be something else in this product so I&#x27;m not sure.  If you have a sensitive scalp, then be careful in your decision. Other than minor scalp itching, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get better for the price. ($2.81) This has argan oil in it which is the best for my curly hair. It smells really good too.</li>
            <li> This one bottle has lasted over a year and does a good job of softening up my hair. The product is pretty thick so I don&#x27;t recommend using that much.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the tea tree stuff from Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> Great smell, reduces the frizz, hair not too heavy after applying. Also, cheap.</li>
            <li> this works great in my hair</li>
            <li> I am african american and I have natural 4b shoulder length kinky hair. This product is great at conditioning my hair. I use it almost every day as my moisturizer and seal with any oil or grease. Good stuff will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find products that my hair likes so I&#x27;m completely in love with this leave in conditioner. My hair loves it, it feels super soft and it keeps my hair hydrated which is a major plus for me because my hair drinks water like it&#x27;s nothing. It also smells very nice. I was worried that it would be too heavy since it&#x27;s a cream but it&#x27;s actually pretty light. I hope the continue making it, every time I find a Garnier product I like they stop making it so get it while you can!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and I love it! I use it everytime I get a shower/wash my hair. It leaves my hair smelling amazing until next wash which of course I love! It also leaves my hair soft and shiny as well as keeping my frizz under control. I have also started using this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair it helps to detangle it... I received my shipment on time and paid a reasonable price a lot cheaper then in the stores near me. I will definitely be purchasing this product again through this seller.&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommended this product</li>
            <li> This works great as leave in, and to use to scrunch light waves. Soft and light.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, texture is not too thick, can be used to make a perfectly smooth ponytail with no flyaways, leaves hair feeling wonderful!  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!!  Have use it for years &amp; I am a creature of habit...if it works, why change?  I will be a long time subscriber!  :)</li>
            <li> This conditioner woeks very well. It gives my clients hair life, sleekness, and shine. I love IT !</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair every night after I shower to keep my hair from frizzing when I sleep. In the morning most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to gel my hair because this stays in it well, but doesn&#x27;t get crunchy or sticky like gel. It adds shimmer and makes your hair really soft and doesn&#x27;t leave any build up or residue in my hair. The smell is great and this is really affordable! There are also NO parabens in this formula which are usually in a lot of hair products (linked to breast cancer).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product...The smell is amazing, the consistency is medium. I use it on damp hair, then I seal it with coconut oil. The combination leaves my natural hair soft. I don&#x27;t care for the frizz-control properties...just the conditioning. The seller got it to me on time as well. :)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is great conditioner its my first time buying it and I will definetly buy again. It smells awesome also.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty good in my blonde dry hair . I do prefer a different product over this but this is good as my back up or if I need something cheaper</li>
            <li> My #1 go to product for my naturally curly hair!!</li>
            <li> Good Product, nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> Really helped my two year old&#x27;s curly frizzy hair stay soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Smooth hair and gives a slight shine, but oily look after one day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I used it on my daughter&#x27;s kinky, course hair after shampooing and conditioning with Design Essentials. I mix the Garnier Fructis with extra virgin olive oil and a little water (this helps with detangling) then I blow dry her hair using a round brush, then flat iron her hair in small sections and her hair is transformed. It turned out soft, shiny, smooth and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It&#x27;s pretty much the only thing that helps me with my curls. I have been using it for a few years because nothing else was good enough. This one is pretty good. Sometimes I use it combined with their Moroccan oil or some other gel, but this is my main hair cream. I really hope they never discontinue it!</li>
            <li> This weighed my hair down :( my hair is already thick enough</li>
            <li> I love this leave in-conditioner I will buy again and it smells great too</li>
            <li> Great non heavy leave in conditioner works for my fine hair</li>
            <li> Love the product..very good price</li>
            <li> I use this daily as a base to gel and mouse.  I also use it to touch up my tips during the day if they get dried out.</li>
            <li> Hair feels silkky smooth.</li>
            <li> Works well and I think it smells great.  I don&#x27;t know if I have noticed any permanent change in my hair since using this, but it defiantly helps the frizz and flyalway hair while wearing the product. I have used coconut oil and Aragon oil and while I like using them with this,i think this product works better than they do. Others have complained about the smell being too strong, but I think it is perfect and only lasts a small while.  My hair is extremely damaged from many years of bleaching and coloring and I will continue to buy this product to help the appearance of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who has shortish hair that I usually part to the side, this product works great for me. I tend to use this product as a replacement to gel or mousse, this product gives just enough hold for my hair throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t give the shine or stickiness as other products.</li>
            <li> Works well as a leave in conditioner!  Not greasy, but moisturizes.  Nice smell and great price. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I have very curly hair and I use this along with a heat protection serum whenever I do a blowout. It leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This style conditioner is very good quality, hair wash clean with it, very smooth, after the next time will buy, ha ha</li>
            <li> If you have color treated damaged hair that soaks up all conditioners as soon as you put them on, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;It is a thick, creamy, luxurious and moisturizing conditioning treatment I now can&#x27;t live without.  I dye my hair blonde at Aveda and use a round brush blow dry to style.  I use a lot of leave in products, but by far this one is the best.  It leaves my hair so smooth, sleek, shiny, nourished and without frizz.  It has a light fragrance I don&#x27;t mind at all, it smells natural and goes away.  I use it every single time I wash my hair whether I blow dry it or not.</li>
            <li> I just bought this item and after one use I already notice a difference in my hair. Using this product after I shower not only makes my hair smell extra nice, but it also keeps in extra moisture as it dries.</li>
            <li> Nope. Left my hair limp and did not give it a shine. I will not buy it again. I like the fragrance though, a nice clean smell. Maybe it would work better for thick hair, but if you have fine hair, this is not the best product. I usually like the Garnier products but this one is not a keeper.</li>
            <li> Works great, lasts for most if not a full day.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to biy this at first, but I&#x27;m happy I did! :)  I am African-American with 4a curly hair -- same pattern as Naptural85. And let me just say, my hair absolutely loves this stuff and it has a wonderful smell that lingers. It smells great and leaves my hair soft. I am definitely adding this to my regular routine. :)</li>
            <li> Nice leave it conditioner. Works well with my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this product - I always use it in the winter to cure any static-y hair from the winter dryness and cold. Great price as an add-on item, too!</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Leaves hair very scented but not much softer.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair. It does an ok job but it might be that with fine hair it seems too heavy. I also use a straightening balm so using the both is probably too much for my hair.  As a conditioner it works. For me, instead I use a touch and I do mean touch of coconut oil rubbed though my hair. It gives my hair great condition and shine. [[ASIN:B003B3OOPA Nature&#x27;s Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce]] Great for cooking. Great for skin and hair!! So in the long run you save money on one product.</li>
            <li> Honestly, a much better hand lotion than leave-in hair condioner.</li>
            <li> Smells so good I could eat it. Silky smooth hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting for years to find products that will tame my thick, wavy, frizzy hair, which seems to be getting dryer as I get older (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s now). This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found for the times that I blow-dry my hair. After I use Garnier&#x27;s Triple Nutrition shampoo and conditioner, I wring the water out of my hair and put a bit more than a quarter-sized amount of this product through, focusing more on the ends. I use an old t-shirt to sop up the extra water (towels seem to make my hair more frizzy) and then blow-dry it most of the way.  The only downside: this doesn&#x27;t help much when I want to air-dry my hair, and actually makes my hair feel a bit worse than it would otherwise.</li>
            <li> This product has been the best thing ever for my daughter&#x27;s hair that can get very knotted.  No more knots and so easy to brush through.  Shiny also!!  Just put a dime size amount on your hands and run your hands through your hair and leave it in.  So easy and makes long hair manageable.</li>
            <li> I use this in my type 4 hair and o use this in my son&#x27;s type 2 and 3 hair. He has slight (oily) waves in the front of his hair and super dry curls in the back. I have dry hair everywhere. Lol a little goes a long way with him. I use allot on my hair just to moisturize but it feels good and my hair is happy so I&#x27;m happy !</li>
            <li> The product is good! :)</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> Sticky and dried hard</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  My hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Great product at an inexpensive price. Love that it can be used on dry or damp hair.</li>
            <li> works really well and makes my hair smell awesome</li>
            <li> Did not do a thing for frizz not for me nor my daughter. Not pleased at all was hoping with the great price and decent reviews it would work. On to the next product- it&#x27;s exhausting having curly hair. I hope to someday find my holy grail hair product that will allow me to have frizz free curls till then I will manage :(</li>
            <li> Oily residue left behind</li>
            <li> Caused Massive flaking . Will never buy again</li>
            <li> Big like for my continually tangled hair. I&#x27;ve tried everything.  This is a leave in that also offers shine, much like the Bio-Silk serum, but cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times and the scent is night and there&#x27;s no flaky residue that flies off when you brush it later in the day.  Shine is incredible.  I use it with a flat iron and sometimes a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller size bottle seems like it will last forever as you only need a few drops or your hair gets greasy. Go lightly with this!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite leave-in conditioner. I get really dry and frizzy hair so I use conditioner in the shower and then apply this after my hair has dried. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, in fact it makes it look very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it just on the end of my hair (about from my ears down) after my hair has dried from my shower and before combing through it with a wide tooth comb. This helps reduce damage, breaking, and split ends. I then use a boar bristle brush to smooth out my hair and distribute some of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never looked better, and a lot of it is thanks to this product. It is very affordable and it actually works!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this leave in condition even started my boyfriend to using it. Leaves your hair feeling smooth and smells great. Definitely maintains frizz.</li>
            <li> Ever since we tried it it has become a must have.&lt;br /&gt;We have 2 young daughters and keeping their hair in check is a chore that has been made 100 times easier with this.&lt;br /&gt;it makes their hair much easier to brush, smells good, and keeps the freezies down.&lt;br /&gt;Do you have kids with long hair, get this once and you will buy it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small we have amazon deliver it every other month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I do wish they made different perfume and non perfume versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helped :)&lt;br /&gt;Pablo &amp; Susie</li>
            <li> I love love love this leave in. Best hair product for my hair black African hair. I just condition my hair and it leaves it soft and conditioned for a couple of days. Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> I am always in search of the perfect leave-in conditioner, and Fructis Sleek &amp;amp; Shine Leave-In is one of the best there is. My hair is color-treated, long and curly/wavy. When I wash it, it sometimes tangles very, very badly. However, when I have this product on hand, I just use a small amount, rub it onto the palms of my hands and distribute it through. I can feel the tangles work their way out as I slip my fingers easily through my hair! If I&#x27;ve just color-treated, it will take a bit extra to do the job, but the results are totally amazing. I usually apply it while still standing in the shower, so if I sense that I&#x27;ve used too much, I just quickly give my hair a spray of water, and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a cosmetic and hair-product junkie, so I&#x27;m always looking for something new. But Fructis Sleek &amp;amp; Shine Leave-In is something that I always find myself going back to again and again.</li>
            <li> I love this product I always buy this.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this from Amazon due to the problems with getting the shampoo and conditioner shipped and having a big mess to deal with, but I do buy this at the local grocery store.  This, along with the other sleek and shine products, are the only thing I have found that work well with my super curly hair in very humid SE Texas.  This stuff is like gold to me!  Love it.  Super pretty ringlets and very little frizz!</li>
            <li> great leave in contioner thx deb</li>
            <li> This is awesome. Arrived in good packaging. Works very well for my dry curly frizzy hair. Love the scent of it, it smells fresh and lovely. Creamy consistency which I like and easy to apply on the hair, not sticky. Leaves my hair soft, hydrated, moisturize and smells great. Works perfectly for my hair, last all day. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair that won&#x27;t curl or hang straight.  I just wanted to find something that would help it do one or the other.  The only upside of this stuff is that it helps get the comb through after a shower.  Beyond that, it does nothing.  I&#x27;ve used increasing amounts on the ends and over multiple days.  My hair remains impervious to its influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;Sigh&lt;&lt; Save your $$$ for a better product.</li>
            <li> My hair is 2A/2B so a leave-in is essential to my hair regimen.  I had high hopes for this product,  but it didn&#x27;t go so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spreading it through my hair was so difficult.  It felt like I was using glue or something.  It also made my hair very sticky, which makes it more difficult to detangle.  For me, that makes it useless as a leave-in.  It went a little more smoothly on wet hair vs dry, but it was still difficult.  Since my hair was a little sticky,  it tangled more often than usual during the day.  I thought I had used too much at first, but I worked pea size amounts into 1 inch sections.  I doubt that&#x27;s the issue.  The smell is bad too.  It&#x27;s not eye-watering bad, but you&#x27;d expect more of a fruity smell with apricot in the mix.  This had more of a chemically smell than apricot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some good things though.  It did deliver on the frizz aspect, just as the label claimed.  My hair was noticably sleeker at the ends and crown, which is where I have my biggest frizz issues.  You also get a lot in the bottle, so it&#x27;ll last you a good while.  For me though, the search continues.</li>
            <li> Before I review this, let me say how frizzy and thick my curls are. I have lots of fine ringlets and waves, and they get greasy quickly so I was hesitant to add more conditioner after a shower. I got this on sale at Wegmans for $2.49 and I have always loved Garnier products. I showered as normal and then put about 2 quarter size dollops all throughout my wet hair. I was taken back how silky, shiny, and frizz free my hair was for once! It was never like this. I just feel like my hair is healthier and stronger, and my hair stylist comments on how he recommends this product to his clients now. Even my mom stole it so I had to buy another one, hah/&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> great product! i have 2 young daughters and they love it. it takes care of the hair knots and i don;t have to worry abut them rinsing regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have always loved it. Keeps my hair smooth and keeps it from drying out all day. It&#x27;s a great product and doesn&#x27;t give me any extra buildup.</li>
            <li> Best price! I am absolutely brand loyal to this cream!</li>
            <li> I can tell when I forget to use it...my hair is frizzier and not nearly as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair:&lt;br /&gt;--Me and Miss Clairol are BFFs...coloring for years about every 6-8 weeks&lt;br /&gt;--Below the shoulder length, thick, fine hair. Wavy when shorter. Tends to frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;--Shampoo and conditioner three times a week. Shampoo and conditioner vary - but are often a Dove shampoo and a L&#x27;Oreal color-treated conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;--Apply the Garnier Fructis leave-in conditioner from about the middle of the hair down. Work it through with fingers. Let it sit about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;--Use a paddle brush to gently brush out the hair and distribute the conditioner from root to tip.&lt;br /&gt;--Blow dry my hair using paddle brush to about 80% dry&lt;br /&gt;--Use my new favorite Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler I straighten and curl at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this conditioner for years. Does not build up and a little goes a long way. For my length hair I use a dime- or nickel-sized dollop, rub it between my hands and then start running my hands through the bottom half of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff</li>
            <li> After reading a bunch of reviews, I ended up picking some of this up at the drug store for about $4. I was previously using the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Balm, and while it worked great, at about $18 a bottle, I would wear my hair in a bun more often to save the dough. Plus, their \\&quot;serving size\\&quot; suggestion of a few small pumps never tamed my mass of frizzy curls, and I&#x27;d end up needing about 20 pumps (no exaggeration) to get the result I needed. (That being said, it worked amazingly, but you can imagine I needed a lot of it, hence it was a bit of an expense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical of the Garnier, but I use their shampoo and conditioner in the shower, and I like it. But $4 a bottle? I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. WRONG! First of all, the product is thick, so then they say use a \\&quot;quarter size\\&quot; dollop, trust them. For as much hair as I have, I slightly double. Still, it&#x27;s barely anything in comparison to what I&#x27;m used to, it&#x27;s thick, and keeps spreading out for what seems like forever. I just keep finger combing it through my hair, and it coats it all evenly without making it heavy, or drying crunchy or sticky (make sure to apply it while your hair is slightly damp, then let it air dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finger-combing it really makes the difference too...I used to try and use a brush to move products through, but all that did was make my hair stick close to my head on top and then fall in thick ringlets toward the bottom...it&#x27;s an odd look. The fuller body and more natural look comes when you keep using your hands to make sure you&#x27;re moving the conditioner through. It adds volume and separates the curls and prevents frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this conditioner makes all the difference. I get so many more compliments on my hair now, and the best part is, even when I sleep on it, I wake up the next morning and it barely looks any different. And to perk it back up, all I do is spray it down with a water bottle and then finger comb it again. The conditioner is thick, so unless you&#x27;re going to wash it OUT of your hair, don&#x27;t add any more on day 2. I can get away with skipping a day of washing my hair if I just re-wet it and smooth it out again. As a girl with curly hair...I can actually REDO MY HAIR WITHOUT REWASHING IT. Just a few quick mists of water and a little finger combing. Other curly haired girls will probably understand, when I did that for the first time and it worked, it was like I could hear angels singing ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going back to $20 a bottle. I can&#x27;t believe how much more I&#x27;m getting out of this stuff...using so much less and paying so much less for the same, if not better results!? Thanks Garnier!you&#x27;re going to wash it OUT of your hair, don&#x27;t add any more on day 2. I can get away with skipping a day of washing my hair if I just re-wet it and smooth it out again.

            <li> I have curly, frizzy ringlets. This leave-in conditioner helps manage my frizz so that I can leave the house! What I like about this conditioner is that it is thick enough to do it&#x27;s work, but not too viscous that it&#x27;s difficult to work into hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while I couldn&#x27;t find this creme anywhere, I think it had gone on sale and sold out in a flash and stores were not restocking fast enough! (I&#x27;ve only just seen this available on Amazon for $4 which is a non-sale price.)  But during that time, I tried other products including my husband&#x27;s Moroccan oil, and other products which cost seriously 10x this product! The Moroccan oil just could not cope past lunch time! And among the other products I tried, the one that came closest was much harder to work into my hair so the results were very uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some experimentation, the way I use this conditioner which works for me is that I just towel dry my hair after a shower. I then work it into my hair until I feel a tiny bit in all of my hair. This requires more than the quarter size they recommend (maybe two quarters) for my shoulder blades-length hair. I let it air dry, which may cause it look a little stringy. I then gently run my fingers through the top of my hair once or twice to smooth it out, and I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this conditioner! Recommended it to all of my family, but they couldn&#x27;t believe it was so good because how affordable it was.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, basically straight hair with a slight wave to it. This product works REALLY well to smooth out my tangles! I&#x27;m not sure if it will work for you if the texture of your hair is more fine. But perfect for us girls with super thick hair!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It smells great, leaves my kinky hair feeling softer and manageable. Good for all hair types</li>
            <li> It really does good in my hair, get rid of frizz and makes it nice and shiney, I love it !!!</li>
            <li> exactly as described, arrived on time, great price!</li>
            <li> GREAT conditioner!!! It managed my frizzy curly hair leaving them manageable and beautiful! I have been receiving many compliments since then 😊💆</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, it keeps my curls in tact and shiny and yes, less frizzy..&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth without all the frizz.</li>
            <li> Smells really good. I use it for my long hair goatee and it does the job. Leaves it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my hair &amp; I don&#x27;t even have great hair</li>
            <li> This product makes my usually dry, brittle hair super soft throughout the day.  It is great and I will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li> Will buy thus products in store now.</li>
            <li> I have thick, chin-length  3a/3b hair that falls in ringlets. This didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture for my hair, even when I tried using a palm full of product. It left my hair feeling (and looking) dry, damaged, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Really does help with tangled hair! My hair is damaged by all the bleach from highlights and this conditioner makes it easy to comb thru my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully well. I always use a very generous amount of this product and it leaves my hair so soft and shinny. For the price and the amount u get this product is one the best.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years! It is an amazing product. It works great for detangling hair, as my hair can get pretty tangly. You can honestly see a difference in your hair. It leaves hair very soft and smooth, and controls frizz. It also enhances natural waves and curls. A little goes a long way, and you cant beat the price! 10 oz for $3? Yes please!</li>
            <li> I used it for 1 week . it feels like i  have wax on my hair . very stiff when it dry .</li>
            <li> Love this hair product!</li>
            <li> I love Garnier products but the sleek and shine ones are too intense for my hair.  Totally flattened my hair - had no body.  Sorry, but i&#x27;ll stick with Garnier&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product. My husband uses it more than I do believe it or not.  He enjoys the scent and how it smooths his hair out!</li>
            <li> Good for curly hair and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> A must have for my daughter&#x27;s long hair!</li>
            <li> Awesome, one of Garnier&#x27;s best products, detangles my thin long hair like no other product and it won&#x27;t make it sticky or greasy, while leaving my hair super silky and shiny, best ever!</li>
            <li> I use this every other day to detangle and condition my hair after showering and I love it. I&#x27;m able to use a bunch on fine hair and not have it feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner works well and smells so nice.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and a very sensitive scalp. This product is perfect for my hair. It keeps my curls in place and it keeps them very soft to the touch. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> I am an African American male and I purchased a couple bottles of these during a very slick coupon deal on Amazon almost 6 months ago. Having naturally dry, frizzy hair is something that most if not all black people have to live with. Black men usually just opt to chop off the naps and keep it low. I was in that same bubble until I actually tried this leave-in conditioner. I&#x27;ve since purchased enough for a 2 year supply and am continuing to let my hair grow out. This product really has been a solution to a problem that I did not realize I had until I tried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to feel about this product. I really wanted it to work for me: it smells so good, but it didn&#x27;t help define my curls at all. It actually made my hair frizzier than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, beware of using this product too frequently: it causes a lot of build-up on my hair and had to use clarifying products multiple times to make my hair feel normal again.</li>
            <li> This product, and all other sleek and shine garnier products, work wonders on curly hair! I use this product to tame my fizzy roots and ends. My curls go frizz free almost every time I use this product</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. A miracle for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have short color treated hair .and this works well it leaves my hair soft and shiny. a little goes a long way and I like the apple scent it has never left my hair greasy ,waxy or sticky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about this product. I used it as I would normally use a leave in... by the way I have natural African American hair, but in the morning when I took out my two strand twists my hair looked dry and frizzy I don&#x27;t know if I used too much product or if my hair wasn&#x27;t wet enough when I put the product in. Personally I like Giovanni leave in but I will give this product one more try because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> getting raves from all the friends at school...it does what it says it will do..a good buy! Try it, on your own hair!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how to use a leave in conditioner in the past, but due to experience I am better with it.  Great conditioner and great cost.</li>
            <li> It works great. No complaints</li>
            <li> just bought this from target cuz they were giving away gift cards if i buy 4 things. well this was like 2.99 so i thought id give it a try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its actually pretty good. ive used alot of leave in conditioners from expensive to cheap brands (ive bleached my hair n made it purple. so my hair is not in very good condition) . this actually passed my expectation for something this inexpensive. i blowdried my hair 80% thro , then put this in my hair and dried the rest. and my hair is pretty silky and shinny in a non-weird sticky way. and it doesnt build up like some of the hair product. id totally buy it again n ditch the higher end leave in conditioners. and this smells pretty nice too.</li>
            <li> I love Garnier products and this is no exception. I gave it 4 stars because the alcohol in it dries out my humid weather curls in Summer  &#x3D;  frizz. However I use this in the Winter with great results for my fine-med/layered/wavy-curly hair.</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff instead of gel or other hair products.  I put it in after a shower and comb.  Hair stays in place all day; and, it&#x27;s good for your hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son and he says it works really well. He&#x27;s got thick curly hair. Sometimes he just wants to tame it a bit. And it makes his hair a little shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a great product ... I especially like it because not every product works with my hair (very fussy)... I have straight hair and have had to use styling gels that would stiffen to keep my hair styled properly... Also, most styling gels are do not nourish hair/scalp.. Hence, I was really happy to have tried this product on because not only is it &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; &amp; natural, it also does a pretty good job of holding my hair in place while imparting flexibility &amp; softness (does not make it rigid)...&lt;br /&gt;Also, a little amount (pea-size) is good enough for me coz I have short hair... this allows one bottle to last upto a year for me!!&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, I have noticed a marked improvement in the smoothness &amp; shine of my hair since I have started using it... definitely a must-buy</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft!  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I use this in place of regular conditioner now. I put it in immediately after my shower and then brush my hair out. I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of conditioners my whole life but this works wonders for my hair. It makes my hair so soft. My hair stays straight and doesn&#x27;t get frizzy even in humidity! I also have noticed that my hair is less oily and has less build up that was caused by normal conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have a toddler with very curly hair and needless to say the search for a product to help her hair was a long one.  This product is wonderful!  After she gets out of the tub even with the best &amp;#34;kids&amp;#34; hair products out there it is impossible to get a comb through it.  Then I tried this product and I have been hooked ever since.  There are some that complain about the price but a little bit of this product goes a LONG way!  Not only does it help detangle her unruley hair but also leaves soft, shiny and beautiful curls.  When the price is around $2 on here it&#x27;s a super great deal to purchase on here.  However, many times you can keep your eyes open in the Sunday paper for coupons occasionally and use it with a sale that can be sometimes found at Walmart or CVS.  Occasionally, even amazon posts a coupon you can use and take advantage of like I did when I purchased this product!  Needless to say I bought this bottle in April and almost August and still have a half of a bottle left!</li>
            <li> Excelent for curly hair</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smell so good and smooth</li>
            <li> I use this every day! Great for thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> This is a conditioner that don&#x27;t wash out, so it continues to protect your throughout the day! Great smell, and long lasting. Great price &amp; Quality!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. It leaves hair very smooth, and manageable. Side note if you apply too much it will have a hairspray sort of side effect.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair and i use this along with a finishing spray. My hair looks nice and shiny. Its not a heavy leave in and it doesnt make my hair feel dry or oily.</li>
            <li> I like how this product keeps my hair soft, but it also irritates my hands when I rub it into my fingers before I distribute it into my hair. It also has a problem with leaving white residue in your hair so be careful not to put too much.</li>
            <li> this is ok and does hydrate my hair however i hate the way it feels and makes my hair feel taky when 9i put it in dry..maybe its just me but it doesnt  go good with my hair..its not horrible though</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. I have thick, wavy hair so i would need to apply more than a quarter size of the product on my hair. I have noticed that my hair is more smoother.</li>
            <li> Great product love the scent</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly hair and I used this after shampooing as my hair air dried.  It was good until I brushed through it.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, dry hair with some frizzy graying bits. This leave in conditioner reduces frizz and makes my hair super soft without weighing it down or making it greasy. Love it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much difference this made on my hair til I went without it.  It is amazing what it can do to smooth your hair down, without the weight of dragging it down.  I will be using this forever, or until they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  The leave in conditioner really works.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. I have dry hair and this helps keep it less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great</li>
            <li> i had damage hair then i started using the Garnier Fructis products later i baught the leave in conditioner and i love love it. It makes my hair look healthy and it smells good. This is my favorite product and my hair is starting to fix up :) not only this but every other Garnier item &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> There was no top on this when I received this. It was all over the plastic casing when it was delivered</li>
            <li> Great product for super curly hair!</li>
            <li> This product really does smooth your hair and leaves it frizz free and soft and light. No greasy feeling like other similar products. Plus it smells soo good. Would definitely recommend to anyone with hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Best leave in conditioner!</li>
            <li> after my daughter&#x27;s bath, I put this on my hands and comb it through her damp hair. in the morning, i can brush her hair so much easier than before i used this conditioner. it&#x27;s a great price and it makes it possible to brush her hair without tears.</li>
            <li> was nice on my extensions but not on my natural hair</li>
            <li> OMG, FINALLY!!!! I received this wonderful product that was referred to me by friends/family members for fizz control, smoothness, and shine for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth Leave-In Conditioning is superb.  After hearing the entire “rave” about this product from friends/family, I decided to purchase this product through the Add-On Item option on the Amazon website.  As soon as I received this product, I put the leave-in conditioner in my hair, I could feel my scalp and hair being sensitively treated from scalp to roots, it makes your hair feel softer while you are processing this leave-in conditioner in your hair.  I usually keep conditioners in my hair longer than the instructed time suggested on the container of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are excited about the Argan oil from Morocco products for their hair regimen treatment.  I have been using products with the Argan oil from Morocco since I first heard about this amazing ingredient for beaut y enhancement, (hair/face/skin), and I can state I have seen a great difference using these products.  The oil is highly recommended, and I have seen a difference in my hair since using products with these oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the leave-in conditioner in my hair for at least ½ hour, washed my hair, and it was softer, smoother, and definitely shinier.  After drying my hair it was manageable enough for me to either curl or leave straight.  The Seller has described this product accurately.  The product states that it controls frizzy, unmanageable hair, I would agree based on my results.  I love the fact that it includes the accented Argan Oil from Morocco and Apricot oil, and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was HIGHLY impressed with the packaging/securing the product, and the SUPER FAST DELIVERY service.  I would recommend this product to others, as well as Amazon Customers.  I definitely will re-order this product again.  I will also let my family know how thankful I am that they referred this wonderful product to me, and I finally tried the product, am very satisfied/happy with the results.  This product has shown me the results that I am looking for in my hair regimen.  Thanks Seller for a great product, and Amazon for excellent service regarding this product/order.  A Happy and Appreciative Amazon Customerthis wonderful product to me, and I finally tried the product, am very satisfied/happy with the results.

            <li> Very good product; my wife says that her hair is so soft ; and no many products do that to her hair.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to say about this stuff?!? It&#x27;s amazing! I have thick wavy hair that tends to get really dry.  Add humidity and it poofs up like a sponge.  No fun.  I used this back when the old formula was around and this formula is so much better.  It leaves my hair so smooth and soft regardless if I straighten or keep it natural.  I also do a cocktail with the Sleek and Shine Serum which keeps the frizzies at bay as well.  Beware though: only use about a nickel size amount because too much of good product can be overwhelming (is that with every product though?).  Also use it towards the ends of your hair as it will probably leave your scalp greasy...it is a leave in conditioner, after all! If you have a natural wave to your hair all you have to do is just scrunch your hair with the product BUT DON&#x27;T OVERDO it or else it can become crunchy...like using mousse.  If that happens just scrunch it again and it will become smooth and pretty.  Overall a great buy for $3.00!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair down to my waist which means it gets tangled a lot. After using this leave-in,  my hair is soft, healthier and more manageable. I use it every single time after washing my hair.  It smells so very good! I am so glad I found this treatment and honestly do not want to be without it. Would recommend this product to everyone who wants beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> This has a tendency to make my hair hard. I&#x27;d I use in conjunction with other moisturizers it works well  to keep the frizz at bay</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product in 2010 &amp; immediately fell in love. I have thin, wavy hair which can be very difficult to manage. I apply it right after I shower. It states to use a quarter size amount but I use enough all over especially on the tips, but never, ever on my scalp. Then I go upon my regular routine of styling: gel &amp; hair spray. But ever since I began using this product I have noticed healthier looking hair, I get lots of compliments on how good my hair looks &amp; on how good it smells. I always recommend it. It did not get a 5- star bc it does what It&#x27;s suppose to do &amp; there&#x27;s no magic Wow! OMG! Factor. By the way, I once tried Nexxus leave-in &amp; bowed to never replace my garnier again. It was  no good.</li>
            <li> makes my hair so much easier to comb out, gives it a healthy shine and helps hydrate it in dry, hot california. Would defiantly order this again and again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doenst make your hair heavy at all&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt make it look greasy&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates really well&lt;br /&gt;etc</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, annoyingly frizzy hair with multiple textures (coils near face, spirals near crown and almost straight near the neck).  It is excessively curly near my face and tends to frizz if I don&#x27;t weigh it down and condition it liberally with product. I can&#x27;t let it dry naturally without a ton of products in it.  For years, I have gone through so many bottles of leave-in conditioners trying to find a perfect product--from the exorbitantly priced to the humblest $2.50/bottle.  I can honestly say price doesn&#x27;t always mean the product will be effective.  My routine is to wash my hair with Redken All Soft shampoo, deep condition with Redken Color Extend, rinse and apply Frizz ease serum to damp hair.  Next, after squeezing as much excess moisture out as possible, I apply a leave-in conditioner followed by Tresemme mousse for curly hair.  I let it dry naturally.  The Fructis leave-in smelled pleasant and it made my curls very springy, soft and defined.  If you have fine hair you may want to use sparingly, as I can tell this product might be a little heavy or sticky if applied too liberally.  For my hair type, it works perfectly. I haven&#x27;t used this to try a straight style yet, but will update my review once I do so.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it makes my hair very soft and moisturized! It smells soooooo good to me! I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This product detangles and moisturizes my hair well, smells amazing, and has no parabens, which is a plus. At three bucks, I will be picking up more.</li>
            <li> Simply did not work for me. Did nothing. No frizz control. Not softer. NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair that requires a lot of upkeep. I was spending a fortune on salon quality leave-in conditioners and curl cream when I stumbled upon this product. Although I&#x27;m not a fan of Garnier shampoo or conditioner, I use this product daily, specifically on my wet curls. It keeps them soft and smooth and it does a great job at managing my frizz.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely., and it&#x27;s a great leave in.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I use it for my dry ends to add a bit of moisture and a pleasant scent to my hair. I don&#x27;t overload it as it can get greasy and I don&#x27;t like a lot of product in my hair, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years for my curly hair and as a detangler for my daughter&#x27;s straight hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biracial and have super curly hair. This is the only product I use on my hair now because it keeps my curls from getting frizzy. I&#x27;ve told all of my other friends that have similar hair, or have kids with curly hair and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this leave in conditioner for my dry, curly hair. It helps to lock in moisture without weighing my hair down or making it look greasy. Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at any grocery store for a similar price. This stuff is amazing! Better than any gel or mousse I&#x27;ve ever used, and is a great leave-in conditioner and styling product. Better than even super expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters&#x27; hair and it works really well. Like Billy Madison said, &amp;#34;Smooth and silky.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works well for beards and mustaches too.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for the price. It tames and smooths my few unruly grays and it smells great. I just purchased another bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a fan of garnier frutis products, but this one is ...eh..&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly hair. Mix between spiral and loose curls. Can be VERY frizzy and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: smells freaking AWESOME. Leaves hair smelling good Till next wash. Cheap. You get a lot of product. Cut down SOME frizz?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: weighed hair down. Made hair feel waxy. Didn&#x27;t really notice any SLEEKness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall. Didn&#x27;t like this product. Didn&#x27;t do what it said and left my hair feeling waxy and gross.&lt;br /&gt;Very light frizz control. Looks better than going without ANYTHING, but didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;However, I will use this up because it smells amazing. I suppose just use LESS product to cut down on the waxy feel.</li>
            <li> smells good, does what&#x27;s supposed to do, buy nothing special</li>
            <li> I bought this from Target and I have to say granier products work. My hair is hard to manage during and after a wash because it&#x27;s thick and its proned to tangle. But this manages to untangle it after all. I recommend using it on wet hair for best results.</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell amazing but the product is great! I have been using this for years. It&#x27;s great to apply before the beach or pool because it won&#x27;t make your hair dry or hard. I always keep it in my beach bag</li>
            <li> ok, thought it would make my hair a lot softer</li>
            <li> Works great on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, but leaves my hair kind of greasy with build-up if I use it too many days in a row</li>
            <li> Prior to using this I was using \\&quot;Mixed chicks\\&quot; leave in conditioner that went for $40+ a bottle (same size as this one) and it just got to be too much. A friend of mine has hair very similar to mine (biracial, curly/wavy and super frizzified) and his hair started to look AMAZING one day. Asked him what he used and he said this, so I finally tried it and OH MY GOD, I love it. Made my hair go from frizzy mess to sleek defined curls and waves that people can&#x27;t help but want to touch. It also helps that the price is insanely affordable. I use the sleek &amp; shine conditioner as well, with tresemme flawless curls shampoo. Best hair care routine I&#x27;ve had my whole life.</li>
            <li> This cream is almost the only thing that can make my hair lay right. It also, makes my hair silky, manageable, and smooth. Plus I like the scent.</li>
            <li> My hair had become extremely damaged from using my straightener, curling iron, and dying it every couple of weeks. It was breaking and thinning, I had to cut a good portion of it off. I decided that I wasn&#x27;t going to let that happen again, so I set out to find good products to prevent the damage from happening. This product has been one of my favorites. I use it after every shower and it leaves my hair smelling good, and I have noticed an incredible change in my hair. It&#x27;s shinier, easier to deal with, but most importantly--healthier. The price is incredible and the bottle has lasted me a long time, it&#x27;s still pretty full even after two months of using it almost daily. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, at least give it a try, I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 years now and I love it!</li>
            <li> Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Leave-in Conditioner is AMMMMMAAAZZZINGG!!! Everything from the wonderful smell, to the how soft and smooth it makes my hair look after I done washing it is is just amazing. I just recently also purchased chi silk infusion which is another leave in conditioner/ heat protector and comparing them both I actually perfer the Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Leave-in conditioner better. Not to mention it also cost less than chi silk infusion. If i could give this product 50 stars I would. I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> So I never write reviews but I just have to give credit where credit is due. I am a male and mostly black. Long story short I had a good wavy grade of hair before I did something really stupid to experiment and dyed + permed my hair 3 consecutive times in a row. I know, idiot move. My hair was extremely damaged after I stopped. I had previously used this product before the catastrophe and it worked amazing but I had switched to another product shortly before I did the unthinkable that worked good as well. With extremely damaged hair I went to the store and decided to buy all these hair products, top brands and not so top brands that claimed to repair damaged hair. Turns out none of them worked and it actually made my hair worse! Mind you these were all black products, which never worked for my hair to begin w/ anyway but I figured since I was mostly black and the texture of my hair had totally changed those products were ideal. Well I was wrong and after countless trial and error periods I decided to pull the product that I first started with out again. After co-washing my hair I put this baby in and my hair become instantaniously soft and moisturized again! I still have a ways to go w/ this mess I made but this product is a big help along the way. I&#x27;ll never swotch to another hair moisturizer again. Best part is it&#x27;s cheap for college students like me! For some guys the smell might be a lil on the fem side but this stuff does the job. Please don&#x27;t ever change or discontinue this product garnier me and others love it! :))</li>
            <li> This is much better than my $20 Nexus Headdress leave-in.  And that stuff was (it&#x27;s now discontinued) a bottle of chemicals, some of which I&#x27;ve found scary stuff on the Web.  The Fructis is 100% natural, based on apricots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it like gel almost to hold my gray shaggy hair back in a random pattern to hide the thin area on top.  It washes out very easily. I was afraid I&#x27;d go around all day smelling like an apricot, but that goes away a few minutes after it is applied.</li>
            <li> I shampooed and conditioned my hair as usual, rinsing with cool water. While my hair was still damp I put a very small amount on my hair in sections trying to get it mostly on the damaged ends. Then I combed my hair and let it air dry. After it dried I combed it again and my hair is very smooth and shiny. The damaged ends look as good as can be expected (nothing really makes them go away entirely except cutting them off). My hair is not weighed down at all. If your hair is weighed down you are probably using too much. Try squirting out the tiniest amount possible, rubbing it into your palms a little then running your hands over your ends in sections. Most people are probably not going to need to put this on their roots. The smell is very pleasant and faded for me rather quickly. To the person who said the smell was overpowering you used too much and or didn&#x27;t let it dry. Great product for damaged/dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I first found out about this product when one of my friends brought it to a pool party and told me she used it on her hair after she got out of the pool to make it smooth and untangle it. My hair gets horribly tangled when its wet so much so that I cant even brush through it but this product changed that. I put this on my hair after swimming and it felt like I Just got out of the shower and it smells so good and makes my hair feel soft and smooth. I use it after swimming or the beach after getting out of the water and sometimes after I shower just because i love how soft it makes my hair feel. I got this at target for about $3.75 and you only need a little bit so the bottle has lasted me a very long time. It is well worth the price and much better quality than I thought for a product thats so cheap!</li>
            <li> Have kids with curls? Buy this! I bought this to use on my niece who is two and has no patience for rinsing out shampoo  AND conditioner but her super curly hair needs conditioning. This is perfect. Now it is used on all of the kids. Fine, thick, thin, course, long and short all of their hair types look fabulous with this quick, simple conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have fine, course hair which I color, so once humidity strikes, it immediately looks bushy and frizzy. I have tried so many serums and  creams to keep the frizz away, but nothing has worked quite like this!! I recently heard on Dr. Oz that women with fine, course hair should use a product that has water listed as the first ingredient which is why I bought this leave-in conditioner. I put no more than a quarter size amount on my damp hair which is just below my shoulders and that is plenty. You may feel that it takes a little longer to blow dry your hair, but it&#x27;s worth it. If you put too much, your hair will feel weighed down. I&#x27;m happy to be going into the humid, hot summers of the North East knowing that I won&#x27;t have bad hair day every day. Great product!</li>
            <li> Good conditioner, good for dry hair. Be careful not to add too much or your hair can get greasy. Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well in my hair.</li>
            <li> Well I found two bottles of this stuff in my hair cabinet, so I tried it out. In my opinion, this would be better for very thick 4a/4c hair types. I&#x27;m 3a/3b and it weighed me down so bad!! It was also kinda heavy and greasy and crunchy in my hair. It didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped. I actually put some of this and Moroccan oil in my hair after showering and went to the movies with my friend. About halfway through the movie I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. My hair was NOT defined at all. I looked like a fur ball, LOL. So yeah, but to each her own.</li>
            <li> OMG such a fantastic product keeps hair smooth, silky and shinny!</li>
            <li> This is our new must have for hair that is always tangled... hair dries nice; no greasy feel or look. Love this!</li>
            <li> I bought this product years ago and I was unsure of why I stopped using it. Now, I know why since I repurchased it a month passed. This stuff is creamy and a bit thick. It smell sweet like fruit. But...if you have to use it to condition your dry tresses daily. It will cause build up because amodimethicone is placed high in the product&#x27;s ingredients. Which is understandable, since the leave in was designed to keep hair frizz free and fight against humidity. However, I thought it was light enough to use each day, but it&#x27;s suppose to be used every 3 days. Indeed, it kept my damaged hair smooth, but when I tried to cleanse it from my healthy transitioning hairs it was difficult to remove. I wash my hair 1 x a week and this stuff made my hair gunky. I recommend you use a strong neutralizing shampoo to get it out of your hair. My clarifying shampoo could not get this stuff out. I won&#x27;t use this unless I need it for straight styles or to condition extensions.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look really greasy! Also makes it stiff as if I had used hairspray!</li>
            <li> It does allow hair to be manageable, but I do not like the way that it still feels like I have still conditioner in my hair that needs rinsed out.  I will not be buying this  product again.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff for 2.99 from a local store, and it&#x27;s worked better than some of the expensive leave in conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;ve got curly hair that&#x27;s slightly coarse and very frizzy. After I saturate my hair with this leave in conditioner, I spray JF Dream curls, and my curls come out really defined with very little frizz. Try it. It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> What an awesome product! I have spent YEARS looking for the right leave-in conditioner. I do admit that I add other products while styling, but what a difference! I get compliments all day long AND requests for my step-by-step process! I&#x27;m African American and Capeverdean (mixture of African and Portuguese). My hair is very curly and soft...like ringlets. This conditioner, along with my gel of choice, sets my curls for 3-5 days without having to REAPLY! I just make sure to put my hair up at night, awake...then shake...viola!!! It&#x27;s done! I&#x27;ve never been able to do this! In the past, I would have to rewet daily (which dries the hair out). My only complaint: I wish there were more in the bottle!</li>
            <li> I have this on subscribe and save. Great price and works awesome. My daughter and I swim and we comb this in and leave it in. This is a permanent staple item for us</li>
            <li> Great when used with the same shampoo, which I do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go a day without this conditioner! My whole life I&#x27;ve been stopped by women with curly hair (and without) to ask what I do to my hair to get it frizz free and defined.  I am always happy to help out a stranger with curls because I know what it&#x27;s like to cry with frustration over hair with a mind of its own! I haven&#x27;t cried once since I discovered mousse! But since then I&#x27;ve found an easy routine that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curls always will have a mind of their own, you can only do so much! Here is my routine for anyone who liked my photos I submitted and wants to give it a shot. Step 1: I use Suave Mint &amp; Eucalyptus anti-dandruff shampoo (this is new but I like it so far for my dry flaky scalp &amp; product build-up) Step 2: I condition my hair most days but sometimes it makes my hair frizz even worse (I really don&#x27;t understand this) but when I do condition, I use Queen Helene Cholesterol Hair Conditioning Cream and leave it in for at least 15-30 minutes.  Step 3: Do not comb, brush, vigorously towel-dry or blow-dry hair at any point! When hair is very damp, apply Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine leave-in conditioner very liberally and evenly. Try to focus on ends and the back of the head. I turn my head upside down while applying this to get the under side of my hair. I usually have a little clip to put my hair half up to get \\&quot;into the thick\\&quot; of the back of the hair. Step 4: I usually part my hair how I want it and begin applying Tresemme Climate Control Mousse. This mousse is not bad about getting hard and flaky, just be sure to apply it evenly, with only a small portion in your hands at a time. At this point I am still \\&quot;shaping my hair\\&quot; which means I can run my fingers through my hair to distribute product.  Step 4: I usually wait until my hair is slightly more dry (about and hour later) and then I will apply Big Sexy Hair Root Pump or Root Pump Plus (same thing). Some days I don&#x27;t need the Big Sexy Hair but if it&#x27;s going to be humid (all bets are off) I&#x27;ll put it in for a little extra hold. I go pretty easy on this stuff as it provides the strongest hold of all these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hair is drying, which usually takes a long, long time, I am constantly flipping my hair over and side to side so it doesn&#x27;t dry so flat. With all the products in my hair, if I didn&#x27;t do this I would have absolutely no body! So flip and scrunch and try to get some air-flow to your scalp. If you have thick curly hair and want to try this, I say good luck! But everyone&#x27;s hair is different, I just put this out there to try and help and give you some ideas. (Sorry this is so long!) I&#x27;ll be posting this under the other two products I use in my routine also.for a little extra hold.

            <li> Okay, for one, it makes your hair look and feel so smooth and silky!  A+ just for that, but that&#x27;s not all.  You can actually style your hair slightly (I&#x27;m not talking spikes, it&#x27;s not that intense) by putting some in your hair, then using a towel to swipe your hair in the direction you want it to stay and it works like a charm once the conditioner is fully absorbed!</li>
            <li> I liked this, however my hair did look oily afterwards. I only used it on days I didn&#x27;t shampoo or condition and mostly after getting out of the pool. I did like the smell of it, just not the feel of it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is listed here for under 3 dollars!  This leave-in conditioner is great.  It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and makes my hair shiny and soft.  I have curly hair that tends to get really dry and straw-like in harsh weather.  I&#x27;ve bought it many MANY times and will probably continue to buy it especially at this price.  The bottle is a bit annoying because you can never get every drop of product out, but like I said, for the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for something to tame my wild, frizzy hair. I had been using a dry oil, but needed something to weigh my hair down. This product was perfect - a little bit of weight to make it lie down better, and it made my hair shiny and silky. Love it!</li>
            <li> I would not buy it again, feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Used it all up and ready to buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner. Usually buy it in stores, but they had a great deal and coupon so couldn&#x27;t pass it up. Leaves your hair feeling smooth for a few days. And does take a lot of my frizz away, which is amazing in the summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kicking myself because I bought this at my local beauty store for $8 and it&#x27;s $3 here... BUT this is an amazing, AMAZING product. I don&#x27;t have curly hair but this works beautifully on my semi-straight hair and gives it a nice feel. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday as a leave in conditioner after i co wash my relaxed hair. It smells great. I use 2 pumps of the product and distribute it evenly throughout my hair with a wide tooth comb. This is the best leave in conditioner i ever used.</li>
            <li> great product to use everyday on curly hair. Used it in extreme heat in the desert and my curls looked great.</li>
            <li> I was just using regular conditioner in my daughter&#x27;s ultra curly hair to keep the curls soft, and manageable, and thought this would do just as well without the greasy feel. Wrong. This did nothing. And I mean nothing. I could have gotten the same result if I sprayed her hair with water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impress with this product! I have badly damaged hair like a bird&#x27;s nest due to frequent hair color, Japanese perm, and hot tools for styling. I was at first reluctant to buy this since it was so cheap and I normally use expensive salon brands.  Since I&#x27;ve been using so many products and it didn&#x27;t take away the tangle or frizz very well, I decided to purchase this producet based on high reviews. I am so glad I did! It got rid of my tangles and made my hair very soft and smooth.  Just because it&#x27;s cheap doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work as well. In this case it worked spectacular! I am also impress with the smell. I am very allergic to perfume and this has a very light fruity smell that didn&#x27;t cause me to sneeze.</li>
            <li> Great product! I am African American and I wear my hair natural. This product works great on my hair it gets rid of any frizz and it does smooth the cuticle of the hair and makes it shine.  My natural curls are well defined and shiny. It&#x27;s not heavy on your hair and the smell is light and fresh. (I&#x27;m sensitive to strong fragrances) I also use the other products in the Sleek &amp; Shine line. i.e. Shampoo and conditioner. I really love them all, and the price is great. I&#x27;ve experimented with a lot of products for natural hair, and I spent quite a lot of money. Natural hair products tend to be very expensive, but this worked better than most of them. I know women who wear their hair  natural also don&#x27;t like to use shampoo with sulfates in them, but I&#x27;ve not had any problem using the shampoo from this line. It didn&#x27;t dry or tangle my hair. Sometimes I just use the Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine  conditioner by itself as a co-wash, and follow up with this leave-in and I have gotten fabulous results! Try it ladies. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> No,it doesn&#x27;t make your have silky</li>
            <li> The seller states that this product should give you &amp;#34;Intense soothing for long-lasting frizz control and shine&amp;#34;. When I used this in my hair it just made my hair some-what stiff with no additional shine. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product over and over in different amounts and on my hair in varying degrees of wetness, but nothing seems to change the fact that it makes my hair feel STICKY! Did not work for me at at all, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My new favorite product for my naturally curly hair.  I use pantene&#x27;s curl gel on my hair, and was always pleased with the curl support it provided, but I still had issues with frizz.  The product really helps tame the frizz, and leaves my hair softy and shiny.  I use it in conjunction with the hair gel, and am very pleased wit the results.  I have not noticed any residue, or build up from this product.</li>
            <li> It works great on my hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable!  I am over 50 and have long bleached blonde hair.  it has been looking totally fried after I wash it and dry it lately. I didn&#x27;t know what to do because I love my hair long, below my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been going along watching it get worse and worse and trying different products that I happened to have in my cabinet.  I remembered having this product and decided to try it.  I had to work around the house all day, so I let it air dry and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like I have my old hair back!  It&#x27;s shinny, not greasy (though don&#x27;t use too much), long and healthy looking.  I keep looking in the mirror in disbelief. I even like to play with it again!  It feels healthy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to write a review because I depend on them so much myself.</li>
            <li> I use this product after I was or co-wash my hair.  I like products that smell really good and this one just smelled OKAY. I will continue to use it until its gone but doubt I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> After almost 30 years in the Navy, I finally get to let my hair grow...AND I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!  Works like a gel, but treats your hair instead of damaging it like a gel.</li>
            <li> This product is one of my favorite Garnier products on the market and I love their products! I have been using their leave in conditioner for about 7 months now and I use it almost daily (still on my first bottle!!!) When I get out of the shower, I like to apply a quarter sized amount of the conditioner all throughout my hair. This makes my hair super soft and shiny and it locks in all of the natural moisture in my hair. Before I started using this product, my hair was dry and had little shine. Now, my hair looks so much better! Also, unlike some other leave-in conditioners, this product is very light and doesn&#x27;t way down my fine, wavy hair. I&#x27;d recommend using [[ASIN:B008DF6XB4 Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Moroccan Oil Treatment 3.75 oz.]] along with the leave-in conditioner right out of the shower. The combination of these two products leaves my hair frizz-free and super shiny. I&#x27;d recommend this product to EVERYBODY! And, it&#x27;s super cheap!</li>
            <li> I like it very much. Thank you</li>
            <li> careful not to use too much or your hear will be as stiff as a board.i guess that would depend on the length of your hear as to how much to use.other then that the smell is great.</li>
            <li> Smells great and I get a lot of compliments on my hair when I use it</li>
            <li> This is a product  I use about 5 times per week.  I also use it on my 3 Labs, two of which have a skin  condition.  It is good stuff.  It is cheaper on Amazonn than at Wal mart or Target.  I have oily hair and this works great for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have outrageously frizzy and curly hair. I put this in my hair directly out of the shower and my frizz is instantly tamed! I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and I plan on continuing use!!!</li>
            <li> Got to say, this smells amazing, and I have had compliments on how nice my hair smells when I use this product. Works great for the price!</li>
            <li> My 6 year olds hair was so dry. Started adding this after showers and her hair is no healthy and looks great!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, which is frizzy and unruly. I&#x27;ve tried SO many products over the years, and was about to give in and buy an expensive product (expensive to me is over $15) ;) Before I did that, I stopped by the store and grabbed a few more products to give it them one last try. I stumbled upon this, and thought \\&quot;It&#x27;s cheap. What can it hurt?\\&quot;  It works perfectly. I can put it in my hair after I shower at night without having to worry about waking up with an unruly afro. Or, I put it in before I blow dry the crap out of my hair. Either way, my hair feels so much smoother and manageable. I haven&#x27;t seen this in the store lately when I&#x27;ve gone to replenish my stock, but I am glad to see it&#x27;s here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Affordable and effective!  Extra curly hair needs all the help it can get!</li>
            <li> love this stuff. smells great, easy to use, inexpensive, lasts a while</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and the feel. Leaves my hair very silky. Use in on my son whose hair is very curly. Works wonders to take out tangles.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks. It makes my hair look Greasy.  For the price I wasn&#x27;t too disappointed. But I will no buy again.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my aloe hair oil i just purchased on amazon! Covers up the stintch, leaves it smelling fabulosa and looking great! I wake up with my hair curly with alot of volume</li>
            <li> I have really dry curly hair. Every other day I put this in my hair after I shower and it feels so soft and moisturizer now</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a product in my hair consistently (besides regular shampoo and conditioner). I&#x27;ll be honest, my hair is usually very easy to manage (straight, thick, and healthy). But after I blowdry my hair, I dislike the frizziness on the edges of everything and wish it would calm down and be shiny without waiting for the natural oils to catch up. Not only does this product make my hair look un-frizzed, calm, and shiny, but it&#x27;s probably my FAVORITE scent right now. It smells like delicious green apple candy when freshly squeezed out of the bottle and the scent diffuses as you rub it in so it&#x27;s not overpowering. Citrusy, fresh, and clean. No clumps or bits in my hair at all and none of that gross &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner for the hair. Smells good and smooths hair just like it says. Purchased for my daughter and I use often. Def worth the price</li>
            <li> Works great for the price. I have pretty severely damaged, porous hair, and using this on damp hair after washing my hair is a godsend. Without it, my hair is significantly poofier.</li>
            <li> Love this product to help keep my hair managable and shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> i love this leave on conditioner!!! :) i don&#x27;t know what i would do without it! my hair is kind of frizzy so i need something that will make it smooth and more manageable... and this is exactly what my hair needs!</li>
            <li> I have really thick, silky hair, but it has been slightly unhealthy and dry lately, so it gets a little frizzy on the ends during the day. This stuff keeps it settled down, silky, and shiny. It only takes a little bit, and it works well. Love the smell, too.</li>
            <li> Good smell and isn&#x27;t too heavy in my hair.</li>
            <li> Sure it smells decent, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type, but I don&#x27;t really see the difference if I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is great however, so it&#x27;s a great value if you notice the difference</li>
            <li> Great hair product! Using it and loving it! Can&#x27;t feel it on my hair at all and it gets rid of the frizz...</li>
            <li> I bought this based on good reviews.The smell is so strong it gave me a headache.I had to rinse it out.I have no idea if this product works,I can&#x27;t get past the sickly sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am a man.  I have naturally curly hair.  I am normally very active so I end up washing my hair far more than I should and it turns to a dry, frizzy mess.  Garnier&#x27;s leave in treatment has become one half of my normal morning treatment.  I alternate between this and the [[ASIN:B000GCTBNY Garnier Fructis Anti-Frizz Serum]].  Using the leave in every other day makes my hair softer without feeling greasy, and gives me the slightest bit of hold without looking or feeling like gel.  If you have short hair I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day or your hair may begin to feel a bit greasy, which is why I alternate.  Otherwise it disappears quickly, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> My husband and brother in law have very nice, naturally curly hair and they use this on a daily basis.  This product was recommended by my best friend whose daughter has naturally curly hair.  It&#x27;s nice to have such a inexpensive product that works so well and doesn&#x27;t make their hair crunchy like gel does.  I tried to use it on my permed hair and it didn&#x27;t work as well for me so I switched to one of Fructis light gel product instead.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I have very thick curly hair that tangles easily. After I wash my hair and comb it through with a wide tooth comb, I add this and it&#x27;s perfect. Not to mention it smells amazing. The only thing is that a little does go a long way -so if you pile too much on, it may make your hair a little hard. However, if you wet it a little and fluff it some more it&#x27;ll get softer in no time.</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed by this product. I keep thinking im applying it wrong because every time i used it, my hair gets weighed down, tangled, sticky and definitely not smoother. I have never bought a smoothing hair product that does the opposite it&#x27;s weird!</li>
            <li> Keeps my naturally curly hair from getting frizzy. Huge bottle for a great price</li>
            <li> I am fourteen years old, and I have very healthy, pin-straight, but VERY thick hair. I have literally used every Garnier Fructis Shampoo, Conditioner, and hair care product (serum, cream, hairspray etc.) on the market, and all had made my hair a grimy, greasy, and dull mess. When I saw this product advertised in my Seventeen magazine, and on TV, I decided to give the Garnier company another chance to prove itself useful. I was astonishingly suprised with the results of this product. The smell is not bad at all, in my opinion, and it is thick and creamy. This product works so well for me that, I haven&#x27;t used any heat-styling tools in 5 months! I usually apply this to my damp hair, after I use my Suave Naturals Mango Mandarin Shampoo and Conditioner, or my Suave Naturals Juicy Green Apple Shampoo and Conditioner, and, It makes my already straight, shiny, and thick hair shine like glass, and easier to style and manage. Even yesterday, when the relative humidity in the air was 88%, my hair was shiny and sleek the whole day, without an ounce of frizz. I also love how it dosen&#x27;t leave any unnecessary buildup in my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am really suprised at what Garnier did with this product, and I will be buying more of this until it discontinues. This is by far the best leave-in conditioner that I have used, hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I swim daily and use this conditioner to coat my hair before swimming to protect my hair from chlorine damage. It works great. I love that it is so inexpensive as I use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I have very short, very straight, thick hair so I was surprised when I saw all these reviews from people with curly hair. Anyway, for me it works great. Makes my color treated hair shiny and keeps away any frizz that keep the ends from laying flat. I use only this with the Garnier flexible hairspray and I am good to go for the day. All of their products smell great too. If your hair is sticky or greasy from this, may be that you are using too much. It says a quarter sized squeeze, but I use less because my hair is short.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on earth. If you have curly hair (I mean for real curly not kinky) and don&#x27;t want to be bothered with oils or grease in your hair or face, you will love this. My hair is always full and sexy. I receive compliments all the time. People even ask if my hair is fake.</li>
