            <li>works great but the fragrance is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>lol, i am ordering a bunch more now.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin issues yet, but I already love this soap!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>and this works great, keeping my skin smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my face and it does an amazing job with getting rid of the oilies.</li>
            <li>This is amazing</li>
            <li>She was thrilled.</li>
            <li>some good sweating exercise &amp; eating healthy, though</li>
            <li>but then everything clears up nicely.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent and my skin feels really good.  </li>
            <li>but so far I am not too impressed.</li>
            <li>I have to say that it&#x27;s one of the best natural soaps that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>This soap smells nice, it has a good size to it, and doesn&#x27;t shrink quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the smell though....</li>
            <li>He is so pleased with the results that I just purchased this item again.</li>
            <li>Says it makes him feel super clean, foams up great and keeps his skin from feeling oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay soap.</li>
            <li>Love soap.</li>
            <li>I wash my underarms and face with this about 3 times every shower (rub, scrub &amp; rinse) just to be sure I got all the dirt (and oils that trap dirt in), but another interesting fact of why we stink is toxins being released from our bodies through the skin.</li>
            <li>Steps 2 and 3 in the D-Tox system won&#x27;t necessarily be required for you to get good results because I&#x27;ve achieved great results with the bar alone.</li>
            <li>but this one I like better.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing is better.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>I switched to the liquid because it&#x27;s easier to take to the gym, but this is great and for the price can&#x27;t really be beat.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way this soap smells.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite charcoal soaps.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this brand many times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Bars are large and smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Either way this soap feels great on my skin and rinses off completely leaving you feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>I feel clean all day!  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft after using and it works great a shaving cream substitute.</li>
            <li>no problems.. and the bars last a good length of time !</li>
            <li>the outbreaks are greatly reduced, his skin is healthy looking and when he does get one or two zits they are not nearly as red and swollen or embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>Too strong a scent.</li>
            <li>It may be too strong for some to use on their face so use with caution.</li>
            <li>Great price and does not dry skin.</li>
            <li>Lathers well, smells great, rinses clean, and most importantly allows my perfume to smell like it should and last.</li>
            <li>a huge fan of this soap, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is HUGE blessing, I&#x27;m washing and Deoderizing in ONE STEP now, and saving money because of it!!!ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li>I was using colloidal silver, a severe acne spot treatment from Acne Free, thieves oil, tea tree oil, and I even tried an iodine gel.</li>
            <li>Light scented and not drying.</li>
            <li>Skin smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasent.</li>
            <li>The absorption of activated charcoal is well known and skin being a significant organ; Skin, pores, absorption...</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricy, but SO worth it!</li>
            <li>Def worth a try for all you folks on the fence!</li>
            <li>So far, I think this stuff is amazing; if only for the light pleasant scent and gentleness.  </li>
            <li>I do, however, think it held clean skin well.  </li>
            <li>I still stress sweat, but my underarms are SO clean</li>
            <li>You just feel ultra clean.</li>
            <li>It works as well as any soap, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>it smells cool</li>
            <li>The activated charcoal is a true cleanser and a godsend for anyone with a desire to rid their body of the chemical elements</li>
            <li>All which are really great products when I use them for other things, but for my cystic acne, the healing tree cleared it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super drying...</li>
            <li>: ) I can only hope it is removing toxins. : )</li>
            <li>Smells good, lathers really well, and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>but it quickly stopped.</li>
            <li>but I used it mainly on my face and it was phenomenal.</li>
            <li>At that point, I was willing to try anything, and as a proud user of Giovanni&#x27;s 2Chic Avocado hairline, my skepticism was minimal.  </li>
            <li>I also loved the fact that is doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin.  </li>
            <li>Fine quality ingredients and smooth texture with soft fragrance!  </li>
            <li>Nice, light fresh smell, washes away cleanly, does well clearing up and preventing breakouts and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li>His favorite soap by far.</li>
            <li>I ordered the charcoal soap to neutralize the chlorine from the poor at the Y. Works great for that!</li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t use bar soap because it dries out my skin, but this one is pretty great.</li>
            <li>It is pretty comparable and doesn&#x27;t melt too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Really is a good soap that lathers easy not like the hard bars that take forever to suds up.</li>
            <li>However it does work to clean very well, and if you use it too much you would dry/burn your skin ( like if you used this on your face..</li>
            <li>Lastly, the bar is HUGE!</li>
            <li>I almost gave up on charcoal soap because this was my first ever.</li>
            <li>First use on that I was like whatever, it&#x27;s not doing anything.</li>
            <li>It has worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>The whole family is thankful for that!  </li>
            <li>this is the first charcoal soap I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling everyone about this who&#x27;s interested in removing Alzheimer&#x27;s-causing aluminum from their bodies by removing antiperspirant from their hygiene</li>
            <li>so it actually makes you break out more when you first start using it because it&#x27;s drawing the dirt out..</li>
            <li>You can feel the difference once you use it the first time.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but</li>
            <li>I love my Skin Dry!  </li>
            <li>Most products that are supposed to help with this dry out the skin, but this soap doesn&#x27;t do that!  </li>
            <li>Not only do they support breast cancer research, but these products have gentle feel and light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Buy it second time, keep skin smooth</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use whole system</li>
            <li>Pondering the whole system</li>
            <li>, he loves that he doesn&#x27;t smell as much as he used to when he works out, and his feet no longer stink.  </li>
            <li>I do air conditioning in South Texas, I&#x27;m was constantly dealing with oily skin primarily the face region till tonight</li>
            <li>the whole family uses this bar of soap and we all really like it.</li>
            <li>very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the Giovanni product line.</li>
            <li>No reason to buy any plain store-bought stuff when this is out there for the same price and so great for your face.</li>
            <li>I can rarely use any other soap because i just do not feel as clean.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on good reviews, however one commenter did say it&#x27;s like regular soap with black dye in it</li>
            <li>The black soap does leave a residue in the soap dish, like all bar soaps, but it washes away cleanly with water and a quick scrub.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and I am very sensitive and not had trouble with that.</li>
            <li>The bar is huge, and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic cleansing gets rid of the excess oil on my chest and back without being harsh and causing my skin to make more.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little bit of this soap to make a good lather.</li>
            <li>To be honest it was in pretty back shape but oddly enough that&#x27;s the only place he has acne.</li>
            <li>Luckily I ordered two different brands at</li>
            <li>Also, it says it &amp;#34;delve deep into pores and absorb toxins, impurities and excess oils that interfere with clear skin&amp;#34; but in my experience it did not penetrate the pores at all, so I stick to my cheap walmart facewash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely helped clear up my skin a bit, and I like the mild scent of the bar.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Seems to work and very soft on skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin and the significant other loves the scent.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft!</li>
            <li>To my surprise, once I got the product home I felt a clean, crisp, and therapeutic sensation throughout my entire body which I have never felt with any other type of body wash/soap.</li>
            <li>it makes you feel so clean without the squeaky feeling that you get a lot of times with other bar soaps.</li>
            <li>and you can see that the little charcoal pieces make up the blackness of the soap but with the Giovanni I couldn&#x27;t see the charcoal granules but it could be ground up to a fine powder.</li>
            <li>i bought this for my boyfriend who was feeling very self conscious about his back.</li>
            <li>But continuous use for like two days and my severe cystic acne started to clear.</li>
            <li>which I don&#x27;t recommend) as far as clearing up acne..</li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t really like is that it is an add-on order.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li>the smell is so light and fluffy and yummy i want to eat the bar</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this soap back in May from Whole Foods, at an employee&#x27;s behest.</li>
            <li>As for the bar itself, the scent is a soft incense like smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is cool, not sweet, and works for men and women.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin with a slight tacky feel to it after you initially rinse off, but afterwards you feel fine.</li>
            <li>This clears it right up,  after a month of use, without other products,  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is drawing out any impurities, but at least I&#x27;m clean!</li>
            <li>Word of caution: this soap is VERY drying for people with dry sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>I have found at the very beginning it did dry out my skin</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and really draws the impurities from the skin...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that it helps a ton in that category, but I would say in combination with baking soda and other things I&#x27;ve been trying my skin has gotten a little better.  </li>
            <li>This leaves his skin so clean and refreshed and the little breakouts are gone after a week of using twice daily.</li>
            <li>Has helped clear up my arm and back acne!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using on a chemical burned area - facial skin peel gone awry - and this has not irritated the sensitive areas underlying cracks and flakes.  </li>
            <li>If you have skin problems I highly recommend this soap but not for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li>No mess, just white sudsy soap.</li>
            <li>I even share with my family, I&#x27;m steel using off one of the first bars for a little over 4 months now.</li>

            <li> Def worth a try for all you folks on the fence!</li>
            <li> So far, I think this stuff is amazing; if only for the light pleasant scent and gentleness.  </li>
            <li> I do, however, think it held clean skin well.  </li>
            <li> I still stress sweat, but my underarms are SO clean</li>
            <li> You just feel ultra clean.</li>
            <li> It works as well as any soap, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> it smells cool</li>
            <li> The activated charcoal is a true cleanser and a godsend for anyone with a desire to rid their body of the chemical elements</li>
            <li> All which are really great products when I use them for other things, but for my cystic acne, the healing tree cleared it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super drying...</li>
            <li> : ) I can only hope it is removing toxins. : )</li>
            <li> Smells good, lathers really well, and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> but it quickly stopped.</li>
            <li> but I used it mainly on my face and it was phenomenal.</li>
            <li> At that point, I was willing to try anything, and as a proud user of Giovanni&#x27;s 2Chic Avocado hairline, my skepticism was minimal.  </li>
            <li> I also loved the fact that is doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin.  </li>
            <li> Fine quality ingredients and smooth texture with soft fragrance!  </li>
            <li> Nice, light fresh smell, washes away cleanly, does well clearing up and preventing breakouts and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> His favorite soap by far.</li>
            <li> I ordered the charcoal soap to neutralize the chlorine from the poor at the Y. Works great for that!</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t use bar soap because it dries out my skin, but this one is pretty great.</li>
            <li> It is pretty comparable and doesn&#x27;t melt too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Really is a good soap that lathers easy not like the hard bars that take forever to suds up.</li>
            <li> However it does work to clean very well, and if you use it too much you would dry/burn your skin ( like if you used this on your face..</li>
            <li> Lastly, the bar is HUGE!</li>
            <li> I almost gave up on charcoal soap because this was my first ever.</li>
            <li> First use on that I was like whatever, it&#x27;s not doing anything.</li>
            <li> It has worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> The whole family is thankful for that!  </li>
            <li> this is the first charcoal soap I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling everyone about this who&#x27;s interested in removing Alzheimer&#x27;s-causing aluminum from their bodies by removing antiperspirant from their hygiene</li>
            <li> so it actually makes you break out more when you first start using it because it&#x27;s drawing the dirt out..</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference once you use it the first time.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but</li>
            <li> I love my Skin Dry!  </li>
            <li> Most products that are supposed to help with this dry out the skin, but this soap doesn&#x27;t do that!  </li>
            <li> Not only do they support breast cancer research, but these products have gentle feel and light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Buy it second time, keep skin smooth</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use whole system</li>
            <li> Pondering the whole system</li>
            <li> , he loves that he doesn&#x27;t smell as much as he used to when he works out, and his feet no longer stink.  </li>
            <li> I do air conditioning in South Texas, I&#x27;m was constantly dealing with oily skin primarily the face region till tonight</li>
            <li> the whole family uses this bar of soap and we all really like it.</li>
            <li> very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the Giovanni product line.</li>
            <li> No reason to buy any plain store-bought stuff when this is out there for the same price and so great for your face.</li>
            <li> I can rarely use any other soap because i just do not feel as clean.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on good reviews, however one commenter did say it&#x27;s like regular soap with black dye in it</li>
            <li> The black soap does leave a residue in the soap dish, like all bar soaps, but it washes away cleanly with water and a quick scrub.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and I am very sensitive and not had trouble with that.</li>
            <li> The bar is huge, and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic cleansing gets rid of the excess oil on my chest and back without being harsh and causing my skin to make more.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit of this soap to make a good lather.</li>
            <li> To be honest it was in pretty back shape but oddly enough that&#x27;s the only place he has acne.</li>
            <li> Luckily I ordered two different brands at</li>
            <li> Also, it says it &amp;#34;delve deep into pores and absorb toxins, impurities and excess oils that interfere with clear skin&amp;#34; but in my experience it did not penetrate the pores at all, so I stick to my cheap walmart facewash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely helped clear up my skin a bit, and I like the mild scent of the bar.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Seems to work and very soft on skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin and the significant other loves the scent.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft!</li>
            <li> To my surprise, once I got the product home I felt a clean, crisp, and therapeutic sensation throughout my entire body which I have never felt with any other type of body wash/soap.</li>
            <li> it makes you feel so clean without the squeaky feeling that you get a lot of times with other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> and you can see that the little charcoal pieces make up the blackness of the soap but with the Giovanni I couldn&#x27;t see the charcoal granules but it could be ground up to a fine powder.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my boyfriend who was feeling very self conscious about his back.</li>
            <li> But continuous use for like two days and my severe cystic acne started to clear.</li>
            <li> which I don&#x27;t recommend) as far as clearing up acne..</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t really like is that it is an add-on order.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li> the smell is so light and fluffy and yummy i want to eat the bar</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this soap back in May from Whole Foods, at an employee&#x27;s behest.</li>
            <li> As for the bar itself, the scent is a soft incense like smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is cool, not sweet, and works for men and women.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin with a slight tacky feel to it after you initially rinse off, but afterwards you feel fine.</li>
            <li> This clears it right up,  after a month of use, without other products,  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is drawing out any impurities, but at least I&#x27;m clean!</li>
            <li> Word of caution: this soap is VERY drying for people with dry sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I have found at the very beginning it did dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and really draws the impurities from the skin...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that it helps a ton in that category, but I would say in combination with baking soda and other things I&#x27;ve been trying my skin has gotten a little better.  </li>
            <li> This leaves his skin so clean and refreshed and the little breakouts are gone after a week of using twice daily.</li>
            <li> Has helped clear up my arm and back acne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using on a chemical burned area - facial skin peel gone awry - and this has not irritated the sensitive areas underlying cracks and flakes.  </li>
            <li> If you have skin problems I highly recommend this soap but not for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> No mess, just white sudsy soap.</li>
            <li> I even share with my family, I&#x27;m steel using off one of the first bars for a little over 4 months now.</li>
            <li> My skin does not get flaky dry, but I do rarely use moisturizers or lotions and this soap will initially make your skin dry, but leave off the lotion because your skin also produces oils you just have to wait a little..</li>
            <li> Gave a bar to a teen who has breakouts and this helped clear her skin, not as red the bumps, and calmed her skin down.</li>
            <li> It does leave some unsightly dark drips if the dish drains but a little water washes it right away.</li>
            <li> The acne was painful, unsightly, and leaving far too many scars for my liking, especially with summer approaching.</li>
            <li> It began to clear up (with often lotion use) after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Have not used it for a long time to comment on benefits</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing natural ever worked for me, so I was just resigned to doing a heavy metal detox every couple years to deal with me using antiperspirant, because I refused to be stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leave my skin soft but a little dry.</li>
            <li> The bar seems to last a bit longer than some other brands of soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The drier parts of my body, however, get too dry using this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, also doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling slippery like some soaps with lotion.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this purifying bar</li>
            <li> (I have dry scalp, also)</li>
            <li> i dont break out and it doesnt dry up my skin.</li>
            <li> The black suds wash away; however, I gave only 4 stars because it will leave black residue on your soap holder, shower caddy, or on side of tub if you let the bar dry there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, so</li>
            <li> and lasts for a long time too, i cut one bar soap in half.</li>
            <li> No more chlorine smell left on my skin either!  </li>
            <li> Plus it leaves my chin and cheeks a little dry.</li>
            <li> its a little expensive but its worth it</li>
            <li> Outside of one or two random bumps from hormones, which were noticeably smaller than usual, my arms and shoulders are virtually clear.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t quite raw.. but not far from it.  </li>
            <li> only realized this worked because I was forced to go antiperspirant-free for a while because I nicked my under-arms while shaving</li>
            <li> but if I had stress sweat, you&#x27;d know it because I&#x27;d smell horrid and have to keep my arms down.</li>
            <li> we saw results about a week and half after he started using it</li>
            <li> Not as helpful to my skin as Origins&#x27; Skin Diver soap, but less costly.</li>
            <li> Have used this for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I usually use the other black bar soap from origins but thought I would try this one for a change.  </li>
            <li> Crazy thing is, that delicate, sweet smell it has stays with my underarms all day.</li>
            <li> It cleans well, but for me dries my skin out just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I just think it may be a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday..</li>
            <li> This opens a whole world of new possibilities of clothing types I refused to wear before because I hated my shirts rubbing up against my deodorant, getting cold &amp; wet and making me feel terribly uncomfortable being wet with pasty stuff slipping around under my arms....</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will order again....</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am not sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s a thing of the past, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a small reminder that 2 and 2 is 4.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I notice any difference in my skin when I use this produce, therefore I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I now can work outside all day, sweat like crazy and no stink whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Made acne worse.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the $12 secret antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Just a bar of soap that made my skin slightly ashy. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence, go ahead and order a pack, you can&#x27;t go wrong with 2 for $10ish, when it&#x27;s $15 a bar at origins.</li>
            <li> Insert horrible teenage flashbacks here...</li>
            <li> It had no good or bad results.</li>
            <li> (My husband&#x27;s skin stunk really bad all over when he was addicted to Mountain Dew)...</li>
            <li> I gave a bar to my 68yr olddad because he always stinks.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have those nasty underarm deodorant stains on my clothes.</li>
            <li> the the worst bar I&#x27;ve ever used when it comes to</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this based on good reviews, however one commenter did say it&#x27;s like regular soap with black dye in it, I do have to wonder because I also bought a Biore Charcoal soap and you can see that the little charcoal pieces make up the blackness of the soap but with the Giovanni I couldn&#x27;t see the charcoal granules but it could be ground up to a fine powder. However it does work to clean very well, and if you use it too much you would dry/burn your skin ( like if you used this on your face..which I don&#x27;t recommend) as far as clearing up acne.. the verdict it still out but so far I am not too impressed. But everyone has different body chemistry so keep that in mind. It only takes a little bit of this soap to make a good lather. My white washcloths are now perm. stained.</li>
            <li> Buy it second time, keep skin smooth</li>
            <li> I usually use the other black bar soap from origins but thought I would try this one for a change.  It is pretty comparable and doesn&#x27;t melt too quickly.  If you are on the fence, go ahead and order a pack, you can&#x27;t go wrong with 2 for $10ish, when it&#x27;s $15 a bar at origins.</li>
            <li> Super drying...I love the smell though....Not sure if I will order again....</li>
            <li> Perfume in soap fills the bathroom day and night. Too strong a scent. Gave the soap away.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my boyfriend who was feeling very self conscious about his back. To be honest it was in pretty back shape but oddly enough that&#x27;s the only place he has acne. we saw results about a week and half after he started using it (FYI: he showers twice a day and uses a loofa in combination with this soap). He is so pleased with the results that I just purchased this item again. Word of caution: this soap is VERY drying for people with dry sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> it smells cool but it&#x27;s just a bar of soap in my opinion. It had no good or bad results. I almost gave up on charcoal soap because this was my first ever. Luckily I ordered two different brands at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Healing Tree - Bamboo Charcoal Soap. First use on that I was like whatever, it&#x27;s not doing anything. But continuous use for like two days and my severe cystic acne started to clear. I was using colloidal silver, a severe acne spot treatment from Acne Free, thieves oil, tea tree oil, and I even tried an iodine gel. All which are really great products when I use them for other things, but for my cystic acne, the healing tree cleared it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Giovanni soap did nothing. Absolutely nothing. Just a bar of soap that made my skin slightly ashy. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> It has worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> So far, I think this stuff is amazing; if only for the light pleasant scent and gentleness.  I&#x27;ve been using on a chemical burned area - facial skin peel gone awry - and this has not irritated the sensitive areas underlying cracks and flakes.  My skin isn&#x27;t quite raw.. but not far from it.  Jury is out on how it helps acne.  I&#x27;ve only used the soap for a couple of days now and remain hopeful for improvements.</li>
            <li> Light scented and not drying.</li>
            <li> works great but the fragrance is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I keep this soap in the kitchen,it will remove any lingering smell from your hands....garlic,onion etc.</li>
            <li> Made acne worse. After doing some scientific research I realized &amp;#34;activated charcoal soap&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t proven to work and is a scam.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am not sure. I feel like it may be drying out my skin. I think i may need to limit it to once a week. It smells nice, and I am very sensitive and not had trouble with that. I just think it may be a bit harsh. I do, however, think it held clean skin well.  : ) I can only hope it is removing toxins. : )</li>
            <li> Have not used it for a long time to comment on benefits</li>
            <li> I like this. I&#x27;ve been a fan of charcoal type soaps so I decided to try this. It cleans well, but for me dries my skin out just a little bit. I&#x27;m happy with the buy but I am probably going to try another type after this, instead of rebuying. I still have a bar left too that I will still use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its good for face and body.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s day and he LOVES it. His favorite soap by far. Says it makes him feel super clean, foams up great and keeps his skin from feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use whole system but I have been using this product for week a ... This has been a life and skin saver. In short, had medical procedure that overload my body  which caused server irritation .  Since using this product  the irritation along with some scaring has ceased. Skin smooth and moist. Please note everyone&#x27;s experience is different.&lt;br /&gt;Another product that does what it states... Pondering the whole system</li>
            <li> Advertised as pack of 2 I only received 1</li>
            <li> My Husband has been using this Detox soap for a while and likes it.Really is a good soap that lathers easy not like the hard bars that take forever to suds up.This leaves his skin so clean and refreshed and the little breakouts are gone after a week of using twice daily.Would recommend this detox soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay soap. Not as helpful to my skin as Origins&#x27; Skin Diver soap, but less costly.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what we call it around here!  My teen had breakouts all over his body, he was horrified!  He washed daily and used all kinds of products that left him flaky and with zits.  This clears it right up,  after a month of use, without other products,  the outbreaks are greatly reduced, his skin is healthy looking and when he does get one or two zits they are not nearly as red and swollen or embarrassing.  Added bonus, he loves that he doesn&#x27;t smell as much as he used to when he works out, and his feet no longer stink.  The whole family is thankful for that!  I was worried that it would stain my white fiberglass tub enclosure - but nope!  It does leave some unsightly dark drips if the dish drains but a little water washes it right away. No staining at all!  This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Found this cheaper on Amazon. I have very sensitive skin and this works great, keeping my skin smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Have used this for about a week and a half. Smells good, lathers really well, and leaves my skin super soft. I typically don&#x27;t use bar soap because it dries out my skin, but this one is pretty great. I started using it on my face, as well, with the Oleavine Konjac Sponge.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for six months now. I have found at the very beginning it did dry out my skin but it quickly stopped. I used this soap for my guttate psoriasis. It began to clear up (with often lotion use) after a few weeks. Happy with the results of this soap I have continued to use it. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t really like is that it is an add-on order.</li>
            <li> Love soap. Gave a bar to a teen who has breakouts and this helped clear her skin, not as red the bumps, and calmed her skin down. She was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the $12 secret antiperspirant. It smelled great but if I had stress sweat, you&#x27;d know it because I&#x27;d smell horrid and have to keep my arms down. Well, this detoxifying wonder works wonders. I now can work outside all day, sweat like crazy and no stink whatsoever. I still stress sweat, but my underarms are SO clean, it&#x27;s just sweat, no stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I won&#x27;t have those nasty underarm deodorant stains on my clothes. This opens a whole world of new possibilities of clothing types I refused to wear before because I hated my shirts rubbing up against my deodorant, getting cold &amp; wet and making me feel terribly uncomfortable being wet with pasty stuff slipping around under my arms....just sooo gross-feeling!!!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a thing of the past, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of this soap, and this is the first charcoal soap I&#x27;ve ever bought. Crazy thing is, that delicate, sweet smell it has stays with my underarms all day. I wash my underarms and face with this about 3 times every shower (rub, scrub &amp; rinse) just to be sure I got all the dirt (and oils that trap dirt in), but another interesting fact of why we stink is toxins being released from our bodies through the skin. I only stunk under my arms, but I imagine this would help anyone so overloaded with toxins that their bodies release the stinky toxins from anywhere on the skin covering their bodies (My husband&#x27;s skin stunk really bad all over when he was addicted to Mountain Dew)...some good sweating exercise &amp; eating healthy, though &amp; he smells great again. I also struggle with acne and this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drier parts of my body, however, get too dry using this. So I&#x27;ve made one bar of this soap last 2 months because I only use it under my arms &amp; on my face/neck/chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2 eldest sons (12 &amp; 13) started stinking so I got them using this strictly for underarms also and they now don&#x27;t wear deodorant, either, and yet smell good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so awesome I gave a bar to my 68yr olddad because he always stinks. I&#x27;m telling everyone about this who&#x27;s interested in removing Alzheimer&#x27;s-causing aluminum from their bodies by removing antiperspirant from their hygiene routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing natural ever worked for me, so I was just resigned to doing a heavy metal detox every couple years to deal with me using antiperspirant, because I refused to be stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is HUGE blessing, I&#x27;m washing and Deoderizing in ONE STEP now, and saving money because of it!!!ðŸ˜„&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only realized this worked because I was forced to go antiperspirant-free for a while because I nicked my under-arms while shaving and you can&#x27;t wear antiperspirant on open wounds. I guess that was a blessing in disguise. ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> This the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  It literally draws the impurities from your skin.  You will see and feel the difference within a week.  I also loved the fact that is doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin.  The blackheads on my nose are disappearing and the pores on my skin is shrinking creating a smoother looking complexion.  Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic cleansing gets rid of the excess oil on my chest and back without being harsh and causing my skin to make more. The charcoal helps to remove toxins in the skin. It leaves skin soft.  Not-so-hot lathering makes using the bars a bit of work, in fact it&#x27;s on par the the worst bar I&#x27;ve ever used when it comes to lathering.&lt;br /&gt;The bar does everything for me by itself. Steps 2 and 3 in the D-Tox system won&#x27;t necessarily be required for you to get good results because I&#x27;ve achieved great results with the bar alone. However, the same things could be said of any high-quality charcoal bar.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it&#x27;s one of the best natural soaps that I have ever used. I even share with my family, I&#x27;m steel using off one of the first bars for a little over 4 months now.</li>
            <li> It works as well as any soap, but it&#x27;s nothing special. Also, it says it &amp;#34;delve deep into pores and absorb toxins, impurities and excess oils that interfere with clear skin&amp;#34; but in my experience it did not penetrate the pores at all, so I stick to my cheap walmart facewash.</li>
            <li> Have been using a detox charcoal soap from overseas for the last 2 years....but this one I like better. Moisturizing is better.</li>
            <li> I do air conditioning in South Texas, I&#x27;m was constantly dealing with oily skin primarily the face region till tonight I felt it&#x27;s effect within minutes of use the scent is neutral and not overpowering</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin and the significant other loves the scent. I&#x27;ll never go back to traditional soap.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, also doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling slippery like some soaps with lotion. The scent is light and pleasent.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin and really draws the impurities from the skin... so it actually makes you break out more when you first start using it because it&#x27;s drawing the dirt out.. but then everything clears up nicely. I use it everyday.. no problems.. and the bars last a good length of time !</li>
            <li> Excellent soap!  Fine quality ingredients and smooth texture with soft fragrance!  One of the best soaps I&#x27;ve used in years!</li>
            <li> the whole family uses this bar of soap and we all really like it. it makes you feel so clean without the squeaky feeling that you get a lot of times with other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. I buy it every time we are close to running out</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the face! I have dry skin and this purifying bar moisturizes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face feel very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived on time and it does what they claim.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to do business with them.</li>
            <li> You can use it on your body but I used it mainly on my face and it was phenomenal. No breakouts whatsoever and it lasted forever. I switched to the liquid because it&#x27;s easier to take to the gym, but this is great and for the price can&#x27;t really be beat. No reason to buy any plain store-bought stuff when this is out there for the same price and so great for your face.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin with a slight tacky feel to it after you initially rinse off, but afterwards you feel fine. It&#x27;s definitely helped clear up my skin a bit, and I like the mild scent of the bar. This also doesn&#x27;t seem to be drying out my skin like the last charcoal soap I tried. Overall, I would recommend it for any man who struggles with occasional body breakouts.</li>
            <li> At first glance I was not sure what to expect from a detox soap especially since I did not know how it would smell or feel on my skin. To my surprise, once I got the product home I felt a clean, crisp, and therapeutic sensation throughout my entire body which I have never felt with any other type of body wash/soap. The activated charcoal is a true cleanser and a godsend for anyone with a desire to rid their body of the chemical elements we all come into contact with daily. Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> Lathers well, smells great, rinses clean, and most importantly allows my perfume to smell like it should and last. I even use it on my face and it does an amazing job with getting rid of the oilies. It may be too strong for some to use on their face so use with caution.</li>
            <li> This is the best Soap I have EVER used.  I can rarely use any other soap because i just do not feel as clean.  The absorption of activated charcoal is well known and skin being a significant organ; Skin, pores, absorption... Just a small reminder that 2 and 2 is 4.  A side Note.. I love my Skin Dry!  My skin does not get flaky dry, but I do rarely use moisturizers or lotions and this soap will initially make your skin dry, but leave off the lotion because your skin also produces oils you just have to wait a little..</li>
            <li> This soap smells nice, it has a good size to it, and doesn&#x27;t shrink quickly. You can feel the difference once you use it the first time. You just feel ultra clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and I have issues with boils and abcesses.  Most products that are supposed to help with this dry out the skin, but this soap doesn&#x27;t do that!  It has a nice clean scent and my skin feels really good.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, so I don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin issues yet, but I already love this soap!  I even used it on my scalp yesterday (I have dry scalp, also) and it&#x27;s helped with that already!  Yes, it&#x27;s pricy, but SO worth it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this soap smells. It makes my skin feel so soft after using and it works great a shaving cream substitute.</li>
            <li> Omg i am a beauty queen, i have every kind of soap, oil, scrub, i even make my own stuff! This is amazing the smell is so light and fluffy and yummy i want to eat the bar lol, i am ordering a bunch more now. Can&#x27;t get enough! And i just got it today!!!!! love it!</li>
            <li> I really like the Giovanni product line. Not only do they support breast cancer research, but these products have gentle feel and light fragrance. Perfect for sensitive skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;Love this line! I do recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Great price and does not dry skin. The bar seems to last a bit longer than some other brands of soap.</li>
            <li> this is my preferred soap. it cleans good and has a pleasant smell. its a little expensive but its worth it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  The bar is huge, and lasts a long time.  The scent is cool, not sweet, and works for men and women.  The black suds wash away; however, I gave only 4 stars because it will leave black residue on your soap holder, shower caddy, or on side of tub if you let the bar dry there.  My husband tends to have problem skin on his back and shoulders, and this bar worked wonders!  Leaves skin soft.  I have this product on auto-pay, which adds to the bargain!  One bar lasts my husband and I for a month, with both of us taking daily showers.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Leave my skin soft but a little dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap back in May from Whole Foods, at an employee&#x27;s behest. At the time I was experiencing breakouts on my arms, shoulders and face that just wouldn&#x27;t quit. *Insert horrible teenage flashbacks here...* The acne was painful, unsightly, and leaving far too many scars for my liking, especially with summer approaching. At that point, I was willing to try anything, and as a proud user of Giovanni&#x27;s 2Chic Avocado hairline, my skepticism was minimal.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but once I switched to an exfoliating loofah, the results went from almost non-existent to massive! Outside of one or two random bumps from hormones, which were noticeably smaller than usual, my arms and shoulders are virtually clear. Now I can wear sleeveless tops and sundresses without feeling self-conscious. Hooray!  I even noticed a difference on my face although not as drastic. Plus it leaves my chin and cheeks a little dry. I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing the travel size facial system to see if that helps, specifically the facial wash and the lotion.  As for the bar itself, the scent is a soft incense like smell. If I could bottle it, I would! The black soap does leave a residue in the soap dish, like all bar soaps, but it washes away cleanly with water and a quick scrub. This of course means no stains in my white tub. Lastly, the bar is HUGE! I purchased it in May and it&#x27;s still going despite my 1-2 showers a day. Once I figure out the timeline, I plan to subscribe here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the soap. I cut it into several pieces so I could have one in my camping bin and one in my travel case for when I go on vacation, etc. I&#x27;m not sure I notice any difference in my skin when I use this produce, therefore I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This soap has a wonderful scent but that would be nothing if it didn&#x27;t do a good job of cleaning. Well, it does. I feel clean all day!  I don&#x27;t know if it is drawing out any impurities, but at least I&#x27;m clean!</li>
            <li> everything makes me break out, but this soap is perfect! and lasts for a long time too, i cut one bar soap in half. i have one in my shower and another in the sink when i wake up and wash my face. i dont break out and it doesnt dry up my skin.</li>
            <li> Noticed no difference in my skin, did not help with body acne.</li>
            <li> Seems to work and very soft on skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months. Has helped clear up my arm and back acne! Def worth a try for all you folks on the fence!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite charcoal soaps. I have purchased this brand many times and will continue to do so. Excellent price as well.</li>
            <li> Love it. Nice, light fresh smell, washes away cleanly, does well clearing up and preventing breakouts and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I ordered the charcoal soap to neutralize the chlorine from the poor at the Y. Works great for that! No more chlorine smell left on my skin either!  It works great for eczema too. No mess, just white sudsy soap. Leaves your skin soft!</li>
            <li> Bars are large and smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you have skin problems I highly recommend this soap but not for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stop using this soap</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I read it may help breakouts.  I haven&#x27;t noticed that it helps a ton in that category, but I would say in combination with baking soda and other things I&#x27;ve been trying my skin has gotten a little better.  Either way this soap feels great on my skin and rinses off completely leaving you feeling very clean.  I would order again.</li>
