    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Does the job, great price!</li>
            <li>Great product for travel!</li>
            <li>These Magnums are the perfect sharpness at a great price!</li>
            <li>The quality of the blades is basically perfect and shaving with this magnum is a dream.</li>
            <li>I bought them from Costco (Razor, 20 Cartridges and a travel case for $20) and they were the best blades I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The price is great, but these nicked me after a couple weeks&#x27; use.  </li>
            <li>but this razor did a great job of picking up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good product for the price</li>
            <li>These razors are phenomenal!</li>
            <li>This razor meets it all together in a nice shave that&#x27;s still smooth at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>If so, you have do much, much better.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care at first since the shave was good</li>
            <li>Great quality...the value is clearly given.</li>
            <li>This razor gave a very nice shave which I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a whisker free face like Gillette at,half the cost.</li>
            <li>The construction of the razor has a cheap plastic feel.</li>
            <li>They are very cheap and work pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the use goes, I had been using a 6 blade from one of the large &amp;#34;dollar store&amp;#34; chains and loved them but the price was getting out of control</li>
            <li>I only expect the best from American companies.  </li>
            <li>timely delivery good product as expected</li>
            <li>I bought my first M5 at Costco when I was looking for a razor that didn&#x27;t give me razor-burn.</li>
            <li>Gillette claims no tug and pull but on some of their more recent razors that are upwards of $15 for JUST the razor.</li>
            <li>M5 is a close smooth shaving American made razor by Personna.</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t affect my experience other than having to rinse the blade a lot more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even better than the most expensive Gillette.</li>
            <li>But that high quality seems to be gone.</li>
            <li>Came in only a few days, very satisfied</li>
            <li>I mainly use these to shave my head and if I&#x27;m not careful I&#x27;ll cut my whole head up.</li>
            <li>I have very tight contours to my face which most blades miss</li>
            <li>I can only really use the blades once before they start to cut my head, sometimes they even new ones start to cut.</li>
            <li>real reason I gave this a 2 star rating is that the blades seem to dull really quickly.</li>
            <li>The first is that the vents on the back aren&#x27;t big enough to allow the shaving cream to move through the blades.</li>

            <li> Great quality...the value is clearly given. It takes me about 7 weeks to go thru one razor.</li>
            <li> Does the job, great price!</li>
            <li> The price is great, but these nicked me after a couple weeks&#x27; use.  Schick Hydro I can use for about two months before changing the blade.  These things I had to change bi-weekly.  I shave my head every other day and my face every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do offer a close shave, and are well made.  I just don&#x27;t have tough enough skin to make them last me two months per cartridge.</li>
            <li> Great product for travel!</li>
            <li> M5 is a close smooth shaving American made razor by Personna. I was misled by one review that said it fell apart, not true. Leaves a whisker free face like Gillette at,half the cost. I use a Burma shave brush and shea/aloe soap. This razor meets it all together in a nice shave that&#x27;s still smooth at the end of the day. I will buy this brand again.  Carrying case is just plastic no special mention.</li>
            <li> Well it says you get the razor with 4 cartridges and case - I only got 2 cartridges, one on the razor and one in the case.  As far as the use goes, I had been using a 6 blade from one of the large &amp;#34;dollar store&amp;#34; chains and loved them but the price was getting out of control so I looked for an alternative.  I have to say the 5 blade really doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the 6 blade and not sure why but after my 1st and 2nd use I ended up with cuts on my face, never had that problem with the 6 blade.  After about a week of use the nik&#x27;s stopped but the shave just isn&#x27;t as close as I was use too.</li>
            <li> good product for the price</li>
            <li> I bought my first M5 at Costco when I was looking for a razor that didn&#x27;t give me razor-burn. These Magnums are the perfect sharpness at a great price!</li>
            <li> This razor gave a very nice shave which I was pleasantly surprised.  I have very tight contours to my face which most blades miss but this razor did a great job of picking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Just a few issues. I only received 2 cartridges.  Not a deal breaker for me just a little annoying and a nagging feeling of being of being ripped off which I couldn&#x27;t shake with each stroke of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The construction of the razor has a cheap plastic feel. I didn&#x27;t care at first since the shave was good but when I dropped it in the shower one morning it broke into several parts with no hope of putting it back together. Now, I was ticked off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am wrong but I thought this item was built in the USA. If so, you have do much, much better.  I only expect the best from American companies.  If you do, send me a email and I will try your product again.  Until then I have nagging feeling I need to shake.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Came in only a few days, very satisfied</li>
            <li> These razors are phenomenal!</li>
            <li> timely delivery good product as expected</li>
            <li> Blades have burs on them.  Awful, painful shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Gillette claims no tug and pull but on some of their more recent razors that are upwards of $15 for JUST the razor. this was under $15, and it included four other razors. The quality of the blades is basically perfect and shaving with this magnum is a dream. I will always buy this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> They are very cheap and work pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only noticed 2 problems. The first is that the vents on the back aren&#x27;t big enough to allow the shaving cream to move through the blades. This is not a big issue, but it does become a little nuisance. This really didn&#x27;t affect my experience other than having to rinse the blade a lot more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason I gave this a 2 star rating is that the blades seem to dull really quickly. I mainly use these to shave my head and if I&#x27;m not careful I&#x27;ll cut my whole head up. These are not big cuts, but they do cause small scars to form and on a few occasions have drawn blood. His also doesn&#x27;t typically happen after a few uses. I can only really use the blades once before they start to cut my head, sometimes they even new ones start to cut. I&#x27;ve used M5 Magnum in the past. I bought them from Costco (Razor, 20 Cartridges and a travel case for $20) and they were the best blades I have ever used. Even better than the most expensive Gillette. But that high quality seems to be gone. I bought more to see if I might have just gotten a bad batch so when they come in I&#x27;ll update.</li>
