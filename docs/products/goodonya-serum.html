            <li>I will continue using for sure.</li>
            <li>Even though I am not in love with the product, I would consider dealing with the things I don&#x27;t love if I see noticeable differences in a couple of months.</li>
            <li>I use their skin treat every day - on my face and my body and love how it lives up to its name.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she really enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The good stuff: even though it is quite watery it goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I. &#x27;m also impressed with how long it lasts almost 2 monthse.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I think in general their stuff is really great.</li>
            <li>I have been using these fine products for over a year now, and my mid-sixties skin responds well to the quality ingredients they use.</li>
            <li>I am sure this product works magic on certain type of skin</li>
            <li>Dreamy smooth sensation.</li>
            <li>Fragrances are endemic to the ingredients - fresh and appropriate.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have tried from this company, and I must say I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the ingredients and it really seems to be doing its job!</li>
            <li>Perks the eyes right up!  </li>
            <li>It does dissipate quickly though!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, but packaging didn&#x27;t match listing photo.</li>
            <li>have not used it long enough to state whether it helps with wrinkles, but the ingredients are great and it does very feel nice on my face.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it too believe it or not, it shrinks up his baggy under eyes pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>love the good on ya cream, so I&#x27;m not sure why I had a reaction to this particular product...</li>
            <li>Most other products last just a month and in most cases cost more.</li>
            <li>This is not my first product from the GoodonYa&#x27; company.</li>
            <li>I put this on at night before bed, and after only a couple of uses, I am waking up looking more rested and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it works instantly to freshen up my eyes and face.</li>
            <li>my eyes felt much tighter!</li>
            <li>I also love that this is completely unscented so that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice lotion but a little watery.</li>
            <li>It feels very moisturizing and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use almost the whole line.</li>
            <li>I also really like doing business with a small business with enthusiastic staff that believes in their products and conveys that to their customers.</li>
            <li>i have been using it for about a year and a half and have been pleased  with its ability to lesson the undereye puffiness, eliminate crows feet and smooth the upper lid.</li>
            <li>Will buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>product is much more of a watery liquid than a serum- which I typically think of is a thicker liquid.</li>
            <li>Instead, I got the regular (Manuka honey based) facial cream and that worked so much better for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those with normal skin</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if it helps with fine lines or wrinkles, I only used it for a week before realizing that I was having a strange reaction to the product and had to stop using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottle had clearly leaked at some point, though it didn&#x27;t appear too much of the product had leaked out, the outside of the bottle was somewhat messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will say I have sensitive skin, and chemical allergies - so that may have played a part.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just started using it, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>This is the only product from Goodonya that I did not like so much</li>

            <li> Different item received</li>
            <li> This is Crap don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Great product.  I wish you would make makeup!</li>
            <li> This is not my first product from the GoodonYa&#x27; company. I think in general their stuff is really great. I did not love this as much as I was hoping to. 1- it was wrapped and protected well in bubble wrap, but because their is no box the only directions are on the bottle and the writing is teeny tiny. It was very hard for me to read it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is much more of a watery liquid than a serum- which I typically think of is a thicker liquid. I also did not care for the smell. It does dissipate quickly though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good stuff: even though it is quite watery it goes on smoothly and dries quickly. It does not feel sticky at all. It feels very moisturizing and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it long enough to state whether it helps with wrinkles, but the ingredients are great and it does very feel nice on my face. I will continue using for sure. Even though I am not in love with the product, I would consider dealing with the things I don&#x27;t love if I see noticeable differences in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom for Christmas as she has been asking me for a good eye and wrinkle handling. She tried it for the first time today and LOVED IT! she sent me a picture and I couldn&#x27;t believe the instant difference. We are both very happy with this product! :)</li>
            <li> This products are tremendous!!</li>
            <li> Dreamy smooth sensation. What a great product and really worth a try. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I have been using these fine products for over a year now, and my mid-sixties skin responds well to the quality ingredients they use. The suggestion not to put anything on our faces we can&#x27;t eat is apt for the GoodOnYa&#x27; line. Though I don&#x27;t eat it, it seems like I could. I use almost the whole line. I use their skin treat every day - on my face and my body and love how it lives up to its name. Their shampoo is gentle; the conditioner lasts forever - a small amount has eliminated once-intractable tangles that existed in my wet hair no matter what conditioner I used. Fragrances are endemic to the ingredients - fresh and appropriate. I also really like doing business with a small business with enthusiastic staff that believes in their products and conveys that to their customers. My husband uses the products as well. We both heartily recommend giving them a try.</li>
            <li> This product cause me to get tiny bumps all around my eyes when I used it - I had hoped it would pass, but I noticed after each use the bumps got worse. Within a few days of discontinuing use the bumps went away. I can&#x27;t tell you if it helps with fine lines or wrinkles, I only used it for a week before realizing that I was having a strange reaction to the product and had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the good on ya cream, so I&#x27;m not sure why I had a reaction to this particular product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I have sensitive skin, and chemical allergies - so that may have played a part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with normal skin I imagine this product would probably work wonders.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have tried from this company, and I must say I love it.  I put this on at night before bed, and after only a couple of uses, I am waking up looking more rested and refreshed.  I also love that this is completely unscented so that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.  I am looking forward to seeing more results in the coming weeks and months!</li>
            <li> Nice lotion but a little watery. Goes on nice and dries quickly.  I just started using it, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients and it really seems to be doing its job!</li>
            <li> Incredibly effective serum! I love it and it works instantly to freshen up my eyes and face. I start the day with it and feel that I look a few years younger. My husband loves it too believe it or not, it shrinks up his baggy under eyes pretty quickly. You only need a drop or two and it dries in a minute. Love this serum!</li>
            <li> This is the only product from Goodonya that I did not like so much and I&#x27;ve sent it back. My under-eye area is very dry and this serum made it worse. Instead, I got the regular (Manuka honey based) facial cream and that worked so much better for me. I am sure this product works magic on certain type of skin and I suggest you check on that before you decide to buy it.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on I could feel a difference....my eyes felt much tighter! Looking forward to the long term benefits!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye serums  i have tried in my 77 years, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  i have been using it for about a year and a half and have been pleased  with its ability to lesson the undereye puffiness, eliminate crows feet and smooth the upper lid.I. &#x27;m also impressed with how long it lasts almost 2 monthse.Most other products last just a month and in most cases cost more. Another plus product arrives within a few days and the company is very responsive to questions. I found with all thier products I have used a little goes a long way, skin cleansers,skin cream and of course this eye serum.  Agreat product,great value!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she really enjoyed it.  She also shared it with her sister and mother who liked it as well.  It&#x27;s great to be able to find cosmetic products with organic ingredients! Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Will buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available. Best Anti Aging product ever.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, but packaging didn&#x27;t match listing photo. Bottle had clearly leaked at some point, though it didn&#x27;t appear too much of the product had leaked out, the outside of the bottle was somewhat messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No noticeable results yet, but no adverse effects either, as noted in some other reviews.</li>
            <li> Perks the eyes right up!  Seeing a difference in a very short period of time.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what three months will bring!</li>
