            <li>One lathering and my washcloth is good for the whole shower.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this clean, clear, wonderful smelling natural soap.</li>
            <li>I have never smelled frankincense or myrrh, so I don&#x27;t know if this soap accurately represents those aromas.  </li>
            <li>The shea is very moisturizing and feels nice in the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap is not only great for face wash, but you can use it as a shave soap as it lathers well.  </li>
            <li>They are buy one get on free at Walgreens now</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after use.</li>
            <li>But the bar goes pretty fast good for the skin even toning process.. Will order again</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it dries out my body skin too.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>Not drying but still leaves you squeaky clean</li>
            <li>I love that ths soap is all natural with no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li>It helps your skin however when you rinse leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shea butter content is very high, so you are getting all the good properties of natural shea butter.</li>
            <li>I rarely have breakouts and can clean my skin with coconut oil without any blemishes.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and fades away quickly, which I prefer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in good condition, but I deducted a star due to price.</li>
            <li>I also use Keri lotion (shea formula) to complete the regimen :)</li>
            <li>But man, does this thing moisturize, far better than the \\&quot;Kiss</li>
            <li>Great product for dry skin - highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I did find it by chance at Target on clearance and bought a large supply!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVEEEE this bar!</li>
            <li>It is a pretty hefty size bar as well.</li>
            <li>looks like the famous big \\&quot;Kiss</li>
            <li>It is very drying to my skin.</li>
            <li>cleans but very drying</li>
            <li>Soap is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Apparently people are already aware of this issue and are smelling this soap before buying it (or rather not buying).</li>
            <li>and I liked the continuous smell of it that continued to smell even when it became just a little piece of it left.</li>
            <li>My new fave shower soap ^-^</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather as easy as normal soap, but gets there with a little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using it for a week on face and body and leaves skin so very soft.</li>
            <li>Works well on my combination skin year &#x27;round, and I love the subtle sexy scent.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It creates a rich lather with very little amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 and was getting the occasional wrinkle and crows feet, and after using this soap, along with the raw shea moisturizer (which I make myself using Bella Shea Butter), I have noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>My Face\\&quot; olive oil soap -- it&#x27;s very large and a rather dreary color of olive green.</li>
            <li>No film left behind &amp; you literally feel clean!</li>
            <li>First off, the shea butter is so healing and nourishing, my skin looks ten years younger after having used this soap (along with raw shea butter as a moisturizer for face and body).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and THIS is giving me the excuse I need!</li>
            <li> And one bar lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Then I bought another two bars, exactly the same one kind and started using one and became very disappointed to see that there is no more smell in this bar</li>
            <li> Went back yesterday as I\\&quot;m down to 1 bar...and...</li>
            <li> I would estimate that it is double the size of any typical bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I struggle to hold it in one hand if it&#x27;s slippery and wet.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few soaps I&#x27;ve tried that actually moisturizes my hands and face from use.  </li>
            <li> I had started using it this winter due to my skin drying out.</li>
            <li> I was buying a bunch of other Shea Moisture stuff, and I accidentally bought a bar of this soap.</li>
            <li> I am now in the process of fixing my once soft skin with an oil regiment as any cleanser makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I can buy it for less at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I got it on another site where it was substantially cheaper than the price shown here, but it&#x27;s not really cheap wherever you get it.</li>
            <li> I had small bumps on thighs.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase it through an affiliate of Amazon&#x27;s ( Soap.com), they were sold out.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I don&#x27;t much like to spend a fortune on bar soap.</li>
            <li> My family has complained about the smell, but I like the soap</li>
            <li> Dimensions are approximately 4 in × 2 in × 1.25 in (from memory).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am not worried about the smell, as long as it didn&#x27;t smell like crap or throw up.</li>
            <li> Needless to I wouldn&#x27;t be buying it here.</li>
            <li> That too bad because I like shopping here.</li>
            <li> wish the price of this wasn&#x27;t so outrageous.</li>

            <li> 1. You can&#x27;t quite tell from the picture, but this bar of soap in quite hefty.  I couldn&#x27;t even wrap my hand around it.  I would estimate that it is double the size of any typical bar of soap. Dimensions are approximately 4 in × 2 in × 1.25 in (from memory).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I have never smelled frankincense or myrrh, so I don&#x27;t know if this soap accurately represents those aromas.  I do like the smell.  I would say it suits a man more than a woman, but to each their own.  Definitely a rich, warm scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Rinses clean.  Doesn&#x27;t lather as easy as normal soap, but gets there with a little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would buy this soap again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it, asking for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product which was suggested by my nurse practitioner.</li>
            <li> I stocked up on this soap when it was on sale at my local Target. Went back yesterday as I\\&quot;m down to 1 bar...and...it&#x27;s no longer available!!! They have OTHERS...but not THIS one...and THIS one is my FAVORITE!  $5 in store..$9 online?? Guess I&#x27;ll try to replicate it and make it myself!! I&#x27;ve been wanting to start soaping..and THIS is giving me the excuse I need!</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin - highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever!  Will keep buying when possible. I wash my face with it every night before moisturizer and i have seen great results for my rosacea and Dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love the soap. the only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; is the price. at 5$ a Bar it makes sense. at 10$ its not&lt;br /&gt;The smell, texture and feeling using is great.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I also use Keri lotion (shea formula) to complete the regimen :)</li>
            <li> Love how the soap smells and makes my skin feel all over body. It has smoothed my the skin on my thighs.  I had small bumps on thighs.  Not anymore since use of this soap</li>
            <li> Not drying but still leaves you squeaky clean</li>
            <li> I use on face and body.  This moisturizes well.  I&#x27;ve even used as shampoo and it works well.</li>
            <li> I rarely have breakouts and can clean my skin with coconut oil without any blemishes. I used this bar on my face a few days and my skin became very irritated with dry patches. I am now in the process of fixing my once soft skin with an oil regiment as any cleanser makes it worse. I am pretty sure it dries out my body skin too.</li>
            <li> This bar of soap is awesome.  It smells great and the smell lasts all day!</li>
            <li> My personal favorite bar soap!!! Love it!  Works well on my combination skin year &#x27;round, and I love the subtle sexy scent.</li>
            <li> Weeks ago I bought their soap bar and I liked the continuous smell of it that continued to smell even when it became just a little piece of it left. It is called &amp;#34;Raw Shea Butter Soap&amp;#34; w/extracts of Frankincense &amp; Myrrh 8 oz. 230 g.&amp;#34; and I saved the wrapping plastic in its entirety. Then I bought another two bars, exactly the same one kind and started using one and became very disappointed to see that there is no more smell in this bar and it just smells like a simple &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; household soap that I can buy for 50 cents a piece at some stores. I feel cheated. I went to the store again and I noticed that two the same bars of the soap are still there on the same shelve weeks later, unsold, but with slightly cut open ends. Apparently people are already aware of this issue and are smelling this soap before buying it (or rather not buying). So now I am stuck with two bars of this soap that are unpacked unwrapped, so I can not return them to the store and I am out of around $11 for 2 bars of soap that I can buy for $1.</li>
            <li> A solid four star product. I love that ths soap is all natural with no nasty chemicals. The shea is very moisturizing and feels nice in the skin. And one bar lasts a very long time. If anything the bar is too big. It&#x27;s so big I struggle to hold it in one hand if it&#x27;s slippery and wet. I wish they would put two smaller sized bars in a pack that added up to tbe same ounces and price. My only complaint is that it has a funny smell that lingers for hours afterwards. My family has complained about the smell, but I like the soap so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> With it being Shea Butter and all I have heard about Shea butter is its great for moisturizing. This soap was the opposite of that. Yea it cleans and its kind of like a dial soap. It is very drying to my skin. I have eczema, so this soap did not help. Smells ok but I am not worried about the smell, as long as it didn&#x27;t smell like crap or throw up. but any way I will not be ordering this soap again. it just dries out my skin. cleans but very drying</li>
            <li> I LOVE this clean, clear, wonderful smelling natural soap.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of my skin after using this soap, and the smell is refreshing.</li>
            <li> This Soap is amazing. I had started using it this winter due to my skin drying out. After just a week my skin started to improve. I also now have my sister and mom using this. It helps your skin however when you rinse leaves your skin feeling clean. Not like there is a layer on it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic soap.  I&#x27;ve gone through and tried a bunch of soaps for washing my face before shaving.  This soap is not only great for face wash, but you can use it as a shave soap as it lathers well.  This is one of the few soaps I&#x27;ve tried that actually moisturizes my hands and face from use.  It&#x27;s shea butter content is very high, so you are getting all the good properties of natural shea butter.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVEEEE this bar! It&#x27;s so luxurious and smells so good! No film left behind &amp; you literally feel clean! It is a pretty hefty size bar as well. My new fave shower soap ^-^</li>
            <li> I like it smell ok.. But the bar goes pretty fast good for the skin even toning process.. Will order again</li>
            <li> I was buying a bunch of other Shea Moisture stuff, and I accidentally bought a bar of this soap. I was disappointed because I don&#x27;t much like to spend a fortune on bar soap. However, once I started using this I became an instant convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the famous big \\&quot;Kiss My Face\\&quot; olive oil soap -- it&#x27;s very large and a rather dreary color of olive green. But man, does this thing moisturize, far better than the \\&quot;Kiss My Face.\\&quot; In the middle of winter, after washing in chlorinated water, my hands feel silky! And I love using this in the bath because the lather doesn&#x27;t quit. One lathering and my washcloth is good for the whole shower. The scent is mild and fades away quickly, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the price of this wasn&#x27;t so outrageous. I got it on another site where it was substantially cheaper than the price shown here, but it&#x27;s not really cheap wherever you get it. But it&#x27;s amazing, so I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep shelling out for it.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. I would travel miles to get it, and it literally did. I wish they would sell this outside the US.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. They are buy one get on free at Walgreens now</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful. It creates a rich lather with very little amount. My skin feels smooth after use. I agree it is pricey but it is a great product. I did find it by chance at Target on clearance and bought a large supply!</li>
            <li> Soap is very moisturizing. Been using it for a week on face and body and leaves skin so very soft.</li>
            <li> I love the soap. I usually purchase it through an affiliate of Amazon&#x27;s ( Soap.com), they were sold out. So I came here to buy it, but to my surprise it coast DOUBLE the price on Amazon than everywhere else I&#x27;ve looked ( Target etc..) Needless to I wouldn&#x27;t be buying it here. That too bad because I like shopping here.</li>
            <li> I adore this soap!  First off, the shea butter is so healing and nourishing, my skin looks ten years younger after having used this soap (along with raw shea butter as a moisturizer for face and body).  I get compliments all the time on how good my skin looks.  I&#x27;m 40 and was getting the occasional wrinkle and crows feet, and after using this soap, along with the raw shea moisturizer (which I make myself using Bella Shea Butter), I have noticed a huge difference.  No blemishes, super-smooth skin, and the wrinkles are GONE.  And that isn&#x27;t to mention the beautiful, gorgeous fragrance.  I would love to find it bottled so I could use it as perfume!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Smells  great and cleans great. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This soap smells great, lathers well, and works for my very sensitive skin! It arrived quickly and in good condition, but I deducted a star due to price. I can buy it for less at the drug store.</li>
