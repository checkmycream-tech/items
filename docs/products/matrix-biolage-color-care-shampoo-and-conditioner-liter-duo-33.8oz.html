            <li>It leaves your hair feeling soft and clean.  </li>

            <li>This product works very well</li>

            <li>In the meantime, I have switched to other shampoo and conditioner sets (including organic and all natural), but i always feel this shampoo and conditioner cleans the oil and hair products out of my hair better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>makes my hair soft and shiny, especially since my hair has been bleached.</li>
            <li>It is not all that expensive for the amount of product which is nice for those of us who are a strict budget.</li>
            <li>I have gotten away from using it due to the high cost.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping my hair would feel a little better than it does after using this combo for some time, but my hair feels lifeless and dull</li>

            <li> great shampoo and conditioner. makes my hair soft and shiny, especially since my hair has been bleached.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been coloring my hair forever, and this is the only product that I have found that works for me.  It leaves my hair clean, soft, and shiny.  Once I found this product, I have no need to use any other.  I highly recommend this product.  But keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  This product really works for me and I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent products for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I color my hair A LOT and by a lot i mean every two weeks. I have been everything from a platinum blonde to have bright red hair to dark brown then back to platinum and then candy cane hair. This shampoo always smells amazing and i always get complements from people I work with and total strangers. This also keeps the color in my hair lasting longer. But with the conditioner I like to leave it on a little longer in the shower or sleep with it in my hair overnight and it keeps my hair silky smoother. I always purchase this same product from this buyer when I run out. Will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use in the shower when you buy the pumps to add to these and the stuff smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for years. In the meantime, I have switched to other shampoo and conditioner sets (including organic and all natural), but i always feel this shampoo and conditioner cleans the oil and hair products out of my hair better than any other shampoo. I also feel it protects my hair color very well in between trips to the salon. I have very fine thin hair that I color about every 3 months (which is awful!!!) but i feel this product takes very good care of my hair. It does not weigh my hair down which is necessary for girls with fine thin hair like myself.  It is not all that expensive for the amount of product which is nice for those of us who are a strict budget. If you want a basic salon grade shampoo and conditioner, i would definitely recommend this set!&lt;br /&gt;Oh and PS...it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this order. They did not have the 33 liter bottle for the shampoo so they sent me two smaller shampoo bottles to compensate for what they did not have. I was very pleased. They also added in a travel pack of shampoo and conditioner. This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair so smooth and smelling so great. I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful, but it left my bleached hair too dry.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner combo keeps your color looking good from salon visit to salon visit.  My color does not fade and my hair remains soft and silky.  The fragrance is amazing too.  The price was 50% less than purchasing in a salon.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser wanted me to use products for color treated hair.  I hate stopping at a special store!  Love the convenience and size PLUS I get the &#x27;color care&#x27; that my hairdresser wants me to have at a good price.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner, and this was a good  price.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this on Amazon less than they sell it in the salon. I am on a fixed income so I need to find ways to cut costs where&lt;br /&gt;ever I can. This product works very well w my color treated hair. The smell is kinda sweet and fruity like. My finacee loves the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Perfect for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything but Biolage, it takes care of damaged hair and makes it like new.  I had ruined my hair by over coloring it; it looked horrible and scraggly.  I went to a hair dresser, she suggested Biolage to get my hair back into shape.  I tried it, it worked wonders on my hair!! now I wont use anything else.  My hair has never felt so soft and manageable!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing....and great for the hair too!</li>
            <li> Not good makes my hair dry</li>
            <li> I found a review online claiming this is the number one shampoo for colored hair.  I was not so impressed.  My hair is even drier than before, and it didn&#x27;t seem to protect the color any more than my last shampoo.  It contains sulphates, which are very drying ingredients.  I am half way through the bottles, but I am switching to a sulphate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> LOVE Biolage products. The scent is sooo nice smelling and these leave my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Smells good but ultimately not great for my hair. I&#x27;ve been using this to wash my dog (which it is pretty good for, he always smells great)</li>
            <li> I was hoping my hair would feel a little better than it does after using this combo for some time, but my hair feels lifeless and dull and I think these products might be the reason. For the price, I think it is a good deal and it should last a very long time which is now a dilemma because I don&#x27;t like the product and I have so much of it left.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using these two products - they work very well. They have a very nice smell and are very easy to use. Lots of good lather from the shampoo. I will certainly keep buying these 2 products!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner for color treated hair.  I have gotten away from using it due to the high cost.  Purchased from this seller as soon as I saw the price!!!  Fast delivery and I am so happy to be using biologe again!</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo and conditioner my hair dresser uses on me at the salon...makes my hair feel so soft and manageable.</li>

            <li> This shampoo is great for color treated hair. It leaves your hair feeling soft and clean.  Your hair smells good for days.</li>
            <li> great price fast delivery</li>
            <li> Everything was great!</li>
            <li> Dried out my long highlighted hair- color care therapie is much better</li>
            <li> I thought it would help my hair not fade as quickly, but I have found that it fades just as quick with this as a less expensive item.  I would not purchase again.</li>
