            <li>it&#x27;s better than the original one ...</li>
            <li>It can make my hair smooth without any knot when I put my conditioner.</li>
            <li>This works just as great as the Original Tangle Teezer, only it doesn&#x27;t have any cracks or a handle to hold water.  </li>
            <li>Does not work very effectively on a child&#x27;s long hair when there are already tangles.</li>
            <li>Great for wet hair, even after salt water!</li>
            <li>This is exactly it.  </li>
            <li>It take me much time and there is still some knot for my hair.</li>
            <li>Really recommend it.</li>
            <li>straight down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really works in my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>It runs through my daughter&#x27;s extremely think and curly hair hurt free every time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it .i</li>
            <li>The only thing that feels a bit odd at first is that it is so light weight.</li>
            <li>I have a six year old girl who hates brushing her tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>Easily resolved by parting hair down the middle and brushing hair</li>
            <li>Comb your hair easily, cut small.</li>
            <li>For example, if I start at my forehead, it touches scalp to just past the crown, but then only combs the top layer of hair.  </li>
            <li>Usually I use my hand to make the hair smooth with conditioner when I take shower.</li>
            <li>If your hair is wet, don&#x27;t use a normal comb, cuz it will damage your hair.</li>
            <li>the bristles are not long enough to go through all of my hair at once.  </li>

            <li> This one is really good. Usually I use my hand to make the hair smooth with conditioner when I take shower. It take me much time and there is still some knot for my hair. But this hairbrush totally solve my problem. It can make my hair smooth without any knot when I put my conditioner. I feel so good for that. Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works just as great as the Original Tangle Teezer, only it doesn&#x27;t have any cracks or a handle to hold water.  No standing water &#x3D; no mold.&lt;br /&gt;I have LONG THICK hair.  the bristles are not long enough to go through all of my hair at once.  For example, if I start at my forehead, it touches scalp to just past the crown, but then only combs the top layer of hair.  Easily resolved by parting hair down the middle and brushing hair straight down.&lt;br /&gt;Would definately purchase again, more as gifts too!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I can&#x27;t live without it .i carry it with me when I am travelling. I wish I found this sooner.</li>
            <li> Very smooth to handle the hair</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have long hair. But the teeth of the brush are too short that it can not reach the roots of the hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair is wet, don&#x27;t use a normal comb, cuz it will damage your hair. This one is different tho, you can see the difference if you use it while taking a shower every time.</li>
            <li> Easy to brush your hair with this! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Great for wet hair, even after salt water! Gets the tangles out so your hair can dry without looking like a standard poodle.</li>

            <li> really works in my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Brightly colored, the quality is also very good. Comb your hair easily, cut small. Sense for me to recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a brush that could be used in the shower that would not get water logged.  This is exactly it.  It is great.  It runs through my daughter&#x27;s extremely think and curly hair hurt free every time.  The brush is hollow.  The bottom has a surface with plenty of holes in it for drainage.  The bristles are of great quality.  The shape has a great feel to it in your hand.  It is very comfortable to use.  The only thing that feels a bit odd at first is that it is so light weight.</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s better than the original one ...</li>
