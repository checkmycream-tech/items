            <li>Feels good on my face, and it works well.</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased it after reading so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Nice fine mist spray....perfection.</li>
            <li>but it does the job better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>over 10 hrs and no smudges when you spray it on top of your make up like</li>
            <li>This did keep my make up on pretty good</li>
            <li>Turns out, Scandinavia is just cheap.</li>
            <li>Keeps my makeup looking great all day long.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing worked better for me than urban decays oil control setting spray but made me break out (I have very sensitive skin) won&#x27;t be buying again but would recommend</li>
            <li>Other than that, no complaints - pleasant scent, no irritation.</li>
            <li>It certainly helps more than not using a finishing spray, but I&#x27;ve found that the Urban Decay sprays are better for my skin</li>
            <li>It does keep my make up longer and fresh</li>
            <li>The product is great but the size is way to small for the price.</li>
            <li>Great product, but a very small bottle.</li>
            <li>This finishing spray works pretty well for my very oily skin.</li>
            <li>I expected better from this product.</li>
            <li>Helps with my oily skin fast shipping I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Will repurchase as this did work better than my Model Setting Spray and a few others.</li>
            <li>Go from natural to cakey in three sprays!</li>
            <li>Wish the spray nozzle allowed a finer spray, but as far as the product - no complaints.</li>
            <li>Makes a big difference in how long my makeup looks fresh.</li>
            <li>I am african american, medium tone and have very oily skin</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good bargain compared to some expensive ones which don&#x27;t do half of what this does.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Helps makeup stay put, but I still get a bit oily.</li>
            <li> Nice fine mist spray....perfection.</li>
            <li> I have a oily skin and thought this product might help. But it didn&#x27;t at all. If you have oily skin don&#x27;t go for this product it&#x27;s not gonna help at all.</li>
            <li> Wish the spray nozzle allowed a finer spray, but as far as the product - no complaints. Feels good on my face, and it works well. Makes a big difference in how long my makeup looks fresh.</li>
            <li> Keeps my makeup looking great all day long.  Usually my face gets really shiny and oily looking by a few hours into the day but after spraying on this product there is no shine all day long</li>
            <li> Feels like spraying alcohol on my face. Not worth the price at ALL!!!! Also alters the finish of your makeup. Go from natural to cakey in three sprays! Yayyyy</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and I like it.  I have very oily skin so by late afternoon, there is some &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; but I expected that considering my skin type.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good product for the price and I will likely purchase again.  P.S.  I used it daily and it lasted about  45 days.</li>
            <li> Locks my make-up in place and keeps my t-zone from getting as oily as it usually gets. Still have to blot a few hours into my day but it does the job better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference in my oily shine when wearing make up.</li>
            <li> I expected better from this product. It certainly helps more than not using a finishing spray, but I&#x27;ve found that the Urban Decay sprays are better for my skin [[ASIN:B00GX8IZ1O Urban Oil Control Makeup Setting Spray]]. When I finish those, several others have been recommended to me to try. I would suggest reading reviews of various sprays as regards your skin type - this didn&#x27;t do it for my oily skin. Other than that, no complaints - pleasant scent, no irritation.</li>
            <li> Great product, but a very small bottle. will last about a month</li>
            <li> Im not sure where all the positive reviews are coming from, it must be desperate sellers trying to get rid of this crummy product. I purchased this in an attempt to find a cheaper alternative to Smashbox oil control primer thinking the Skindinavia spray would be similar to Urban Decay De-Slick setting spray.Turns out, Scandinavia is just cheap. I would have had better oil control results smearing a greasy piece of fried chicken all over my face. This product made my face oilier than if I had used nothing, it was oily from the moment it touched my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a waste of money. Sometimes you just have to suck it up and pay for quality!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like the liquid spray dried. Just sat on my face. It reduced no oil. Makeup wore and I found this pointless. I am african american, medium tone and have very oily skin</li>
            <li> This makes my makeup look airbrushed without the need for powder. It improves the look of my foundation even if it is looking on the cakey side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing worked better for me than urban decays oil control setting spray but made me break out (I have very sensitive skin) won&#x27;t be buying again but would recommend</li>
            <li> Best make up setting spray I&#x27;ve ever used.So glad I purchased it after reading so many good reviews.It does keep my make up longer and fresh over 10 hrs and no smudges when you spray it on top of your make up like some in the market do. If you are looking for a make up settimg spray, yes I would recommend this,for the price it&#x27;s a good bargain compared to some expensive ones which don&#x27;t do half of what this does. Its awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Its just awesome.</li>
            <li> The product is great but the size is way to small for the price.</li>
            <li> Helps with my oily skin fast shipping I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame the product. I have extremely oily skin. I was hoping it would help so my makeup didn&#x27;t look greasy and smudge. I found that my eye makeup with smudge off with this spray.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and I&#x27;ll put my make up on and by the end of day it&#x27;s gone. I use this spray and it stays all day! My blush and foundation stay all day. My skin is dry and this has even helped with my breakouts. It controls oil so well.</li>
            <li> This finishing spray works pretty well for my very oily skin. It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like others I have tried.  I have to blot and touch up my foundation a bit after 4 hours then re-spray, but it is not like I have to re-apply my make-up from scratch.  I do notice a difference if I forget to use it - my face is oily within 2 hours!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hurt nor help.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin. This did keep my make up on pretty good but after awhile there was some almost dryness or cracking in my makeup. Granted that was about 6 hours after I applied it. Will repurchase as this did work better than my Model Setting Spray and a few others.</li>
            <li> Nope. Didn&#x27;t work for me. I still had shine. A LOT of shine. I am not impressed at all. To expensive for no results.</li>
            <li> terrible. too expensive for the quantity and does not work well</li>
