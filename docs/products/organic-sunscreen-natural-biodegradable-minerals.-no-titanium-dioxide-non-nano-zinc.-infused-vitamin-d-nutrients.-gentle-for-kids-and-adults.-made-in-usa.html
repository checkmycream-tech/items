            <li> Finally found a sunscreen with natural ingredients</li>
            <li> My problem with other brands was either that is was too thick/difficult to rub in or too oily for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this did not cause me to break out as some with chemicals have in the past.</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry, especially in the summer when we go as a family to Wyoming, due to the relentless wind.</li>
            <li> I am also a nurse and read product labels carefully.  </li>
            <li> has to be careful what she puts on her skin.</li>
            <li> It works well, but a little pasty for me.</li>
            <li> and it does blend in with a little work I then put lotion over it to help it blend and with the smell because I do not like the smell at all</li>
            <li> The bottle was very aged and the product very thick.  </li>
            <li> It smells like it is too old and burned terribly when it went in my eyes after I sweat.</li>
            <li> I returned this unfortunately; it smells terrible and the packaging was indented and appeared to be damaged.</li>
            <li> The worst sunscreen I have purchasd and will finish.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed !!!</li>

            <li> This sunscreen smells fabulous and goes on smooth.  I love that it is not full of chemicals and I feel safe putting it on the whole family.  Living in Colorado, it is important to have a sunscreen, yet I also don&#x27;t want to limit the opportunity to get my Vit D from the sun - now I can use sunscreen and know that I am not depriving my body of the Vit D that it needs. Great product!</li>
            <li> What a great find!  Finally a suntan lotion that I can use on my face every day with out the grease.  I also know that I am getting the much needed vitamin C.  We have used it on all occasions.  So far we have not gotten burned using this product.  It is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - nourishing and protective to the skin, and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> We did not like the smell of it at all......</li>
            <li> It works well, but a little pasty for me.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen. works on my kids sensitive skin and keeps them protected. Non greasy, water resistant-It&#x27;s organic and the ingredients are safe, gentle and effective. I use it before applying makeup like a moisturizer and make up goes on well over. good lasting, no Titanium Dioxidefast, added vitamin D and minerals. shipping, good value.</li>
            <li> I would no recommend or purchase again.  The bottle was very aged and the product very thick.  The worst sunscreen I have purchasd and will finish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  care for the smell but otherwise good product and it does blend in with a little work I then put lotion over it to help it blend and with the smell because I do not like the smell at all</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  Have tried many different natural and organic sunscreens and this is my fave. My problem with other brands was either that is was too thick/difficult to rub in or too oily for my sensitive skin.  This smooths into skin easily without being greasy (no breakouts) and it works too, no sunburn, even after swimming. It also doesn&#x27;t leave me looking like a ghost, absorbs well into the skin. Great for both face and body. Only buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much, it did not leave a white residue. Plan to buy another bottle</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! I am a red head, very fair skin tone and this sunscreen protected me from a sun burn while on the water canoeing! I love the outdoors and protect my skin as much as possible. I am also a nurse and read product labels carefully.  This product does what is promised and the customer service from this seller is outstanding.  I will definitely buy this all natural product again!!</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients in this sunscreen also has vitamin D nutrients in it. It allows you to absorb the vitamin D necessary for your body. This is the perfect moisturizer to put on your face before going out. It&#x27;s really easy to apply and evenly goes onto skin.</li>
            <li> This is great sunscreen in part because its organic.  You do not have to worry about putting harmful chemicals on your skin.  It also smells really good.  Not to strong, a light scent.  The texture is also very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky or greasy.  My skin is very sensitive and this did not cause me to break out as some with chemicals have in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t stink. It&#x27;s like my anti aging skin cream, only cheaper! My skin is so dry, especially in the summer when we go as a family to Wyoming, due to the relentless wind. I love that it is a natural product that nourishes and protects my skin. I&#x27;m 42 with 3 kids.  I&#x27;m not goin down without a fight, so I am willing to spend more on quality products that are actually good for my family and I, keepin the wrinkles at bay for as long as possible! Here is a pic from the Platte River in Wyo with my new friend!</li>
            <li> My daughter had skin cancer, &amp; i like the organic all natural ingredients in this sunscreen for her,&lt;br /&gt;She has to be careful what she puts on her skin. This product works well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural sunscreen. I returned this unfortunately; it smells terrible and the packaging was indented and appeared to be damaged. I sampled a tiny amount on my hand and it stinged when I put it on. I&#x27;ll keep looking!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed !!! Just received one bottle instead of two bottles</li>
            <li> Finally found a sunscreen with natural ingredients</li>
            <li> It smells like it is too old and burned terribly when it went in my eyes after I sweat. I had to wash it off to stop the burning.</li>
