            <li>GREAT HANDLE BUT</li>
            <li>This one got great reviews.</li>
            <li>and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Compared to what it would be to buy a teasing comb + a separate brush, this item is a great price.</li>

            <li>Works great for teasing hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for teasing.  </li>
            <li>great brush</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>great tease brush...</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and I love the convenient pick at the end, which helps to part the hair.</li>
            <li>maybe if you already know what you&#x27;re doing this would be a great product, but if you&#x27;re a noob like me, then good luck.</li>
            <li>This brush is also the perfect size, it fits in most of my travel totes</li>
            <li>Great, perfect, just the right size!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved it, so</li>
            <li>It is a really good tasting brush.  </li>
            <li>and I found this to be a good tool.  </li>
            <li>And for a good price, to boot.  </li>
            <li>A good hair tool for the money.</li>
            <li>Like i said the brush works good</li>
            <li>Good thing to buy.</li>
            <li>The price was good, it arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>This doesnt tease as good as i thought it would.</li>
            <li>This does what it says and a good price for a good brush.  </li>
            <li>I think this brush is a good bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>good brush, but the paint on the handle is already chipping off, after taking it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>The pointed end is great for sectioning your hair and the bristles are also good for smoothing out the top of your teased hair.</li>
            <li>This brush works great - much better than just using a comb.</li>
            <li>Great teasing brush, I am very excited about it.</li>
            <li>I love this teasing brush!  </li>
            <li>ordered one more which is on the way to my house!</li>
            <li>gotta love amazon!</li>
            <li>I need more practice on how to use it correctly though!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My favorite brush for adding volume to my hair!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love this brush!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and have to tease it to look good.</li>
            <li>not as good as a teasing comb but works ok</li>
            <li>The bristles also do a good job of smoothing out the top of the hair after teasing.</li>
            <li>This is a handy brush to use not just for teasing but for pulling the softer hairs into a ponytail or smoothing out a sleek bun.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, so</li>
            <li>Looks nice though</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simplify your morning by using this handy tool.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to work with and does a good job, but it doesn&#x27;t quite grip the hair as well as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>It is a good size for my hand and easily teases my hair so that it appears that my hair is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to damage hair as hair is very easy to comb out after use.</li>
            <li>Amazing teasing brush, I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>This brush is easy to use and it will get you the volume you need!</li>
            <li>It teases hair easily and the nice rat tail can bring up the lift.</li>
            <li>The price is right, the size is great, and even though I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>i wanted a cheap teasing brush and this works like a charm!</li>
            <li>I just bought this teasing comb because I am in front of a camera and needed more volume for my hair.</li>
            <li>A rat tailed comb works much better than this comb.</li>
            <li>It has hair bristles as well as nylon bristles which created the static problem.</li>
            <li>Can rat my hair better with a rat tail comb..</li>
            <li>this is because the bristles are so dense you comb more hair at one time.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the item title</li>
            <li>love this teasing brush</li>
            <li>better than a teasing comb :)</li>
            <li>I found it did the job much better.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic ratting/teasing brush!  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>love this brush</li>
            <li>I love this teasing brush.  </li>
            <li>Might work for many, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li>This is totally the best teaser brush that ever existed.</li>
            <li>These are Magic.</li>
            <li>I use them at the salon and clients LOVE them.</li>
            <li>I love love this brush.  </li>
            <li>It works alt better than any teasing comb.  </li>
            <li>Excellent back combing brush.  </li>
            <li>love the handle.</li>
            <li>The tease stays in better that the comb style I was using.  </li>
            <li>I love the way they tease your hair without feeling like they are ripping your hair apart.</li>
            <li>and I already am a fan of the brush, works much better.</li>
            <li>Excellent presentation, nice colors and works as I expected.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my grand daughter because her hair will not hold curls, this helps the curl stay all day/</li>
            <li>This teasing brush will give your hair more volume without damaging it.</li>
            <li>Brush is a nice size with a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>Seemed like it put static in my hair.</li>
            <li>I still prefer to use the pick of the teasing comb to separate my hair as I feel that part does a better job, but the brush part does wonders.</li>
            <li>She has come to work with perfect big hair every day.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush locally after reading great reviews online, and I have to say it does work as advertised!</li>
            <li>I also use for light teasing, which is also effective.</li>
            <li>I use this more than I thought I would.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this was a great purchase I am so happy I decided to go with this &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; style verses some of the other teasing &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; that are out on the market.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good at that.</li>
            <li>I am able to achieve lovely volume without any visible to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>brush is available from many locations at many varying prices</li>
            <li>Excelent And cheap :-)</li>
            <li>You can tease the underside of  your hair and smooth out the top</li>
            <li>I am able to separate the sections out and brush them smooth before curling my hair.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, good quality.</li>
            <li>Good product,  fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This has lasted well so far and is easy to throw in your bag and take on the road as it is a nice size, love it !</li>
            <li>Great little brush doesn&#x27;t pull hair and also good for teasing hair .</li>
            <li>Wish the pick side was thinner but other than that it works great!</li>
            <li>my hair was easy to brush through.</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to tease your hair.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hold on to.  </li>
            <li>The paint on the brush handle chips off fairly easy though.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does what you need it to do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that the handle is like a pointy stick because you can use that to create very straight parts in your hair.</li>
            <li>but i found amazons to be the medium amount with the sweet bonus of free shipping!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect little teasing brush.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;pick\\&quot; handle helps me separate sections and pull up the teased areas to even out the look, then I smooth over with the brush.</li>
            <li>use it everyday and it works great!</li>
            <li>If you just want to tease the hair along your crown/part for some volume, this brush is a great value and skinny enough to carry along in your purse.</li>
            <li>It is great for teasing your hair to get some extra volume.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t end up liking this as well as my cheap plastic teasing comb.</li>
            <li>It easy, you achieve volume quickly and there is no discomfort.</li>
            <li>It easily grabs your hair and works quickly.</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>Now, with this great tool, it takes me half the time and combs out better.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my hair got so much static</li>
            <li>This small brush is perfect for a suitcase or purse</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super great at changing my hairstyles, but when I do rat my hair, it works fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it that much, but i think it works ok.  </li>
            <li>If you want a really good tease you should get a different brush.</li>
            <li>It works great for teasing hair a lot or a little and then, smooths it into style easily.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s pretty easy to throw in your purse</li>
            <li>Other then that im happy it shiped faster then I acaccepted.</li>
            <li>Also good for making your curls a little more relaxed.</li>
            <li>It is decent, i was just expecting a lot more from it.</li>
            <li>Item as ordered...arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush- offered at my Fallon for quite a bit more- helps me with roller setting to divide sections and teasing crown for a classic hair set- would buy again!</li>
            <li>Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I really love this brush and i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I have really loved this brush (and found myself wondering why I waited so long to buy one).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too large and easily fits into my travel toiletries bag.</li>
            <li>The bristles do a great job, and it seems less damaging than using a rattail comb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an easy way to get ready for work with doing one&#x27;s hair, make-up, dressing, and jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are strong and the wooden handle is easy to grip and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I quickly realized, however, that this natural bristle brush is fabulous for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush does a fine job, and I don&#x27;t feel like it does much damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have stick straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>Great little hairbrush.</li>
            <li>I even watched videos on youtube and the results seemed nothing short of amazing...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or seem like it will break; very durable.</li>
            <li>Way better than the old teasing combs.</li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>Not only did it tease much better than a teasing comb, but this teasing brush part also allowed me to smooth out my hair without losing any volume.  </li>
            <li>For teasing light teasing for volume on the sides or back of hair a comb works better.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price paid for it.</li>
            <li>Is small so it is easy to work with and does a good job.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that this was as good as all the other reviews were saying.</li>
            <li>Hair slips right through.</li>
            <li>I use this as a regular brush, my daughter has very fine hair &amp; this</li>
            <li>Works better than  a normal brush for high volume</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and for the first time ever I actually have volume!</li>
            <li>Great for an extra lift for my flat hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spornette little wonder is a really good teasing brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this brush really does the trick!</li>
            <li>Product also works very well!</li>
            <li>Go to Sally and get better quality for the same price range.</li>
            <li>Just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li>It creates A LOT of volume when used properly just be sure you know how to correctly tease your hair...</li>
            <li>Seeing that there are many reviews on here, I decided to make my review short and sweet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but mine looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It works better for combine or for a low maintenance tease.</li>
            <li>This thing really works!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by this great little brush.</li>
            <li>Being a Southern Girl I love big hair, even though my hair does not tease easily.</li>
            <li>I use this with Redken hairspray and Big Sexy texturizing powder, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to tease very well.</li>
            <li>You barely tease, smooth out, and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Gets a good grip on hair and teases well, however I usually just use it on my bangs.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is pretty prickly, so it feels scratchy on my scalp, but this stiffness is what helps it do such a nice job at back brushing.  </li>
            <li>Ended up going to my regular fine tooth comb.</li>
            <li>In the picture it was blue and so that would have been fine.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this!</li>
            <li>The bristles hold on to dust really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks&#x27;</li>
            <li>luck and keep the hair high!</li>
            <li>No bristle shedding, appears to be very well made.</li>
            <li>and they work very well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>This brush is easier and faster to backcomb any area of my hair that needs extra body then smooth over after while retaining the body.</li>
            <li>I really encourage you to buy this brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ease my hair much, but this will do the trick.</li>
            <li>But I like the firmness of the bristles and it does the job of teasing for me very well.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Much easier than a comb to tease your hair.</li>
            <li>But I really like it.</li>
            <li>I need hair tools that can at least make it look like I put up a good fight.</li>
            <li>have extremely fine, flat hair.</li>
            <li>Great stiff brush for extremely short hair.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than any other teasing brush I have used.</li>
            <li>I have straight very fine hair, so I can always use a little lift.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, straight, and really smooth.</li>
            <li>My poofs are big and this is just a great small brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After using the Little Wonder Teasing Brush I noticed how easily it manages to tease my hair - also is useful when untangling my hair.</li>
            <li>This is good for not only teasing but for smoothing hair down when styling or putting hair up in ponytails or buns.</li>
            <li>True to name, definitely a wonder!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a good little teasing brush, and FINALLY, I&#x27;ve found one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much you use it!</li>
            <li>You could use it just to brush your hair, and if you do you will notice more hair than usual coming out at first-</li>
            <li>The main reason I did not give 5 stars is that you cannot chose your color.</li>
            <li>It creates decent puffs</li>
            <li>I then go back and and use the pointed handle to pull layers and tease, smoothing the top back out with the brush.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>This little teasing brush is way better.</li>
            <li>It has an end with a tip that can be used for parting the hair, and the other side (the brush end) can easily be used to either brush or backcomb the hair.</li>
            <li>I use this brush for curling my hair in addition to teasing, so I&#x27;ve been surprised at how much I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this tool everyday, probably more like a couple times a month.  </li>
            <li>Love the small size to back-comb or &#x27;fluff&#x27; to give lift to fine hair.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m asian with really fine long straight hair</li>
            <li>This brush is a cost effective little tool to have, especially for those with oily hair.</li>
            <li>I live this brush.</li>
            <li>Makes me think it was used and passed off and sold as new.</li>
            <li>I used it to make a nice bump at the back of my head and it didn&#x27;t make my hair look messy like it does when I tease with a comb.</li>
            <li>I love this Little Wonder!</li>
            <li>They would tease, but when I would attempt to smooth my \\&quot;bump\\&quot; down, my hair would go right back to the way it was.  </li>
            <li>A quick last-minute check of this brush before packaging would have revealed a large portion of the black glossy finish chipped from the surface.</li>
            <li>Teasing is key to both, and this helps so much!</li>
            <li>This bristle structure not only helps catch all hair, but really tease and tousle your locks!</li>
            <li>Had an odd smell when I opened it, but works just fine.</li>
            <li>It definitly makes my hair fluffy! :)</li>
            <li>It works well on my hair [normal thickness &amp; naturally wavy].</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic little brush.</li>
            <li>I want one a little bit larger now for sure.</li>
            <li>My old brush wasn&#x27;t doing the trick anymore</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and it is of equal quality as those you would find at Sallys</li>
            <li>It has really worked well and doesn&#x27;t pull the curl back out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday to tease my hair or to pull it back smoothly, for all you beauty geeks out there: this is a must have in your hair drawer!</li>
            <li>I use it every day to brush out after blow drying with a different Spornette round brush, and my hair is looking better than ever.  </li>
            <li>Not exactly what I expected; more like a brush than comb, but I do use it often and keep in purse.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t quite strong enough to get a tight snarl</li>
            <li>but this brush is really cheap quality, some of the outer bristles are bent back, not worth ordering.  </li>
            <li>I have natural volume but could never tease my hair to be BIG using a normal teasing comb and</li>
            <li>I ratted my hair then sprayed a little hairspray on it and gently brushed it down and had great volume all day long.</li>
            <li>Nice, firm little brush.</li>
            <li>I have pretty shiny, thick hair, so getting any volume can be pretty tricky.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to mat and knot my hair, at the end of the day even through much thrashing around (playing with the niece and nephew) and rough housing</li>
            <li>No regrets buying it.</li>
            <li>Again, somehow it prompted static and made it worse.</li>
            <li>I have thick, smooth &amp; shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a teasing comb a few months back in an attempt to give my fine, flat hair some volume.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tease well and is too small to be an adequate hair brush.</li>
            <li>Fast service, the brush was larger than expected</li>
            <li>It is very dry here, but it&#x27;s always dry and my hair certainly doesn&#x27;t always look like that.</li>
            <li>but for anyone with medium length hair this brush is exactly what is needed to tease and tame your hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>This little brush really grabs the hair and teases evenly.</li>
            <li>This little brush does so much.</li>

            <li> This brush is great for both teasing and smoothing.</li>
            <li> GREAT HANDLE BUT</li>
            <li> This one got great reviews.</li>
            <li> and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Compared to what it would be to buy a teasing comb + a separate brush, this item is a great price.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great stocking stuffier gift as well.</li>
            <li> Works great for teasing hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for teasing.  </li>
            <li> great brush</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> great tease brush...</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and I love the convenient pick at the end, which helps to part the hair.</li>
            <li> maybe if you already know what you&#x27;re doing this would be a great product, but if you&#x27;re a noob like me, then good luck.</li>
            <li> This brush is also the perfect size, it fits in most of my travel totes</li>
            <li> Great, perfect, just the right size!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved it, so</li>
            <li> It is a really good tasting brush.  </li>
            <li> and I found this to be a good tool.  </li>
            <li> And for a good price, to boot.  </li>
            <li> A good hair tool for the money.</li>
            <li> Like i said the brush works good</li>
            <li> Good thing to buy.</li>
            <li> The price was good, it arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> This doesnt tease as good as i thought it would.</li>
            <li> This does what it says and a good price for a good brush.  </li>
            <li> I think this brush is a good bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> good brush, but the paint on the handle is already chipping off, after taking it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> The pointed end is great for sectioning your hair and the bristles are also good for smoothing out the top of your teased hair.</li>
            <li> This brush works great - much better than just using a comb.</li>
            <li> Great teasing brush, I am very excited about it.</li>
            <li> I love this teasing brush!  </li>
            <li> ordered one more which is on the way to my house!</li>
            <li> gotta love amazon!</li>
            <li> I need more practice on how to use it correctly though!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite brush for adding volume to my hair!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and have to tease it to look good.</li>
            <li> not as good as a teasing comb but works ok</li>
            <li> The bristles also do a good job of smoothing out the top of the hair after teasing.</li>
            <li> This is a handy brush to use not just for teasing but for pulling the softer hairs into a ponytail or smoothing out a sleek bun.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, so</li>
            <li> Looks nice though</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simplify your morning by using this handy tool.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to work with and does a good job, but it doesn&#x27;t quite grip the hair as well as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> It is a good size for my hand and easily teases my hair so that it appears that my hair is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to damage hair as hair is very easy to comb out after use.</li>
            <li> Amazing teasing brush, I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to use and it will get you the volume you need!</li>
            <li> It teases hair easily and the nice rat tail can bring up the lift.</li>
            <li> The price is right, the size is great, and even though I have really fine hair</li>
            <li> i wanted a cheap teasing brush and this works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I just bought this teasing comb because I am in front of a camera and needed more volume for my hair.</li>
            <li> A rat tailed comb works much better than this comb.</li>
            <li> It has hair bristles as well as nylon bristles which created the static problem.</li>
            <li> Can rat my hair better with a rat tail comb..</li>
            <li> this is because the bristles are so dense you comb more hair at one time.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the item title</li>
            <li> love this teasing brush</li>
            <li> better than a teasing comb :)</li>
            <li> I found it did the job much better.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic ratting/teasing brush!  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> love this brush</li>
            <li> I love this teasing brush.  </li>
            <li> Might work for many, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This is totally the best teaser brush that ever existed.</li>
            <li> These are Magic.</li>
            <li> I use them at the salon and clients LOVE them.</li>
            <li> I love love this brush.  </li>
            <li> It works alt better than any teasing comb.  </li>
            <li> Excellent back combing brush.  </li>
            <li> love the handle.</li>
            <li> The tease stays in better that the comb style I was using.  </li>
            <li> I love the way they tease your hair without feeling like they are ripping your hair apart.</li>
            <li> and I already am a fan of the brush, works much better.</li>
            <li> Excellent presentation, nice colors and works as I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand daughter because her hair will not hold curls, this helps the curl stay all day/</li>
            <li> This teasing brush will give your hair more volume without damaging it.</li>
            <li> Brush is a nice size with a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> Seemed like it put static in my hair.</li>
            <li> I still prefer to use the pick of the teasing comb to separate my hair as I feel that part does a better job, but the brush part does wonders.</li>
            <li> She has come to work with perfect big hair every day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush locally after reading great reviews online, and I have to say it does work as advertised!</li>
            <li> I also use for light teasing, which is also effective.</li>
            <li> I use this more than I thought I would.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this was a great purchase I am so happy I decided to go with this &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; style verses some of the other teasing &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; that are out on the market.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty good at that.</li>
            <li> I am able to achieve lovely volume without any visible to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> brush is available from many locations at many varying prices</li>
            <li> Excelent And cheap :-)</li>
            <li> You can tease the underside of  your hair and smooth out the top</li>
            <li> I am able to separate the sections out and brush them smooth before curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, good quality.</li>
            <li> Good product,  fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This has lasted well so far and is easy to throw in your bag and take on the road as it is a nice size, love it !</li>
            <li> Great little brush doesn&#x27;t pull hair and also good for teasing hair .</li>
            <li> Wish the pick side was thinner but other than that it works great!</li>
            <li> my hair was easy to brush through.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to tease your hair.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to hold on to.  </li>
            <li> The paint on the brush handle chips off fairly easy though.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does what you need it to do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that the handle is like a pointy stick because you can use that to create very straight parts in your hair.</li>
            <li> but i found amazons to be the medium amount with the sweet bonus of free shipping!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little teasing brush.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;pick\\&quot; handle helps me separate sections and pull up the teased areas to even out the look, then I smooth over with the brush.</li>
            <li> use it everyday and it works great!</li>
            <li> If you just want to tease the hair along your crown/part for some volume, this brush is a great value and skinny enough to carry along in your purse.</li>
            <li> It is great for teasing your hair to get some extra volume.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up liking this as well as my cheap plastic teasing comb.</li>
            <li> It easy, you achieve volume quickly and there is no discomfort.</li>
            <li> It easily grabs your hair and works quickly.</li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> Now, with this great tool, it takes me half the time and combs out better.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my hair got so much static</li>
            <li> This small brush is perfect for a suitcase or purse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super great at changing my hairstyles, but when I do rat my hair, it works fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it that much, but i think it works ok.  </li>
            <li> If you want a really good tease you should get a different brush.</li>
            <li> It works great for teasing hair a lot or a little and then, smooths it into style easily.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s pretty easy to throw in your purse</li>
            <li> Other then that im happy it shiped faster then I acaccepted.</li>
            <li> Also good for making your curls a little more relaxed.</li>
            <li> It is decent, i was just expecting a lot more from it.</li>
            <li> Item as ordered...arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Great little brush- offered at my Fallon for quite a bit more- helps me with roller setting to divide sections and teasing crown for a classic hair set- would buy again!</li>
            <li> Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I really love this brush and i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I have really loved this brush (and found myself wondering why I waited so long to buy one).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too large and easily fits into my travel toiletries bag.</li>
            <li> The bristles do a great job, and it seems less damaging than using a rattail comb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an easy way to get ready for work with doing one&#x27;s hair, make-up, dressing, and jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are strong and the wooden handle is easy to grip and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I quickly realized, however, that this natural bristle brush is fabulous for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush does a fine job, and I don&#x27;t feel like it does much damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great little brush.</li>
            <li> Great little hairbrush.</li>
            <li> I even watched videos on youtube and the results seemed nothing short of amazing...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or seem like it will break; very durable.</li>
            <li> Way better than the old teasing combs.</li>
            <li> Worth buying.</li>
            <li> Not only did it tease much better than a teasing comb, but this teasing brush part also allowed me to smooth out my hair without losing any volume.  </li>
            <li> For teasing light teasing for volume on the sides or back of hair a comb works better.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price paid for it.</li>
            <li> Is small so it is easy to work with and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this was as good as all the other reviews were saying.</li>
            <li> Hair slips right through.</li>
            <li> I use this as a regular brush, my daughter has very fine hair &amp; this</li>
            <li> Works better than  a normal brush for high volume</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and for the first time ever I actually have volume!</li>
            <li> Great for an extra lift for my flat hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spornette little wonder is a really good teasing brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this brush really does the trick!</li>
            <li> Product also works very well!</li>
            <li> Go to Sally and get better quality for the same price range.</li>
            <li> Just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> It creates A LOT of volume when used properly just be sure you know how to correctly tease your hair...</li>
            <li> Seeing that there are many reviews on here, I decided to make my review short and sweet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but mine looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It works better for combine or for a low maintenance tease.</li>
            <li> This thing really works!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by this great little brush.</li>
            <li> Being a Southern Girl I love big hair, even though my hair does not tease easily.</li>
            <li> I use this with Redken hairspray and Big Sexy texturizing powder, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to tease very well.</li>
            <li> You barely tease, smooth out, and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Gets a good grip on hair and teases well, however I usually just use it on my bangs.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is pretty prickly, so it feels scratchy on my scalp, but this stiffness is what helps it do such a nice job at back brushing.  </li>
            <li> Ended up going to my regular fine tooth comb.</li>
            <li> In the picture it was blue and so that would have been fine.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this!</li>
            <li> The bristles hold on to dust really well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks&#x27;</li>
            <li> luck and keep the hair high!</li>
            <li> No bristle shedding, appears to be very well made.</li>
            <li> and they work very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> This brush is easier and faster to backcomb any area of my hair that needs extra body then smooth over after while retaining the body.</li>
            <li> I really encourage you to buy this brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ease my hair much, but this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> But I like the firmness of the bristles and it does the job of teasing for me very well.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Much easier than a comb to tease your hair.</li>
            <li> But I really like it.</li>
            <li> I need hair tools that can at least make it look like I put up a good fight.</li>
            <li> have extremely fine, flat hair.</li>
            <li> Great stiff brush for extremely short hair.  </li>
            <li> Works much better than any other teasing brush I have used.</li>
            <li> I have straight very fine hair, so I can always use a little lift.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, straight, and really smooth.</li>
            <li> My poofs are big and this is just a great small brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After using the Little Wonder Teasing Brush I noticed how easily it manages to tease my hair - also is useful when untangling my hair.</li>
            <li> This is good for not only teasing but for smoothing hair down when styling or putting hair up in ponytails or buns.</li>
            <li> True to name, definitely a wonder!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a good little teasing brush, and FINALLY, I&#x27;ve found one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much you use it!</li>
            <li> You could use it just to brush your hair, and if you do you will notice more hair than usual coming out at first-</li>
            <li> The main reason I did not give 5 stars is that you cannot chose your color.</li>
            <li> It creates decent puffs</li>
            <li> I then go back and and use the pointed handle to pull layers and tease, smoothing the top back out with the brush.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This little teasing brush is way better.</li>
            <li> It has an end with a tip that can be used for parting the hair, and the other side (the brush end) can easily be used to either brush or backcomb the hair.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for curling my hair in addition to teasing, so I&#x27;ve been surprised at how much I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this tool everyday, probably more like a couple times a month.  </li>
            <li> Love the small size to back-comb or &#x27;fluff&#x27; to give lift to fine hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m asian with really fine long straight hair</li>
            <li> This brush is a cost effective little tool to have, especially for those with oily hair.</li>
            <li> I live this brush.</li>
            <li> Makes me think it was used and passed off and sold as new.</li>
            <li> I used it to make a nice bump at the back of my head and it didn&#x27;t make my hair look messy like it does when I tease with a comb.</li>
            <li> I love this Little Wonder!</li>
            <li> They would tease, but when I would attempt to smooth my \\&quot;bump\\&quot; down, my hair would go right back to the way it was.  </li>
            <li> A quick last-minute check of this brush before packaging would have revealed a large portion of the black glossy finish chipped from the surface.</li>
            <li> Teasing is key to both, and this helps so much!</li>
            <li> This bristle structure not only helps catch all hair, but really tease and tousle your locks!</li>
            <li> Had an odd smell when I opened it, but works just fine.</li>
            <li> It definitly makes my hair fluffy! :)</li>
            <li> It works well on my hair [normal thickness &amp; naturally wavy].</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic little brush.</li>
            <li> I want one a little bit larger now for sure.</li>
            <li> My old brush wasn&#x27;t doing the trick anymore</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and it is of equal quality as those you would find at Sallys</li>
            <li> It has really worked well and doesn&#x27;t pull the curl back out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to tease my hair or to pull it back smoothly, for all you beauty geeks out there: this is a must have in your hair drawer!</li>
            <li> I use it every day to brush out after blow drying with a different Spornette round brush, and my hair is looking better than ever.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected; more like a brush than comb, but I do use it often and keep in purse.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t quite strong enough to get a tight snarl</li>
            <li> but this brush is really cheap quality, some of the outer bristles are bent back, not worth ordering.  </li>
            <li> I have natural volume but could never tease my hair to be BIG using a normal teasing comb and</li>
            <li> I ratted my hair then sprayed a little hairspray on it and gently brushed it down and had great volume all day long.</li>
            <li> Nice, firm little brush.</li>
            <li> I have pretty shiny, thick hair, so getting any volume can be pretty tricky.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to mat and knot my hair, at the end of the day even through much thrashing around (playing with the niece and nephew) and rough housing</li>
            <li> No regrets buying it.</li>
            <li> Again, somehow it prompted static and made it worse.</li>
            <li> I have thick, smooth &amp; shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a teasing comb a few months back in an attempt to give my fine, flat hair some volume.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tease well and is too small to be an adequate hair brush.</li>
            <li> Fast service, the brush was larger than expected</li>
            <li> It is very dry here, but it&#x27;s always dry and my hair certainly doesn&#x27;t always look like that.</li>
            <li> but for anyone with medium length hair this brush is exactly what is needed to tease and tame your hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> This little brush really grabs the hair and teases evenly.</li>
            <li> This little brush does so much.</li>
            <li> It has short and long as well as plush and coarse bristles, all on a sturdy wooden handle with a pointed tip for sectioning.</li>
            <li> This brush is alright, but for teasing, I would highly recommend a comb with uneven bristles.</li>
            <li> I never got the hang of teasing with a comb, my hair came out lumpy and fell flat within an hour.</li>
            <li> in seconds you can go from flat to fab!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without one of these.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s just the brush, but it has continued to hold onto lint/dust through 3 different houses in 2 US states and a foreign country.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim along with two other brushes, and intended to use it only for creating volume for up dos.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the wooden brush, and that it has a sectioning point on the other end.</li>
            <li> The only other one I use is a Paddle Brush when I blow dry my hair, otherwise this is my everything else brush.</li>
            <li> It distributes oil and help to work in dry shampoo after application.</li>
            <li> brush is about as long as your forearm and as wide as an inch!</li>
            <li> However, my hair has never been such a frizzy flying mess after this brush touched it.</li>
            <li> although some of the little bristles come off but not alot unless you actually pull them out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need a little extra height &amp; this gives it to you.</li>
            <li> The pointed end of the brush is extremely helpful in creating parts or sectioning hair off for a thorough blow dry.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> (hold above you head for a few seconds).</li>
            <li> it was just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t tease as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Umm I got a pink one.</li>
            <li> badboy is the secret key to WOW hair that holds and shapes</li>
            <li> This gives you a more solid base if you will.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, other than it does what it is supposed to, and does it well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something differently</li>
            <li> This brush,  like other brushes I have from spornettes is AMAZING!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what these other reviewers were thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After searching amazon for other items, I came across this and decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Had I realized this I may have purchased it in store since I really wanted the green one and got blue which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> It teases so well in less time than it takes me to tease with a comb.</li>
            <li> I brushed it in my hair and it does the job, but uhh, not happy with it being pink...</li>
            <li> This brush makes it easier, and I use less product (saves $$$).</li>
            <li> and it provides slight volume</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and have had no problems using this for teasing, general brushing, and parting my hair.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t look like a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> Got this little brush after seeing it used on a Utube presentation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this just for doing a little back-brushing at my crown.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely a Little Wonder.</li>
            <li> This little brush works wonders..</li>
            <li> This review is from: Spornette Little Wonder</li>
            <li> I used to use a pick to give a little tease and body to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used teasing combs/combs for years at my roots and found this little gem on amazon....love it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> and my arm actually got tired.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, although i wish the bristles weren&#x27;t so flimsy as i sometimes have a harder time teasing my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have not had trouble brushing out the teased hair after using.</li>
            <li> Gives the desired effect with very little effort.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s held up well and shown very little signs of wear.</li>
            <li> This brush is small</li>
            <li> i can get a small poof going</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the combs fell short.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tough on the hair</li>
            <li> HARD BRISTLES</li>
            <li> Therefore, it&#x27;s hard to tease.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and I wanted to wear mine in a pompadour and retro curls.</li>
            <li> Not a good teasing brush.</li>
            <li> Might work on curly hair or thick hair but not for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;m not being violent enough with my hair.</li>
            <li> There is something wrong with the bristles -- they don&#x27;t hold the hair well &amp; the brush is useless for teasing.</li>
            <li> useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I didn&#x27;t expect premium quality at the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to bother returning it, but it&#x27;s totally useless.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> Bad brush!</li>
            <li> Worst teasing comb ever!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not as good as a teasing comb but works ok</li>
            <li> Love the small size to back-comb or &#x27;fluff&#x27; to give lift to fine hair.</li>
            <li> I got this brush cause i wanted a cheap teasing brush and this works like a charm! I highly suggest this!</li>
            <li> I love this teasing brush!  My old brush wasn&#x27;t doing the trick anymore so I decided to purchase this one. Teasing has never been made easier with the brush! It easy, you achieve volume quickly and there is no discomfort. I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I just bought this teasing comb because I am in front of a camera and needed more volume for my hair. The first time I used it my hair got so much static it looked like I rubbed a balloon on my head. I have very thin hair and it did not work when I tried to backcomb it. A rat tailed comb works much better than this comb. It has hair bristles as well as nylon bristles which created the static problem. Might work on curly hair or thick hair but not for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Can rat my hair better with a rat tail comb.. Not the best, parts hair awesomely</li>
            <li> There is something wrong with the bristles -- they don&#x27;t hold the hair well &amp; the brush is useless for teasing.</li>
            <li> I live this brush. Just what o was looking for.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> useless. Does not work.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to tease my hair or to pull it back smoothly, for all you beauty geeks out there: this is a must have in your hair drawer! Reasonably priced and it is of equal quality as those you would find at Sallys</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went so long without one of these. It&#x27;s so helpful with teasing and smoothing hair when styling. Plus it&#x27;s pretty easy to throw in your purse so you&#x27;re covered when your hair goes south.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  Very sturdy, good quality.</li>
            <li> My friend had this brush and I absolutely loved it, so I got it too. I have pretty shiny, thick hair, so getting any volume can be pretty tricky. However, this brush really does the trick!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  It worked so well on her hair I tried it on my thin hair.  It is a really good tasting brush.  Therefore. ...  ordered one more which is on the way to my house!</li>
            <li> I like to tease my hair to give it some fullness and height at the crown. I never got the hang of teasing with a comb, my hair came out lumpy and fell flat within an hour. This little brush really grabs the hair and teases evenly. The \\&quot;pick\\&quot; handle helps me separate sections and pull up the teased areas to even out the look, then I smooth over with the brush. I love this Little Wonder!</li>
            <li> A gift, so I did not use it, but it looks good!</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and was just what I expected. Product also works very well! Good price as well! A lot easier than using a regular comb!</li>
            <li> Not much to say, other than it does what it is supposed to, and does it well. I have thick hair, and I wanted to wear mine in a pompadour and retro curls. Teasing is key to both, and this helps so much!</li>
            <li> Sorry, I didn&#x27;t expect premium quality at the price but this brush is really cheap quality, some of the outer bristles are bent back, not worth ordering.  Go to Sally and get better quality for the same price range.</li>
            <li> The bristles hold on to dust really well.  I&#x27;ve never had this with a brush before.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something differently or if it&#x27;s just the brush, but it has continued to hold onto lint/dust through 3 different houses in 2 US states and a foreign country.  Otherwise, the brush works well.</li>
            <li> This brush,  like other brushes I have from spornettes is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;The brush is about as long as your forearm and as wide as an inch! You could use it just to brush your hair, and if you do you will notice more hair than usual coming out at first- this is because the bristles are so dense you comb more hair at one time.&lt;br /&gt;As for teasing this brush is ace! It teases my hair in no time at all, just three strokes backwards on each handful of strands and voila a rats nest!...It also smooths hair out as well so you can hide how ratted it is underneath!&lt;br /&gt;This brush is available from many locations at many varying prices but i found amazons to be the medium amount with the sweet bonus of free shipping! gotta love amazon!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. My hair is very fine and I have always difficulty teasing my hair or building any sort of volume in it. This brush is small so it is easy to work with and does a good job, but it doesn&#x27;t quite grip the hair as well as I had hoped for. The bristles also do a good job of smoothing out the top of the hair after teasing. The end works well or sectioning hair. The main reason I did not give 5 stars is that you cannot chose your color. I should have paid more attention to the item title, I thought since I could click on the different colors I could choose one. This is not the case. You get whatever they send. Had I realized this I may have purchased it in store since I really wanted the green one and got blue which was disappointing. Just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> A quick last-minute check of this brush before packaging would have revealed a large portion of the black glossy finish chipped from the surface. Makes me think it was used and passed off and sold as new.</li>
            <li> Great for an extra lift for my flat hair! use it everyday and it works great! love this teasing brush</li>
            <li> Works great! better than a teasing comb :)</li>
            <li> Gives the desired effect with very little effort.  I&#x27;m a novice and I found this to be a good tool.  And for a good price, to boot.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> Great little brush- offered at my Fallon for quite a bit more- helps me with roller setting to divide sections and teasing crown for a classic hair set- would buy again! Thanks&#x27;</li>
            <li> Teaser - creates the best volume and bump of any brush I&#x27;ve tried.  Definitely get it if you are wanting to add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this was as good as all the other reviews were saying. It is decent, i was just expecting a lot more from it.</li>
            <li> Item as ordered...arrived quickly.  I need more practice on how to use it correctly though! A good hair tool for the money.</li>
            <li> This brush is alright, but for teasing, I would highly recommend a comb with uneven bristles. I found it did the job much better.</li>
            <li> Not a good teasing brush. Hair slips right through. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for both teasing and smoothing. Excellent quality and I love the convenient pick at the end, which helps to part the hair. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who does a lot of updos or retro hairstyles that require a lot of teasing and smoothing.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m asian with really fine long straight hair and i just couldn&#x27;t get this to work for me. maybe i&#x27;m not being violent enough with my hair. i can get a small poof going but nothing that bangin&#x27;. maybe if you already know what you&#x27;re doing this would be a great product, but if you&#x27;re a noob like me, then good luck. i use it now as a regular brush and it&#x27;s pretty good at that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim along with two other brushes, and intended to use it only for creating volume for up dos. I quickly realized, however, that this natural bristle brush is fabulous for my fine hair.  I use it every day to brush out after blow drying with a different Spornette round brush, and my hair is looking better than ever.  Love it!</li>
            <li> GREAT HANDLE BUT HARD BRISTLES AND THEY COME OF  THE BRUSH COME OFF SSPARINGLY I WOULDNT BUY IT AGAIN !</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic ratting/teasing brush!  My new favorite!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little teasing brush. It has short and long as well as plush and coarse bristles, all on a sturdy wooden handle with a pointed tip for sectioning. This bristle structure not only helps catch all hair, but really tease and tousle your locks! It creates A LOT of volume when used properly just be sure you know how to correctly tease your hair...you don&#x27;t want a rats nest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush not only created a lot of Va-Va-Volume but it doesn&#x27;t seem to mat and knot my hair, at the end of the day even through much thrashing around (playing with the niece and nephew) and rough housing my hair was easy to brush through. I use a bit of hairspray at the root followed by backcombing and allowing the volume and hairspray to set (hold above you head for a few seconds). This brush is also the perfect size, it fits in most of my travel totes so I can always have wonderfully big hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this was a great purchase I am so happy I decided to go with this &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; style verses some of the other teasing &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; that are out on the market. I hope this review has helped you decide you teasing brush purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and keep the hair high!</li>
            <li> I use this brush often to tease my hair, and I like the handle shape for sectioning off my hair.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! Would buy again</li>
            <li> I used this brush to tease my hair for Halloween. Did its job as I was a &amp;#34;Mad Scientist&amp;#34;. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great little brush. Bought as a stocking stuffer.  Wanted the gold color but out of stock.</li>
            <li> Generic teasing brush. Gets a good grip on hair and teases well, however I usually just use it on my bangs. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast service, the brush was larger than expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a teasing brush before.  This is good for not only teasing but for smoothing hair down when styling or putting hair up in ponytails or buns.</li>
            <li> If you just want to tease the hair along your crown/part for some volume, this brush is a great value and skinny enough to carry along in your purse.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it for parting and smoothing while using my InStyler. It teases hair easily and the nice rat tail can bring up the lift. It&#x27;s also perfect for smoothing after teasing, and just to use for brushing your hair. It&#x27;s my everything brush. The only other one I use is a Paddle Brush when I blow dry my hair, otherwise this is my everything else brush. No bristle shedding, appears to be very well made.</li>
            <li> got it witin 2 weeks. although some of the little bristles come off but not alot unless you actually pull them out. love this brush this is my second time buying it !!</li>
            <li> Great little brush doesn&#x27;t pull hair and also good for teasing hair .</li>
            <li> I use this with Redken hairspray and Big Sexy texturizing powder, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to tease very well.</li>
            <li> Got this little brush after seeing it used on a Utube presentation. It is great for teasing your hair to get some extra volume. Doesn&#x27;t seem to damage hair as hair is very easy to comb out after use.</li>
            <li> Good product,  fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected; more like a brush than comb, but I do use it often and keep in purse.</li>
            <li> I love this teasing brush.  It does magic without making you look totally weird.</li>
            <li> I purchased this just for doing a little back-brushing at my crown. I have straight very fine hair, so I can always use a little lift. This brush works great - much better than just using a comb. The brush itself is pretty prickly, so it feels scratchy on my scalp, but this stiffness is what helps it do such a nice job at back brushing.  It&#x27;s also nice that the handle is like a pointy stick because you can use that to create very straight parts in your hair.</li>
            <li> Seeing that there are many reviews on here, I decided to make my review short and sweet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spornette little wonder is a really good teasing brush.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t tangle or pull the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as a comb for me. I have long, fine hair. Might work for many, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews when I was looking for such a brush. This one got great reviews. I even watched videos on youtube and the results seemed nothing short of amazing... However, my hair has never been such a frizzy flying mess after this brush touched it. It is very dry here, but it&#x27;s always dry and my hair certainly doesn&#x27;t always look like that. I&#x27;m not going to bother returning it, but it&#x27;s totally useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for me. I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> This is totally the best teaser brush that ever existed.</li>
            <li> These are Magic. This little brush does so much. I use them at the salon and clients LOVE them. and the price is great.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! My stylist recommended it to instead of the teasing comb I was using before. It gives my hair awesome volume!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what these other reviewers were thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best Teasing brush around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combs breaks.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and they work very well. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love love this brush.  It works alt better than any teasing comb.  I would definitely recommend this teasing brush.</li>
            <li> True to name, definitely a wonder!</li>
            <li> A product I can&#x27;t fix my hair without.  Way better than the old teasing combs.</li>
            <li> This small brush is perfect for a suitcase or purse</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! I have very thick hair and have had no problems using this for teasing, general brushing, and parting my hair. Compared to what it would be to buy a teasing comb + a separate brush, this item is a great price. Even if you don&#x27;t tease your hair ever, this brush still works well for everything else. it&#x27;s not too large and easily fits into my travel toiletries bag. Definitely a great stocking stuffier gift as well.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely a Little Wonder. It teases so well in less time than it takes me to tease with a comb. I also like to use it for blowing out my bangs. Very nicely made and works great!</li>
            <li> I like this brush. It&#x27;s a little tough on the hair but I guess that&#x27;s how it works. It creates decent puffs so I don&#x27;t have to spray my hair after styling which kinda compensates the roughness of the brush itself.</li>
            <li> Great little hairbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent back combing brush.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to tease your hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is an excellent travel brush.  The handle is easy to hold on to.  It works great for teasing hair a lot or a little and then, smooths it into style easily.  I recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This little brush works wonders..in seconds you can go from flat to fab! Would buy their products again...love the handle. I want one a little bit larger now for sure.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, straight, and really smooth. Therefore, it&#x27;s hard to tease. This brush does a fine job, and I don&#x27;t feel like it does much damage to my hair. I used it to make a nice bump at the back of my head and it didn&#x27;t make my hair look messy like it does when I tease with a comb.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for teasing hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this as a regular brush, my daughter has very fine hair &amp; this works wonderfully without pain! It works well for teasing my hair as well!</li>
            <li> This is a handy brush to use not just for teasing but for pulling the softer hairs into a ponytail or smoothing out a sleek bun. The pointed end of the brush is extremely helpful in creating parts or sectioning hair off for a thorough blow dry. I&#x27;ve had it for several months and it&#x27;s held up well and shown very little signs of wear. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This review is from: Spornette Little Wonder Teasing Brush, Colors may vary (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I really love this brush and i highly recommend. Is small so it is easy to work with and does a good job.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for traveling, or even stowing in your purse. It has an end with a tip that can be used for parting the hair, and the other side (the brush end) can easily be used to either brush or backcomb the hair. The bristles do a great job, and it seems less damaging than using a rattail comb. With how low the price is for this product, I especially recommend it!</li>
            <li> This brush is easy to use and it will get you the volume you need! I ratted my hair then sprayed a little hairspray on it and gently brushed it down and had great volume all day long.</li>
            <li> Works great for teasing hair.  The tease stays in better that the comb style I was using.  I recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, how did I not know about these brushes before. I love the way they tease your hair without feeling like they are ripping your hair apart.</li>
            <li> Great teasing brush, I am very excited about it. I have a teasing comb that I use to give the crown of my hair for a ponytail lift and I already am a fan of the brush, works much better. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> Wish the pick side was thinner but other than that it works great!</li>
            <li> Great for teasing.  I really like it a lot.  Does what it says it should.</li>
            <li> Works much better than any other teasing brush I have used. It easily grabs your hair and works quickly. Great price too!</li>
            <li> teasing or smoothing your hair..great brush</li>
            <li> Works great! it was just what I expected.  I even ordered a second one for my daughter after I received this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it that much, but i think it works ok.  I&#x27;m not super great at changing my hairstyles, but when I do rat my hair, it works fine.</li>
            <li> This brush is easier and faster to backcomb any area of my hair that needs extra body then smooth over after while retaining the body.</li>
            <li> Like i said the brush works good but this is my first teasing comb, but when i got the packaging there was a small probably 1 to 2 inch slit in it. It wont happen to all of them but its a possibility because it was were the brush was pointed. Other then that im happy it shiped faster then I acaccepted.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by this great little brush. I have very fine hair and have to tease it to look good. When using a comb it took forever to get it all done and my arm actually got tired. Now, with this great tool, it takes me half the time and combs out better. I really encourage you to buy this brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent presentation, nice colors and works as I expected. Good thing to buy. Works better than  a normal brush for high volume</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand daughter because her hair will not hold curls, this helps the curl stay all day/</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tease well and is too small to be an adequate hair brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I have a couple others but I like this one best. The price was good, it arrived in a timely fashion. They don&#x27;t guarantee which color you get but mine looks exactly like the picture. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Excelent And cheap :-)</li>
            <li> I used to use a pick to give a little tease and body to my hair.  This little teasing brush is way better. You can tease the underside of  your hair and smooth out the top so you don&#x27;t look like a frizzy mess.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ease my hair much, but this will do the trick. Nice, firm little brush. I have bought Spornette brushes before and they tend to &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; out of my hair arsenal. My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own, so I need hair tools that can at least make it look like I put up a good fight.</li>
            <li> This teasing brush will give your hair more volume without damaging it. Best teasing brush I&#x27;ve ever used and at a great price.</li>
            <li> great tease brush...I like it</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me. Sometimes I need a little extra height &amp; this gives it to you. Also good for making your curls a little more relaxed.</li>
            <li> I miss my TeaseUP, but this one works.</li>
            <li> Great stiff brush for extremely short hair.  Let&#x27;s me style it the way I want it!!!  Excellent product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this tool everyday, probably more like a couple times a month.  But I like the firmness of the bristles and it does the job of teasing for me very well.  I have not had any issues with bristles falling out.  I would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, although i wish the bristles weren&#x27;t so flimsy as i sometimes have a harder time teasing my thick hair. Otherwise it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t tease as well as I expected. Ended up going to my regular fine tooth comb. Looks nice though</li>
            <li> Umm I got a pink one. Didn&#x27;t see the colors may vary thing in the title until now. In the picture it was blue and so that would have been fine. I brushed it in my hair and it does the job, but uhh, not happy with it being pink...</li>
            <li> Brush is a nice size with a comfortable handle. Had an odd smell when I opened it, but works just fine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up liking this as well as my cheap plastic teasing comb. Seemed like it put static in my hair. I also didn&#x27;t find that it smoothed over the teasing well. Again, somehow it prompted static and made it worse. I&#x27;ll probably just throw it away.</li>
            <li> It definitly makes my hair fluffy! :)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.</li>
            <li> This tool helps me tease my hair so that it looks to increase volume. It is a good size for my hand and easily teases my hair so that it appears that my hair is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an easy way to get ready for work with doing one&#x27;s hair, make-up, dressing, and jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simplify your morning by using this handy tool.</li>
            <li> This has lasted well so far and is easy to throw in your bag and take on the road as it is a nice size, love it !</li>
            <li> I had purchased a teasing comb a few months back in an attempt to give my fine, flat hair some volume.  Unfortunately, the combs fell short.  They would tease, but when I would attempt to smooth my \\&quot;bump\\&quot; down, my hair would go right back to the way it was.  After searching amazon for other items, I came across this and decided to give it a shot.  I was definitely impressed.  Not only did it tease much better than a teasing comb, but this teasing brush part also allowed me to smooth out my hair without losing any volume.  I still prefer to use the pick of the teasing comb to separate my hair as I feel that part does a better job, but the brush part does wonders.</li>
            <li> This doesnt tease as good as i thought it would. It works better for combine or for a low maintenance tease. If you want a really good tease you should get a different brush.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush for adding volume to my hair! Love!</li>
            <li> Best teasing brush I have used.</li>
            <li> Came promptly in the mail today &amp; exceeded all my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a good little teasing brush, and FINALLY, I&#x27;ve found one.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely fine, flat hair. This makes my hair look as though I actually have some volume!</li>
            <li> Works great! The paint on the brush handle chips off fairly easy though.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my friend. She loves it! She has come to work with perfect big hair every day.</li>
            <li> The price is right, the size is great, and even though I have really fine hair this teases it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do retro hair styles and this works wonders. My poofs are big and this is just a great small brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Worst teasing comb ever! Wish I could return this.  Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic little brush. however, I need a smaller one since my hair is ultra short. but for anyone with medium length hair this brush is exactly what is needed to tease and tame your hair.</li>
            <li> Bad brush! does not even get in the hair</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  You barely tease, smooth out, and it lasts all day.  Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> This does what it says and a good price for a good brush.  Even though I use it for teasing, it doesn&#x27;t break my hair or make it so knotty I can&#x27;t comb it out later if i don&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does what you need it to do.  Much easier than a comb to tease your hair.</li>
            <li> Being a Southern Girl I love big hair, even though my hair does not tease easily. I have fine, thin hair and I have really loved this brush (and found myself wondering why I waited so long to buy one). I am able to achieve lovely volume without any visible to my fine hair. The pointed end is great for sectioning your hair and the bristles are also good for smoothing out the top of your teased hair. I use this brush for curling my hair in addition to teasing, so I&#x27;ve been surprised at how much I&#x27;ve used it. I am able to separate the sections out and brush them smooth before curling my hair. I then go back and and use the pointed handle to pull layers and tease, smoothing the top back out with the brush. It has really worked well and doesn&#x27;t pull the curl back out of my hair. I would highly recommend this brush, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much you use it! (In fact, I may need a second one for my purse . . . )</li>
            <li> I have thick, smooth &amp; shiny hair. I have natural volume but could never tease my hair to be BIG using a normal teasing comb and hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This badboy is the secret key to WOW hair that holds and shapes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies - everyone needs this!</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t quite strong enough to get a tight snarl so I have to use a comb in addition to this. But I really like it. No regrets buying it.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this.</li>
            <li> After using the Little Wonder Teasing Brush I noticed how easily it manages to tease my hair - also is useful when untangling my hair. The bristles are strong and the wooden handle is easy to grip and comfortable to hold. I think this brush is a good bargain for the price. I would recommend this teasing brush to others. It works well on my hair [normal thickness &amp; naturally wavy].</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush locally after reading great reviews online, and I have to say it does work as advertised! I have stick straight, fine hair. When I want volume, I have to pull out the big guns. This brush makes it easier, and I use less product (saves $$$). I have not had trouble brushing out the teased hair after using. I like the feel of the wooden brush, and that it has a sectioning point on the other end. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used teasing combs/combs for years at my roots and found this little gem on amazon....love it. Will  never go back to a comb again. For root teasing it&#x27;s the best. For teasing light teasing for volume on the sides or back of hair a comb works better. This gives you a more solid base if you will. Great, perfect, just the right size!</li>
            <li> good brush, but the paint on the handle is already chipping off, after taking it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> This brush is a cost effective little tool to have, especially for those with oily hair. It distributes oil and help to work in dry shampoo after application. I also use for light teasing, which is also effective. I use this more than I thought I would.</li>
            <li> This teasing comb works great! Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or seem like it will break; very durable. It was worth the price paid for it.</li>
            <li> Amazing teasing brush, I love it.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to get tangled and it provides slight volume, I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything that makes my hair too poofy.</li>
            <li> This thing really works! I have very fine hair and for the first time ever I actually have volume! I absolutely love this brush. It does exactly what it says.</li>
