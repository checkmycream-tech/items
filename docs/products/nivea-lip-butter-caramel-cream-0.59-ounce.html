    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>an excellent product</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially nice in the summer when I&#x27;m out in the sun.</li>
            <li>The scent is also delicious!  </li>
            <li>But if you like that sort of thing, this one will be good for you!  </li>
            <li>All together great product.</li>
            <li>However, when I looked at the ingredients, I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>This is a great lip product.  </li>
            <li>The Caramel Cream Kiss version does not have a flavor that I can tell, but it smells very nice.  </li>
            <li>The front packaging says great things like &#x27;seals in moisture&#x27; and Shea Butter and Almond oil - good ingredients, good benefits.</li>
            <li>This is probably a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very appealing and the taste,</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and keeps my lips moist without making them more prone to chapping once it has worn off.  </li>
            <li>I love the caramel cream smell!  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as if you were using Vasoline, and if you like that feel, then it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>I will definitley be buying more of this, since my daughter keeps trying to steal it for herself!</li>
            <li>This lip butter is amazing.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good product that I am enjoying and hasn&#x27;t caused break outs or buildup of guck.  </li>
            <li>I love this product: it&#x27;s one of the most moisturizing, emollient lip products available, and it&#x27;s inexpensive, smells awesome, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s more cost effective for them to use the inferior product though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an okay product, but it doesn&#x27;t have anything particularly nice to recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and also it has a bit of a glossy finish when you put it on, and honestly it makes my lips look more plump.</li>
            <li>found the balm better than most, but not quite as good as the best, in terms of preventing lip dryness for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very very light.</li>
            <li>The flavor was quite pleasant and it does an excellent job of moisturizing dried lips.  </li>
            <li>But if you want real moisture, and healthier ingredients for that matter, I&#x27;d give this a pass and go for one of EOS&#x27;s amazing Smooth Spheres, the sweet mint is hands-down the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have so many in my purse and just use whichever one I&#x27;m able to fish out of my purse when I put my hand in.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a taste, which I like, and I love the caramel fragrance.</li>
            <li>If I have many choices, I&#x27;ll leave it.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm is Aquaphor, which was recommended to me by my doctor.  </li>
            <li>I am a lip balm addict, and I love it when I find one that I like.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these lip balms.  </li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t enough to dock a star however, because it&#x27;s still an excellent product, just not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I have something to use for my lips.</li>
            <li>Which is a complete shame, because shea butter and almond oil are great moisturizers on their own.</li>
            <li>On a side note, the Vanilla Macadamia did have a better taste.</li>
            <li>I would love to see this in a tube or something like the plastic flip top containers vaseline uses.</li>
            <li>This tin of mostly Vaseline (petroleum jelly) is both buttery in color and texture.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but didn&#x27;t remind me of caramel at all, just mildly sweet.  </li>
            <li>The tin is cute too and will make a perfect geocache container when it is empty!</li>
            <li>Nivea really makes a superior product.</li>
            <li>The Caramel Cream Kiss smells heavenly (like a Werther&#x27;s Original) and the scent lingers on the lips for a while, unlike most scented lip care products.  </li>
            <li>And I would strongly prefer a stick-type application</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a very slight shine to your lips after using, so it&#x27;s great over a stain or lip color -- on its own, it provides excellent protection for chapped or dry lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a creamy, oil based balm, in that it goes on smooth, not sticky.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent is light; I can&#x27;t even smell it once I put it on.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and lasts alot longer than the sticks.</li>
            <li>In fact, I wish they sold this in larger containers as it would make a great hand</li>
            <li>This is $3.99, as of this writing, and available as an add on for Prime.  </li>
            <li>I rarely branch out, but I&#x27;m glad I did with this.</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>This lip moisturizer works well and tastes nice, and I would highly recommend it for use at home.&lt;br /&gt;However, lip moisturizer in a tin isn&#x27;t practical on the run, since application requires either greasing one&#x27;s finger or \\&quot;kissing\\&quot; the contents, which is something one probably wouldn&#x27;t want to do in public.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Although I don&#x27;t plan to use any more of either after my first test!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I, again, was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>For one thing, I love the flat metal tin which will fit nicely in a purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li>I had to constantly reapply it which is surprising since it is so greasy...and the greasiness never quite leaves my lips.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; of this Lip Butter is similar to a caramel candle from Bath and Body Works, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, there are some drawbacks to the lip butter which keep it from getting the full 5-stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a perfect blend of thick moisturizer with out feeling like you&#x27;re slapping petroleum jelly on your lips.</li>
            <li>The smells is sweet without being over powering.</li>
            <li>ingredients: petrolatum, polyglyceryl-3 disostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Burt&#x27;s Bees follower, tried and true.</li>
            <li>parkil(shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulsis (sweet almond) oil, water, glycerin, glyceryl glucoside, BHT, flavor, titanium dioxide, iron oxides.  </li>
            <li>when I licked my lips while wearing this, was not bad.  </li>
            <li>It lasts quite a long time and it has a pleasant flavor.  </li>
            <li>It was very much like the Carmex lip balm in the small jars, which are the best lip balms that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>:)  My lips are accustomed to always having some type of lip balm on them, and I have tried many different types.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie, and I love trying out new scents.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;d seen many rave reviews of Nivea&#x27;s Lip Butters in magazines (which lead me to try it in the first place) but while it&#x27;s creamy in texture, it&#x27;s really greasy in wear.</li>
            <li>After my first application, it kept my lips moist for two hours!</li>
            <li>so, it&#x27;s worth it for long lasting, delicious smelling, non-habit-forming lip moisturization.</li>
            <li>far, my lips seem to be getting better, holding onto moisture with fewer days of being dry and chapped, since I&#x27;ve been using this lip butter, so those are the good points about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very creamy, lightly flavored, yummy lip balm that coats your lips to perfection.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smooth and creamy, and they moisturize really well.</li>
            <li>It lasts forever and smells amazing at the same time.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a different kind of lip balm, when I came across [[ASIN</li>
            <li>overall, it is nicer than some lip balms I&#x27;ve tried, yet not as nice as some.</li>
            <li>lips did stay soft most of the day, so the product works as a moisturizer, although I much prefer using straight 100% shea butter and coconut oil for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked this lip butter.</li>
            <li>But mostly I just love how it goes on so smoothly and makes my lips very soft for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It fades away pretty quickly, so I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t bother you, this might be a good match as it scores well on other points.  </li>
            <li>This scent isn&#x27;t my favorite of the different varieties, but that&#x27;s just because I don&#x27;t like overly sweet smelling things.  </li>
            <li>Compared to more natural alternatives, I have found petrolatum, in proper proportion, to work better without leaving a film.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed some of Nivea&#x27;s products, so the Caramel Cream Kiss Lip Butter certainly seemed a natural choice.  </li>
            <li>It has a very creamy consistency, much more so than many other lip balms that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient listed is petroleum and it shows.</li>
            <li>and you see the first ingredient is petrolatum, which is a by-product of petroleum.</li>
            <li>The feel of the product on the lip reminds me of wearing petroleum jelly, and when checking ingredients, it&#x27;s the first one listed.  </li>
            <li>However, in this instance, I think the inconvenience is worth it because the product is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most chapsticks cost about $3 in stores, and the bigger Nivea sticks about $4.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can think of that would make it better is that I would like to see is a sunscreen added to it.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t understand why Nivea chose to use them in the first place.</li>
            <li>I think this is my favorite lip balm flavor that I have tried in the last couple of years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea products in the past, and excitedly bought this balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had that problem with a couple of other lip products that were effectively \\&quot;habit forming\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The lip balm has a nice sweet smell and makes your lip feel rather slick.</li>
            <li>Personally, the raspberry is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, aside from the small issues that I mentioned I think that the lip butter is pretty good for helping with chapped lips.</li>
            <li>The new Nivea Lip Butter Caramel Cream Kiss is a moisture rich blend of shea butter, almond oil and petrolatum to keep your lips soft and moisturized with a fresh caramel flavoring.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in how long the color lasted - a huge plus!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much a chapstick/lip-gloss junkie.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t slide off my lips and it lasted a long time without adding more.  </li>
            <li>Also, the taste/fragrance is very mild, definitely in its favor.  </li>
            <li>The little tin is easy to open and it fits nicely into the pocket of my jeans or in my purse.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm itself is very creamy as though it were real butter.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t really taste it, which is a plus for</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply much to your lips for them to be moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is also very susceptible to heat which makes it impractical for a summer purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li>NIVEA CARAMEL LIP BUTTER glides on smoothly and instantly hydrates my lips.</li>
            <li>-- works great while on, but if you don&#x27;t reapply your lips end up feeling worse than before you used the product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter flavor not as much.</li>
            <li>price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>and I really like this Nivea Caramel Lip Butter.</li>
            <li>I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this Nivea Lip Butter.  </li>
            <li>addition, the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, so I wouldn&#x27;t feel confident putting it in a bag with other things.</li>
            <li>The tin looks kind of small but</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice thick consistency, which means that it stays on really well.  </li>
            <li>Once my purse was stolen and the main thing I worried about was not having any lip balm.  </li>
            <li>The lip butter is very soft which means that it is a trick to avoid getting way too much on my finger tip.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and does have a mild caramel flavor at first, then instantly tastes fake.</li>
            <li>Nivea products have always been a fave of mine, so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a long-lasting, flavorful lip balm.</li>
            <li>This Nivea mix rarely needs to be applied since one application really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size for a small purse, diaper bag, or pocket, and even when left in a hot car, it didn&#x27;t change consistency at all.</li>
            <li>This lip butter is definitely smooth and soft as butter, but it does not keep my lips moisturized for very long.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a different fragrance (Kind of tired of the fruity flavors), but it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The butter made my lips feel okay, but nothing beyond what plain petroleum jelly does.  </li>
            <li>It spreads very easily, and it is only necessary to use a very tiny amount.  </li>
            <li>But overall, it is a nice little product and I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li>So, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to try this new \\&quot;butter tin.\\</li>
            <li>But when I can smell it (when I open the tin and while I&#x27;m applying it), it&#x27;s pleasant enough (not exactly caramel, but definitely sweet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent does smell good while in the tin, but once you put it on, the smell dies down a little</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin also opens and closes easily, and it has a thin profile, meaning that it will easily fit not only in a purse, but also a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, but is a little greasy.</li>
            <li>product actually has the consistency of soft butter, or a very creamy lotion.</li>
            <li>So naturally I would want to try ths Nivea Lip Butter Tin.</li>
            <li>As a result, it&#x27;s been relegated to nighttime use (before bed!), and times when I&#x27;m not outside much.</li>
            <li>OK, enough about how neurotic I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use only Avon Care Deeply and Carmex, but I have branched out a bit in recent years.  </li>
            <li>The caramel smell is present but not overwhelming, which is good because I&#x27;m not a huge caramel lover (though I do like it and was willing to take a gamble on this).</li>
            <li>This product does make my lips feel soft but it really is nothing the least bit special.  </li>
            <li>only downside is that the main ingredient is petroleum, but I knew that it wasn&#x27;t a natural product before buying it.</li>
            <li>However, it is fun to try other products periodically.  </li>
            <li>I get very dry, flaky lips if I don&#x27;t use anything on them, and they stayed pretty moist throughout the day after using this product.</li>
            <li>It smelled a little sickeningly sweet for my tastes.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs incredibly quickly without doing much for slightly chapped lips other than making them peel.  </li>
            <li>(unfortunately, the Raspberry also includes rose which I don&#x27;t like)</li>
            <li>This tin is also less convenient - you really need two hands and you need to be careful or you end up with too much smeared on your fingers.  </li>
            <li>I normally have used Vaseline lip therapy since it contains petrolatum and not much else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got dry lips that sometimes crack and chap, so I&#x27;m always using some form of lip balm or gloss that will help keep them soft and</li>
            <li>It seems to last a long time, and even after if wears off my lips still feel soft.  </li>
            <li>and it really is buttery soft to apply, a little does go a long way.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> That wasn&#x27;t enough to dock a star however, because it&#x27;s still an excellent product, just not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I have something to use for my lips.</li>
            <li> Which is a complete shame, because shea butter and almond oil are great moisturizers on their own.</li>
            <li> On a side note, the Vanilla Macadamia did have a better taste.</li>
            <li> I would love to see this in a tube or something like the plastic flip top containers vaseline uses.</li>
            <li> This tin of mostly Vaseline (petroleum jelly) is both buttery in color and texture.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but didn&#x27;t remind me of caramel at all, just mildly sweet.  </li>
            <li> The tin is cute too and will make a perfect geocache container when it is empty!</li>
            <li> Nivea really makes a superior product.</li>
            <li> The Caramel Cream Kiss smells heavenly (like a Werther&#x27;s Original) and the scent lingers on the lips for a while, unlike most scented lip care products.  </li>
            <li> And I would strongly prefer a stick-type application</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a very slight shine to your lips after using, so it&#x27;s great over a stain or lip color -- on its own, it provides excellent protection for chapped or dry lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a creamy, oil based balm, in that it goes on smooth, not sticky.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> The scent is light; I can&#x27;t even smell it once I put it on.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and lasts alot longer than the sticks.</li>
            <li> In fact, I wish they sold this in larger containers as it would make a great hand</li>
            <li> This is $3.99, as of this writing, and available as an add on for Prime.  </li>
            <li> I rarely branch out, but I&#x27;m glad I did with this.</li>
            <li> It keeps my lips hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> This lip moisturizer works well and tastes nice, and I would highly recommend it for use at home.&lt;br /&gt;However, lip moisturizer in a tin isn&#x27;t practical on the run, since application requires either greasing one&#x27;s finger or \\&quot;kissing\\&quot; the contents, which is something one probably wouldn&#x27;t want to do in public.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Although I don&#x27;t plan to use any more of either after my first test!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I, again, was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> For one thing, I love the flat metal tin which will fit nicely in a purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li> I had to constantly reapply it which is surprising since it is so greasy...and the greasiness never quite leaves my lips.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; of this Lip Butter is similar to a caramel candle from Bath and Body Works, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there are some drawbacks to the lip butter which keep it from getting the full 5-stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a perfect blend of thick moisturizer with out feeling like you&#x27;re slapping petroleum jelly on your lips.</li>
            <li> The smells is sweet without being over powering.</li>
            <li> ingredients: petrolatum, polyglyceryl-3 disostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Burt&#x27;s Bees follower, tried and true.</li>
            <li> parkil(shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulsis (sweet almond) oil, water, glycerin, glyceryl glucoside, BHT, flavor, titanium dioxide, iron oxides.  </li>
            <li> when I licked my lips while wearing this, was not bad.  </li>
            <li> It lasts quite a long time and it has a pleasant flavor.  </li>
            <li> It was very much like the Carmex lip balm in the small jars, which are the best lip balms that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> :)  My lips are accustomed to always having some type of lip balm on them, and I have tried many different types.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie, and I love trying out new scents.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;d seen many rave reviews of Nivea&#x27;s Lip Butters in magazines (which lead me to try it in the first place) but while it&#x27;s creamy in texture, it&#x27;s really greasy in wear.</li>
            <li> After my first application, it kept my lips moist for two hours!</li>
            <li> so, it&#x27;s worth it for long lasting, delicious smelling, non-habit-forming lip moisturization.</li>
            <li> far, my lips seem to be getting better, holding onto moisture with fewer days of being dry and chapped, since I&#x27;ve been using this lip butter, so those are the good points about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very creamy, lightly flavored, yummy lip balm that coats your lips to perfection.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smooth and creamy, and they moisturize really well.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever and smells amazing at the same time.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a different kind of lip balm, when I came across [[ASIN</li>
            <li> overall, it is nicer than some lip balms I&#x27;ve tried, yet not as nice as some.</li>
            <li> lips did stay soft most of the day, so the product works as a moisturizer, although I much prefer using straight 100% shea butter and coconut oil for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked this lip butter.</li>
            <li> But mostly I just love how it goes on so smoothly and makes my lips very soft for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It fades away pretty quickly, so I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t bother you, this might be a good match as it scores well on other points.  </li>
            <li> This scent isn&#x27;t my favorite of the different varieties, but that&#x27;s just because I don&#x27;t like overly sweet smelling things.  </li>
            <li> Compared to more natural alternatives, I have found petrolatum, in proper proportion, to work better without leaving a film.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed some of Nivea&#x27;s products, so the Caramel Cream Kiss Lip Butter certainly seemed a natural choice.  </li>
            <li> It has a very creamy consistency, much more so than many other lip balms that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> The first ingredient listed is petroleum and it shows.</li>
            <li> and you see the first ingredient is petrolatum, which is a by-product of petroleum.</li>
            <li> The feel of the product on the lip reminds me of wearing petroleum jelly, and when checking ingredients, it&#x27;s the first one listed.  </li>
            <li> However, in this instance, I think the inconvenience is worth it because the product is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most chapsticks cost about $3 in stores, and the bigger Nivea sticks about $4.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can think of that would make it better is that I would like to see is a sunscreen added to it.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand why Nivea chose to use them in the first place.</li>
            <li> I think this is my favorite lip balm flavor that I have tried in the last couple of years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea products in the past, and excitedly bought this balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had that problem with a couple of other lip products that were effectively \\&quot;habit forming\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The lip balm has a nice sweet smell and makes your lip feel rather slick.</li>
            <li> Personally, the raspberry is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, aside from the small issues that I mentioned I think that the lip butter is pretty good for helping with chapped lips.</li>
            <li> The new Nivea Lip Butter Caramel Cream Kiss is a moisture rich blend of shea butter, almond oil and petrolatum to keep your lips soft and moisturized with a fresh caramel flavoring.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in how long the color lasted - a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much a chapstick/lip-gloss junkie.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t slide off my lips and it lasted a long time without adding more.  </li>
            <li> Also, the taste/fragrance is very mild, definitely in its favor.  </li>
            <li> The little tin is easy to open and it fits nicely into the pocket of my jeans or in my purse.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm itself is very creamy as though it were real butter.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really taste it, which is a plus for</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply much to your lips for them to be moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is also very susceptible to heat which makes it impractical for a summer purse or pocket.  </li>
            <li> NIVEA CARAMEL LIP BUTTER glides on smoothly and instantly hydrates my lips.</li>
            <li> -- works great while on, but if you don&#x27;t reapply your lips end up feeling worse than before you used the product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter flavor not as much.</li>
            <li> price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> and I really like this Nivea Caramel Lip Butter.</li>
            <li> I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this Nivea Lip Butter.  </li>
            <li> addition, the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, so I wouldn&#x27;t feel confident putting it in a bag with other things.</li>
            <li> The tin looks kind of small but</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice thick consistency, which means that it stays on really well.  </li>
            <li> Once my purse was stolen and the main thing I worried about was not having any lip balm.  </li>
            <li> The lip butter is very soft which means that it is a trick to avoid getting way too much on my finger tip.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant and does have a mild caramel flavor at first, then instantly tastes fake.</li>
            <li> Nivea products have always been a fave of mine, so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a long-lasting, flavorful lip balm.</li>
            <li> This Nivea mix rarely needs to be applied since one application really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size for a small purse, diaper bag, or pocket, and even when left in a hot car, it didn&#x27;t change consistency at all.</li>
            <li> This lip butter is definitely smooth and soft as butter, but it does not keep my lips moisturized for very long.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a different fragrance (Kind of tired of the fruity flavors), but it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The butter made my lips feel okay, but nothing beyond what plain petroleum jelly does.  </li>
            <li> It spreads very easily, and it is only necessary to use a very tiny amount.  </li>
            <li> But overall, it is a nice little product and I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li> So, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to try this new \\&quot;butter tin.\\</li>
            <li> But when I can smell it (when I open the tin and while I&#x27;m applying it), it&#x27;s pleasant enough (not exactly caramel, but definitely sweet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent does smell good while in the tin, but once you put it on, the smell dies down a little</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin also opens and closes easily, and it has a thin profile, meaning that it will easily fit not only in a purse, but also a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, but is a little greasy.</li>
            <li> product actually has the consistency of soft butter, or a very creamy lotion.</li>
            <li> So naturally I would want to try ths Nivea Lip Butter Tin.</li>
            <li> As a result, it&#x27;s been relegated to nighttime use (before bed!), and times when I&#x27;m not outside much.</li>
            <li> OK, enough about how neurotic I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use only Avon Care Deeply and Carmex, but I have branched out a bit in recent years.  </li>
            <li> The caramel smell is present but not overwhelming, which is good because I&#x27;m not a huge caramel lover (though I do like it and was willing to take a gamble on this).</li>
            <li> This product does make my lips feel soft but it really is nothing the least bit special.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that the main ingredient is petroleum, but I knew that it wasn&#x27;t a natural product before buying it.</li>
            <li> However, it is fun to try other products periodically.  </li>
            <li> I get very dry, flaky lips if I don&#x27;t use anything on them, and they stayed pretty moist throughout the day after using this product.</li>
            <li> It smelled a little sickeningly sweet for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs incredibly quickly without doing much for slightly chapped lips other than making them peel.  </li>
            <li> (unfortunately, the Raspberry also includes rose which I don&#x27;t like)</li>
            <li> This tin is also less convenient - you really need two hands and you need to be careful or you end up with too much smeared on your fingers.  </li>
            <li> I normally have used Vaseline lip therapy since it contains petrolatum and not much else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dry lips that sometimes crack and chap, so I&#x27;m always using some form of lip balm or gloss that will help keep them soft and</li>
            <li> It seems to last a long time, and even after if wears off my lips still feel soft.  </li>
            <li> and it really is buttery soft to apply, a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> My lips feel dry after a short time.</li>
            <li> It does contain some questionable ingredients such as BHT, so if you are interested in a natural product you might want to avoid this.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty quick to chuck this one in with my collection of bad balms and goopy glosses that didn&#x27;t make the cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, I would recommend this product for everyone, but especially those who tend to have dry lips as the day progresses!  </li>
            <li> It lasted quite a long time.</li>
            <li> But, as I mentioned before, the NIVEA CARAMEL LIP BUTTER contains Titanium Dioxide, which is normally used as a sunscreen, but in this case I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s used for.</li>
            <li> It seems to stick around for a long time</li>
            <li> It made my lips look glossy and lasted as long as overnight when I didn&#x27;t eat anything.</li>
            <li> this does have decently long wear</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tin that it comes in isn&#x27;t at all messy or difficult to open, but at the same time it&#x27;s secure enough that it&#x27;s never come loose in my purse, even being jostled around all the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for other smells/flavors in the future!</li>
            <li> Yes this moisturizes your dry chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I used lip balms all the time because my lips always feel dry</li>
            <li> My lips are really dry and flaky when I don&#x27;t use lip balm and this got rid of the flakiness.</li>
            <li> The tin is small and thin, and would be easy to slip in a pocket or purse (don&#x27;t put it in a pocket against your body, though).  </li>
            <li> :B00AWRHA1S Nivea Lip Butter Loose Tin, Caramel Cream Kiss, 0.59 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> (The regular unscented one is just plain white and the raspberry is slightly pink, though none add color to your lips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are other oils and butters but they are minor players.</li>
            <li> The only downside for me is the round tin.</li>
            <li> Some products really do not work on me -</li>
            <li> second thing is that it does create a muted pale color to the lips.</li>
            <li> Although the tin is thin and flat enough to keep in a pocket or purse, I don&#x27;t want to stick my finger in it while outside because of germs.</li>
            <li> but since that&#x27;s usually the main ingredient in sunscreens, I know that usually coats and colors the skin with an ashy-white tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other heavily-moisturizing lip butters (or balms), this hasn&#x27;t caused me to breakout anywhere: it works as expected, and the caramel cream is heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but seriously a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> Of course, it may be that whatever you have to do to make something like this hold up in stick form contributes to the \\&quot;habit forming\\&quot; problem of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used a bit of it on my nose, since it had become sore and chapped due to allergies - and it worked.</li>
            <li> I tried to like it but not only was the flavor nearly non-existent (and very obviously fake</li>
            <li> It is a five star mix of moisture rich ingredients that last a long time, but I have to take one star back for the awful container.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like it, especially as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the fact that you have to use your finger for application.</li>
            <li> anyway, this lip butter doesn&#x27;t smell like caramel, but more like a Bath &amp; Body Works vanilla (which I hate).</li>
            <li> It boils down to preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I walked down the aisle with a lip balm folded into my wedding bouquet.  </li>
            <li> It does get slightly softer when exposed to heat, but I haven&#x27;t had any of them melt or anything.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight scent and taste of caramel, but not in a cloying way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no taste and it lasts longer than my usual EOS lip balm.</li>
            <li> a little flavoring just can&#x27;t cover.</li>
            <li> It has little to zero smell of caramel.  </li>
            <li> a little less \\&quot;melty\\&quot; than plain petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it leaves my lips rough and the smell is not great as I expected to be.</li>
            <li> In the tin, the color of the \\&quot;butter\\&quot; is an opaque off-white (see the picture I uploaded), but it does not impart any noticeable tint upon your lips, even when applied heavily.  </li>
            <li> I wore a few times</li>
            <li> &quot; I have used Carmex in the small tin before, but find it inconvenient compared to sticks, and the consistency is too much like Vaseline.</li>
            <li> It lacks both the advertised caramel smell and flavor and repeated use left a vaguely metallic taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> when my lips are drier than usual, this stuff does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get past the vas.</li>
            <li> I think this has to do with the Titanium Dioxide listed in the ingredients, I&#x27;m not sure,</li>
            <li> I carry my lip balm in my pocket and this tin takes up space and can be difficult to open.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be purchasing the raspberry and plain ones again and again!</li>
            <li> Some lip balms are too greasy or slick when I put them on, but this one is moisturizing without being icky.  </li>
            <li> I have a tin of 100% organic shea butter that works wonders for dry skin and lips with no chemicals or fake</li>
            <li> It was a little too thin for my preferences, however, because I found it slightly awkward to grip and open.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like sticking my finger in and wiping it across my lips, especially if your hands are dirty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any negative side effects from Vaseline, so</li>
            <li> There are also other unnecessary and unhealthy ingredients like BHT, Titanium Dioxide and Iron Oxides.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed to find that it is scented only; there is no flavor.  </li>
            <li> The product leaves a subtle glossy look on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of us prefer Victoria Secret&#x27;s and some prefer B&amp;BW.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind consuming trace amounts of unhealthy ingredients, then by all means, use this product.</li>
            <li> Nivea fails on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit weird that this is in a tin rather than a stick; you have to put it on your finger and then rub it on your lips.  </li>
            <li> Lip Butter is unfortunately quite descriptive.  </li>
            <li> ) it just made my lips feel dirty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The first ingredient listed is petroleum and it shows. The lip balm has a nice sweet smell and makes your lip feel rather slick. There&#x27;s really no taste and it lasts longer than my usual EOS lip balm. Overall, I like it, especially as a little goes a long way. The only negative is the fact that you have to use your finger for application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much a chapstick/lip-gloss junkie. I have so many in my purse and just use whichever one I&#x27;m able to fish out of my purse when I put my hand in. So naturally I would want to try ths Nivea Lip Butter Tin. The lip balm itself is very creamy as though it were real butter. It lasted quite a long time. I get very dry, flaky lips if I don&#x27;t use anything on them, and they stayed pretty moist throughout the day after using this product. The scent does smell good while in the tin, but once you put it on, the smell dies down a little and you can&#x27;t really taste it, which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I see to this is that it is in a tin. I don&#x27;t like sticking my finger in and wiping it across my lips, especially if your hands are dirty. A stick is easier to use when you are on to go. But overall, it is a nice little product and I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Some lip balms are too greasy or slick when I put them on, but this one is moisturizing without being icky.  It didn&#x27;t slide off my lips and it lasted a long time without adding more.  I love the caramel cream smell!  It&#x27;s very appealing and the taste, when I licked my lips while wearing this, was not bad.  All in all, I would recommend this product for everyone, but especially those who tend to have dry lips as the day progresses!  Also, I wore this under lipsticks and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in how long the color lasted - a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed some of Nivea&#x27;s products, so the Caramel Cream Kiss Lip Butter certainly seemed a natural choice.  The flavor was quite pleasant and it does an excellent job of moisturizing dried lips.  The only drawback for me was the vaseline texture.  For me it just something I find unnatural and distracting.  If it doesn&#x27;t bother you, this might be a good match as it scores well on other points.  It just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a different kind of lip balm, when I came across [[ASIN:B00AWRHA1S Nivea Lip Butter Loose Tin, Caramel Cream Kiss, 0.59 Ounce]]. Not only is it a different fragrance (Kind of tired of the fruity flavors), but it&#x27;s very light. You don&#x27;t need to apply much to your lips for them to be moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t have a taste, which I like, and I love the caramel fragrance. After my first application, it kept my lips moist for two hours! So, if you are looking for a moisturizer for your lips and you don&#x27;t like a lot of product, this lip butter is for you.</li>
            <li> This lip butter is definitely smooth and soft as butter, but it does not keep my lips moisturized for very long. It goes on smooth, but is a little greasy. My lips feel dry after a short time. I had to constantly reapply it which is surprising since it is so greasy...and the greasiness never quite leaves my lips. It&#x27;s strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has petrolatum, which I hear is supposed to be bad for you. I&#x27;ve never had any negative side effects from Vaseline, so I don&#x27;t know...anyway, this lip butter doesn&#x27;t smell like caramel, but more like a Bath &amp; Body Works vanilla (which I hate). Some of us prefer Victoria Secret&#x27;s and some prefer B&amp;BW. If you are a VS person, this scent may smell bad to you, but if you are a B&amp;BW person, you&#x27;ll probably like it. It boils down to preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, it is nicer than some lip balms I&#x27;ve tried, yet not as nice as some. I can take or leave it. Basically if it&#x27;s all I have, I&#x27;ll take it. If I have many choices, I&#x27;ll leave it.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm is Aquaphor, which was recommended to me by my doctor.  However, it is fun to try other products periodically.  Like Aquaphor, Nivea Lip Butter has a petrolatum base.  Compared to more natural alternatives, I have found petrolatum, in proper proportion, to work better without leaving a film.  The \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; of this Lip Butter is similar to a caramel candle from Bath and Body Works, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the balm better than most, but not quite as good as the best, in terms of preventing lip dryness for a long time.  Still, it&#x27;s a good product that I am enjoying and hasn&#x27;t caused break outs or buildup of guck.  I recommend it if you like lip balm in tubs rather than sticks or tubes.</li>
            <li> This product does make my lips feel soft but it really is nothing the least bit special.  It lacks both the advertised caramel smell and flavor and repeated use left a vaguely metallic taste in my mouth.  The lip butter is very soft which means that it is a trick to avoid getting way too much on my finger tip. It is also very susceptible to heat which makes it impractical for a summer purse or pocket.  Not something that I will finish up or recommend.</li>
            <li> A very creamy, lightly flavored, yummy lip balm that coats your lips to perfection.  You don&#x27;t have to use very much to get the job done.  I am a lip balm addict, and I love it when I find one that I like.  This one is a keeper.  It&#x27;s a creamy, oil based balm, in that it goes on smooth, not sticky.  Because it is oil based, it smoothes onto your lips like butter.  I can&#x27;t wait to try all the flavors!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lip balms.  They&#x27;re smooth and creamy, and they moisturize really well. This scent isn&#x27;t my favorite of the different varieties, but that&#x27;s just because I don&#x27;t like overly sweet smelling things.  It smelled a little sickeningly sweet for my tastes.  That wasn&#x27;t enough to dock a star however, because it&#x27;s still an excellent product, just not my favorite.  But if you like that sort of thing, this one will be good for you!  Personally, the raspberry is my absolute favorite.  This one has a caramel color to it in addition to its scent.  (The regular unscented one is just plain white and the raspberry is slightly pink, though none add color to your lips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when my lips are drier than usual, this stuff does the trick.  I keep a tin of it in my makeup container, in my medicine cabinet and in my purse, so I always have some when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin that it comes in isn&#x27;t at all messy or difficult to open, but at the same time it&#x27;s secure enough that it&#x27;s never come loose in my purse, even being jostled around all the time.  It does get slightly softer when exposed to heat, but I haven&#x27;t had any of them melt or anything.  The balm has always held its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent product and I&#x27;ll be purchasing the raspberry and plain ones again and again!</li>
            <li> I love this product: it&#x27;s one of the most moisturizing, emollient lip products available, and it&#x27;s inexpensive, smells awesome, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a very slight shine to your lips after using, so it&#x27;s great over a stain or lip color -- on its own, it provides excellent protection for chapped or dry lips. Unlike other heavily-moisturizing lip butters (or balms), this hasn&#x27;t caused me to breakout anywhere: it works as expected, and the caramel cream is heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only four stars?&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any SPF protection in it. As a result, it&#x27;s been relegated to nighttime use (before bed!), and times when I&#x27;m not outside much. Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it leaves my lips rough and the smell is not great as I expected to be. But I&#x27;m glad I have something to use for my lips.</li>
            <li> Yes this moisturizes your dry chapped lips. But it does so with petreum jelly. If I wanted vasine on my lips I&#x27;d just buy that. There are other oils and butters but they are minor players. The scent is very very light. I just can&#x27;t get past the vas. jelly texture.</li>
            <li> Nivea fails on this product. The front packaging says great things like &#x27;seals in moisture&#x27; and Shea Butter and Almond oil - good ingredients, good benefits. Turn the package over and you see the first ingredient is petrolatum, which is a by-product of petroleum. Yes, the stuff that runs machines and cars. Which is a complete shame, because shea butter and almond oil are great moisturizers on their own. I suppose it&#x27;s more cost effective for them to use the inferior product though. There are also other unnecessary and unhealthy ingredients like BHT, Titanium Dioxide and Iron Oxides. For lip balm. I just don&#x27;t get it. I have a tin of 100% organic shea butter that works wonders for dry skin and lips with no chemicals or fake ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the flavor. It smells pleasant and does have a mild caramel flavor at first, then instantly tastes fake. I bet that&#x27;s because of all the chemical ingredients a little flavoring just can&#x27;t cover. On a side note, the Vanilla Macadamia did have a better taste. (Although I don&#x27;t plan to use any more of either after my first test!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips did stay soft most of the day, so the product works as a moisturizer, although I much prefer using straight 100% shea butter and coconut oil for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in this when Nivea truly could have stood up for their customer&#x27;s health and avoided all the toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like the NIVEA CARAMEL LIP BUTTER  TIN. I&#x27;ve got dry lips that sometimes crack and chap, so I&#x27;m always using some form of lip balm or gloss that will help keep them soft and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NIVEA CARAMEL LIP BUTTER glides on smoothly and instantly hydrates my lips. It does have a slight scent and taste of caramel, but not in a cloying way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my lips seem to be getting better, holding onto moisture with fewer days of being dry and chapped, since I&#x27;ve been using this lip butter, so those are the good points about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are some drawbacks to the lip butter which keep it from getting the full 5-stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I don&#x27;t like the fact that I have to use my finger to apply it. Although the tin is thin and flat enough to keep in a pocket or purse, I don&#x27;t want to stick my finger in it while outside because of germs. Not only will you contaminate the container, but then you apply the product with whatever bacteria you pick up and put it on your lips where you&#x27;ll undoubtedly ingest it. Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing is that it does create a muted pale color to the lips. This isn&#x27;t an issue for me, but some guys or gals might not like it. I think this has to do with the Titanium Dioxide listed in the ingredients, I&#x27;m not sure, but since that&#x27;s usually the main ingredient in sunscreens, I know that usually coats and colors the skin with an ashy-white tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely, the third issue is that it doesn&#x27;t say that it has an SPF so your lips will still get sunburn if you&#x27;re outdoors or using a tanning bed. But, as I mentioned before, the NIVEA CARAMEL LIP BUTTER contains Titanium Dioxide, which is normally used as a sunscreen, but in this case I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s used for. Anyway, if it isn&#x27;t listed as having an SPF then you should assume that it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, aside from the small issues that I mentioned I think that the lip butter is pretty good for helping with chapped lips.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but didn&#x27;t remind me of caramel at all, just mildly sweet.  The feel of the product on the lip reminds me of wearing petroleum jelly, and when checking ingredients, it&#x27;s the first one listed.  It works exactly as if you were using Vasoline, and if you like that feel, then it&#x27;s perfect.  I will use the tin, but wouldn&#x27;t get another one.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying  I am a lip balm/ lip gloss junkie! I have tons! Nivea products have always been a fave of mine, so I had high expectations. I, again, was not disappointed.  Nivea really makes a superior product. They call in Lip Butter for a reason. This stuff is creamy and smooth. It is a perfect blend of thick moisturizer with out feeling like you&#x27;re slapping petroleum jelly on your lips. The smells is sweet without being over powering. I will definitley be buying more of this, since my daughter keeps trying to steal it for herself!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and keeps my lips moist without making them more prone to chapping once it has worn off.  I&#x27;ve had that problem with a couple of other lip products that were effectively \\&quot;habit forming\\&quot; -- works great while on, but if you don&#x27;t reapply your lips end up feeling worse than before you used the product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit weird that this is in a tin rather than a stick; you have to put it on your finger and then rub it on your lips.  Of course, it may be that whatever you have to do to make something like this hold up in stick form contributes to the \\&quot;habit forming\\&quot; problem of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, it&#x27;s worth it for long lasting, delicious smelling, non-habit-forming lip moisturization.</li>
            <li> The new Nivea Lip Butter Caramel Cream Kiss is a moisture rich blend of shea butter, almond oil and petrolatum to keep your lips soft and moisturized with a fresh caramel flavoring. It does have a few additives that help lock in moisture and you won&#x27;t need to use as much. I normally have used Vaseline lip therapy since it contains petrolatum and not much else. While that does work, it needs to be applied a lot. The cocoa butter flavor not as much. This Nivea mix rarely needs to be applied since one application really lasts a long time. The only downside for me is the round tin. It is clunky. I carry my lip balm in my pocket and this tin takes up space and can be difficult to open. I would love to see this in a tube or something like the plastic flip top containers vaseline uses. It is a five star mix of moisture rich ingredients that last a long time, but I have to take one star back for the awful container.</li>
            <li> I go through a lot of lip gloss/balm, so I figured I might as well give Nivea&#x27;s Lip Butter a try.  I was a little disappointed to find that it is scented only; there is no flavor.  The scent is light; I can&#x27;t even smell it once I put it on.  This is probably a good thing.  But when I can smell it (when I open the tin and while I&#x27;m applying it), it&#x27;s pleasant enough (not exactly caramel, but definitely sweet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is creamy and a little less \\&quot;melty\\&quot; than plain petroleum jelly.  It doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel goopy or sticky, even if you apply a lot.  In the tin, the color of the \\&quot;butter\\&quot; is an opaque off-white (see the picture I uploaded), but it does not impart any noticeable tint upon your lips, even when applied heavily.  The shine is fairly low sheen (a guy could probably wear this if he didn&#x27;t apply too much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butter made my lips feel okay, but nothing beyond what plain petroleum jelly does.  The tin is small and thin, and would be easy to slip in a pocket or purse (don&#x27;t put it in a pocket against your body, though).  It was a little too thin for my preferences, however, because I found it slightly awkward to grip and open.  And I would strongly prefer a stick-type application so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an okay product, but it doesn&#x27;t have anything particularly nice to recommend it.  I won&#x27;t mind using it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients: petrolatum, polyglyceryl-3 disostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, water, glycerin, glyceryl glucoside, BHT, flavor, titanium dioxide, iron oxides.</li>
            <li> I am constantly battling against chapped lips. I always have a chapstick, Burt&#x27;s Bees, or Nivea Stick in my purse, car, desk and anywhere else I might be. So, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to try this new \\&quot;butter tin.\\&quot; I have used Carmex in the small tin before, but find it inconvenient compared to sticks, and the consistency is too much like Vaseline. It works but it&#x27;s unpleasant on my face. This tin is also less convenient - you really need two hands and you need to be careful or you end up with too much smeared on your fingers.  However, in this instance, I think the inconvenience is worth it because the product is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually has the consistency of soft butter, or a very creamy lotion. It goes on smoothly and lasts alot longer than the sticks. And, it doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers feeling sticky. The Caramel Cream Kiss smells heavenly (like a Werther&#x27;s Original) and the scent lingers on the lips for a while, unlike most scented lip care products.  I&#x27;ve also used a bit of it on my nose, since it had become sore and chapped due to allergies - and it worked. In fact, I wish they sold this in larger containers as it would make a great hand cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable. Most chapsticks cost about $3 in stores, and the bigger Nivea sticks about $4. This is $3.99, as of this writing, and available as an add on for Prime.  I wish they had another fruit flavor (unfortunately, the Raspberry also includes rose which I don&#x27;t like) but I would buy this caramel again.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Burt&#x27;s Bees follower, tried and true. I rarely branch out, but I&#x27;m glad I did with this. It&#x27;s a nice size for a small purse, diaper bag, or pocket, and even when left in a hot car, it didn&#x27;t change consistency at all. The caramel smell is present but not overwhelming, which is good because I&#x27;m not a huge caramel lover (though I do like it and was willing to take a gamble on this). I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for other smells/flavors in the future!</li>
            <li> I used lip balms all the time because my lips always feel dry and I really like this Nivea Caramel Lip Butter. It has a very creamy consistency, much more so than many other lip balms that I&#x27;ve tried. And the cream and burnt sugar flavor is yummy. It seems to stick around for a long time and I don&#x27;t have to reapply it too often. The tin looks kind of small but a little of this goes a long way. It&#x27;s especially nice in the summer when I&#x27;m out in the sun. The little tin is easy to open and it fits nicely into the pocket of my jeans or in my purse.  The only thing I can think of that would make it better is that I would like to see is a sunscreen added to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie, and I love trying out new scents.  I&#x27;ve always liked Nivea products in the past, and excitedly bought this balm. I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice thick consistency, which means that it stays on really well.  The scent is also delicious!  It has a definite caramel scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin also opens and closes easily, and it has a thin profile, meaning that it will easily fit not only in a purse, but also a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the main ingredient is petroleum, but I knew that it wasn&#x27;t a natural product before buying it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked this lip butter. It was very much like the Carmex lip balm in the small jars, which are the best lip balms that I&#x27;ve used. It made my lips look glossy and lasted as long as overnight when I didn&#x27;t eat anything. My lips are really dry and flaky when I don&#x27;t use lip balm and this got rid of the flakiness. The smell is predominantly caramel but I feel like I can smell a hint of coconut. It fades away pretty quickly, so I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all.</li>
            <li> This lip butter is amazing. The tin seems small when you first buy it but seriously a little goes a long way with this product. It lasts forever and smells amazing at the same time. All together great product. Oh! and also it has a bit of a glossy finish when you put it on, and honestly it makes my lips look more plump.</li>
            <li> The product itself appears to work well. It smells nice. It keeps my lips hydrated and smooth. However, when I looked at the ingredients, I wasn&#x27;t happy. BHT?  Petroleum? Are you kidding?? Not what I want on my body or on my lips. If you don&#x27;t mind consuming trace amounts of unhealthy ingredients, then by all means, use this product. I just don&#x27;t understand why Nivea chose to use them in the first place. But I have discarded the remainder of mine and will not be using this again.</li>
            <li> Lip Butter is unfortunately quite descriptive.  This tin of mostly Vaseline (petroleum jelly) is both buttery in color and texture.  It does not last, and it definitely gets melty in the heat.  It has little to zero smell of caramel.  It absorbs incredibly quickly without doing much for slightly chapped lips other than making them peel.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to my stick shaped lip balm.</li>
            <li> My dad once called me a \\&quot;lip junkie,\\&quot; so I feel especially qualified to review this product.  Once my purse was stolen and the main thing I worried about was not having any lip balm.  I walked down the aisle with a lip balm folded into my wedding bouquet.  OK, enough about how neurotic I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use only Avon Care Deeply and Carmex, but I have branched out a bit in recent years.  Some products really do not work on me - they get gummy and waxy.  This balm is a keeper.  For one thing, I love the flat metal tin which will fit nicely in a purse or pocket.  Also, the taste/fragrance is very mild, definitely in its favor.  But mostly I just love how it goes on so smoothly and makes my lips very soft for a long time.  This is a great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;d seen many rave reviews of Nivea&#x27;s Lip Butters in magazines (which lead me to try it in the first place) but while it&#x27;s creamy in texture, it&#x27;s really greasy in wear. I tried to like it but not only was the flavor nearly non-existent (and very obviously fake) it just made my lips feel dirty. Like a bad sticky lip-gloss I wore a few times I was pretty quick to chuck this one in with my collection of bad balms and goopy glosses that didn&#x27;t make the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind a lotion-like greasiness on your lips this does have decently long wear and it really is buttery soft to apply, a little does go a long way. But if you want real moisture, and healthier ingredients for that matter, I&#x27;d give this a pass and go for one of EOS&#x27;s amazing Smooth Spheres, the sweet mint is hands-down the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I confess that I am a lip balm addict.  :)  My lips are accustomed to always having some type of lip balm on them, and I have tried many different types.  I really like this Nivea Lip Butter.  It spreads very easily, and it is only necessary to use a very tiny amount.  It seems to last a long time, and even after if wears off my lips still feel soft.  The Caramel Cream Kiss version does not have a flavor that I can tell, but it smells very nice.  The product leaves a subtle glossy look on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the present, Amazon does not have the ingredients in this lip butter listed.  It does contain some questionable ingredients such as BHT, so if you are interested in a natural product you might want to avoid this.  Ingredients are as follows:  petroleum, polyglyceryl-3, diisostearate, butyrospermum parkil(shea) butter, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, prunus amygdalus dulsis (sweet almond) oil, water, glycerin, glyceryl glucoside, BHT, flavor, titanium dioxide, iron oxides.  The product is made in Belgium.</li>
            <li> This lip moisturizer works well and tastes nice, and I would highly recommend it for use at home.&lt;br /&gt;However, lip moisturizer in a tin isn&#x27;t practical on the run, since application requires either greasing one&#x27;s finger or \\&quot;kissing\\&quot; the contents, which is something one probably wouldn&#x27;t want to do in public.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the lid doesn&#x27;t stay on very well, so I wouldn&#x27;t feel confident putting it in a bag with other things.</li>
            <li> This is a great lip product.  It lasts quite a long time and it has a pleasant flavor.  The tin is cute too and will make a perfect geocache container when it is empty! I think this is my favorite lip balm flavor that I have tried in the last couple of years.  I will definitely have to purchase these en masse to put in Christmas stockings and give to family and friends.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a long-lasting, flavorful lip balm.</li>
