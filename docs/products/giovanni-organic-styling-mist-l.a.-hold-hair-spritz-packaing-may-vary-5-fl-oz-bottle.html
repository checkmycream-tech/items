            <li>I love this hairspray....</li>
            <li>Love all Giovanni products.</li>
            <li>love that spraying it does not trash my lungs.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love that this styling mist is organic and vegan with no animal testing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for a better alternative.</li>
            <li>Glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>A spritz, not a spray, so better on the environment, the lungs.  </li>
            <li>My daughters &amp; I love using this as our hair spray.</li>
            <li>This styling mist works better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>I just love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost a year now and really love it.  </li>
            <li>We find it the most tolerable.</li>
            <li>I first bought it because I was looking for an eco-friendly product and now I&#x27;m fascinated by how good it</li>
            <li>I looked up &amp;#34;alcohol free&amp;#34; hairspray; this came out on top, so I figured it was alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I prefer other brands for the best quality.</li>
            <li>I can easily brush it off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the aerosol smell that is so strong and over powering.</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as some hair sprays but it does the trick without any harmful ingredients or hurting animals.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Does the job for light styling.</li>
            <li>Light spray holds all day.</li>
            <li>too comfortable.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it is important to note that this hairspray DOES contain alcohol.</li>
            <li>I buy this because it is Gluten/Wheat free hair product.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free company.</li>
            <li>so it is important that I use a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t cause a greasy or sticky buildup.</li>
            <li>Finding good quality natural products at a budget price is always a challenge.  </li>
            <li>This is the only kind we buy now!</li>
            <li>Love it, great spray with little to no flakes.  </li>
            <li>Really like this hairspray, which doesn&#x27;t have the toxic smell of many brands, but holds well.  </li>
            <li>I wear my hair up in the Summer to keep cool.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely not a pro at products like this, but it&#x27;s been good to me.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a hairspray that is not so hazardous to your health, many that are , are too wet, this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and not full of the chemicals that so many of the drug store or salon type hair sprays have in them.</li>
            <li>Great product - my wife will not use any other hair spray.</li>
            <li>When I became pregnant, I went on a search for an organic non-toxic hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly and was packed well.</li>
            <li>It has a very light fragrance, holds hair well and if my dog licks it off the tile, it is all natural.</li>
            <li>No sticky feeling, light and holds very well.</li>
            <li>These each get an EWG rating of just 2 (green), so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, so don&#x27;t overdue it like cheap sprays.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy using this hair product, but Giovanni should really rethink the bottle construction.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something more natural, this is not the hair spray for you.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li>I bought a 2 oz bottle at Pharmaca, and I used it right up, so I must like it.</li>
            <li>This spray has a pleasant smell and tames my slightly greying hair.  </li>
            <li>The hold is medium, and I had to rinse the nozzle a few times to make sure the spray comes out in a fine mist--no pump spray is quite as fine as an aerosol, but I don&#x27;t like using aerosols for any reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Note that I am picky about anything I put on my hair because having straight, blond hair, it can look greasy quickly.  </li>
            <li>It gives great hold to my thin, fine, straight, medium-length hair without breaking it or leaving it sticky-feeling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Tall order - it is exactly all those things.  </li>
            <li>but considering all the other great ingredients -- some derived from essential oils -- a superior product when compared to other things my wife has used.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve always robbed hair product from my wife - this is the first time I&#x27;ve bothered to buy it.</li>
            <li>Not only for myself but my two daughters love this product also.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the 3 pack and just finished using the first one.</li>
            <li>It provides a good hold without being hard or sticky.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my hairstyle very well in humid conditions.</li>
            <li>Gives my \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hair body and holds gently without a cement-like look.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my hairspray.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>Too much of a hassle to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>Do mountain men really use that stuff?</li>
            <li>- how much quicker does it need to be?</li>
            <li>This is a decent non-aerosol hairspray.</li>
            <li>Ok - so I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days - but I have to say it is exactly what I was looking for - healthy (according to the independent site EWG/Skindeep), natural, no alcohol, no aerosol, decent smelling, body building at my crown, no crispyness, brushable hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>live this spray its just right not to heavy and not to light either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an organic/safer hairspray product for a few years now and am so glad I found this.</li>
            <li>I did a product report with the new formulation and this product now receives a score of &#x27;5,&#x27; not &#x27;2.&#x27;</li>
            <li>The new ingredients are as follows:</li>
            <li>I live that it holds hair well</li>
            <li>It holds my hair exactly where I sprayed it, yet a simple brush-through removes it.</li>
            <li>I just wish the bottle size was bigger ;)</li>
            <li>Not very good work at making sure items work before being shipped out.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t offend my sensitive nasal passages, leaves no sticky build-up, and holds my hair in place without being cement.</li>
            <li>all natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What it does do is leaves your hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>It stays soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Bought this hairspray from my local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>All the ingredients are rated 2 or below (green), are organic, no phthalates, no parabens, and the company is certified Cruelty Free by Leaping Bunny (&amp;lt;...&gt;).</li>
            <li>and, if it has a fragrance, it is not heavy, nor is it cloying.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s about as all natural as you can get on the market.</li>
            <li>Pump spray and an all natural product.  </li>
            <li>can brush your hair after applying this hairspray and it&#x27;s still soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I use it for myself and my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It is not very expensive because it lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to hold the style.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve often brushed my hair after using it and it still helps to maintain the new style created by brushing.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is the lack of a screw top.</li>
            <li>U barely feel when u put on.</li>
            <li>Only use Giovanni products because they are made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Also, I wish there was a screw cap, so I could fully empty the liquid contents into a new bottle of styling mist or transfer the liquid into a smaller bottle for travel.</li>
            <li>I have naturally thin, fine hair, so it works for me.</li>

            <li> It gives great hold to my thin, fine, straight, medium-length hair without breaking it or leaving it sticky-feeling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Tall order - it is exactly all those things.  </li>
            <li> but considering all the other great ingredients -- some derived from essential oils -- a superior product when compared to other things my wife has used.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve always robbed hair product from my wife - this is the first time I&#x27;ve bothered to buy it.</li>
            <li> Not only for myself but my two daughters love this product also.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 pack and just finished using the first one.</li>
            <li> It provides a good hold without being hard or sticky.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my hairstyle very well in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> Gives my \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hair body and holds gently without a cement-like look.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my hairspray.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Too much of a hassle to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> Do mountain men really use that stuff?</li>
            <li> - how much quicker does it need to be?</li>
            <li> This is a decent non-aerosol hairspray.</li>
            <li> Ok - so I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days - but I have to say it is exactly what I was looking for - healthy (according to the independent site EWG/Skindeep), natural, no alcohol, no aerosol, decent smelling, body building at my crown, no crispyness, brushable hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> live this spray its just right not to heavy and not to light either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an organic/safer hairspray product for a few years now and am so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> I did a product report with the new formulation and this product now receives a score of &#x27;5,&#x27; not &#x27;2.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The new ingredients are as follows:</li>
            <li> I live that it holds hair well</li>
            <li> It holds my hair exactly where I sprayed it, yet a simple brush-through removes it.</li>
            <li> I just wish the bottle size was bigger ;)</li>
            <li> Not very good work at making sure items work before being shipped out.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t offend my sensitive nasal passages, leaves no sticky build-up, and holds my hair in place without being cement.</li>
            <li> all natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What it does do is leaves your hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> It stays soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Bought this hairspray from my local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> All the ingredients are rated 2 or below (green), are organic, no phthalates, no parabens, and the company is certified Cruelty Free by Leaping Bunny (&amp;lt;...&gt;).</li>
            <li> and, if it has a fragrance, it is not heavy, nor is it cloying.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s about as all natural as you can get on the market.</li>
            <li> Pump spray and an all natural product.  </li>
            <li> can brush your hair after applying this hairspray and it&#x27;s still soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use it for myself and my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It is not very expensive because it lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to hold the style.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve often brushed my hair after using it and it still helps to maintain the new style created by brushing.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the lack of a screw top.</li>
            <li> U barely feel when u put on.</li>
            <li> Only use Giovanni products because they are made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Also, I wish there was a screw cap, so I could fully empty the liquid contents into a new bottle of styling mist or transfer the liquid into a smaller bottle for travel.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin, fine hair, so it works for me.</li>
            <li> He really likes that it does not leave his hair to stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a stiff hold and won&#x27;t hold a specific area (high bangs)</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair so not using hairspray was not an option.  </li>
            <li> When you are down to the last bits you can not transfer into the next bottle.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday - my hair is never stiff and sticky like other hairsprays I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Even with that the tube sits all the way down in the bottle so getting ever drop is possible.</li>
            <li> It combs out easily without leaving hair dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> Non-aerosol spray makes my hair wet with this sticky stuff.</li>
            <li> sticky, too wet, hair doesn&#x27;t stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;You do the math.</li>
            <li> Then finding ones that do the job is even harder.  </li>
            <li> With more than one occurrence, the sprayers have been very difficult to push down.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair, and this hairspray, although it makes my hair stiff in order for it to hold, works well for me.</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning in the front for the last few years due to illness</li>
            <li> Aminoethyl propanol (rated by the EWG as a 0-low  due to lack of data)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Brushes out easily and does NOT leave your hair feeling stiff or dirty.</li>
            <li> I do wish the bottle was larger and less expensive, but it is worth the money as I use hairspray everyday and no longer want to expose myself or my baby to the harsh chemicals that are in hair products.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little healthier then other hairsprays.</li>
            <li> Odd?</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all, and I had to transfer the contents to the previous bottle.</li>
            <li> It is in a small square bottle that is hard to grip, and the last oneI bought also had a defective pump.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hairs in their assigned spots with little effort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I tired several organic non-toxic products and this product</li>
            <li> Been my favourite hairspray for quite a few years now.</li>
            <li> I am giving the three stars for the poor quality of the sprayer, which is a total challenge and nightmare.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> This hair spray mist doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky and stiff.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Hold well but does not make hair stiff.</li>
            <li> (there is almost no smell) and it holds my hairstyle without making my hair too stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> It holds the hair in place, if a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> With the current bottle design, it is impossible to empty the liquid contents, and the styling mist goes to waste.</li>
            <li> If you have thicker hair, I&#x27;m not sure it will hold it as well.</li>
            <li> fragrance not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> is the only hairspray I found that didn&#x27;t smell terrible and actually works!</li>
            <li> WRONG!!</li>
            <li> Almost impossible!</li>
            <li> this spray does the job, with no flakes and no sticky or nasty feel to the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty flaky gunk all over your hair and scalp.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Hubby uses and loves this product.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It&#x27;s not sticky or heavy.  Does the job for light styling.</li>
            <li> Even though i have below shoulder length hair, i still have short hairs here and there that needs to be held in place when my hair is up in a bun or something. this spray does the job, with no flakes and no sticky or nasty feel to the hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and works well with my hair. I have naturally thin, fine hair, so it works for me. If you have thicker hair, I&#x27;m not sure it will hold it as well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. The hold is very good without being over powering or crunchy. It lasts all day long. The scent is pleasant. And best of all its organic, you wont be breathing in all those crappy chemicals or putting them on your skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have to use hair products to keep my hair under control.  When I became pregnant, I went on a search for an organic non-toxic hairspray.  I tired several organic non-toxic products and this product is the only hairspray I found that didn&#x27;t smell terrible and actually works! I do wish the bottle was larger and less expensive, but it is worth the money as I use hairspray everyday and no longer want to expose myself or my baby to the harsh chemicals that are in hair products.</li>
            <li> Have been using Giovanni Organic Styling Mist for years after trying various &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; hairsprays that neither held up to their claim nor held my hair! This one doesn&#x27;t offend my sensitive nasal passages, leaves no sticky build-up, and holds my hair in place without being cement.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray....BUT it&#x27;s no longer rated a 2 on EWG. They now have a rating of 5!! Below is the EWG report. Still a great product but be warned if you are looking for an all natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION - The product above is not the same as Giovanni L.A. Hold Hair Spritz. The ingredients have changed. I did a product report with the new formulation and this product now receives a score of &#x27;5,&#x27; not &#x27;2.&#x27; If you&#x27;re looking for something more natural, this is not the hair spray for you. The new ingredients are as follows: AQUA (PURIFIED WATER); *ROSEMARY OFFICINALIS (ROSEMARY) LEAF EXTRACT; *URTICA DIOICA (NETTLE) EXTRACT; *THYMUS VULGARIS (THYME) EXTRACT; BUTELA ALBA (BIRCH) LEAF EXTRACT; *SALVIA SCLAREA (CLARY) EXTRACT; *LAVANDULA ANGUSTIFOLIA (LAVENDER) EXTRACT; *TUSSILAGO FARFARA (COLTSFOOT) FLOWER EXTRACT; *ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW) EXTRACT; *CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (CHAMOMILE) FLOWER EXTRACT; MALVA SYLVESTRIS (MALLOW) ROOT EXTRACT; SD ALCOHOL 40-B; ACRYLATES/HYDROXYESTER; ACRYLATES COPOLYMER; AMINOMETHYL PROPANOL; ESSENTIAL OIL FRAGRANCE&lt;br /&gt;Like Reply</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for a safer hairspray.  My hair has been thinning in the front for the last few years due to illness and I was getting frantic.  I have long hair so not using hairspray was not an option.  This spray has a pleasant smell and tames my slightly greying hair.  When I touch it or comb it out, there is no stickiness or stiffness.  It is almost like it moisturizes it.  At any rate, I have finally found what I am looking for and it is organic as a bonus.  Love all Giovanni products. Note that I am picky about anything I put on my hair because having straight, blond hair, it can look greasy quickly.  This product does not give it a greasy look - only manageable.</li>
            <li> Light spray holds all day. And non-toxic</li>
            <li> This hair spray mist doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky and stiff.  What it does do is leaves your hair feeling soft.  Spray mist holds your style in place.  It doesn&#x27;t have the aerosol smell that is so strong and over powering. It&#x27;s good for the enviroment.  Will purchase the Giovanni Organic Styling Mist again and again.</li>
            <li> Superb hold. Non Sticky. U barely feel when u put on. too comfortable. been using this item frm couple yrs</li>
            <li> Works great on fine hair. No sticky feeling, light and holds very well. Worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a successful purchase for the price!</li>
            <li> Much better than hair spray - and it holds!! Not to mention, no chemicals - organic. It combs out easily without leaving hair dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> This product has great hold, yet doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.  It stays soft to the touch.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Giovanni Organic Styling Mist for years and I continue to find it to be a great product. It is not very expensive because it lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to hold the style. It doesn&#x27;t give a sticky feel or a heaviness to my hair. It doesn&#x27;t make the hair feel stiff. In fact, I&#x27;ve often brushed my hair after using it and it still helps to maintain the new style created by brushing. It&#x27;s a good product and not full of the chemicals that so many of the drug store or salon type hair sprays have in them.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair, and this hairspray, although it makes my hair stiff in order for it to hold, works well for me.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray for organic - - love it</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this hairspray from my local Whole Foods. Firstly, it is important to note that this hairspray DOES contain alcohol. It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my hairstyle very well in humid conditions. My hair begins to lose its hold after about an hour. I would not recommend it for fine hair like mine. But you can give it a try; it might work for you.</li>
            <li> Gives my \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hair body and holds gently without a cement-like look.&lt;br /&gt;Also love that spraying it does not trash my lungs.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law introduced me to this product - Giovanni Organic Styling Mist - and I love it.  I use it everyday - my hair is never stiff and sticky like other hairsprays I&#x27;ve used.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t like this hairspray but to my surprise I do. My hair stays in place and the smell is not overpowering like others. It&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s a little healthier then other hairsprays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an organic/safer hairspray product for a few years now and am so glad I found this. It gives great hold to my thin, fine, straight, medium-length hair without breaking it or leaving it sticky-feeling. I checked out the ingredients on the bottle I purchased against EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database. All the ingredients are rated 2 or below (green), are organic, no phthalates, no parabens, and the company is certified Cruelty Free by Leaping Bunny (&amp;lt;...&gt;). Others have posted that this product gets an EWG rating of 5 (yellow), but check the ingredients for yourself. My label lists three chemicals that are not organic plant extracts: SD Alcohol-40B, Acrylates/Hydroxyester Acrylates Copolymer, and Aminomethyl Propanol. These each get an EWG rating of just 2 (green), so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Really like this hairspray, which doesn&#x27;t have the toxic smell of many brands, but holds well.  Came quickly and was packed well.</li>
            <li> I love that this styling mist is organic and vegan with no animal testing. It smells nicely and holds my curls fairly well. It is not as strong as some hair sprays but it does the trick without any harmful ingredients or hurting animals. I can&#x27;t ask for a better alternative. I have gone through 3 bottles and keep it on subscribe and save auto shipments. Even my boyfriend uses it to style his hair. He really likes that it does not leave his hair to stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my hairspray. For the longest time, my choice was aerosol freeze spray by John Mitchell company. I have been wanting a cleaner product for some time and decided to take a chance on this one. Glad that I did. It holds well and doesn&#x27;t make me want to choke to death. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This hair spray has great holding power.</li>
            <li> Been my favourite hairspray for quite a few years now. The perfect &#x27;stickiness&#x27;. You don&#x27;t need much, so don&#x27;t overdue it like cheap sprays. This spray also doesn&#x27;t make you gag.</li>
            <li> Ok - so I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days - but I have to say it is exactly what I was looking for - healthy (according to the independent site EWG/Skindeep), natural, no alcohol, no aerosol, decent smelling, body building at my crown, no crispyness, brushable hairspray.  Tall order - it is exactly all those things.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a stiff hold and won&#x27;t hold a specific area (high bangs) - it&#x27;s best for buildable body.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy using this hair product, but Giovanni should really rethink the bottle construction. I am giving the three stars for the poor quality of the sprayer, which is a total challenge and nightmare. With more than one occurrence, the sprayers have been very difficult to push down. Also, I wish there was a screw cap, so I could fully empty the liquid contents into a new bottle of styling mist or transfer the liquid into a smaller bottle for travel. With the current bottle design, it is impossible to empty the liquid contents, and the styling mist goes to waste.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Only use Giovanni products because they are made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I  have issues with fragrances, and hair spray has been one of my challenges. This one is great.  Holds beautifully and, if it has a fragrance, it is not heavy, nor is it cloying. I use it every day and I love it!</li>
            <li> Is the only functional hair spritz that I don&#x27;t have allergy issues with. Thank you, Giovanni.</li>
            <li> Works great, washes out great, no flakes, just love it. Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Great product - my wife will not use any other hair spray.</li>
            <li> It is a good price for those who need to pinch pennies. I prefer other brands for the best quality.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Hold well but does not make hair stiff.</li>
            <li> A spritz, not a spray, so better on the environment, the lungs.  Works well;  fragrance not overwhelming.  Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I looked up &amp;#34;alcohol free&amp;#34; hairspray; this came out on top, so I figured it was alcohol free. WRONG!! And I got a package of 3. Non-aerosol spray makes my hair wet with this sticky stuff. It&#x27;s awful. Too much of a hassle to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;Too sticky, too wet, hair doesn&#x27;t stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;You do the math.</li>
            <li> I first bought it because I was looking for an eco-friendly product and now I&#x27;m fascinated by how good it is!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice (there is almost no smell) and it holds my hairstyle without making my hair too stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> My daughters &amp; I love using this as our hair spray.It is a better alternative to all the toxic stuff out there that we used to use! This is the only kind we buy now!</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray!!  It is the only one that does the trick!</li>
            <li> great hairspray for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> great light hairspray!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this hair spray several times.  I like that the package comes with three bottles, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.  It holds the hair in place, if a bit stiff. I can easily brush it off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Great cruelty free product.  Use only on occasion, so will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Just cancelled my subscription. Two out of three delivered bottles do not spray.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I wear my hair up in the Summer to keep cool.  This styling mist works better than I thought it would.  There are no parabens or phthalates in it to pollute the earth so it&#x27;s a win win.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it and with no guilt about messing up mother earth.</li>
            <li> when I find something perfect, I always fear its going to be taken off the shelves.PLEASE DON&#x27;T EVER TAKE THIS AWAY FROM ME111</li>
            <li> A supposed Mountain Man writing a review on hairspray? Odd? Perhaps. Do mountain men really use that stuff? This one does! But it&#x27;s about as all natural as you can get on the market. And it works. Great spray midst (not aerosol!) Makes for an even quicker job - how much quicker does it need to be? Still has alcohol in it - and I imagine that drys my hair out still - but considering all the other great ingredients -- some derived from essential oils -- a superior product when compared to other things my wife has used. That&#x27;s right, I&#x27;ve always robbed hair product from my wife - this is the first time I&#x27;ve bothered to buy it. I&#x27;m definitely not a pro at products like this, but it&#x27;s been good to me. I can&#x27;t believe I just wrote a review about hairspray.</li>
            <li> Not only for myself but my two daughters love this product also.  It provides a good hold without being hard or sticky.</li>
            <li> Finding good quality natural products at a budget price is always a challenge.  Then finding ones that do the job is even harder.  This spray works.  It holds my hair exactly where I sprayed it, yet a simple brush-through removes it.</li>
            <li> Pump spray and an all natural product.  I buy this because it is Gluten/Wheat free hair product. Recommend this buy.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> This is a decent non-aerosol hairspray. I bought a 2 oz bottle at Pharmaca, and I used it right up, so I must like it. The hold is medium, and I had to rinse the nozzle a few times to make sure the spray comes out in a fine mist--no pump spray is quite as fine as an aerosol, but I don&#x27;t like using aerosols for any reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can brush your hair after applying this hairspray and it&#x27;s still soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray! I use it for myself and my 5 year old daughter. I live that it holds hair well but it doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty flaky gunk all over your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> 1) Alcohol, 2) Water, 3) Acrylates/Hydroxyester Acrylates copolymer (rated by Environmental Working Group / EWG as a 2-low), and 4) Aminoethyl propanol (rated by the EWG as a 0-low  due to lack of data)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...then lots of plant based organic products</li>
            <li> This is a great styling spray. Cruelty free company.</li>
            <li> It has a very light fragrance, holds hair well and if my dog licks it off the tile, it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Have been using Giovanni products for years and I keep buying them. BUT the pump spray is a challenge. The last LA Hold I bought didn&#x27;t work at all, and I had to transfer the contents to the previous bottle. Good luck trying to get the top off!! Almost impossible! Same goes for their Shine. It is in a small square bottle that is hard to grip, and the last oneI bought also had a defective pump.  I don&#x27;t like having to fight my pump spray.</li>
            <li> We use this product every day but oftern have to go to a speciality store to get it.  Getting in &amp;#34;bulk: mailed to us is a time and cost savings.</li>
            <li> I just love this hairspray. Very lightly scented and perfect hold. Brushes out easily and does NOT leave your hair feeling stiff or dirty. Great shine also.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a hairspray that is not so hazardous to your health, many that are , are too wet, this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love it, great spray with little to no flakes.  I just wish the bottle size was bigger ;)</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 pack and just finished using the first one. Opened the 2nd bottle and it will NOT spray. The 3rd bottle sprays like a hose and saturates my hair. Not very good work at making sure items work before being shipped out.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray!  This is my one of my favorites (this one and aveda brilliant).  I have been using it for almost a year now and really love it.  It holds so well and doesn&#x27;t cause a sticky buildup.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so it is important that I use a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t cause a greasy or sticky buildup.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I have been using it for years. It keeps my hairs in their assigned spots with little effort. Well done. The only complaint I have is the lack of a screw top. When you are down to the last bits you can not transfer into the next bottle. Even with that the tube sits all the way down in the bottle so getting ever drop is possible.</li>
            <li> live this spray its just right not to heavy and not to light either. holds hair well</li>
            <li> Great hold, quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!  It holds all day and it&#x27;s not sticky.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Used this hair spray for years now. We find it the most tolerable.</li>
            <li> Sprayers didn&#x27;t work and lid doesn&#x27;t come off so I couldn&#x27;t transfer to another bottle.  Other than that I would like the product.</li>
