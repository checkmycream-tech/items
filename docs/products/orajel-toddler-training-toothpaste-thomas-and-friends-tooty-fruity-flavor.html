    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I HAVE USED THIS FOR MANY TIMES, IT&#x27;S PERFECT.</li>
            <li>The kids loved it as it was Thoma&#x27;s &amp; Friends&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I always liked Tooty Fruity as a kid.</li>
            <li>He liked the taste which helped with the purpose of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The paste is flouride free, so that makes it good for toddlers.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>She liked the idea of Thomas the train paste, but as soon as she tasted it, she gagged it and refused any more of it.  </li>
            <li>quality is good, but I feel the paste is very liquidy, drips out of the brush at times.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes good too</li>
            <li>and I am sure in part because of the fruity flaovr.</li>
            <li>This is a product that is supposed to be safe for swallowing for a toddler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My child likes it and he would love to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li>This is my kids favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The network popular products, nearby of friend also recommend the use of toothpaste, taste good, and very safe, mother very assured, the baby was very like.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a toddler, you know getting them to do the basics (washing and brushing) is a huge pain.</li>
            <li>Well, the kid (three-year-old boy) likes the toys and my wife seems to want to get him everything else available with that branding.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s lot&#x27;s of things available, believe me.</li>
            <li>We raise our kids organic, and we wanted a training toothpaste fluoride free...</li>
            <li>It is floride free</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t ready for what was this toothpaste made of...Sorbitol !!!  </li>
            <li>You can say \\&quot;let&#x27;s go brush with thomas\\&quot; and get your kid excited</li>
            <li>Hence the \\&quot;really cool</li>
            <li>for him to squeeze and add to his brush, not messy since its clear gel and tastes good too</li>
            <li>1.5 oz is a good size: lasts a couple months, not so big he&#x27;ll be in high school when it&#x27;s done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect no flouride toothpaste for a 13 month old who is not able to &#x27;spit&#x27; as yet.  </li>
            <li>Not sure when we will out grow it, but for now, it works great.</li>
            <li>Well, he likes it and scrubs his teeth willingly with his Thomas the Train Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My wife came back from shopping with this \\&quot;safe if swallowed-fluoride free\\&quot; toothpaste with Thomas the train on it...  </li>
            <li>Really?!?  </li>
            <li>We have tried many different toothpastes from Wholefoods</li>
            <li>The dentist said &amp;#34;These training toothpastes might taste good, but they do very little, if anything to combat cavities.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get the guy to spit it out when it tastes so good</li>
            <li>My son really loves the flavor of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was very pungent myself...</li>
            <li>flavors\\&quot; for kids, so they can really load up on their chemicals</li>

            <li>Son hates the Orajel brand it taste too much like medicine</li>
            <li>This toothpaste should bare a warning label, for the parents to be aware of the chemicals their toddler will be swallowing (since we all know how much toothpaste kids swallow when TRAINING...</li>
            <li>One of the latest acquisitions is a small tube of Orajel Toddler Training Toothpaste with aThomas the Train image on the front.</li>
            <li>when I open it, have to be ready to catch it</li>
            <li>been using this as training toothpaste for my toddler for more than a year, at least 2x a day.</li>
            <li>Because our 6 year old grandson loves the taste so much, he is always anxious and willing to brush his teeth using this Tooty Fruity flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed that they&#x27;ve spent so much effort to secure popular characters for marketing, and yet so little effort to ensure that their product is actually safe and meets pediatricians&#x27; recommendations for a non-toxic toddler product.</li>

            <li> Back to that other paste now with the beaver on it.</li>
            <li> I found I could purchase the same item at target for quite a bit less, and it wasn&#x27;t on sale at the time.</li>
            <li> His other toothpaste tastes like bubble gum and has fluoride which he isn&#x27;t supposed to have.</li>
            <li> I am unsure if it is the flavor but toddler does not seem to like it, he has used other brands of toothpaste and i have never had a problem to get him to brush his teeth until now.</li>
            <li> Ethylene Glycol (Ethylene glycol, is commonly used in acrylic paints, brake fluid, antifreeze, tile grout, primer, sealant paste, floor polish, tyre sealant and shoe polish.</li>
            <li> The lid always blurps a little toothpaste out</li>
            <li> Even a little fluoride in toothpaste will prevent cavities at this age.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - teach your kids to spit by age 2 and USE a kids toothpaste WITH FLUORIDE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We had a hard time using other brands, our daughter loves Thomas the train</li>
            <li> but my kids always say they hate the taste.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED, WILL FIND ANOTHER TOOTHPASTE.</li>

            <li> One thing you want your kids to do is brush their teeth regularly. Because our 6 year old grandson loves the taste so much, he is always anxious and willing to brush his teeth using this Tooty Fruity flavor. Not sure when we will out grow it, but for now, it works great.</li>
            <li> Perfect no flouride toothpaste for a 13 month old who is not able to &#x27;spit&#x27; as yet.  She loves brushing her teeth and I am sure in part because of the fruity flaovr.</li>
            <li> The paste is flouride free, so that makes it good for toddlers.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is good, but I feel the paste is very liquidy, drips out of the brush at times.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes good too</li>
            <li> My son really loves the flavor of this toothpaste.  I recieved the item promptly and it was just as described.</li>
            <li> She liked the idea of Thomas the train paste, but as soon as she tasted it, she gagged it and refused any more of it.  I thought it was very pungent myself...couldn&#x27;t blame her.  Back to that other paste now with the beaver on it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a toddler, you know getting them to do the basics (washing and brushing) is a huge pain. This stuff turned that around for the brushing part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;+ You can say \\&quot;let&#x27;s go brush with thomas\\&quot; and get your kid excited&lt;br /&gt;+ My son loves the taste&lt;br /&gt;+ 1.5 oz is a good size: lasts a couple months, not so big he&#x27;ll be in high school when it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;+ tube stands on its lid, takes a minimum of space&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- The lid always blurps a little toothpaste out when I open it, have to be ready to catch it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using this as training toothpaste for my toddler for more than a year, at least 2x a day. No problems and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I found I could purchase the same item at target for quite a bit less, and it wasn&#x27;t on sale at the time.</li>
            <li> The network popular products, nearby of friend also recommend the use of toothpaste, taste good, and very safe, mother very assured, the baby was very like.</li>
            <li> We had a hard time using other brands, our daughter loves Thomas the train so we got her this and the Thomas toothbrush and now she loves brushing her teeth. She loves the taste and we would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> We seem to have a Thomas the Train home. Well, the kid (three-year-old boy) likes the toys and my wife seems to want to get him everything else available with that branding. There&#x27;s lot&#x27;s of things available, believe me. One of the latest acquisitions is a small tube of Orajel Toddler Training Toothpaste with aThomas the Train image on the front. Well, he likes it and scrubs his teeth willingly with his Thomas the Train Toothbrush. I tried it out, out of curiosity, and it tastes just about like Tooty Fruity (or Juicy Fruit) chewing gum. I always liked Tooty Fruity as a kid. His other toothpaste tastes like bubble gum and has fluoride which he isn&#x27;t supposed to have. This one  doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s probably just as well. It&#x27;s hard to get the guy to spit it out when it tastes so good and I don&#x27;t see any spitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> I bought this one following the pediatrician&#x27;s and the dentist&#x27;s recommendation. The kids loved it as it was Thoma&#x27;s &amp; Friends&#x27;.</li>
            <li> We raise our kids organic, and we wanted a training toothpaste fluoride free... My wife came back from shopping with this \\&quot;safe if swallowed-fluoride free\\&quot; toothpaste with Thomas the train on it...  I just wasn&#x27;t ready for what was this toothpaste made of...Sorbitol !!!  Ethylene Glycol (Ethylene glycol, is commonly used in acrylic paints, brake fluid, antifreeze, tile grout, primer, sealant paste, floor polish, tyre sealant and shoe polish. Oh yes.......and it&#x27;s also used in some \\&quot;smoothing lotions\\&quot; and \\&quot;firming moisturizer\\&quot;! ) , Simethicone (anti gas agent), so the side effects of Sorbitol (bloating, gas tar like stools, diarrea, etc can be offset), Sodium saccharin (petroleum based sweetner - 500x sweeter than sugar- used in diet sodas, and well known to cause and facilitate cancer- cancer cells feed of the molecules of saccharin-)... This toothpaste should bare a warning label, for the parents to be aware of the chemicals their toddler will be swallowing (since we all know how much toothpaste kids swallow when TRAINING... Hence the \\&quot;really cool flavors\\&quot; for kids, so they can really load up on their chemicals intake before they grow. VERY DISAPPOINTED, WILL FIND ANOTHER TOOTHPASTE.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this on a whim while grocery shopping with the kids.  One look at the ingredient list and we threw it away.  Parabens?!?  Really?!?  Our doctor warned us not to use lotions and shampoos with parabens on our kids, and those only go on the skin!  This is a product that is supposed to be safe for swallowing for a toddler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed that they&#x27;ve spent so much effort to secure popular characters for marketing, and yet so little effort to ensure that their product is actually safe and meets pediatricians&#x27; recommendations for a non-toxic toddler product.</li>
            <li> My grandson really likes Thomas &amp; Friends, so this was a hit with him.  He liked the taste which helped with the purpose of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> with Thomas n friends my son enjoys his tooth brushing time along w/battery op toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;easy for him to squeeze and add to his brush, not messy since its clear gel and tastes good too</li>
            <li> Beware - it is Fluoride-Free - UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has been brushing with this (we do the brushing), twice a day, since she was 1. She just turned 3 and found out she had 2 cavities.  The dentist said &amp;#34;These training toothpastes might taste good, but they do very little, if anything to combat cavities.  Even a little fluoride in toothpaste will prevent cavities at this age.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - teach your kids to spit by age 2 and USE a kids toothpaste WITH FLUORIDE.&lt;br /&gt;(also, she doesn&#x27;t really drink any juice, soda, etc, or sugary stuff)</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS FOR MANY TIMES, IT&#x27;S PERFECT. My child likes it and he would love to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li> I am unsure if it is the flavor but toddler does not seem to like it, he has used other brands of toothpaste and i have never had a problem to get him to brush his teeth until now.</li>
            <li> This is my kids favorite toothpaste. It is floride free so I like it. We have tried many different toothpastes from Wholefoods but my kids always say they hate the taste. So I keep getting them this one.</li>
            <li> Son hates the Orajel brand it taste too much like medicine</li>
