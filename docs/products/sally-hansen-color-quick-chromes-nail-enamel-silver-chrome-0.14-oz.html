            <li>The silver is a good but slightly dull silver that&#x27;s perfect with a shiny topcoat or sparkles.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, but it leaves a lot of streaks that you have to go over with more coats.</li>
            <li>so it applies more smoothly.</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply!</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s not as easy and fast to paint your nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when dry it did not look good at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, accurate without getting much polish on your skin, and fast drying for when you might be on the go.</li>
            <li>The chrome color is pretty cool too, and the brush gives nailpaints perfection.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Silver Chrome and the color is vibrant, bright and solid after two coats.</li>
            <li>I have a few of these pens in different colors, and let me tell you, awesome.</li>
            <li>It does dry fast as stated and it very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that it would look exactly like the picture on the box and come out really shiny.</li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a high shine.</li>
            <li>I bought it just to see how it would work, but I would stick to normal nail polish in the bottle.</li>
            <li>keep coming up with new things for nails</li>
            <li>The applicator is really easy to use, though I am concerned that the brush head will dry out and not be usable next time I use it since it is not kept in the nail polish solution.</li>
            <li>I thought, \\&quot;wow chrome, that looks</li>
            <li>I have used it several times, and the brush has not dried out yet.</li>
            <li>The chrome colors are so different, and classy, and I am not a teenager.  </li>
            <li>I normally have shaky hands when I use regular nail polish, but since I could hold this like a pen it made it easier to apply without as big if a mess around the edges to clean up.</li>

            <li> I was looking for some interesting nail polish colors today and I saw this. I thought, \\&quot;wow chrome, that looks neat\\&quot;, so I got it. I was hoping that it would look exactly like the picture on the box and come out really shiny. It isn&#x27;t as shiny as the picture, kind of like the luster of aluminum that isn&#x27;t really polished, but I think it looks great. The applicator is really easy to use, though I am concerned that the brush head will dry out and not be usable next time I use it since it is not kept in the nail polish solution. It also dries and sets really fast, I couldn&#x27;t make a dent in it with my nail just a few minutes after application. I thought I would need at least two coats, but after one coat it is opaque. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I recently have gotten into nail designs.  I have a few of these pens in different colors, and let me tell you, awesome.I love the fact that because it&#x27;s a pen, it&#x27;s easy to apply, the brush itself is pretty good, and it dries....quick!  I use the grey often as a base color.  If anything, I&#x27;ll always have the silver chrome as part of my colloction.</li>
            <li> I got this product,thinking it would be easy to use on the go. I was correct! The polish dries so quickly and is so easy to apply. I have used it several times, and the brush has not dried out yet. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My wife thinks its great</li>
            <li> I like the color. However, it goes on clumpy. I think the color has dried out somewhat. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to add some polish thinner so it applies more smoothly.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  Easy to use and dries quickly.  Good for pedicures. Seals well.  I&#x27;m going to try other colors. Happy.</li>
            <li> Clumpy and messy - disappointed</li>
            <li> Bought this for stamping. Love how quickly it dries. The silver is a good but slightly dull silver that&#x27;s perfect with a shiny topcoat or sparkles. The brush damages very easily. It&#x27;s no good as a nail polish brush but it&#x27;s perfect for stamping.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last too long and it&#x27;s not as easy and fast to paint your nails.&lt;br /&gt;it was a nice try, but i wouldn&#x27;t buy the product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with regular nailpaint, too thick and too thin at some points, the color takes time to dry and the impatient me somehow smothers it within that time, but this color pen took away all my woes! The chrome color is pretty cool too, and the brush gives nailpaints perfection. Easy to apply, gives an amazing coat throughout and dries off super-fast, I love it!</li>
            <li> i use this as a stamping polish works great the polish is not hard on my nails either. love it</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I thought it would save time. The brush is unacceptable, it gets all over the place and I must have a different definition of \\&quot;quick dry\\&quot;. It is, however, quick to get gummy and stay that way for hours. It looks cheap. Mine went into the trash after one use. Save your money</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply! It doesn&#x27;t seem like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; nail polish liquid though, but that may be because I bought a metallic color? I&#x27;d purchase another because the ease of application.</li>
            <li> These nailpolish pens are great!  They are easy to use, accurate without getting much polish on your skin, and fast drying for when you might be on the go.</li>
            <li> Brush is a bit cumbersome and stiff. After about 10-12 clicks the product begins to dispense. Color isn&#x27;t very opaque. Took about 3 coats to get opacity. Doesn&#x27;t have a high shine. Possibly great for touch ups vs. full application.</li>
            <li> these are so cool to work with! hope sally comesout with more colors. delivery was very quick  thank you  keep coming up with new things for nails</li>
            <li> It does dry fast as stated and it very easy to apply.  Chips very easy so I have to touch up daily.  Touching up does not really look that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived earlier then promised.</li>
            <li> The polish dries extremely fast and does not seem to chip super easily. Great for someone who needs a quick way to polish their nails.</li>
            <li> I really liked how the color just glides on and Im amazed on how fast it dryes really recommend it!</li>
            <li> It took many shake to get any polish to come out then I put it on but when dry it did not look good at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the color at all</li>
            <li> The product applies weirdly. It is easy to apply, but it leaves a lot of streaks that you have to go over with more coats. I bought it just to see how it would work, but I would stick to normal nail polish in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Silver Chrome and the color is vibrant, bright and solid after two coats. However, the brush on this looks like the end of a frayed rope!  It&#x27;s very coarse and uneven leading to rough edges. I&#x27;m disappointed that it can&#x27;t paint a nail as intended without looking sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll still be using it when striping or stamping but it is truly ineffective as it was intended to be used.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish. The style of the bottle makes it very easy to use. I normally have shaky hands when I use regular nail polish, but since I could hold this like a pen it made it easier to apply without as big if a mess around the edges to clean up. And it dries really fast as well.</li>
            <li> Loving it! These pens are so easy to use painting your own nails.  The chrome colors are so different, and classy, and I am not a teenager.  The shipping was soooooooooo fast!!!! So happy!!!!</li>
