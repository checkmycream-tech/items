            <li>It&#x27;s been awesome.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li>I just ordered on a whim and they turned out to be some of the best eye pencils I own.  </li>
            <li>Great staple colors to have.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, can&#x27;t find it anywhere on stores anymore!</li>
            <li>Amazing..</li>
            <li>These eyeliners are really nice.</li>
            <li>By far the best eye liner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>My favorite eye liner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also allergic to most products</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>And I LOVE having three colors to layer or not.  </li>
            <li>this one stays put better than most any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve dealt with it many times.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to wear all 3 without issues</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>A fabulous product!</li>
            <li>This is my second box cause they are the best.</li>
            <li>Physicians Formula makes a very good product and I will definitely add more products to my makeup arsenal.</li>
            <li>I loved this set so much I purchased the trio in the brown hues too.</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t too much of a problem though, it&#x27;s still a good liner.</li>
            <li>They go on so easy, smudged if I wanted them to, but would draw a finer line if desired.  </li>
            <li>The pens are easy to use.</li>
            <li>....makes for great liner for upper &amp; lower lids.</li>
            <li>Also the blue looks good as eyeliner</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel I am getting full value.</li>
            <li>It stays on really well!  </li>
            <li>Dark shades better then light.  </li>
            <li>The colors are not overly vibrant, but I feel they have the right amount of color needed to emphasize my eyes.</li>
            <li>I very recommend Physician Formula eyeliners for those who is working and wants to make sure that their eyeliner does not smash or totally disappears by the lunch time.</li>
            <li>I most love the blue and the dark blue,  but I do still like the light brown/bronze color.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner works very well - it applies smoothly without grabbing and stays put - but it is brittle and breaks before you use the entire pencil</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and seems to last.</li>
            <li>Absolutely ZERO burning,  watering,  itching.  </li>
            <li>This one has worked very well.</li>
            <li>What really sucks is that I absolutely LOVED the product &amp; I wish I wasn&#x27;t allergic to it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try out some new eyeliner, and this was very reasonably priced for three sticks</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply, stay put all day and don&#x27;t smear like other eyeliners can.</li>
            <li>New, unopened.  </li>
            <li>They last a long time and are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love the black and blue trio</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>In other matters,  i also switched to Almay one coat get up and grow mascara,  the non waterproof version,  as I am sure waterproof mascara is not good for my super sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I normally like to wear a navy blue eyeliner on my bottom lash line because I feel like it makes my eyes prettier, but I don&#x27;t see a difference at all.</li>
            <li>I bought the blue eye kit since I have blue eyes, and it really plays well with my color.</li>
            <li>For the price, it was worth it, but if you&#x27;re looking for what it claims to be (a black, a blue/black, and a brown liner set)</li>
            <li>It really brings out the blue, especially the black/blue eyeliner when used with the custom mascara for blue eyes!</li>
            <li>I bought the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; set and from what I can tell, the \\&quot;blue/black\\&quot; pencil is just straight up black.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> one of the colors seemed old and dried out</li>
            <li> bought it ar walmart. It applies smoothly and seems to last. The down-side is that it burned my eyes. I do have sensitive eyes so it might work for others.</li>
            <li> This product irritated my eyes in every color....Can not wear it....</li>
            <li> These were terrific. I just ordered on a whim and they turned out to be some of the best eye pencils I own.  They go on so easy, smudged if I wanted them to, but would draw a finer line if desired.  Their consistency was terrific as some pencils have a tendency to harden as they age and next thing you know you can&#x27;t use them.  Granted, with this ease comes the fact that they might not stay on during the sweatiest of workouts, but I have not had a problem wearing them during anything and they are definitely my go to pencils for liner or smudging. Love them.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye liner. Black with subtle blue shimmer is the only black eye liner I wear! I&#x27;m also allergic to most products but I&#x27;ve never had any issue with this product. Love it</li>
            <li> Great staple colors to have.  Just a little shimmer, but it is very subtle.  It stays on really well!  I never have to reapply, even if I wear from day to night.</li>
            <li> I have had THE WORST problem with my VERY sensitive allergy eyes and eye makeup making them burn and water terribly.  It has gone on for months.  L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al,  maybelline,  nothing I tried worked for me.  The option of wearing no eye makeup was not doable either,  as I looked tired and washed out without any on.  So,  after months of research,  I ordered this product.  Absolutely ZERO burning,  watering,  itching.  ZERO.  And that wasn&#x27;t enough to make me a convert,  the fact that these do not BUDGE, smear or rub off would! And I LOVE having three colors to layer or not.  I most love the blue and the dark blue,  but I do still like the light brown/bronze color.  In other matters,  i also switched to Almay one coat get up and grow mascara,  the non waterproof version,  as I am sure waterproof mascara is not good for my super sensitive eyes.  Anyhow,  I know you will NOT be disappointed in this product.  You&#x27;ll be a convert for life like myself!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time keeping eyeliners on.. this one stays put better than most any I&#x27;ve tried. Will Def buy again!</li>
            <li> New, unopened.  Great product for waterline eyeliner.  I love the black and blue trio ....makes for great liner for upper &amp; lower lids.</li>
            <li> I am so sad to say that this product has caused my eyes to have a horrible allergic reaction. My eyelids swell up, turn red &amp; I get somewhat  blurry vision &amp; look like a zombie for 2-3 days with blood shot red eyes &amp; everyone thinks I have pink eye. It took me awhile to figure out that it was this eye liner that was causing it so I&#x27;ve dealt with it many times. What really sucks is that I absolutely LOVED the product &amp; I wish I wasn&#x27;t allergic to it. I used the green eye trio for at least a year now with problems on &amp; off. The purple one is the one that causes my reaction. I can wear the green with no issues but I&#x27;m too scared to try the black. I used to be able to wear all 3 without issues so I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula or what?? I&#x27;m done buying this product. I hope I can find something that won&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> This  is the best brand of eyeliner.  It stays on and does not smuge.  My local store stopped selling it, so hurray for Amazon!</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are really nice. They are easy to apply, stay put all day and don&#x27;t smear like other eyeliners can. The colors are not overly vibrant, but I feel they have the right amount of color needed to emphasize my eyes. I wear contacts and have no problems or eye irritation with these liners. Physicians Formula makes a very good product and I will definitely add more products to my makeup arsenal.</li>
            <li> I like these eye pencils because they never need sharpening and they don&#x27;t smudge.  The colors are beautiful. I am very happy with them!</li>
            <li> By far the best eye liner I have ever used. I WILL buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best color of brown for my eyebrows.  Also the blue looks good as eyeliner The pens are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great colors and actually does last longer on your eyes.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I loved this set so much I purchased the trio in the brown hues too. Love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eyeliner that wouldn&#x27;t cause by eyes to itch, which I&#x27;ve had an issue with in other eyeliners. This one has worked very well. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it smugging either. It doesn&#x27;t shimmer as the name says. I bought the blue eye kit since I have blue eyes, and it really plays well with my color. I don&#x27;t plan on switching eyeliners. It&#x27;s been awesome.</li>
            <li> I very recommend Physician Formula eyeliners for those who is working and wants to make sure that their eyeliner does not smash or totally disappears by the lunch time. I am using blue trio all the time at work or when going out. I must admit that this is the ONLY ONE eyeliner that stays where it should be by the end of the day!!! Amazing..</li>
            <li> Dark shades better then light.  Some do not show up snd drag when applying.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner works very well - it applies smoothly without grabbing and stays put - but it is brittle and breaks before you use the entire pencil so I don&#x27;t feel I am getting full value.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have been using it for over 3 years. When I wear it, I get tons of compliments on my eyes!! It really brings out the blue, especially the black/blue eyeliner when used with the custom mascara for blue eyes! A fabulous product! [[ASIN:B0039BCT88 Physicians Formula Shimmer Strips Mascara Duo, 2-in-1 Brightening, Blue Eyes 7045]]</li>
            <li> This is my second box cause they are the best. They last a long time and are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, can&#x27;t find it anywhere on stores anymore!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try out some new eyeliner, and this was very reasonably priced for three sticks so I decided to try it. I bought the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; set and from what I can tell, the \\&quot;blue/black\\&quot; pencil is just straight up black. I normally like to wear a navy blue eyeliner on my bottom lash line because I feel like it makes my eyes prettier, but I don&#x27;t see a difference at all. That isn&#x27;t too much of a problem though, it&#x27;s still a good liner. My biggest disappointment was that the brown liner is so light, it&#x27;s barely visible. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t NOT recommend this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily rave about it. For the price, it was worth it, but if you&#x27;re looking for what it claims to be (a black, a blue/black, and a brown liner set) this is hit and miss.</li>
