            <li>Like many women I have used top of the line facial products</li>
            <li>Love this high quality product.</li>

            <li>FIRST REVIEW:  </li>
            <li>FINE LINES ARE BECOMING LESS NOTICEABLE.</li>
            <li>I apply it directly to my face and neck areas after cleansing and it goes on like silk, then absorbs nicely into my skin before I start laying my daily products...  </li>
            <li>I have skin that still tends to break out in certain areas on my face - even though I am over 50.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting it!</li>
            <li>Like this serum very much...it&#x27;s odorless and colorless and softens the skin.  </li>
            <li>well, I have now tried on my whole face...at night.  </li>
            <li>High quality oils like this one nourish and protect skin!</li>
            <li>I little goes a long way and it a bit too tacky to wear under make-up, but great to apply before bedtime.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased Banish Fine Lines to see how it would work on dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This product has significantly diminished dark under eye circles.  </li>
            <li>I am early 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My face is so soft now.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and have had no issues using this product either under my eyes or on my entire face.</li>
            <li>I have been plagued with sensitive skin my entire life, and have been blemish prone since I was a preteen trying every product I caught wind of.</li>

            <li> Really love this stuff, I also add a tiny bit and put it in my hair!!!! Also smooth skin and silky hair!</li>
            <li> I truly loooove your product!  the best out of 5 that I have tried.  bless you emubliss!!!</li>

            <li> Wonderful serum.  Reduces fine lines on face.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  FINE LINES ARE BECOMING LESS NOTICEABLE.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Been using this product now for about 3 weeks and I can notice lies especially around my eyes to diminish.</li>
            <li> Good stuff love using this serum goes on smooth and absorbs well..</li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> Great product!!  makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  I have noticed a decrease in fine lines and wrinkles!!</li>
            <li> Trying to incorporate EmuBliss into my daily routine and really love it...  Texture of my skin is very, very nice!

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Only leaves the skin oily</li>
            <li> Like this serum very much...it&#x27;s odorless and colorless and softens the skin.  I little goes a long way and it a bit too tacky to wear under make-up, but great to apply before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Good oil, I use in my hair.  Still like coconut oil better for my face.</li>
            <li> Love this high quality product. Would purchase again when needed. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference and I really like it!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  Now that I have used this for awhile, I want to write an update.      Previously, I had said that I only used under my eyes...well, I have now tried on my whole face...at night.  It feels a little heavy, but, absorbs well in under 1/2 hour for me.  My face is so soft now. Also, it has CURED the DERMATITIS I had going in and behind my ears.  Years of treating with prescription strength hydrocortisone cream....and this little oil fixed the problem better in days!!!  I am thrilled!!!    I have skin that still tends to break out in certain areas on my face - even though I am over 50.  This does NOT make my face breakout no matter how much I use!    If you want your face to feel velvety...use this oil.  I don&#x27;t wear make up, but, if I did, I would guess that it would go on very smooth after using this oil. I will order this again. Definately!    FIRST REVIEW:  I love the way this absorbs into the skin.  I use this to help topical relief medications go deep into my knees, back and neck.  A little heavy for my skin type, but, I do use under my eyes.  Works great everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!! WOW! I have been plagued with sensitive skin my entire life, and have been blemish prone since I was a preteen trying every product I caught wind of. This oil is amazing for skincare. You can have a flawless complexion with high quality oils like these. Don&#x27;t fall for cheap product advertising that makes us think &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; products are best for skincare, otherwise our pores will get clogged? WRONG! High quality oils like this one nourish and protect skin!</li>
