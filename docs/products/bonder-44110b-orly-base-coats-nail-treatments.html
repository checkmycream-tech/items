    <ol>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>Shipping was great!</li>
            <li>Their nail polishes are awesome but</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat I have ever used!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with that.  </li>
            <li>The Good:</li>
            <li>I love this product!    </li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I saw so many good reviews about it and thought purchasing it would be a no brainer.</li>
            <li>I discovered this basecoat because my favorite two nail salons both use it.  </li>
            <li>Okay for some reason nail polish does not like to adhere to my nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited.  </li>
            <li>This product certainly helps the nail color to go on easier and much better, and it has stopped the chipping.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good investment.</li>
            <li>It also works well as a top coat and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>If you already get a couple days out of your manicure, well lucky you.  </li>
            <li>For that alone, it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It may not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>My nail polish used to peel off after a day of so after applying, so trying to maintain a manicure wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>For me, this is worth buying.</li>
            <li>my nail polish began to peal of right away.</li>
            <li>Definitely extends the life of most manicures.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>Use a top coat and it&#x27;ll last even longer.</li>
            <li>first couple of times I tryed it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty maddening.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it makes certain polishes bubble.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>Some of my friends have tried it and say this doesn&#x27;t really make a difference for them.  </li>
            <li>My nail polish lasts much longer without chipping.</li>
            <li>TThis product doesn&#x27;t really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for about a year and it does help my polish stay on much longer than normal.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes</li>
            <li>Normally I wear nail envy, but when I ran out I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>I did not have top coat on and the polishes had not done that before, so I&#x27;m not sure if the Bonder or combination of bonder and polish caused it.  </li>
            <li>I have started using under the first coat and then under the second.</li>
            <li>Yeah I finally found a way to have pretty nails again .</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised how well it worked to grab the nail polish and has never once had the polish coat bubbled, smeared or streaked.  </li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, this product did nothing.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good base coat.</li>

            <li> This is a pretty good base coat.</li>
            <li> My polish lasted so long and there wasn&#x27;t any chipping at all.</li>
            <li> I mean I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to extend my manicure for a week, but thanks to this stuff, I&#x27;ve made it well beyond 24 hours</li>
            <li> If you have oily nails, it also helps to wash and dry your hands thoroughly and swab your nails with a cottonball soaked in alcohol before applying polish.</li>
            <li> I still had some chipping after a few days of wear but better than it chipping the same day that I put it on without the base.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat, but when I received it from BeautyLand4U</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this base coat!</li>
            <li> I mean comeon ORLY!</li>
            <li> I hate painting my nails because they chip in a matter of a few hours .</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Definitely extends the life of most manicures. Sometimes it makes certain polishes bubble. Not sure why some and not others. Overall a good investment. Dries quickly. I get about 3-4 extra days of wear.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this base coat! Normally I wear nail envy, but when I ran out I decided to try something new. My polish lasted so long and there wasn&#x27;t any chipping at all.</li>
            <li> I tried this base coat based on it&#x27;s mention in a few nail blogs.  I was very pleasantly surprised how well it worked to grab the nail polish and has never once had the polish coat bubbled, smeared or streaked.  For that alone, it&#x27;s worth the price.  My only issue is at times I&#x27;ve noticed the tips pull back with polish.  I did not have top coat on and the polishes had not done that before, so I&#x27;m not sure if the Bonder or combination of bonder and polish caused it.  I now use this exclusively for base coats, and can recommend.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This product certainly helps the nail color to go on easier and much better, and it has stopped the chipping.  It allows the polish to stain the nail bed ( I use red), but I will trade that for no-chipping and easier application.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  Use it as a base coat and your nail polish has something to adhere to.  Your polish will last longer.  Use a top coat and it&#x27;ll last even longer.</li>
            <li> Works really well and I do not feel the need to go to a salon. Only if I want to treat myselfe.</li>
            <li> The Good: Simply put, when I use this basecoat, I extend the life of my manicure from a day or two to a week plus.  The Bad:  Some of my friends have tried it and say this doesn&#x27;t really make a difference for them.  The Verdict:  It may not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  I love this product!    I discovered this basecoat because my favorite two nail salons both use it.  My nail polish used to peel off after a day of so after applying, so trying to maintain a manicure wasn&#x27;t worth the effort.  Now, I polish my nails all the time.  If you have oily nails, it also helps to wash and dry your hands thoroughly and swab your nails with a cottonball soaked in alcohol before applying polish.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, this product did nothing.  My nail polish lasted the same amount of time as if I didn&#x27;t use it, 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product, someone recommended it to me on IG. It might&#x27;ve worked well for them but for me the product didn&#x27;t do what it promised. Shipping was great!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about a year and it does help my polish stay on much longer than normal. Its just a must have</li>
            <li> This base coat does seem to extend the life of my nail polish. I have started using under the first coat and then under the second. This extends the drying time of both; but that&#x27;s not really a big deal.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good base coat. I still had some chipping after a few days of wear but better than it chipping the same day that I put it on without the base.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used! My nail polish lasts much longer without chipping. It also works well as a top coat and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat, but when I received it from BeautyLand4U it was obviously a knock off.</li>
            <li> TThis product doesn&#x27;t really work.&lt;br /&gt;the first couple of times I tryed it my nail polish began to peal of right away. I would take a shower and the nail polish would break.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> Okay for some reason nail polish does not like to adhere to my nails. My polish has chipped in less thin 24 hours after a professional manicure or when I do my nails myself. It&#x27;s pretty maddening. The woman that cuts my hair recommended this stuff, saying how her nails are always in water and it still made her manicure last.  Well it worked for me too! I&#x27;m so excited.  I mean I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to extend my manicure for a week, but thanks to this stuff, I&#x27;ve made it well beyond 24 hours and I&#x27;m happy with that.  For me, this is worth buying. If you already get a couple days out of your manicure, well lucky you.  But then I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for you.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference in the durability of my polish. Nothing special about this base coat that I could se after 5 uses</li>
            <li> I was told about this bonder by a friend . I hate painting my nails because they chip in a matter of a few hours . I got this and I have to take my polish off . Yeah I finally found a way to have pretty nails again . And they don&#x27;t chip ! I will buy this again .</li>
            <li> I ususally do not leave product review but I gotta say this is the worst basecoat I have ever used. I saw so many good reviews about it and thought purchasing it would be a no brainer. My nail polish peels completly within couple of hours of applying. I mean comeon ORLY! Their nail polishes are awesome but this is.crap. I had high hopes but I&#x27;m going to stick to my cheap Beauty Secret basecoat.</li>
