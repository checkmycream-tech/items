            <li>THIS IS AN OK BRUSH, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SOFTER</li>
            <li>TO HOW ITS MOSTLY USED ON YOUR LOWER LASH LINE</li>
            <li>I got this brush, and I love it.</li>

            <li>I love sigma and have added to my collection since receiving this brush.</li>
            <li>I love all of them except for this one.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s more time consuming</li>
            <li>This difference makes it more usfull.</li>
            <li>and i love sigma</li>
            <li>so glad I have this brush.  </li>
            <li>Its really Lovely</li>
            <li>This brush is so perfect for tiny details around your eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this brush.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t spend more than 25 dollars on a brush, I do expect it to not shed fibers everywhere.</li>
            <li>I just got this brush in the mail yesterday and I am so in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this Sigma pencil brush.</li>
            <li>I received my new brush in 2 days under prime and it is just as amazing as the rest of the sigma brushes I own!  </li>
            <li>They are as great as everyone says and I love this particular brush for building up my corner crease eyeshadow on my lids.</li>
            <li>I just received one of these E30 pencil brushes and was very excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>The E30 is great to work in color in the outer V area, but I use it mainly to buff out my shadow in the lower lash line area.  </li>
            <li>They are not only on par with M.A.C., they are above them with an amazing price for the great quality and the wonderful service!ough of the eyeshadow</li>
            <li>They are not only on par with M.A.C., they are above them with an amazing price for the great quality and the wonderful service!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and applies eyeshadow in the outer &#x27;v&#x27; and lower lash line awesomely!</li>
            <li>I love the makeup and Sigma brushes because they are very soft and leaves a great finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So excited!</li>
            <li>pencil brush is for precise application of color and it worked even better</li>
            <li>Great brush,the bristles are soft</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always packed with makeup brushes for myself and my clients and so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but when I&#x27;m doing more detailed work with the eyes I defiantly use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, easy to hold, and does a great job applying color.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this brush and the company!</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more after the original order just to have in inventory.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to get eyeshadow into the &#x27;V&#x27; then blend with my E25 brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the best eye pencil I&#x27;ve used so far thanks sigma</li>
            <li>This is a great, useful shape, but some of my $1 brushes haven&#x27;t even shed this much or gotten this scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I love this Sigma pencil - really great for detailed work on your upper lids.  </li>
            <li>Though I was already aware, this was a nice sentiment.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and apply the product amazingly, they are super soft and I cannot wait to buy more!!!</li>
            <li>Everything fine and on time</li>
            <li>Very fast processing and is a very nice compact brush and very percise tip</li>
            <li>I love this brush very much!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply makeup and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I would like to say that I saw on a review from someone that she was upset that Sigma does offer a free gift if you leave a review</li>
            <li>This brush helps with precise placement and smudging of color.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to order from Sigma Beauty as their products are fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to clean also.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy I finally have it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearsighted and need to be closer to my mirror than 7 inches in order to use this as precisely as I&#x27;d intended (for using eyeshadow as eyeliner).</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are comfortable and the customer will never feel scratches with Sigma.</li>
            <li>This is such a great brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I finally purchased this brush.</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase more Sigma pencils, they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It works great to angle in your inner and outer corner and in your crease.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily to smudge out my bottom lash line for that smoked out look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for applying shadow to the inner corner of the eye as well as on the bottom lid!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gone back to my trusty Eco Tools and Real Techniques brushes which I think are wonderful.</li>
            <li>The brush is of good quality and soft under the eyes to smudge out makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect because it&#x27;s small and precise.</li>
            <li>very well made and feels very strong.</li>
            <li>When I received my Sigma E30, I was really excited.</li>
            <li>First time buying a Sigma brush- the girls at work LOVE them</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already had a significant amount of bristles</li>
            <li>applies color very well and is very good for using in the inner and outer corners of the eye!!!</li>
            <li>After I got done with them I washed them and all 3 came clean without any problems.</li>
            <li>with this Sigma Pencil - E30 can this be also use as an smokey eye look and also can this be clean</li>
            <li>It is not as soft as the Sigma, but performs better and more closely to the MAC.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing brush, it&#x27;s really soft and precise,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to arrive so quick, overall I am loving my E30 from sigma. :)</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist i absolutely love my Sigma Pencil Brush and my Sigma Large Powder Brush.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle, very precise with natural hair packed bristles.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and has a nice grip.</li>
            <li>you will be hooked and wanting a full set as well.</li>
            <li>I have loved all the brushes I have ordered from Sigma actually, no complaints whatsoever...</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price at all.</li>
            <li>(They are great products at extremely afforable rates)</li>
            <li>I feel like I have purchased every brush set under the sun, yet I was still missing something...a good pencil brush!  </li>
            <li>I love the new pencil brush from Sigma, much better than Mac brushes, and the shipping was so fast, I can&#x27;t wait to order a full brush set from Sigma, if you have any doubts on these brushes then just order 1</li>
            <li>Keeping it short &amp; simple; this brush has got to have the best quality and price.</li>
            <li>Works if you are going for a bold under eye area.</li>
            <li>will have to make a quick purchase of a pencil brush at a store.</li>
            <li>shipping was quick and no problems.</li>
            <li>I love this brush!I received my sigma pencil-E30 brush the other day, and I love how easily it smudges and blends my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>The hair feels so soft and it can be easily cleaned love this so much</li>
            <li>They are great brushes, but I was expecting something a little</li>
            <li>very delicate bristles with perfect texture and density.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I have mostly all of sigma&#x27;s brushes</li>
            <li>There was no shedding and they felt nice and solid in my hand. .</li>
            <li>It is so useful</li>
            <li>The range of available shapes/functions is huge and so far the ones I use (foundation, eye &amp; powder)</li>
            <li>The bristles are a perfect texture (not too soft and not too stiff), pick up eyeshadow well, and have never shed.</li>
            <li>recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time.</li>
            <li>This brush has a nice, long handle and gave me a lot of control over where and how</li>
            <li>Really nice &amp; wish I had ordered at least 4 more.</li>
            <li>The first piece of paper informed me of how to first clean, spot clean, and deep clean my brushes.  </li>
            <li>Another decent cheap pencil brush that I like okay enough is the Sedona Lace pencil brush.</li>
            <li>Is a total dupe for mac 219 although its a bit fluffier so if you want more precise application ie high glitter or shine product I would not recommend this brush</li>
            <li>Plus, very fast shippment/delivery: just 4 days</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>Also arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>Ships fast!</li>
            <li>I love how this pencil brush from sigma applies pigment/shadow with such precision.  </li>
            <li>No longer sure this is an essential brush!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely buy another two of these now</li>
            <li>My first Sigma brush and</li>
            <li>It shedded at first</li>
            <li>It was the first time I cleaned them.  </li>
            <li>First, let me give a nod at the seller.  </li>
            <li>In fact, since that initial purchase Sigma is my favorite  brand.  </li>
            <li>Some of my super cheap brushes feel the same.</li>
            <li>I was surprised then, but I was even more surprised this morning!  </li>
            <li>and my brush is here.&lt;br /&gt;Second, as to brush it self: it is really a good quolity brush, with natural soft, not rough at all, bristles.</li>
            <li>brush is dense and stiff enough to brush color on your bottom lash line with accuracy while flexible enough to blend, has a tapered tip great for smudging eyeliner, and it could also be AMAZING for a cut crease or a defined outer</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything negative about this brush as its nicely pointed and works like a charm!</li>
            <li>It is good quality and small, good for people with small eyelid.</li>
            <li>The 2 bigger blending brushes worked great and the smaller pencil brush was very precise without being too stiff.</li>
            <li>often times this company is out of stock on many things because their products are in such high demand.</li>
            <li>sigma brushes are top quality, you never ever know how you lived with any other brush and they are such a deal especially compared to other high end companies, i own many sigma brushes and i have never hated one.</li>
            <li>It is great for getting dark accent color deep into the crease of your eye, or putting color into the outer-v, or outlining under your bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>The natural bristles are soft and makes application easy.  </li>
            <li>Much better than Mac and other high end brands!!</li>
            <li>I really like this pencil brush.</li>
            <li>The pencil brush works really well with detailing on the crease when applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I have purchased six brushes from this seller on Amazon and the shipping was fast and products were great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just got my sigma pencil brush and let me tell you it has made my eyeshadow application much easier</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, I bought this brush to see how much use I will get from it.</li>
            <li>Well the real deal was this brush not the kit, I use the E30 a lot, for defining my outer corner, on my lower lash line, on my lash line, crease...  </li>
            <li>I ordered the sigma beauty brushes because they have come highly recommended and I do not regret it!</li>
            <li>Has made application so much easier.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>Would like to mention that makeup geek makes a very similiar brush that I believe is cheaper but</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Not much to say except I love this brush.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I like sigma brushes so much</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I really like them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t grab for this very often.</li>
            <li>and I really shouldn&#x27;t have to do that when I paid this much for an eye brush.</li>
            <li>Really Recommend this brush ..</li>
            <li>The lines formed are completely straight</li>
            <li>It has a good point and bristles that are not too firm and not too soft.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish is that the handle wasn&#x27;t so long, but most makeup brushes are and also the price is higher than on the Sigma site so if you are interested in purchasing one, I would check out Sigma first and compare prices.</li>
            <li>A lot of the make artists that I liked were using them, amongst a bunch of others, so I thought I&#x27;d give a few a try.</li>
            <li>I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works for corrector, concealer, many other things also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice and firm, and makes it a lot easier to apply eyeshadow in high precision areas, like my crease.  </li>
            <li>Out of the 3 I&#x27;m pretty sure the pencil brush will be my go to brush , but that also could be because of the way I do my makeup everyday.</li>
            <li>(if a brush is good it is enough time to see it) and my verdict is: it is not as stiff and pointed as MAC one, and I really like it</li>
            <li>Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that even tho all 3 brushes I ordered (E35, E25 and E30) were different sizes all of them had the same feel in my hand.</li>
            <li>This is not what you want if you want the classic pencil brush.</li>
            <li>Especially if you aren&#x27;t necessarily the most expert at color application, like me.  </li>
            <li>When I was at the make-up counter, the woman tried to sell me the same type of brush for more than double the price of this one.  </li>
            <li>I use this brush mainly for color in my tear ducts and lower lash line</li>
            <li>(that was the main reason why I ordered it).</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and picks up pigment very well.</li>
            <li>overall, not bad but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again,don&#x27;t think the extra $$ for a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; is worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Its soft, and the handle is easy for me to hold on too since I have long fingers.</li>
            <li>weight of this brush- feels high end</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I opened my package, I was surprised to see more things than I expected!  </li>
            <li>the next day it is absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s normal or not.</li>
            <li>I use this brush everyday and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get a few more.</li>
            <li>Since my crease is a bit smaller, this would be useful to pack color and deepen the outer v</li>
            <li>Brush is high quality and very soft - just a bit more stiff that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I normally wash new brushes before I use them, but I couldn&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li>The next paper informed me of how to receive a complimentary gift (an unexpected delight!).  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without them now.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>the bristles are very soft</li>
            <li>Love how the small angular shape and the bristles are soft yet firm enough to really be able to place the color in the outer v!</li>
            <li>And SO soft, as all of the Sigma brushes are!</li>
            <li>It makes applying eyeshadow in an specific area a breeze and really makes blending the shadows under the eye area easier than ever!</li>
            <li>I ordered many things on Tuesday, just past 1:00PM.  </li>
            <li>I love this small pencil brush for applying my eye shadow in the outer corner of my eye.</li>
            <li>It puts the color exactly where you want it and can be used for multiple purposes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed (and very sad for the future of my wallet).</li>
            <li>My natural crease on my eye is not defined</li>
            <li>It is soft to your eye</li>
            <li>it is the only brush you need for blending all of your colors together gently tapping away on a paper towel</li>
            <li>A really soft pencil brush that delivers eye shadow to my crease or under my eye with precision.</li>
            <li>the end though the brush is soft and it doesn&#x27;t poke or itch your eyelid when you use it to draw on your skin or put color on the lower lash line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to see the shape of an eyebrow from further away than the edge of an eyelid.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles that are pointed and hold together well.</li>
            <li>Any doubts I had about Sigma have completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Any doubts I had about Sigma have completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money trying to find the right one</li>
            <li>I have purchased numerous Sigma brushes since my first purchase several years ago.</li>
            <li>They are consistently well made, last for years even with daily cleanings and will not break the bank to purchase!</li>
            <li>I usually reach for my MAC pencil brush instead and plan on purchasing another one, even though it costs ten bucks more than the Sigma brush.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I see a lot of reviews for various sigma brushes and I get an idea that Sigma brushes 1)should be soft 2) should not shed and be of general high quality.</li>
            <li>It spreads the shadow nicely and doesn&#x27;t scatter the color like other brushes have in the past for me.</li>
            <li>I just had a very basic brush set from Eco Tools that I got at Walmart but wanted a few more specific for eyes.</li>
            <li>The bristles were slightly rough, but did not shed when I washed it the first time and the bristles were noticeably softer after washing.  </li>
            <li>This pencil brush in my opinion is better than the ones put out by other companies(like MAC) and it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a bit hard at the tip and not as precise as I expected it for a precise shadow application, especially when you want a smoky wing.</li>
            <li>However, I have heard great things about Sigma through YouTube and different blogs, so I decided to give them a try since I was in desperate need of a pencil brush.  </li>
            <li>my last, rave review, I have used the brush several times, but I don&#x27;t use it as much because it has gotten scratchier, which is suspect.</li>
            <li>It still applies like a dream, but it is slightly more irritating to my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>I kept trying various brushes that seemed &#x27;close enough&#x27; to this one - but am so glad it finally just broke down and got it!</li>
            <li>I have washed mine several times and it keeps its shape without any wild hairs and hasn&#x27;t shed at all</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s definitely not something I need near my eyes.</li>
            <li>Honestly you can&#x27;t go wrong ordering from this company.</li>
            <li>This brush would also be good for creating a dramatic cut-crease look and I am planning on purchasing another to use with dark shadows.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is an extremely affordable high end brush.</li>

            <li> I own two and may just pick up a couple more.</li>

            <li> it should be fine!</li>
            <li> but they feel very cheap and</li>
            <li> Great brush perfect for blending in small areas of the eyes like outer corner , sculpting out your crease , smudging eyeshadow underneath your eyes and even for smudging or blending out eyeliner to give you more of a softened blended look.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for blending.</li>

            <li> I just received these last night and after I opened them I was so impressed with the feel of the brush in my hand</li>
            <li> This brush also works well to apply eyeshadow on your lower lash-line &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased this pencil brush and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and I would say that I love using pencil brushes for blending on my crease...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always been pleased with the quality of my sigma brushes</li>
            <li> Love using this pencil on the outer portion of my lid and in the crease (use a blending brush to soften).</li>

            <li> I love the feel/</li>
            <li> my uses for this brush have been 1) for cutcrease, although I find using an angled brush is better 2)for under the eyes, when you want a smoked out effect.</li>
            <li> I just love this brush.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush.  </li>
            <li> so I watched the videos ndnread more thoroughly...</li>
            <li> Use this brush for a variety of uses, but mostly for deepening the shadow color in the crease.  </li>
            <li> And am so glad.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN OK BRUSH, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SOFTER</li>
            <li> TO HOW ITS MOSTLY USED ON YOUR LOWER LASH LINE</li>
            <li> I got this brush, and I love it.</li>
            <li> but I am pleased that it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love it and am excited to buy more sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> I love sigma and have added to my collection since receiving this brush.</li>
            <li> I love all of them except for this one.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s more time consuming</li>
            <li> This difference makes it more usfull.</li>
            <li> and i love sigma</li>
            <li> so glad I have this brush.  </li>
            <li> Its really Lovely</li>
            <li> This brush is so perfect for tiny details around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this brush.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t spend more than 25 dollars on a brush, I do expect it to not shed fibers everywhere.</li>
            <li> I just got this brush in the mail yesterday and I am so in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this Sigma pencil brush.</li>
            <li> I received my new brush in 2 days under prime and it is just as amazing as the rest of the sigma brushes I own!  </li>
            <li> They are as great as everyone says and I love this particular brush for building up my corner crease eyeshadow on my lids.</li>
            <li> I just received one of these E30 pencil brushes and was very excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The E30 is great to work in color in the outer V area, but I use it mainly to buff out my shadow in the lower lash line area.  </li>
            <li> They are not only on par with M.A.C., they are above them with an amazing price for the great quality and the wonderful service!ough of the eyeshadow</li>
            <li> They are not only on par with M.A.C., they are above them with an amazing price for the great quality and the wonderful service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and applies eyeshadow in the outer &#x27;v&#x27; and lower lash line awesomely!</li>
            <li> I love the makeup and Sigma brushes because they are very soft and leaves a great finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So excited!</li>
            <li> pencil brush is for precise application of color and it worked even better</li>
            <li> Great brush,the bristles are soft</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always packed with makeup brushes for myself and my clients and so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> but when I&#x27;m doing more detailed work with the eyes I defiantly use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, easy to hold, and does a great job applying color.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this brush and the company!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more after the original order just to have in inventory.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to get eyeshadow into the &#x27;V&#x27; then blend with my E25 brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the best eye pencil I&#x27;ve used so far thanks sigma</li>
            <li> This is a great, useful shape, but some of my $1 brushes haven&#x27;t even shed this much or gotten this scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I love this Sigma pencil - really great for detailed work on your upper lids.  </li>
            <li> Though I was already aware, this was a nice sentiment.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and apply the product amazingly, they are super soft and I cannot wait to buy more!!!</li>
            <li> Everything fine and on time</li>
            <li> Very fast processing and is a very nice compact brush and very percise tip</li>
            <li> I love this brush very much!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply makeup and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that I saw on a review from someone that she was upset that Sigma does offer a free gift if you leave a review</li>
            <li> This brush helps with precise placement and smudging of color.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to order from Sigma Beauty as their products are fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy I finally have it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearsighted and need to be closer to my mirror than 7 inches in order to use this as precisely as I&#x27;d intended (for using eyeshadow as eyeliner).</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are comfortable and the customer will never feel scratches with Sigma.</li>
            <li> This is such a great brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I finally purchased this brush.</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase more Sigma pencils, they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It works great to angle in your inner and outer corner and in your crease.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily to smudge out my bottom lash line for that smoked out look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for applying shadow to the inner corner of the eye as well as on the bottom lid!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gone back to my trusty Eco Tools and Real Techniques brushes which I think are wonderful.</li>
            <li> The brush is of good quality and soft under the eyes to smudge out makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect because it&#x27;s small and precise.</li>
            <li> very well made and feels very strong.</li>
            <li> When I received my Sigma E30, I was really excited.</li>
            <li> First time buying a Sigma brush- the girls at work LOVE them</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already had a significant amount of bristles</li>
            <li> applies color very well and is very good for using in the inner and outer corners of the eye!!!</li>
            <li> After I got done with them I washed them and all 3 came clean without any problems.</li>
            <li> with this Sigma Pencil - E30 can this be also use as an smokey eye look and also can this be clean</li>
            <li> It is not as soft as the Sigma, but performs better and more closely to the MAC.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing brush, it&#x27;s really soft and precise,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to arrive so quick, overall I am loving my E30 from sigma. :)</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist i absolutely love my Sigma Pencil Brush and my Sigma Large Powder Brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, very precise with natural hair packed bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and has a nice grip.</li>
            <li> you will be hooked and wanting a full set as well.</li>
            <li> I have loved all the brushes I have ordered from Sigma actually, no complaints whatsoever...</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price at all.</li>
            <li> (They are great products at extremely afforable rates)</li>
            <li> I feel like I have purchased every brush set under the sun, yet I was still missing something...a good pencil brush!  </li>
            <li> I love the new pencil brush from Sigma, much better than Mac brushes, and the shipping was so fast, I can&#x27;t wait to order a full brush set from Sigma, if you have any doubts on these brushes then just order 1</li>
            <li> Keeping it short &amp; simple; this brush has got to have the best quality and price.</li>
            <li> Works if you are going for a bold under eye area.</li>
            <li> will have to make a quick purchase of a pencil brush at a store.</li>
            <li> shipping was quick and no problems.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!I received my sigma pencil-E30 brush the other day, and I love how easily it smudges and blends my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> The hair feels so soft and it can be easily cleaned love this so much</li>
            <li> They are great brushes, but I was expecting something a little</li>
            <li> very delicate bristles with perfect texture and density.  </li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I have mostly all of sigma&#x27;s brushes</li>
            <li> There was no shedding and they felt nice and solid in my hand. .</li>
            <li> It is so useful</li>
            <li> The range of available shapes/functions is huge and so far the ones I use (foundation, eye &amp; powder)</li>
            <li> The bristles are a perfect texture (not too soft and not too stiff), pick up eyeshadow well, and have never shed.</li>
            <li> recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time.</li>
            <li> This brush has a nice, long handle and gave me a lot of control over where and how</li>
            <li> Really nice &amp; wish I had ordered at least 4 more.</li>
            <li> The first piece of paper informed me of how to first clean, spot clean, and deep clean my brushes.  </li>
            <li> Another decent cheap pencil brush that I like okay enough is the Sedona Lace pencil brush.</li>
            <li> Is a total dupe for mac 219 although its a bit fluffier so if you want more precise application ie high glitter or shine product I would not recommend this brush</li>
            <li> Plus, very fast shippment/delivery: just 4 days</li>
            <li> Like it very much.</li>
            <li> Also arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> Ships fast!</li>
            <li> I love how this pencil brush from sigma applies pigment/shadow with such precision.  </li>
            <li> No longer sure this is an essential brush!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely buy another two of these now</li>
            <li> My first Sigma brush and</li>
            <li> It shedded at first</li>
            <li> It was the first time I cleaned them.  </li>
            <li> First, let me give a nod at the seller.  </li>
            <li> In fact, since that initial purchase Sigma is my favorite  brand.  </li>
            <li> Some of my super cheap brushes feel the same.</li>
            <li> I was surprised then, but I was even more surprised this morning!  </li>
            <li> and my brush is here.&lt;br /&gt;Second, as to brush it self: it is really a good quolity brush, with natural soft, not rough at all, bristles.</li>
            <li> brush is dense and stiff enough to brush color on your bottom lash line with accuracy while flexible enough to blend, has a tapered tip great for smudging eyeliner, and it could also be AMAZING for a cut crease or a defined outer</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything negative about this brush as its nicely pointed and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> It is good quality and small, good for people with small eyelid.</li>
            <li> The 2 bigger blending brushes worked great and the smaller pencil brush was very precise without being too stiff.</li>
            <li> often times this company is out of stock on many things because their products are in such high demand.</li>
            <li> sigma brushes are top quality, you never ever know how you lived with any other brush and they are such a deal especially compared to other high end companies, i own many sigma brushes and i have never hated one.</li>
            <li> It is great for getting dark accent color deep into the crease of your eye, or putting color into the outer-v, or outlining under your bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> The natural bristles are soft and makes application easy.  </li>
            <li> Much better than Mac and other high end brands!!</li>
            <li> I really like this pencil brush.</li>
            <li> The pencil brush works really well with detailing on the crease when applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I have purchased six brushes from this seller on Amazon and the shipping was fast and products were great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just got my sigma pencil brush and let me tell you it has made my eyeshadow application much easier</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , I bought this brush to see how much use I will get from it.</li>
            <li> Well the real deal was this brush not the kit, I use the E30 a lot, for defining my outer corner, on my lower lash line, on my lash line, crease...  </li>
            <li> I ordered the sigma beauty brushes because they have come highly recommended and I do not regret it!</li>
            <li> Has made application so much easier.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> Would like to mention that makeup geek makes a very similiar brush that I believe is cheaper but</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not much to say except I love this brush.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I like sigma brushes so much</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I really like them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grab for this very often.</li>
            <li> and I really shouldn&#x27;t have to do that when I paid this much for an eye brush.</li>
            <li> Really Recommend this brush ..</li>
            <li> The lines formed are completely straight</li>
            <li> It has a good point and bristles that are not too firm and not too soft.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that the handle wasn&#x27;t so long, but most makeup brushes are and also the price is higher than on the Sigma site so if you are interested in purchasing one, I would check out Sigma first and compare prices.</li>
            <li> A lot of the make artists that I liked were using them, amongst a bunch of others, so I thought I&#x27;d give a few a try.</li>
            <li> I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works for corrector, concealer, many other things also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and firm, and makes it a lot easier to apply eyeshadow in high precision areas, like my crease.  </li>
            <li> Out of the 3 I&#x27;m pretty sure the pencil brush will be my go to brush , but that also could be because of the way I do my makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> (if a brush is good it is enough time to see it) and my verdict is: it is not as stiff and pointed as MAC one, and I really like it</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that even tho all 3 brushes I ordered (E35, E25 and E30) were different sizes all of them had the same feel in my hand.</li>
            <li> This is not what you want if you want the classic pencil brush.</li>
            <li> Especially if you aren&#x27;t necessarily the most expert at color application, like me.  </li>
            <li> When I was at the make-up counter, the woman tried to sell me the same type of brush for more than double the price of this one.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush mainly for color in my tear ducts and lower lash line</li>
            <li> (that was the main reason why I ordered it).</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and picks up pigment very well.</li>
            <li> overall, not bad but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again,don&#x27;t think the extra $$ for a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; is worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Its soft, and the handle is easy for me to hold on too since I have long fingers.</li>
            <li> weight of this brush- feels high end</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I opened my package, I was surprised to see more things than I expected!  </li>
            <li> the next day it is absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s normal or not.</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get a few more.</li>
            <li> Since my crease is a bit smaller, this would be useful to pack color and deepen the outer v</li>
            <li> Brush is high quality and very soft - just a bit more stiff that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I normally wash new brushes before I use them, but I couldn&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li> The next paper informed me of how to receive a complimentary gift (an unexpected delight!).  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without them now.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> the bristles are very soft</li>
            <li> Love how the small angular shape and the bristles are soft yet firm enough to really be able to place the color in the outer v!</li>
            <li> And SO soft, as all of the Sigma brushes are!</li>
            <li> It makes applying eyeshadow in an specific area a breeze and really makes blending the shadows under the eye area easier than ever!</li>
            <li> I ordered many things on Tuesday, just past 1:00PM.  </li>
            <li> I love this small pencil brush for applying my eye shadow in the outer corner of my eye.</li>
            <li> It puts the color exactly where you want it and can be used for multiple purposes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed (and very sad for the future of my wallet).</li>
            <li> My natural crease on my eye is not defined</li>
            <li> It is soft to your eye</li>
            <li> it is the only brush you need for blending all of your colors together gently tapping away on a paper towel</li>
            <li> A really soft pencil brush that delivers eye shadow to my crease or under my eye with precision.</li>
            <li> the end though the brush is soft and it doesn&#x27;t poke or itch your eyelid when you use it to draw on your skin or put color on the lower lash line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to see the shape of an eyebrow from further away than the edge of an eyelid.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles that are pointed and hold together well.</li>
            <li> Any doubts I had about Sigma have completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Any doubts I had about Sigma have completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money trying to find the right one</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous Sigma brushes since my first purchase several years ago.</li>
            <li> They are consistently well made, last for years even with daily cleanings and will not break the bank to purchase!</li>
            <li> I usually reach for my MAC pencil brush instead and plan on purchasing another one, even though it costs ten bucks more than the Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of reviews for various sigma brushes and I get an idea that Sigma brushes 1)should be soft 2) should not shed and be of general high quality.</li>
            <li> It spreads the shadow nicely and doesn&#x27;t scatter the color like other brushes have in the past for me.</li>
            <li> I just had a very basic brush set from Eco Tools that I got at Walmart but wanted a few more specific for eyes.</li>
            <li> The bristles were slightly rough, but did not shed when I washed it the first time and the bristles were noticeably softer after washing.  </li>
            <li> This pencil brush in my opinion is better than the ones put out by other companies(like MAC) and it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a bit hard at the tip and not as precise as I expected it for a precise shadow application, especially when you want a smoky wing.</li>
            <li> However, I have heard great things about Sigma through YouTube and different blogs, so I decided to give them a try since I was in desperate need of a pencil brush.  </li>
            <li> my last, rave review, I have used the brush several times, but I don&#x27;t use it as much because it has gotten scratchier, which is suspect.</li>
            <li> It still applies like a dream, but it is slightly more irritating to my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> I kept trying various brushes that seemed &#x27;close enough&#x27; to this one - but am so glad it finally just broke down and got it!</li>
            <li> I have washed mine several times and it keeps its shape without any wild hairs and hasn&#x27;t shed at all</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s definitely not something I need near my eyes.</li>
            <li> Honestly you can&#x27;t go wrong ordering from this company.</li>
            <li> This brush would also be good for creating a dramatic cut-crease look and I am planning on purchasing another to use with dark shadows.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is an extremely affordable high end brush.</li>
            <li> someone who frequently does other people&#x27;s makeup, I don&#x27;t mind investing in my brushes.  </li>
            <li> i use it with Sigma&#x27;s flat definer brush and then use the E30 to smoke out my lower lash line.</li>
            <li> This will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Although it feels soft there is a definite &amp;#34;pointy-ness&amp;#34; to some of the bristles which can prick a little on the eyelid</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, this was just a test to see how Sigma brushes performed (it was Sigma vs. Bdellium and Sigma is, without a doubt, several tiers above all other brush companies at the same price point).</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and I like that it is slightly pointed at the end.</li>
            <li> After letting it sufficiently dry, I went ahead and did my makeup for my graduation later...</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about due for a new big fluffy face brush-</li>
            <li> Does the job, but I think that the brush I received was cut down a little too much...</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be having this brush for a long time.</li>
            <li> While my expected date to get my brush was next Monday at the earliest, I received it this morning!  </li>
            <li> IÂ´m thinking about getting other two E30, maybe next</li>
            <li> The trifold was a small manual on their Essential Kit of 12 brushes (I&#x27;m looking at this for my next buy!), including pictures and short descriptions.  </li>
            <li> even so I ordered only one brush, they sent it to me in a hard carton box, and the brush itself was in another, signature, box (for me it is really neat because other sellers would put such small items just in regular envelop).</li>
            <li> So, it does the job but its not a favorite by far</li>
            <li> is probably one of the softest brushes I own, which is crazy because this is a stiff brush!</li>
            <li> Works just as expected</li>
            <li> It is easier to apply in just the area that you want, and the color doesn&#x27;t fluff everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Sooo big and fluffy.</li>
            <li> The handle to this brush is longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> This brush is not my go to brush for everyday simple looks</li>
            <li> I really expected this to be softer.</li>
            <li> I have very hooded eyes; and it was difficult to get into the outer corners with a regular eyeshadow brush without smearing eyeshadow all over my lid (not a pretty look!)  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how divine all other sigma brushes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the other one in a Sigma set and it can be used with creams.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard about fake Sigma brushes being made because they&#x27;re not a massively expensive brush line like MAC, but when I touched the bristles I just had to wonder.</li>
            <li> I usually have an issue with them being too rough and irritating, but this one is actually too soft.</li>
            <li> It is a little stiff however and I&#x27;ve used it and washed it multiple times.</li>
            <li> Also, the bristles are a little rough and could be softer.</li>
            <li> this brush will not let you down</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m leery of trying to cut it down.</li>
            <li> I use the pencil brush to darken and define my crease when creating a Smokey eye with black shadow on the outer crease.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about buying these brushes online, not sure if I would get a knock off product instead</li>
            <li> and apparently some the of bristle seemed to be stuck together as if glued, making the bristle hard and stiff!  </li>
            <li> However, I am getting use out of it for filling in eyebrows with a little eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I checked them this morning and again they dried well and still no shedding.</li>
            <li> That was less than 48 hours!  </li>
            <li> There was two sheets of postcard-sized paper and a trifold, along with a stiff container.  </li>
            <li> It came in a plain plastic sheath, I removed it and felt the bristles wanting to feel the softness these reviews mention, but</li>
            <li> Stands up to cleaning, doesn&#x27;t shed excessively and isn&#x27;t overly harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I did my eye makeup without this little pencil brush!  </li>
            <li> I do have trouble applying color on the bottom lash line because it comes off too thick of a line.</li>
            <li> This product is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for people with small eyelids and small eyes.</li>
            <li> I usually use a smudge brush, but this gives an even smokier effect.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is used....</li>
            <li> From brush tip to end of the handle is a little over 7 inches, and I hadn&#x27;t thought about what this would mean.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;ve usually stuck to M.A.C. brushes and sometimes Arbonne.  </li>
            <li> So sad because I wanted to take it on a trip that I will be leaving on shortly so</li>
            <li> Instead I felt a pokey, stiff bristle!  </li>
            <li> however I did not own the E30.  </li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t seem to fray like on less expensive brushes, which means I&#x27;ll be using it for a while.</li>
            <li> This brush is serious biz; get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> For a little while I wondered if I received a fake brush.</li>
            <li> It was really irritating to use in that delicate area today, though.</li>
            <li> If the handle were wood, I&#x27;d have my husband cut it shorter, but it&#x27;s a very hard plastic</li>
            <li> It will change your lower lid game.</li>
            <li> Not a good idea!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these brushes.</li>
            <li> but I have to admit that it&#x27;s not wonderful.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this pencil brush.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush, you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>

            <li> It is good quality and small, good for people with small eyelid.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected</li>
            <li> I really like this pencil brush. Perfect for my outer v.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for blending outer under eye to your eyeliner- super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I have mostly all of sigma&#x27;s brushes however I did not own the E30.  I received my new brush in 2 days under prime and it is just as amazing as the rest of the sigma brushes I own!  I love this brush for blending.</li>
            <li> I guess pencil brushes aren&#x27;t my favorite to use so I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with them. But for what it is, I like it.</li>
            <li> The sigma brushes are wonderful, the finishes of the shadows and application of blush and powder is fantastic. The brushes are very soft and fluffy. I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever brushes good, the best is even Sigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time. What is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love for the products of Sigma.</li>
            <li> This brush is fabulous! It&#x27;s super soft and applies eyeshadow in the outer &#x27;v&#x27; and lower lash line awesomely! I think I need a back-up!</li>
            <li> eye make up without stain , use it!! excellent!! this brush is very easy to use,it&#x27;s like a pen. a bientot!!</li>
            <li> Great for defining a crease with smokey eyeshadow looks, and for creating a outer v look.  My natural crease on my eye is not defined so i create one this crease brush really is good for that. Awesome crease brush!!!!!</li>
            <li> The brush quality is AMAZING. The bristles are soft and has a nice grip. I really love that the Sigma label on the brush has a holographic effect which makes it look really nice. The pencil brush works really well with detailing on the crease when applying eyeshadow. I will be sticking to sigma brushes now that i know they are good quality.</li>
            <li> I just received these last night and after I opened them I was so impressed with the feel of the brush in my hand I had to use them! I love that even tho all 3 brushes I ordered (E35, E25 and E30) were different sizes all of them had the same feel in my hand. Kinda like holding a pencil. So I washed my face and put on more makeup! I chose a style that would allow me to use all of them, and use them the way they are meant to be used. There was no shedding and they felt nice and solid in my hand. . The 2 bigger blending brushes worked great and the smaller pencil brush was very precise without being too stiff. After I got done with them I washed them and all 3 came clean without any problems. I normally wash new brushes before I use them, but I couldn&#x27;t wait and I knew I&#x27;d be washing off the makeup I was going to be putting on. I checked them this morning and again they dried well and still no shedding. Out of the 3 I&#x27;m pretty sure the pencil brush will be my go to brush , but that also could be because of the way I do my makeup everyday. I would like to say that I saw on a review from someone that she was upset that Sigma does offer a free gift if you leave a review and yes they do, however they don&#x27;t say anywhere on the card that it has to be a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> When I received my Sigma E30, I was really excited. I watch youtube videos and they always use the E30, so I thought I should buy it. I have used it and LOVE IT! It is one of my favorite brushes!</li>
            <li> This brush helps with precise placement and smudging of color.  It has a good point and bristles that are not too firm and not too soft.</li>
            <li> Always a pleasure ordering Sigma Beauty products. I will continue to order from Sigma Beauty as their products are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love love Sigma brushes! I have purchased six brushes from this seller on Amazon and the shipping was fast and products were great.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend these brushes to anyone who is in need for good quality makeup brushes!&lt;br /&gt;I think I will probably buy a travel kit next time. The colored brushes in the travel kit are so adorable!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money trying to find the right one and this is it</li>
            <li> Just got my sigma pencil brush and let me tell you it has made my eyeshadow application much easier now i can apply eyeshadow on my crease evenly without having to go back and do it again.This brush also works well to apply eyeshadow on your lower lash-line &#x3D;)gotta say sigma great job.!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased this pencil brush and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s SO soft and gets into the creases and blends wonderfully. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good things about the Sigma Pencil Brush - E30... and I am very happy with this brush. It does a great job blending in my crease. I have pretty small eyes and I would say that I love using pencil brushes for blending on my crease... I do have trouble applying color on the bottom lash line because it comes off too thick of a line. If you have smaller eyes, I would suggest using this as a crease blending brush. Also, the bristles are a little rough and could be softer. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m rating this 4 out of 5. Other than that, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this brush and the company!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always been pleased with the quality of my sigma brushes</li>
            <li> Love using this pencil on the outer portion of my lid and in the crease (use a blending brush to soften). I also use it to soften eye liner.  I apply eyeliner and then choose a similar color in powder and blend in to soften.</li>
            <li> Keeping it short &amp; simple; this brush has got to have the best quality and price. Much better than Mac and other high end brands!! The packaging was great as well as the shipping. I didn&#x27;t expect it to arrive so quick, overall I am loving my E30 from sigma. :)</li>
            <li> I use this brush for the crease on my eye and I love it. It spreads the shadow nicely and doesn&#x27;t scatter the color like other brushes have in the past for me. The brush is soft and I like that it is slightly pointed at the end. The only thing I wish is that the handle wasn&#x27;t so long, but most makeup brushes are and also the price is higher than on the Sigma site so if you are interested in purchasing one, I would check out Sigma first and compare prices. The shipping speed was good and it arrived in my mailbox.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a good brush to blend creamy eye liner for a while now. I came across this brush in a tutorial on youtube and saw how good this brush was able to blend in the video. So I bought the brush and this brush is prefect for blending creamy eye liners!!! I am in love with this brush!!! I feel that it is a must have for someone who uses creamy eye liner!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pencil brush. I have wanted one for a while now and i&#x27;m glad i got it from sigma. The brush makes applying shadow to my brease a breeze and it works great for outlining the outer v of the eye. I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist i absolutely love my Sigma Pencil Brush and my Sigma Large Powder Brush. These makeup Brushes make my makeup process a smooth transition and ends up leaving my face flawless!! I recommend everyone to get these brushes!</li>
            <li> Since I go the performance eye it, I bought this brush to see how much use I will get from it. Well the real deal was this brush not the kit, I use the E30 a lot, for defining my outer corner, on my lower lash line, on my lash line, crease...  IÂ´m thinking about getting other two E30, maybe next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About quality, go for it!! It is soft to your eye (I have sensitive lids) and blends perfect!! A must have in your makeup bag!</li>
            <li> Ships fast! This is a quality brush and perfect for applying eye makeup in the crease and blending eyeliner. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> love these brushes are pricey for me but will buy one or two at a time till i get them all.....</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, very precise with natural hair packed bristles. Very good quality. I would highly recommend this especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This product is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for people with small eyelids and small eyes. The natural bristles are soft and makes application easy.  I would recommend this product to others.  Thank you Sigma.</li>
            <li> This is one awesome brush! Don&#x27;t know how I ever did my eye shadow without it.</li>
            <li> Pinceau de qualitÃ©, look trÃ¨s haut de gamme Ã  avoir absolument dans sa trousse Ã  maquillage pour un maquillage parfait.</li>
            <li> I ordered the sigma beauty brushes because they have come highly recommended and I do not regret it! They are great brushes, but I was expecting something a little softer-- I find the eco tools to be softer, but these do the job I wanted them to do!(:</li>
            <li> I love my four Sigma Brushes!! They are great for use!! Must affordable than the MAC Brushes!! Does the same work Mac brushes does. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these brushes. I did wash them as recommended in the brush usage pamphelet. If you need a tutorial go to youtube and a lady name Lipshock can help you with the brushes</li>
            <li> I love the new pencil brush from Sigma, much better than Mac brushes, and the shipping was so fast, I can&#x27;t wait to order a full brush set from Sigma, if you have any doubts on these brushes then just order 1 you will be hooked and wanting a full set as well.</li>
            <li> The scratchiest brush ever and it&#x27;s for your eye?!? Not a good idea!</li>
            <li> I love how this pencil brush from sigma applies pigment/shadow with such precision.  Has made application so much easier. I kept trying various brushes that seemed &#x27;close enough&#x27; to this one - but am so glad it finally just broke down and got it!</li>
            <li> Not a pencil brush. This is not what you want if you want the classic pencil brush. This is a tapaered brush. Not what is pictured.     The ultimate blending brush. Sigma this brush will not let you down it is the only brush you need for blending all of your colors together gently tapping away on a paper towel remove any excess product and use it again the next day it is absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. What else can I say. I love these brushes. My makeup goes on a lot smoother and more effortless since I started buying sigma brushes. I am in the process of replacing all my brushes to sigma brushes. I already have several.  I&#x27;d like to have them all!!! There a bit pricy but worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s really nice and firm, and makes it a lot easier to apply eyeshadow in high precision areas, like my crease.  Especially if you aren&#x27;t necessarily the most expert at color application, like me.  It is easier to apply in just the area that you want, and the color doesn&#x27;t fluff everywhere.  Love this brush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I have loved all the brushes I have ordered from Sigma actually, no complaints whatsoever... however I use this brush for many uses. It is great for getting dark accent color deep into the crease of your eye, or putting color into the outer-v, or outlining under your bottom lashes. It&#x27;s just a perfect jack-of-all-trades brush! And SO soft, as all of the Sigma brushes are! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> I love the sigma brushes I ordered! Products came quickly and in great shape. I would definatly order from amazon again.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. Very soft bristles. Worked well when using it in my crease. Picks up color well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush from Amazon because my local retailers didn&#x27;t have it in stock. My order arrived promptly and the brush is amazing! It&#x27;s soft, easy to hold, and does a great job applying color. The bristles don&#x27;t seem to fray like on less expensive brushes, which means I&#x27;ll be using it for a while. I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone!</li>
            <li> Perfect perfect perfect no shedding love this brush!</li>
            <li> The pencil brush is so good for creating outer \\&quot;V&#x27;s\\&quot; on the outer crease. When I washed it, there was like three hairs that shed, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything to be worried about. It&#x27;s also perfect for my tiny eyes I can control where the colors go perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fabulous brush!  Gets color in the crease perfectly. And no shedding at all. When I was at the make-up counter, the woman tried to sell me the same type of brush for more than double the price of this one.  Never going to buy a cosmetic brush from anywhere else again.</li>
            <li> I love sigma brushes!  I couldn&#x27;t live without them now.</li>
            <li> I have several crease pencils but this one is the best. It releases the pigments on the eye rather than storing it on the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for liner under they eyes and blending the color. The brush is very soft and picks up pigment very well. Love this brand.</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush for applying shadow under the bottom lashes... Does the job, but I think that the brush I received was cut down a little too much... The tip is a tad bit on the rounded off side. Overall I like this brush, applies color very well and is very good for using in the inner and outer corners of the eye!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried that the brush would be domed shaped (like a crease brush). However, IT WAS NOT! I love it. My search for a pencil brush is over. I love this brush. I&#x27;ll be getting a couple more.</li>
            <li> This is a definite buy! The price is great and do is the quality. Really nice &amp; wish I had ordered at least 4 more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I did my eye makeup without this little pencil brush!  I have very hooded eyes; and it was difficult to get into the outer corners with a regular eyeshadow brush without smearing eyeshadow all over my lid (not a pretty look!)  With this brush it&#x27;s easy to get eyeshadow into the &#x27;V&#x27; then blend with my E25 brush. It&#x27;s also a great brush for smudging shadow along eye line.  The brush came on time &amp; was packaged securely in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Great Pencil brush - wish it was slightly more &amp;#34;bendy&amp;#34; for easier to blend out under eye shadow. It leaves a bit of a line that takes some time to blend out. Works if you are going for a bold under eye area. Brush is high quality and very soft - just a bit more stiff that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> First time buying a Sigma brush- the girls at work LOVE them so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I love the feel/weight of this brush- feels high end and it picks up a lot of product.  I&#x27;m about due for a new big fluffy face brush- I will definitely buy a Sigma.</li>
            <li> Great product I would repurchase it again&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best eye pencil I&#x27;ve used so far thanks sigma you are the best</li>
            <li> His grandfather and his grandfather conduction velocity they are great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very amazing to me with all your dealings with the speed and ease</li>
            <li> I use this brush every day to highlight under my brows and around the tear ducts of my eyes. The bristles are a perfect texture (not too soft and not too stiff), pick up eyeshadow well, and have never shed. This brush would also be good for creating a dramatic cut-crease look and I am planning on purchasing another to use with dark shadows. Overall, this is an extremely affordable high end brush.</li>
            <li> I Just love this! very well made and feels very strong. I think I&#x27;ll be having this brush for a long time.</li>
            <li> 10 month update ***&lt;br /&gt;Since my last, rave review, I have used the brush several times, but I don&#x27;t use it as much because it has gotten scratchier, which is suspect. Also a hair falls out every time I use it. Some of my super cheap brushes feel the same. I don&#x27;t know why this is. It still applies like a dream, but it is slightly more irritating to my sensitive eye area. I see a lot of reviews for various sigma brushes and I get an idea that Sigma brushes 1)should be soft 2) should not shed and be of general high quality. This is a great, useful shape, but some of my $1 brushes haven&#x27;t even shed this much or gotten this scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my uses for this brush have been 1) for cutcrease, although I find using an angled brush is better 2)for under the eyes, when you want a smoked out effect. I usually use a smudge brush, but this gives an even smokier effect. It was really irritating to use in that delicate area today, though. No longer sure this is an essential brush!&lt;br /&gt;_____&lt;br /&gt;This is probably one of the softest brushes I own, which is crazy because this is a stiff brush! I can&#x27;t imagine how divine all other sigma brushes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencil brush is for precise application of color and it worked even better that I thought it would. This brush has a nice, long handle and gave me a lot of control over where and how my eyeshadow applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, this was just a test to see how Sigma brushes performed (it was Sigma vs. Bdellium and Sigma is, without a doubt, several tiers above all other brush companies at the same price point). I&#x27;m really impressed (and very sad for the future of my wallet). I am going to save up for an entire kit!</li>
            <li> This is the best pencil brush in the world. That is all. It blends beautifully!</li>
            <li> Great brush,the bristles are soft it&#x27;s good quality,i would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I just love this brush. It is so useful and it doesn&#x27;t shed. I own two and may just pick up a couple more.</li>
            <li> I use the pencil brush to darken and define my crease when creating a Smokey eye with black shadow on the outer crease.</li>
            <li> A really soft pencil brush that delivers eye shadow to my crease or under my eye with precision. I have washed mine several times and it keeps its shape without any wild hairs and hasn&#x27;t shed at all</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome!! Love how the small angular shape and the bristles are soft yet firm enough to really be able to place the color in the outer v! It&#x27;s all great for blending color on the lower lash line! Great brush!! Would like to mention that makeup geek makes a very similiar brush that I believe is cheaper but often times this company is out of stock on many things because their products are in such high demand. (They are great products at extremely afforable rates) But the Sigma E30 is very good and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not much to say except I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Everything fine and on time</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these. I use this with my powders only. It works very well. I got the other one in a Sigma set and it can be used with creams.</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Is a total dupe for mac 219 although its a bit fluffier so if you want more precise application ie high glitter or shine product I would not recommend this brush</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush.  I had been buying the MAC brushes until I found a stylist on youtube that used sigma brushes.  These will be the ones I get from now own! ... Just as good and much more affordable.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is used....so I watched the videos ndnread more thoroughly...it should be fine!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this brush! i use it with Sigma&#x27;s flat definer brush and then use the E30 to smoke out my lower lash line. Sigma brushes never shed and apply makeup beautifully.</li>
            <li> Anything sigma is amazing!! Honestly you can&#x27;t go wrong ordering from this company. Customer service is great too. And this brush is my very favorite. Sooo big and fluffy.</li>
            <li> This pencil brush in my opinion is better than the ones put out by other companies(like MAC) and it&#x27;s half the price. I washed this brush when I opened it and I didn&#x27;t notice any shedding at al. I would prefer to have gotten he synthetic one, but I purchased this one.  I like sigma brushes so much, I&#x27;m saving up for the Mrs. Bunny brush set.</li>
            <li> Really nice pencil brush! Works well and the price was great! I&#x27;ll most likely buy another two of these now that I know I like them.</li>
            <li> My first Sigma brush and it is AMAZING!  Fast shipping &amp; great product! I lo e the quality of this brush and it is perfect for applying color to your crease. It&#x27;s so easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but I have to admit that it&#x27;s not wonderful. For a little while I wondered if I received a fake brush. I haven&#x27;t heard about fake Sigma brushes being made because they&#x27;re not a massively expensive brush line like MAC, but when I touched the bristles I just had to wonder. They&#x27;re synthetic of course but they feel very cheap and it was kind of concerning.&lt;br /&gt;In the end though the brush is soft and it doesn&#x27;t poke or itch your eyelid when you use it to draw on your skin or put color on the lower lash line. I definitely recommend it but if you have the money just go for the MAC pencil brush instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this brush for years and I&#x27;m so happy I finally have it. So great for applying crease color and under the lash line.</li>
            <li> I really loved this brush!! It shedded at first but after I washed it, it stopped. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have purchased every brush set under the sun, yet I was still missing something...a good pencil brush!  The E30 is great to work in color in the outer V area, but I use it mainly to buff out my shadow in the lower lash line area.  After I got this brush, I no longer had the chronic beauty disease of the panda eye.  This brush is serious biz; get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!! They are soft and apply the product amazingly, they are super soft and I cannot wait to buy more!!!</li>
            <li> I was going to order the travel kit from the Sigma website, but did not want all the brushes in the set.  When I saw they had them on Amazon individually, I decided to get just the ones I wanted.  I&#x27;m so glad I did! They are as great as everyone says and I love this particular brush for building up my corner crease eyeshadow on my lids. I got 3 brushes I wanted for way cheaper than buying the set that had brushes I didn&#x27;t want and not all the brushes I wanted.  If that makes sense.  Anyway I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Use this brush for a variety of uses, but mostly for deepening the shadow color in the crease.  It works for corrector, concealer, many other things also.</li>
            <li> with this Sigma Pencil - E30 can this be also use as an smokey eye look and also can this be clean if so how can it be cleaned cause this Sigma Pencil - E30 iam intrested in this also looked up into the rates on amamzon and looked it up on youtube.com</li>
            <li> I needed good blending brushes but I canâ€™t afford a 25-35$ for a mac brush. So I asked around and seen that sigma are as good as mac but cheaper so I got the E35,E25 E30 E55 E45 and the E40. They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean. Shipping was fast and I really like them. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5, when I washed them some of the hair came out. It was the first time I cleaned them.  I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s normal or not. I havenâ€™t tried cleaning them again Iâ€™m scared.</li>
            <li> The handle to this brush is longer than I expected. From brush tip to end of the handle is a little over 7 inches, and I hadn&#x27;t thought about what this would mean. I&#x27;m nearsighted and need to be closer to my mirror than 7 inches in order to use this as precisely as I&#x27;d intended (for using eyeshadow as eyeliner). If the handle were wood, I&#x27;d have my husband cut it shorter, but it&#x27;s a very hard plastic and I&#x27;m leery of trying to cut it down. However, I am getting use out of it for filling in eyebrows with a little eyeshadow. It&#x27;s much easier to see the shape of an eyebrow from further away than the edge of an eyelid.</li>
            <li> I just got this brush in the mail.  Very fast processing and is a very nice compact brush and very percise tip</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I always see YouTube videos of people singing the praises of Sigma brushes and swore I would buy one one day. So I did! And am so glad. I use this brush mainly for color in my tear ducts and lower lash line and I get great color payoff. I plan on getting an entire collection eventually.</li>
            <li> Hello! I love the makeup and Sigma brushes because they are very soft and leaves a great finish.&lt;br /&gt;They are comfortable and the customer will never feel scratches with Sigma.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are awesome!  I&#x27;ll never by MAC ones again!</li>
            <li> Love, love this brush!</li>
            <li> The packaging was off the charts! So excited!</li>
            <li> Sigma is an excellent product  that lasts forever.  No smells, shedding or discoloration.  The only drawback is getting the product out during cleaning the brush.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because I saw on a blog. I like it that it nice and dense. Would definitely order Sigma products again!</li>
            <li> Great for creases, the outer V and under the eye. Soft bristles that are pointed and hold together well. Great value and great buy.</li>
            <li> This is such a great brush. It makes applying eyeshadow in an specific area a breeze and really makes blending the shadows under the eye area easier than ever! I&#x27;m so happy I finally purchased this brush. I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without it!</li>
            <li> I love this Sigma pencil - really great for detailed work on your upper lids.  I am going to purchase more Sigma pencils, they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of makeup tutorials on YouTube and I kept hearing about Sigma brand brushes. A lot of the make artists that I liked were using them, amongst a bunch of others, so I thought I&#x27;d give a few a try. I just had a very basic brush set from Eco Tools that I got at Walmart but wanted a few more specific for eyes. So, it does the job but its not a favorite by far and I&#x27;ve gone back to my trusty Eco Tools and Real Techniques brushes which I think are wonderful. I&#x27;ve had this particular Sigma brush, I bought 3 total, for less than a week and I&#x27;ve already had a significant amount of bristles fall out and I&#x27;ve washed them twice. Although it feels soft there is a definite &amp;#34;pointy-ness&amp;#34; to some of the bristles which can prick a little on the eyelid socket.&lt;br /&gt;So overall, not bad but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again,don&#x27;t think the extra $$ for a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; is worth it for me.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush wasn&#x27;t as sturdy as I thought, but it definitely gets the job done. Easy to apply makeup and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> sigma brushes are top quality, you never ever know how you lived with any other brush and they are such a deal especially compared to other high end companies, i own many sigma brushes and i have never hated one.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN OK BRUSH, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SOFTER SEEING AS TO HOW ITS MOSTLY USED ON YOUR LOWER LASH LINE I THINK ITS KINDA SCRATCHY.</li>
            <li> This is a great pencil brush! It is a little stiff however and I&#x27;ve used it and washed it multiple times. If you are looking for a softer pencil brush, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I got this brush, and I love it. Not bad for the price at all. Its soft, and the handle is easy for me to hold on too since I have long fingers. It was a great price for such a wonderful brush.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about buying these brushes online, not sure if I would get a knock off product instead but I am pleased that it wasn&#x27;t. My friend has these Sigma brushes, and I love the texture and feel of the brush that I had to get my own, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!I received my sigma pencil-E30 brush the other day, and I love how easily it smudges and blends my eye makeup. The perfect size!</li>
            <li> First, let me give a nod at the seller.  I ordered many things on Tuesday, just past 1:00PM.  Within an hour, I was notified that my Sigma pencil brush had shipped.  I was surprised then, but I was even more surprised this morning!  While my expected date to get my brush was next Monday at the earliest, I received it this morning!  That was less than 48 hours!  Now I definitely don&#x27;t mind paying the seven dollars in shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened my package, I was surprised to see more things than I expected!  There was two sheets of postcard-sized paper and a trifold, along with a stiff container.  The first piece of paper informed me of how to first clean, spot clean, and deep clean my brushes.  Though I was already aware, this was a nice sentiment.  The next paper informed me of how to receive a complimentary gift (an unexpected delight!).  The trifold was a small manual on their Essential Kit of 12 brushes (I&#x27;m looking at this for my next buy!), including pictures and short descriptions.  Then came my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who frequently does other people&#x27;s makeup, I don&#x27;t mind investing in my brushes.  Therefore, I&#x27;ve usually stuck to M.A.C. brushes and sometimes Arbonne.  However, I have heard great things about Sigma through YouTube and different blogs, so I decided to give them a try since I was in desperate need of a pencil brush.  I had my doubts, I assure you.  Anything that cheaper than M.A.C. couldn&#x27;t be the same quality, I thought.  WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is dense and stiff enough to brush color on your bottom lash line with accuracy while flexible enough to blend, has a tapered tip great for smudging eyeliner, and it could also be AMAZING for a cut crease or a defined outer v.  The bristles were slightly rough, but did not shed when I washed it the first time and the bristles were noticeably softer after washing.  After letting it sufficiently dry, I went ahead and did my makeup for my graduation later... It&#x27;s perfect!  It picked up enough of the eyeshadow I was using, it blended well, it smudged well... Any doubts I had about Sigma have completely disappeared.  They are not only on par with M.A.C., they are above them with an amazing price for the great quality and the wonderful service!ough of the eyeshadow I was using, it blended well, it smudged well... Any doubts I had about Sigma have completely disappeared.  They are not only on par with M.A.C., they are above them with an amazing price for the great quality and the wonderful service!</li>
            <li> I love this small pencil brush for applying my eye shadow in the outer corner of my eye. I have hooded eyes and this make application easier on my lid. I would recommend this to friends and family. This is also a made well brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush very much! It works great to angle in your inner and outer corner and in your crease. I can&#x27;t say anything negative about this brush as its nicely pointed and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous Sigma brushes since my first purchase several years ago. In fact, since that initial purchase Sigma is my favorite  brand.  They are consistently well made, last for years even with daily cleanings and will not break the bank to purchase! The range of available shapes/functions is huge and so far the ones I use (foundation, eye &amp; powder) do their job perfectly. If you have never tried a Sigma, do so I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily to smudge out my bottom lash line for that smoked out look. Great brush! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this for the outer v crease of my eyes and I like it a lot!!!</li>
            <li> excellent item! The hair feels so soft and it can be easily cleaned love this so much</li>
            <li> Fabulous brush that is perfect for adding shadow to the bottom lash line. Love it and am excited to buy more sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> Great brush perfect for blending in small areas of the eyes like outer corner , sculpting out your crease , smudging eyeshadow underneath your eyes and even for smudging or blending out eyeliner to give you more of a softened blended look. I&#x27;m a mua so I&#x27;m always packed with makeup brushes for myself and my clients and so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. This brush is not my go to brush for everyday simple looks but when I&#x27;m doing more detailed work with the eyes I defiantly use it.</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday and I love it. It puts the color exactly where you want it and can be used for multiple purposes.  I love sigma and have added to my collection since receiving this brush. Get one for the perfect application of your shadow to the crease or bottom lash line.</li>
            <li> I just received one of these E30 pencil brushes and was very excited to try it out.  It came in a plain plastic sheath, I removed it and felt the bristles wanting to feel the softness these reviews mention, but ouch!  Instead I felt a pokey, stiff bristle!  I touched it again trying feeling what the stiffness was and apparently some the of bristle seemed to be stuck together as if glued, making the bristle hard and stiff!  My guess is that I received a defective one, so I returned it immediately.  So sad because I wanted to take it on a trip that I will be leaving on shortly so will have to make a quick purchase of a pencil brush at a store.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of Sigma eye and face brushes. I love all of them except for this one. I usually have an issue with them being too rough and irritating, but this one is actually too soft. It doesn&#x27;t deposit enough shadow onto my eye. I feel like the bristles need to be a tad shorter. I don&#x27;t grab for this very often. If I do, I use it to blend after I use a different brush to apply the color. But that&#x27;s more time consuming and I really shouldn&#x27;t have to do that when I paid this much for an eye brush. I usually reach for my MAC pencil brush instead and plan on purchasing another one, even though it costs ten bucks more than the Sigma brush. Another decent cheap pencil brush that I like okay enough is the Sedona Lace pencil brush. That one is synthetic though and I don&#x27;t prefer those for blending. I&#x27;m tempted to try the Bdellium pencil brush. Their blending brushes are very nice too.    Update: 2/22/15 - I did get the Bdellium brush after all. It&#x27;s closer to the MAC pencil brush in my opinion. It is not as soft as the Sigma, but performs better and more closely to the MAC. I&#x27;ll probably get a few more.</li>
            <li> Really Recommend this brush .. the bristles are very soft&lt;br /&gt;everyone should have a pencil brush to get a perfect eye look</li>
            <li> Just got my brush and let me tell you next.&lt;br /&gt;First, about the seller. I&#x27;ve ordered from Sigma beauty and they did an awesome job: even so I ordered only one brush, they sent it to me in a hard carton box, and the brush itself was in another, signature, box (for me it is really neat because other sellers would put such small items just in regular envelop). Plus, very fast shippment/delivery: just 4 days and my brush is here.&lt;br /&gt;Second, as to brush it self: it is really a good quolity brush, with natural soft, not rough at all, bristles. I have used it onec (if a brush is good it is enough time to see it) and my verdict is: it is not as stiff and pointed as MAC one, and I really like it (that was the main reason why I ordered it). This difference makes it more usfull. This brush is more flexible and does a great job applying/blending shadows in my creas and outer v-area. It is perfect for it. Like it very much. Definitely, would recommend this brush to anybode.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing brush, it&#x27;s really soft and precise, i just really really love it, 100% recomended!! and i love sigma so..</li>
            <li> Good for corners of eyes very well blends great and has a good quality. This will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Sigma is a trusted brand name in makeup &amp; quality is definitely what u get with this line. Stands up to cleaning, doesn&#x27;t shed excessively and isn&#x27;t overly harsh on the skin. From amateurs to pro mua could make use of this brush</li>
            <li> shipping was quick and no problems. The brush is of good quality and soft under the eyes to smudge out makeup. I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> very delicate bristles with perfect texture and density.  Im so glad I have this brush.  It will change your lower lid game. Also arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> I love the sigma E30 pencil,it works wonderfully for me,it&#x27;s everything i thought it would be and more.Its really Lovely</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with sigma brushes, a must have for a makeup artist, or even those who just love makeup.</li>
            <li> This brush is so perfect for tiny details around your eyes. It has become one of my favorites and I am considering purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this brush. It is a good shape for crease and outer corner detailing. However, mine is shedding and this makes it unusable. I would advise you keep your packaging in case you need to return yours. While I didn&#x27;t spend more than 25 dollars on a brush, I do expect it to not shed fibers everywhere. That&#x27;s definitely not something I need near my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really expected this to be softer. It&#x27;s actually a bit hard at the tip and not as precise as I expected it for a precise shadow application, especially when you want a smoky wing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this brush! Since my crease is a bit smaller, this would be useful to pack color and deepen the outer v</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this pencil brush. I use this to smoke out the outer corners of my eyes. I also use this to apply shadow on my bottom lash line. It&#x27;s perfect because it&#x27;s small and precise. It&#x27;s also a great crease brush. Love this brush!</li>
            <li> This pencil is great for smudging liner and adding color to the lower lash line.</li>
            <li> I just got this brush in the mail yesterday and I am so in love with it. Works so well! Sigma brushes are great!</li>
            <li> I love this Sigma pencil brush. It&#x27;s great for applying shadow to the inner corner of the eye as well as on the bottom lid!</li>
            <li> This brush is very percise and the best eyeliner brush i have ever use. I bought 2 more after the original order just to have in inventory. The lines formed are completely straight and I don&#x27;t have the steadiest hand. I recommend this brush, you will not be sorry</li>
