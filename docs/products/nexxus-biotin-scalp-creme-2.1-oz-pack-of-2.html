            <li>I have been using this product for a little over a year now &amp; it is simply great!</li>
            <li>The pills were a special 2 for 1 which gives me a 4 month supply for $30.00.  </li>
            <li>I have 3 older brothers who have either lost most of their hair or have noticable bald spots.  </li>
            <li>I am not spending any more money that normal.  </li>
            <li>Not much by way of smell, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will certainly reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li>My hair seems much more full and I even had a comment from the hair dresser on how nice and thick it is.  </li>
            <li>I could do without the mint smell, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming, especially when your hair dries.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help you grow more hair, but it has helped immensely with hair falling out.</li>
            <li>but you really can feel your hair growing!</li>
            <li>I found the much more expensive product from Kerastase to be superior</li>
            <li>Its working pretty good but makes the hair feel thick</li>
            <li>If I use too much, it does feel like there is a minor amount of product in your hair, but more often than not it is not noticeable and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Did nothing for hair positively and only dried out hair more and gave me more tangles.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>&amp; it doesn&#x27;t take much product for one use.</li>
            <li>Really works on the hair edges and will help hair grow.</li>
            <li>I do take the HH550 hair supplement from Whole Body Research.  </li>
            <li>I use a dime size and rub it in the usual itchy places i get from wearing a wig, also great for during the day itches starting....</li>
            <li>About every third day I switch to the Nizoral anti-dandruff shampoo to clean the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Tried and true I&#x27;ve used this over ten years now</li>
            <li>Definitely increases thickness &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; when used, but cannot confirm any true hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I love utilizing professional salon type products versus store bought hair care products, I love to try new innovative products on my hair especiaally for thining hair as I have in my more mature years; but it will be a rather cold day in you know where before I spend the money I spent on two tiny sample size tubes of scalp conditioner that is to revitalize my scalp and regrow my hair.</li>
            <li>You just need to apply a little amount each use---but make sure that you massage it into the scalp</li>
            <li>but it is too early to really say what its end result will be.  </li>
            <li>which I believe to be normal.  </li>
            <li>I am 48 years old.  </li>
            <li>but I strongly agree that with a daily routine and proper diet with excercsie that the time between having a head of thick full hair and thinning hair can definitely be delayed.</li>
            <li>I have dealt with this for my whole entire life and now as a young adult I would finally like to find a solution that will help me with this problem.  </li>
            <li>it is cheap, but i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just a placebo effect or not.  </li>
            <li>really wanted a product for dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>When I began using the product I had just cut my hair very short (fade length) to begin my natural process.</li>
            <li>I am a young African American female with no issues at all with my hair, just looking to grow it longer &amp; thicker.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Tried and true I&#x27;ve used this over ten years now and it&#x27;s always worked in my thinning areas love it</li>
            <li> very happy with the product and the service</li>
            <li> Really works. I use this with the Bortin pills.</li>
            <li> Great stuff all honesty its really working.About an year ago I got clorox bleach in my hair and it thinned the front part of my hair badly out of desperation I needed something that would work! with the combination of the derma roller and Nexxus Biotin Scalp Creme I&#x27;m seeing results gradually and I have been using it for about two weeks and my hair is most defiantly thickening ! Its an slow process but its working !</li>
            <li> I like this creme better than Vigorol temple and scalp! I use a dime size and rub it in the usual itchy places i get from wearing a wig, also great for during the day itches starting....just rub some in and the touch of menthol in the product stops the itch immediately! I have no opinion on the re-growth factor my hair is so gone there&#x27;s no coming back. But i do know biotin is the #1 supplement you want when wanting to re-grow your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for three months now (still on my first 2.1 oz bottle, and I use a small amount- about a pea size- every day). I think it&#x27;s great. I could do without the mint smell, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming, especially when your hair dries. It doesn&#x27;t help you grow more hair, but it has helped immensely with hair falling out. If I use too much, it does feel like there is a minor amount of product in your hair, but more often than not it is not noticeable and is very lightweight. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair conditioner/treatment for thinning hair that I have ever used. It leaves my hair fuller, healthier, without be weighted down. The biotin in the conditioner is the best thing for your hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased for application over scalp in thinning areas.  I should have known this would not help; taking oral biotin helps but not topical.  Will likely not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for three years. It&#x27;s the the only one that actually stops hair from falling. I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different products. None of them worked like this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year now &amp; it is simply great! I am a young African American female with no issues at all with my hair, just looking to grow it longer &amp; thicker. When I began using the product I had just cut my hair very short (fade length) to begin my natural process. One year later I am about 1 inch past my shoulders. I am a cosmetology school grad &amp; I have tried it ALL! This is the best! Only dislikes would be the itchy scalp &amp; the fact that I gives me a very very slight headache. Nothing to complain about but you really can feel your hair growing! &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take much product for one use.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money whatsoever!  Did nothing for hair positively and only dried out hair more and gave me more tangles.</li>
            <li> Love the cooling feeling I get when I put this in my hair. I use it after I shampoo my hair with nexus biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product makes my thinning hair feel and look fuller.  I like the smell, which does not last long after it is applied.  Easy to use and is effective for me.</li>
            <li> Really works on the hair edges and will help hair grow. This products last a long time and look forward to pucrhasing it again</li>
            <li> My hair is growing back. I saw new hair growth in three weeks , GREAT product !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I continue to use it b/c it is cheap, but i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just a placebo effect or not.  Definitely increases thickness &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; when used, but cannot confirm any true hair growth.  It may well be stemming the thinning effect, but no regrowth</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time. It seems to be working very good!</li>
            <li> It makes the texture of my fine hair more manageable and healthier.  I use this on my damp hair everyday.</li>
            <li> After a little over a year of use, this (paired with the Nexxus shampoo) has improved my thinning hair - by which I mean, slowed it down. This leave-in creme will give you a look like you have hair gel in, which can be remedied with a little ruffling after it dries. Not much by way of smell, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This is Good but can be flaky&lt;br /&gt;this product make my hair thicker not longer</li>
            <li> still trying to make up my mind about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted a product for dry scalp.  the smell is a little&lt;br /&gt;overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I did a combination with the Biotin Capsules and this Shampoo. My hair loss is gone now.</li>
            <li> been using for a very long time.  prices fluctuates  will continue to use.</li>
            <li> waiting to see results, still using it.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair starting to thin and fall out all of a sudden about 2 months ago. I am 48 years old.  I have 3 older brothers who have either lost most of their hair or have noticable bald spots.  Call it vein if you wish but I decided to be proactive because considering the square shape of my head I would not make a very good looking bald guy.  After many hours of research I came up with my own regimen which includes The Nexxus VitaTress Shampoo, Organix Biotin/Collagen conditioner and the Biotin Scalp cream.  About every third day I switch to the Nizoral anti-dandruff shampoo to clean the scalp.  I do take the HH550 hair supplement from Whole Body Research.  Recommended dose is 2 per day but I only take 1 in the morning. After only a couple of weeks I noticed a definite improvement.  There are only a few occasional hairs that fall out which I believe to be normal.  My hair seems much more full and I even had a comment from the hair dresser on how nice and thick it is.  In all because I purchased these products on Amazon I am not spending any more money that normal.  The 32 ounce bottle of  shampoo has been in my shower for 4 months now and it was only $22.50. Im guessing I can still get another month out of it. Scalp cream is $20.00 for a 2-pack  which will  last about 5 months. Organix products can be purchased in any store for about 6 bucks and Nizoral Shampoo is $18.00. The pills were a special 2 for 1 which gives me a 4 month supply for $30.00.  I understand that there is currently no cure for baldness and it is inevitable because of my genes that I will someday be bald but I strongly agree that with a daily routine and proper diet with excercsie that the time between having a head of thick full hair and thinning hair can definitely be delayed. For me it is at a small cost of about $0.77 each day.</li>
            <li> I have lost about 1/3 of my hair due to anemia.  The result is that one&#x27;s scalp is sore (hairs that fall out leave tiny holes in one&#x27;s scalp).  I found the much more expensive product from Kerastase to be superior (but it&#x27;s very expensive).</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for those who are beginning to have thinning hair or may want to go one step further in attempting to prevent thinning hair.  I use this product in conjunction with the shampoo---Nexxus Biotin.  These make a very good combination and, after using both for about a month or so, I have seen that my hair appears to be fuller where this product is applied.  You just need to apply a little amount each use---but make sure that you massage it into the scalp well.  I highly recommend this product and will certainly reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li> Helped my nails to grow longer and chip less.  Also helped my hair to grow thicker.  Helps with itching as well.</li>
            <li> Feel real good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> In actuality, two tiny sample size tubes of scalp conditioner for the price paid is not worth it. I love utilizing professional salon type products versus store bought hair care products, I love to try new innovative products on my hair especiaally for thining hair as I have in my more mature years; but it will be a rather cold day in you know where before I spend the money I spent on two tiny sample size tubes of scalp conditioner that is to revitalize my scalp and regrow my hair. Of course they claim you have to keep buying and using the product in order for it to work. I will not be utilizing this product again.</li>
            <li> I have a hereditary condition of no hair on my edges.  I have dealt with this for my whole entire life and now as a young adult I would finally like to find a solution that will help me with this problem.  I have seen some growth in the areas but it is too early to really say what its end result will be.  I am using this product along with take biotin so I hope to be able to post photos of my progress at some point!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several years, and it has helped my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Its working pretty good but makes the hair feel thick so I only use once a day ..... The pills was the best but got discontinue</li>
            <li> Makes your hair look thicker but have not seen any regrowth which is what I am looking for.  Very good solution, easy to apply for a quick fix.</li>
