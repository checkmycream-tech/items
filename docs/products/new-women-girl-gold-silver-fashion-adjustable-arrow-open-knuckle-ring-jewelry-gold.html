            <li>Super cute, gentle when stretching to fit so it does not break.</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t comment about durability, because my 12 y/o wore it for thr first time yesterday, but it looks very cute, not cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Beautiful but poor quality.  </li>
            <li>I not only highly recommend it, I plan to buy a couple more.</li>
            <li>good for price.. very small wish was thicker and broad but fits fine on my fingers.</li>

            <li>Cute, delicate ring.</li>
            <li>is a little large on me but nothing major</li>
            <li>The tip of the arrow leaves a small indent on the finger but still worth the buy.</li>

            <li> is a little large on me but nothing major</li>
            <li> The tip of the arrow leaves a small indent on the finger but still worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I was super bummed it broke four hours late when I bumped it on a table.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and small, which is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to adjust it, but from what other reviews say, adjusting it can be problematic.</li>
            <li> so now I am very careful with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it a few times and it is still shiny, the color hasn&#x27;t worn off, and there are no signs of green left on my finger.</li>
            <li> but the metal turned black after 24 hours of wearing it.</li>
            <li> After that the heat from my finger made it split in half.</li>
            <li> The ring didn&#x27;t make my skin turn black or green</li>
            <li> I can see that when I bent it, it already cracked a little</li>
            <li> Turns my finger green and the paint came off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to wear it for longer than half an hour!</li>
            <li> Too bad it broke the first day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t turned my finger green yet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather small</li>
            <li> I just put the ring on my finger ,that broken to half.i</li>
            <li> It was poorly shaped.</li>
            <li> Just really bad quality, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a Christmas gift for my daughter as I am one of those annoying people that Christmas shop all year.</li>
