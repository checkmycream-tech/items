    <ol>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Excellent set!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best trimmers in the market for the price.</li>
            <li>Everything was perfect</li>
            <li>I get the best shave from Proglide razors but have a terrbile time getting them unclogged</li>
            <li>Very good, comes with all the products in picture and in description.</li>
            <li>This product is great, trims ALL the hairs</li>
            <li>This is a great tool.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise a great product</li>
            <li>Great piece of equipment to help with my shave.</li>
            <li>Yes, you get a good shaver since that is what you paid for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to be able to use a trimmer while you&#x27;re in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Love this product gives me a nice trim every time.</li>
            <li>I love that it is water proof</li>
            <li>They should have made this stress point more robust.</li>
            <li>Was the perfect gift for a 15 year old new to shaving.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for use as a beard and moustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li>better suited for white males...</li>
            <li>I use constantly and are always pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>It is a great little device for that purpose because of the attachments for different length hair.  </li>
            <li>But its a working product that for the price you cannot really complain.</li>
            <li>It makes my morning routine so much easier.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Turns out the Blade arm for the Styler is made of cheap plastic and is very thin and cracks very easily.</li>
            <li>I originally rated this a 5 star because it seemed like an amazing design, but after using it for a short while it turns out that it may be poorly designed.</li>
            <li>My only grip is the location of the power button and the general ease of the attachments.</li>

            <li> Works great! Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever had.  It&#x27;s so nice to be able to use a trimmer while you&#x27;re in the shower.  Not convenience.  Shaves well but wish the blades weren&#x27;t so expensive.  Comes with three different size guards for the clippers and 1 razor.</li>
            <li> This product is great, trims ALL the hairs and I do mean ALL. Talk about not getting clipped or pinched in the delicates! My only grip is the location of the power button and the general ease of the attachments. But its a working product that for the price you cannot really complain.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool.  I love that it is water proof so i can use it in the shower.  It makes my morning routine so much easier.</li>

            <li> Excellent set! I use constantly and are always pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers in the market for the price. Of course the gillette shaving kit has no parallel either</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect</li>
            <li> Very good, comes with all the products in picture and in description.</li>

            <li> I bought this primarily for use as a beard and moustache trimmer.  It is a great little device for that purpose because of the attachments for different length hair.  It&#x27;s a bonus that it also has a shaving attachment.  It fulfils all of my grooming needs and I highly recommend it.  It loses one star since it can be somewhat difficult to change the attachments.  Sometimes I am afraid that I am going to break it when doing so.  Otherwise a great product</li>
            <li> Great piece of equipment to help with my shave.</li>

            <li> I originally rated this a 5 star because it seemed like an amazing design, but after using it for a short while it turns out that it may be poorly designed. I get the best shave from Proglide razors but have a terrbile time getting them unclogged so I am always tapping the razor on the sink to try to get the blade unclogged after every stroke. Turns out the Blade arm for the Styler is made of cheap plastic and is very thin and cracks very easily. They should have made this stress point more robust.</li>
