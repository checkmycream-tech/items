    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Its a perfect replacement for Lipoflavinoid.</li>
            <li>But I believe it&#x27;s every bit as good as the Lipoflavonoid.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is a bit cheaper, but I honestly think it helped more than the OTC Lipoflavonoid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more soon.</li>
            <li>I was told to take Bee Pollen with it, and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Product is considerably cheaper and just as effective.</li>
            <li>My ear doctor first recommended Lipoflavonoid, which helped tremendously</li>
            <li>I am glad I found the Rising company and its generic brands</li>
            <li>Then I went off of it, and felt the higher noise level returning.</li>
            <li>A whole lot cheaper than Ribo-Flavinoid Plus.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>(I have a high pitched whine).  </li>
            <li>It contains normal vitamins along with choline, bioflavonoids, and inositol to promote blood flow to the nerves in the ears.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as cheaper products!</li>
            <li>I noticed all of a sudden my ringing in the ear got elevated to a new high.</li>
            <li>I know the main ingredients are the same.  </li>
            <li>This product did not completely clear the ringing in the ears but now that I am off of it they are really screaming.  </li>
            <li>So far cannot see any difference in the generic version vs the name brand ...</li>
            <li>but I ran out, couldn&#x27;t find more, and the ringing came back even worse.  </li>
            <li>Risanoid is a good generic product over lipoflavonoid which is very expensive</li>

            <li> Also, the pills are much larger and harder to swallow.</li>

            <li> This is a safe, effective, and less expensive product that helps relieve the annoying, and sometimes painful, ringing in the ears, tinnitis.  </li>

            <li> the only negative things about this company is how slow it takes to get the product</li>

            <li> Not nearly as good as Lipo Flavinoid.</li>
            <li> but it was quite expensive (over $25 a bottle).  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Last year my husband had seen several doctors for tinnitus. After doing everything the doctors suggested, he still had no relief until someone told him about this product. Within a week of taking this product daily, all symptoms have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as cheaper products!</li>
            <li> Risanoid is a good generic product over lipoflavonoid which is very expensive I am glad I found the Rising company and its generic brands the only negative things about this company is how slow it takes to get the product</li>
            <li> It is a bit cheaper, but I honestly think it helped more than the OTC Lipoflavonoid.  I felt like my ringing was a little quieter.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything to eradicate or even reduce ringing in the ears, which was the sole reason for buying it.</li>
            <li> Does definitely work like Lipo-Flavonoid Plus, however the tinnitus seems to come back louder after ceasing use than it does with Lipo-Flavonoid Plus.  Also, the pills are much larger and harder to swallow.</li>
            <li> did not help the ringing in the ears at all.</li>
            <li> This is a safe, effective, and less expensive product that helps relieve the annoying, and sometimes painful, ringing in the ears, tinnitis.  My ear doctor first recommended Lipoflavonoid, which helped tremendously but I ran out, couldn&#x27;t find more, and the ringing came back even worse.  Years passed and I found it again but it was quite expensive (over $25 a bottle).  So I tried this version.  I can definitely notice a difference!  But I believe it&#x27;s every bit as good as the Lipoflavonoid.  I know the main ingredients are the same.  It contains normal vitamins along with choline, bioflavonoids, and inositol to promote blood flow to the nerves in the ears.  Other ingredients are cellulose (plant origin), crocarmollose, silica, cellulose coating, hydoxypropyl methylcellulose, titanium dioxide color, vegetable stearic acid, vegatable magnesium stearate, vanillin, and mannitol.  It does not contain any yeast, wheat, milk or milk derivatives, lactose, sugar, preservatives, or soy.  The bottle contains 100 tablets and directions are for 3 to be taken a day.  I&#x27;ll be getting more soon.</li>
            <li> Worked for me.  I guess everyone is different. I noticed all of a sudden my ringing in the ear got elevated to a new high. I tried the Brand name (a little more expensive) as directed on the bottle. I have to say, shortly, it did bring down that elevated noise level for me back to where it was at a tolerable level. Then I went off of it, and felt the higher noise level returning. So, I tried  and ordered this generic brand. I actually achieved the same reduction in noise with these as well.  I was told to take Bee Pollen with it, and so far, so good. I will buy these and the others again...Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do a thing after three months use.</li>
            <li> It may work for some. However, after four weeks I could not discern any appreciable improvement to the ringing symtoms in&lt;br /&gt;my ears.</li>
            <li> Its a perfect replacement for Lipoflavinoid. It relieves the symptoms of Maniers. Product is considerably cheaper and just as effective.</li>
            <li> A whole lot cheaper than Ribo-Flavinoid Plus. Saves me a lot of money........wife has tinnitis (ringing in the ears) Thanks</li>
            <li> This product did not completely clear the ringing in the ears but now that I am off of it they are really screaming.  Probably will reorder.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as Lipo Flavinoid. won&#x27;t be getting this again after I finish this bottle</li>
            <li> So far cannot see any difference in the generic version vs the name brand ... I appreciate the cost savings</li>
            <li> Took the entire bottle as directed.  No change what-so-ever (I have a high pitched whine).  Hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but didn&#x27;t help my tintinitus</li>
            <li> Not effective for me.</li>
