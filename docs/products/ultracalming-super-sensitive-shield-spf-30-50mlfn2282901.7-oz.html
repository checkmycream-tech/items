            <li>Feels great, not greasy on the face and wears well under make up.  </li>
            <li>Because this is Dermalogica, it is a very nice product.</li>
            <li>Made with great ingredients from a very reputable skin care company.  </li>
            <li>Good sun screen for my skin.</li>
            <li>Received item in good condition.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel good too.</li>
            <li>What good is it if it expires?</li>
            <li>I have used every kind of won&#x27;t clog, fragrance free, hypoallergenic and still irritated my face!!!</li>
            <li>Most of the products are great.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice, and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li>Works great and came quick.</li>
            <li>I started to use dermalogica ultra sensitive face wash and this sunscreen and my complexion has improved greatly!</li>
            <li>This works great for my son with sensitive skin and a much better price than the salon!</li>
            <li>It stays on top of the skin but is invisible.</li>
            <li>I love Dermalogica...</li>
            <li>Love this serum.</li>
            <li>that does not irritate my skin (and I have tried many over the years).</li>
            <li>The top of the bottle came off and exploded all over me and the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>If your skin is dry, oily, or in-between, it is an excellent product to even things out.</li>
            <li>Great product, does irritate for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The texture is light and easy to spread out evenly on your face and neck, and does not turn your face into a frying pan (think a greasy oil pot) toward the end of the day on the beach.</li>
            <li>works great keeps the redness from coming through my makeup and helps hydrate my skin all day long</li>
            <li>Dermalogica Super Sensitive Sunscreen works great on my very fair and very sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s protection (active ingredients) comes from zinc oxide and Titanium dioxide, so it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;a non-chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because only time will tell whether the sunscreen is doing a good job of protection.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin, often get breakouts with many products.</li>
            <li>Dermalogica is the first product (ever!)</li>
            <li>But the SPF is only 30, and I get better sun blocking results from the much cheaper - and stronger - Neutrogena ultra sheer, which is equally nice to my skin.</li>
            <li>Topical Sun Screen is so much better for your skin because it does not sink into the skin and then dissipate throughout your body.  </li>
            <li>My most necessary item!!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that I can purchase the larger sizers through Amazon</li>
            <li>Non geasy lasts long time no awful fragrance!</li>
            <li>Blends in very well on the skin, does not leave a sticky film residue.</li>
            <li>Which is much safer than chemical based sunsreens.  </li>
            <li>Product goes a long way, don&#x27;t need higher SPF, well WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li>This particular sunscreen works really well .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It could be a little creamier so that it might spread more evenly.  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>This product left my skin feeling very greasy and didn&#x27;t work very well at preventing sun damage.</li>
            <li>I know it is to keep people with very sensitive skin from burning.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin a bit white at first, but it fades.</li>
            <li>I wear it as the first layer below my makeup , but it is so light that it won&#x27;t give you any feeling of wearing something too thick on your face.</li>
            <li>The old formula has lavender, to which I am allergic.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and always develop some rash on my face after a couple of days of using a sun screen product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>It is completely odorless which i prefer.</li>
            <li>It seems to be good for my skin type, but I did not care for the &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34; which made me look rather ill.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is not too thick, not too thin, just perfect.</li>
            <li>I get regular facials and this product comes highly precommended from proessionals.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin &amp; break out with any other sunscreen on my face.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> works great keeps the redness from coming through my makeup and helps hydrate my skin all day long</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Feb 2015 and found out the expiry date is Mar 2015! Never buy from this store again!!!</li>
            <li> Works great and came quick.</li>
            <li> Good sun screen for my skin.</li>
            <li> Received item in good condition. Will be using it when hiking on sunny days in Missouri.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day.  I mix it with Dermalogica Active Moist.  It saves my skin from the dry and sun damaging elements in Colorado.</li>
            <li> It seems to be good for my skin type, but I did not care for the &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34; which made me look rather ill.  I know it is to keep people with very sensitive skin from burning.  It could be a little creamier so that it might spread more evenly.  I&#x27;ll probably purchase it, again, though.</li>
            <li> Topical Sun Screen is so much better for your skin because it does not sink into the skin and then dissipate throughout your body.  It stays on top of the skin but is invisible.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica... leaves face moisturized and spf covered but not greasy. Most of the products are great.  I&#x27;ve been using this line for years</li>
            <li> I get regular facials and this product comes highly precommended from proessionals. It smooths out the skin (which is great for someone with imperfect skin) and also has sunscreen in it. If your skin is dry, oily, or in-between, it is an excellent product to even things out. It makes you feel good too.</li>
            <li> I have never found a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t break out my face - until now. This stuff is amazing... was in the sun all day and had no burn and NO BREAKOUTS!  This lotion is not too thick, not too thin, just perfect. I will definitely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I started to use dermalogica ultra sensitive face wash and this sunscreen and my complexion has improved greatly! And this was WAY cheaper than buying the same oz at the local business that sells the brand.</li>
            <li> My most necessary item!! Love this serum. I cannot live without it. Highly recommend this product. Love the fact that I can purchase the larger sizers through Amazon</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin! It seems like every sunblock that I used, causes my face to turn red. It was like if i use sunblock, my face is red and if i don&#x27;t my face is burnt!! I have used every kind of won&#x27;t clog, fragrance free, hypoallergenic and still irritated my face!!! This product is the ONLY ONE that didn&#x27;t burn my face or leave it red. Product goes a long way, don&#x27;t need higher SPF, well WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I am allergic to various skin products and have even gotten blisters as a reaction to some lipglosses, face washes and sunscreen. I did not have a reaction to this product. It leaves your skin a bit white at first, but it fades. It is also very viscous so don&#x27;t squeeze too hard. A few big drops will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I usually use the Ultracalming Line of  Dermalogica products and wanted a moisturizer with sunscreen, as I don&#x27;t wear foundation. This product left my skin feeling very greasy and didn&#x27;t work very well at preventing sun damage. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Non geasy lasts long time no awful fragrance! I use it daily!</li>
            <li> The bottle that arrived was a prior formula of this product. The site lists the newest formula. The old formula has lavender, to which I am allergic. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Great product, does irritate for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and always develop some rash on my face after a couple of days of using a sun screen product. Dermalogica is the first product (ever!) that does not irritate my skin (and I have tried many over the years). The texture is light and easy to spread out evenly on your face and neck, and does not turn your face into a frying pan (think a greasy oil pot) toward the end of the day on the beach. It is not cheap, but does what it&#x27;s supposed to--very well.</li>
            <li> my daughter has a difficult time finding sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate her face.  This one works great</li>
            <li> Great sun screen and moisturizer in one</li>
            <li> This works great for my son with sensitive skin and a much better price than the salon!</li>
            <li> The top of the bottle came off and exploded all over me and the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Hubby even loves it!  It&#x27;s natural.  Made with great ingredients from a very reputable skin care company.  Feels great, not greasy on the face and wears well under make up.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Non-sticky but give a bit if shiny and whitening feel.</li>
            <li> Blends in very well on the skin, does not leave a sticky film residue. I have a very sensitive skin, often get breakouts with many products. So it is hard for me to find products for my skin. This particular sunscreen works really well . I have used it a couple of times without any problems. I wear it as the first layer below my makeup , but it is so light that it won&#x27;t give you any feeling of wearing something too thick on your face. It is completely odorless which i prefer. I gave it 3 stars because only time will tell whether the sunscreen is doing a good job of protection. I would also complain about the price point. 1.7 ounce for the price is too steep for this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen. I have very oily skin &amp; break out with any other sunscreen on my face. The reason I gave it a one star is that this company sent me a sunscreen that expires in 2 weeks! I can&#x27;t poss use all of this in 2 weeks! What good is it if it expires?</li>
            <li> It is a bit oily to me. If I use it as daily moisturizer, it feels a little bit heavy.</li>
            <li> This arrived in poor condition.Nearly half the bottle of sunscreen spilled out inside the parcel plastic bag. Dermalogica should always have a protective seal on their products.Due to the product not having a seal and that the cap was loose, the sunscreen liquid escaped from the bottle and wasted half the bottle.It was a mess when i opened my parcel.The product&#x27;s box was smashed as well.Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Because this is Dermalogica, it is a very nice product. My skin feels nice, and it&#x27;s not greasy. But the SPF is only 30, and I get better sun blocking results from the much cheaper - and stronger - Neutrogena ultra sheer, which is equally nice to my skin.</li>
            <li> Dermalogica Super Sensitive Sunscreen works great on my very fair and very sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s protection (active ingredients) comes from zinc oxide and Titanium dioxide, so it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;a non-chemical sunscreen. Which is much safer than chemical based sunsreens.  It wears well&lt;br /&gt;alone or under make-up.  Great product!</li>
