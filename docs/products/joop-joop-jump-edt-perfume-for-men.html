            <li>he loved it so much!  </li>
            <li>I have the Original Joop, and love that as well.</li>
            <li>The bottle is easy designed, cooly (is that a word?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so strong that after a couple hours I get a bit</li>
            <li>The top notes are not my favorite, but it has an awesome dry down with great woods and a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is definitely unique and easy on the nose.  </li>
            <li>An evening cologne that I enjoy wearing all day.</li>
            <li>Bottom line - the scent is fantastic</li>
            <li>Someone made a difference in your life - pass it on...average, and the deal is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Got this via amazon and it smelt like its not the original one.</li>
            <li>I have used this Cologne for more than 5 years, it is Simply the best in the world I could not live with out it</li>
            <li>Sophisticated modern fragrance.</li>
            <li>Jump best fits, but for now I am going with a more casual night scent.</li>
            <li>sure where Jump falls in my collection, probably just outside the Top 10 - but, I like it and recommend/suggest adding to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got 8-10 hours last on my skin , projection is pretty good .</li>
            <li>I was hesitant with Jump, but found the reviews (and price) worth a try.  </li>
            <li>The beginning notes are those of spice, sugar, vanilla, and floral and then settling down to a nice smooth aquatic, clean, sweet (but not too sweet) fragrance that is masculine and unique.  </li>
            <li>first Joop purchase was a the Original Joop some years ago and was initially turned off on how strong that fragrance was.  </li>
            <li>For the avid collector, and those that need a versatile fragrance, add Jump to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product showed up on time and smells just as it should, thanks!</li>
            <li>Slightly sweet without smelling like old spice.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favourite fragrance, it&#x27;s strong enough for me .</li>
            <li>The current deal on Amazon is just under $30.00 for a large bottle with Free Shipping.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Wolfgang</li>
            <li>You can really tell if the manufacture wants to sell &amp;#34;top shelf&amp;#34; by the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I was unwilling to pay the really high price they sell it for in stores, so I found it on here for way cheaper!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, sweet, masculine and elegant, it&#x27;s hard to find at store.</li>
            <li>does, but it does have some decent staying power.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since at least 10 years and still love it every day I&#x27;m using it!</li>
            <li>i will get it for him again and recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>I like finding the great scent from a blind buy...</li>
            <li>May be other Joop products are good, but this one definitely not worth.</li>
            <li>A previous reviewer said he thought it was too strong.  </li>
            <li>It for sure doesn&#x27;t last as long on me as regular JOOP!</li>
            <li>other than that its not bad for the value at all.</li>
            <li>my son is a young adult, but i don&#x27;t think that matters</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>, it has potential &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34;, longevity is above average, and the deal is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Definitely scoring in the Wow Factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Joob, as usual is a strong statment, joob jump is a little extra on the statment..</li>
            <li> It is light and casual, not a heavy dark cologne, contrary to some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> A LONG TIME WOMAN ARE THE ONES THAT ASK ME ALL THE TIME</li>
            <li> I went through a 1.7 oz bottle, purchased from a dept. store and found the larger (3.4 oz) bottle here on Amazon to be half the price of that smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> longevity is above average, lasting about 6+ hours on the skin and a little longer on my shirtsleeve.  </li>
            <li> just give it 15 min to ease a little.</li>
            <li> Now I have to get the green bottle to try.</li>
            <li> scent actually isn&#x27;t bad, but one little spray and you&#x27;ll still be smelling it after your next shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blind Bought this.</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy for me (never do that with perfumes/cologne)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spices make it a bit too risque for casual wear in my opinion (though I may use it sometimes).</li>
            <li> THEY GO CRAZY FOR ME</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> A previous reviewer said he thought it was too strong.  I don&#x27;t beleive that to be with case with me.  It for sure doesn&#x27;t last as long on me as regular JOOP! does, but it does have some decent staying power.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself, and my grandfather for fathers day. We both love it, and so does everyone around us. I have the Original Joop, and love that as well. I believe every man should add this to their collection of great cologne.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favourite fragrance, it&#x27;s strong enough for me . It&#x27;s fresh, sweet, masculine and elegant, it&#x27;s hard to find at store. i&#x27;m so happy when i own it . I got 8-10 hours last on my skin , projection is pretty good . i&#x27;m a big fan of Joop! fragrances.</li>
            <li> Joob, as usual is a strong statment, joob jump is a little extra on the statment.. my recommendayion, do not go out once u wear it.. just give it 15 min to ease a little. other than that its not bad for the value at all.</li>
            <li> Just the way i remember it. I am satisfied</li>
            <li> Got this via amazon and it smelt like its not the original one. Something was off. May be other Joop products are good, but this one definitely not worth.</li>
            <li> I am still debating when Joop! Jump best fits, but for now I am going with a more casual night scent. The spices make it a bit too risque for casual wear in my opinion (though I may use it sometimes). The top notes are not my favorite, but it has an awesome dry down with great woods and a hint of vanilla. Definitely good for 20-40 age group.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since at least 10 years and still love it every day I&#x27;m using it! Thanks Wolfgang</li>
            <li> I have used this Cologne for more than 5 years, it is Simply the best in the world I could not live with out it</li>
            <li> he loved it so much!  i will get it for him again and recommend it highly.  my son is a young adult, but i don&#x27;t think that matters</li>
            <li> Sophisticated modern fragrance. Slightly sweet without smelling like old spice. An evening cologne that I enjoy wearing all day.</li>
            <li> Blind Bought this. I spray 5 on each arm. Smells Good. Gotta couple of Compliments, My Supervisor and Co-Worker noticed it when I wore it.</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy for me (never do that with perfumes/cologne)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent actually isn&#x27;t bad, but one little spray and you&#x27;ll still be smelling it after your next shower.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so strong that after a couple hours I get a bit nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re taking a trip &amp; can&#x27;t bring cologne with you, just squirt this stuff about 3 times before the trip and it should last all week.</li>
            <li> Great citrus scent. It is light and casual, not a heavy dark cologne, contrary to some of the reviews. I went through a 1.7 oz bottle, purchased from a dept. store and found the larger (3.4 oz) bottle here on Amazon to be half the price of that smaller bottle. Great French product at a great price.</li>
            <li> You guys know I like finding the great scent from a blind buy... As one of my former supervisors once said, &amp;#34;sometimes you get the bear... and sometimes the bear gets you...&amp;#34;  With Jump, I think I got the bear.  The fragrance is definitely unique and easy on the nose.  The beginning notes are those of spice, sugar, vanilla, and floral and then settling down to a nice smooth aquatic, clean, sweet (but not too sweet) fragrance that is masculine and unique.  Almost addictive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Joop purchase was a the Original Joop some years ago and was initially turned off on how strong that fragrance was.  I was hesitant with Jump, but found the reviews (and price) worth a try.  I am pleasantly surprised.  While the projection is good, it is not overpowering.  Very easy on the nose and not offensive.  I have worn the fragrance once and received compliments and curiosity of the fragrance.  Definitely scoring in the Wow Factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longevity is above average, lasting about 6+ hours on the skin and a little longer on my shirtsleeve.  The beauty of the fragrance is the versatility.  You pick up various notes that will blend well with any time of year and any occasion.  The fragrance is really good.  The bottle is easy designed, cooly (is that a word?) designed that fits the hand perfectly.  It is also well packaged.  You can really tell if the manufacture wants to sell &amp;#34;top shelf&amp;#34; by the packaging.  Great job, Joop..!! The current deal on Amazon is just under $30.00 for a large bottle with Free Shipping.  You can&#x27;t beat that..!!  For the avid collector, and those that need a versatile fragrance, add Jump to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure where Jump falls in my collection, probably just outside the Top 10 - but, I like it and recommend/suggest adding to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give Joop Jump 4.3 stars out of 5.  Bottom line - the scent is fantastic, it has potential &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34;, longevity is above average, and the deal is fantastic.  I definitely recommend adding to your collection.  Someone made a difference in your life - pass it on...average, and the deal is fantastic.  I definitely recommend adding to your collection.

            <li> Ive always loved the original Joop on my husband and this one smells just as good on him. Now I have to get the green bottle to try.</li>
