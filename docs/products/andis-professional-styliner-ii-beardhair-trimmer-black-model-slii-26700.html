            <li>It&#x27;s good, but would have been better if it cuts a bit closer.</li>
            <li>I read many good reviews, and brought it a month ago.</li>

            <li>Came brand new in the box and beeb working excellent since opened and started using!</li>
            <li>Andis Styliner is a great trimmer and Amazon shipped them quickly and on time.</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer, I&#x27;m a prefessional barber and this machine cuts nice and clean every time great for shape ups and bald fades.</li>
            <li>Good quality and strong motor.</li>
            <li>A solid product, good quality, all around the best edger and trimmer I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>Adjustment screw is metal which is a good thing since the cheap plastic screw tend to get damaged over the years.</li>
            <li>I use the Oster T-edgers, for professional use they are the best, but, that&#x27;s just my two cents.</li>
            <li>Andis is just the best on the market and even professional barbers use it as well</li>
            <li>So far I have been very impressed with the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best trimmer, if you ask any barber that specializes in tapering, line-ups, &amp; designs they&#x27;ll tell you this is the best trimmer by far.  </li>
            <li>These have been an excellent purchase thus far, Ive had them for about a month or so now.</li>
            <li>this is the most effective and reliable tool in every barber&#x27;s repertoire..</li>
            <li>:) nice and durable.</li>
            <li>GOOD AND ORIGINAL QUALITY</li>
            <li>Says it works great and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>At first it was great; I could use it instead of shaving to have a 1-day of growth look (and avoid bumps I get on my neck when shaving with a razor).  </li>
            <li>WORKS PERFECTLY FINE!</li>
            <li>It is also very smooth.</li>
            <li>CUTS GREAT AND SMOOTH AND ALWAYS STAY COOL</li>
            <li>Sleek and powerful to cut the skin, smooth and cool running motor, best tool to have when doing shape-ups.</li>
            <li>I really love these things.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for years and will continue to use them for many more to come.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Love using this.</li>
            <li>They vibrate like hell, they&#x27;re a nightmare to adjust the blades, and the housing isn&#x27;t the most durable.</li>
            <li>This trimmer, to most, may be an acquired taste.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you oil it after every use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li>I love this andis styliner...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li>Much much better better than cordless.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Andis products (I already own the Andis Master, T Edjer, and T Outliner).</li>
            <li>Mostly my fault but a warning in the manual</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>More the  20 years.</li>
            <li>smaller clipper is excellent</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Great for children and adults my son&#x27;s edge up was so crispy with these andis with a gentle blade, they came to me set close</li>
            <li>the top screw bottom</li>
            <li>I went with this brand because the Wahl brand had too many complaints of the product being used.</li>
            <li>Of course I cleaned it with alcohol just to make sure.</li>
            <li>I have had many over 30 years and this will be my go to every time.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Low noise, perfect for edging and detailing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for a year now and love every bit of it.  </li>
            <li>I even like these trimmers better than the Andis Styliner M3s.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product I recommend is comfortable to use</li>
            <li>I am infinitely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love these, beyond pleased with the results they delivered.</li>
            <li>Love the price also.</li>
            <li>Like many men I would get bumps if I shaved with a razor.</li>
            <li>Great item fast delivery</li>
            <li>The Master set worked flawlessly, and they were quiet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll choose something better this time.</li>
            <li>the second pair have been received and are flawless .</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with these clippers at this time.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than the t outliner in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I may buy more.</li>
            <li>Awesome for simple trims.</li>
            <li>Top of the line product here I don&#x27;t see why you would choice anything else.</li>
            <li>My father was in love with these clippers.</li>
            <li>i love the feel of it and the power it has.</li>
            <li>and i love the way it cuts</li>
            <li>We know most brothas have problems with using straight-edge razors because our hair curls under the skin.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>It was very clean</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anybody looking for a good quality trimmer, a close shave, and a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t get hot after just minutes of usage like some others do.</li>
            <li>My barber using these exact clippers on his customers and cuts really good</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my husband and he says it gave him the best and smoothest shave in a long time.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anybody looking for a good quality trimmer, a close shave, and a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t get hot after just minutes of usage like some others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quickly gets my edges lined up as nicely as the barber shop.</li>
            <li>good runs good barley used it for 2 days, further ratings to come</li>
            <li>Provides crispy clean lines!</li>
            <li>They are NOT the most maneuverable trimmer available.</li>
            <li>I bought  this product after carefully doing my homework on the best product for trimming and outlining hair and this came up.</li>
            <li>It is ideal for daily shaving and edging up your hairline.</li>
            <li>Its great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it is ideal for both the home and commercial purposes...</li>
            <li>&#x27;burns are super straight; the T-blade is a joy to use.</li>
            <li>Pretty good clippers cuts close for that clean edge</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of other trimmers to shave my head as well as razors and this one seems to be the best option</li>
            <li>Excellent product  would suggest this over other clippers</li>
            <li>It was an easy decision from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a plus and feels strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product to anyone in need of a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband, who cuts his own hair, and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>HANDS DOWN THE BEST FUNCTIONAL TRIMMER YOUR GIRLFRIEND</li>
            <li>What I realized is that none of those are made for shaping fine lines on beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome trimmer doesn&#x27;t get hot, quiet workhorse !!</li>
            <li>Runs smooth and shaves smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>It gives a close, clean shave and is extremely smooth and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Great for mustache, under the chin and neck area, especially if you want to avoid in grown hair.</li>
            <li>They are NOT the lightest trimmer available.</li>
            <li>and they still didn&#x27;t give me the precise edges I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My babe has great facial hair that he maintains himself &amp; these</li>
            <li>and i enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Sure wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again, for what that&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Great buy for trimming your hair around ear, liner on back.  </li>
            <li>It is a great trimmer, only noisy.  </li>
            <li>Bought this siad free shippin</li>
            <li>Def not as smooth of a feel as post waxing</li>
            <li>The product does display a quality fit and finish however.  </li>
            <li>Over all a definitely great trimmer if you use it properly.</li>
            <li>Good but extremely loud.</li>
            <li>These trimmers are far superior to the T-edger.</li>
            <li>IMHO, this is far superior to anything produced by Oster, Wahl, etc.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to shave right AFTER you shower, and maintain the clippers well.</li>
            <li>I did mention she&#x27;s 29 weeks pregnant right, so she notices EVERYTHING!!  </li>
            <li>so i got my moneys worth, and this one works just as good as the older model</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this particular unit, the first worked flawlessly for over 10 years - had to retire it because it crashed to the ground too many times and</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very easy and gives a real close cut.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Not disappointing!</li>
            <li>and they are crisp and sharp excellent product and purchase</li>
            <li>I need to have a certain power level in order to give myself a good clean cut, but at that power level, it is very noisy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and it gives a clean cut.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give his as clean of a shave as a razor does, but he likes how it doesn&#x27;t irritate his face.  </li>
            <li>It cuts so close and gives a clean finish.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer has a great feel in quality, balanced in weight, and provides a close in dry shave.</li>
            <li>I also use andis cleaner/lube after each use to prolong the life of the product i recommend everyone properly clean and lube theirs</li>
            <li>I had to use a special tool to get screw out and blade off.</li>
            <li>Hard to adjust perfectly, doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as the 000 blade on my Andis clippers.</li>
            <li>a brief review indicated that the price was fair,</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t even after 3 years of daily usage... if you take good care of it.</li>
            <li>Overall - good purchase for price from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good trimmer for removing the bulk of hair on the sides and back of your head</li>
            <li>But the overall shape of the tool can be improved, a more ergonomic design would make outlining easier and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>But I can assure you that they are so loud that I honestly think that if you worked at a place that required you to use them, you would have to request ear plugs for both you and your customer.    </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that they were electric instead of battery operated, but the loudness was completely unbearable.  </li>
            <li>Earlier I had one that was really good quality.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Stays REALLY cool after running for a while.  </li>
            <li>If you do this though, and your hair is very curly/nappy like mine, say hello to more razor bumps.</li>
            <li>She loves them and says they are great, they give a fine edge and tight details.</li>
            <li>I have a previous version of this item and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Theoretically it can be done, but there are too many pieces to hold onto and to put pressure on in different directions at once to ensure a good cut without the blade teeth poking up and able to cut you.</li>
            <li>other than that its a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have quick hands, this might be an issue for you.  </li>
            <li>but none cut this close or were as quick to use.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>But the trimmer&#x27;s documentation had in bold lettering, &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li>but none cut this close or were as quick to use.</li>
            <li>does the job quick and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Super close trimmers and don&#x27;t agitate the skin.</li>
            <li>She used the styliners for about three trims the very first week</li>
            <li>The sound it makes is absolutely deafening and thus you can&#x27;t have it on for more than 10 seconds without getting absolutely annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>It eventually cuts close enough after u stroke so very many times.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and this trimmer works smoothly and does the job!</li>
            <li>Great quality for little money.</li>
            <li>The clippers cut really close and precise.</li>
            <li>The power is amazing and it runs very quietly,</li>
            <li>I really like how smooth this clipper glides effortlessly.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>But I bought this one for my kid and it is kind of too big to trim his hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Is quiet and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>I own three different Andis clippers and I use this one specifically for balding out my head before fading.</li>
            <li>Overall, it gets the job done pretty well, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to any stylist, barber or a man doing his own grooming at home.</li>
            <li>Though they are a bit heavier the cut is worth it.</li>
            <li>These trimmers provide straight lines, a clean shave at a quick pace.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and delivers a nice cut.</li>
            <li>After I re-boxed this item to return it, I came into possession of a \\&quot;Sound Level Meter\\&quot; that measures precisely how loud an item is.  </li>
            <li>Powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li>worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful.</li>
            <li>Better than the Oster T liner by far.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great haircut, you need the personal Andis Professional Styliner II</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I find it very powerful, and it gives a very close shave (i would say that it leaves about 0.1 mm of beard).</li>
            <li>It also shipped out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I like this trimmer mainly because it is the most gentle that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The clippers perform well right out of the box.</li>
            <li>The blade in this shaver does quite a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is smooth and not too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this trimmer-it does everything I expected it to do without any problem.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer gives a clean good shave but it vibrates a little too much as a matter of expectation.</li>
            <li>In my honest opinion, once you&#x27;ve gotten used to all the drawbacks this trimmer has, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a better edger out there.</li>
            <li>Blades are super sharp and nice quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still in great shape, but I can&#x27;t get it aligned enough to use it, so I&#x27;m actually going to look for another one.</li>
            <li>Good clippers but plan on making several adjustments to get rid of the loud vibration noise.  </li>
            <li>My whole life I&#x27;ve been a Wahl fan; since many of my professional hair stylist friends persuaded me otherwise, I decided to give Andis a shot.  </li>
            <li>I like this one very much.</li>
            <li>They were in original package and were brand new.</li>
            <li>It is a great trimmer, very hard to cut skin with, and does not get hot quickly...</li>
            <li>It gives me a close shave and doesn&#x27;t get hot at all from my experience with it.</li>
            <li>I first purchased them when I worked at Ft.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li>The motor made a funny noise the first day and you have to shake it to make it stop.</li>
            <li>this unit is ready to go!</li>
            <li>The old version cut smoothly.</li>
            <li>(it actually looks nicer and more sleek in my opinion).  </li>
            <li>He said &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t get hot like the others ones&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is my first time every trying to use a styliner, the styliner itself doesn&#x27;t heat up after 15min of use, however the blade does.  </li>
            <li>As most who have bought this trimmer, I use it to shave with because I cannot shave close with a regular or electric razor because it causes ingrown hairs and breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Thanks joel!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this trimmer running hot either.</li>
            <li>I got these to replace my t outliners that have get too hot when I&#x27;m shaving my face and head.  </li>
            <li>Once blade is adjusted it works wonders I love these things I will never go to a different brand I must admit I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li>My first inclination was to contact Amazon because of their stellar return poilcy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used plenty of product from Andis and the quality is always consistent.</li>
            <li>If you adjust, make sure to watch a youtube video first to learn proper adjusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me a close shave and doesn&#x27;t get hot at all from my experience with it.</li>
            <li>most who have bought this trimmer, I use it to shave with because I cannot shave close with a regular or electric razor because it causes ingrown hairs and breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is the first pair of Kenneth Cole shoe I have bought with which I have an issue.  </li>
            <li>We received the first set and the clipper box was damaged as well as the clippers.</li>
            <li>i love andis products and that is only reaffirmed with this product...</li>
            <li>I bought these clippers for my husband as a Christmas present and he is utterly pleased with them.</li>
            <li>my andis styliner II is my first choice.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace an original Styliner which was probably 18-20 years old.</li>
            <li>It took me hair cuts to the next level with crisp clean line ups!</li>
            <li>Strong andis trimmer, precise and sharp.</li>
            <li>what a difference,,it does alot better clean cut in a less time.</li>
            <li>Clippers are well made, quiet, good selection of guides for different hair lengths and side trimming, etc.</li>
            <li>Clean lines and very powerful for fading and dry shaving.</li>
            <li>At first it worked really well - cut my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a professional, solid, quality feel to it and the blades are extremely easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>These are Great trimmers out of the box, hits sharp but not enough to cut your clients.</li>
            <li>I been using cheap clippers all my life for my personal care,,its my first time to try this profesional trimmer,,oohhh</li>
            <li>Cuts really close</li>
            <li>I really recommend these.</li>
            <li>Straight out the box</li>
            <li>I took the trimmers apart and there was absolutely nothing I could do to fix them.</li>
            <li>really hope this product that I got was defective.</li>
            <li>cuts  very well just a bit noisy</li>
            <li>Really like this product for the price</li>
            <li>I paid $50+ for such a cheap quality item.</li>
            <li>These trimmers are very reliable too.</li>
            <li>You really get to know a company if there is a hiccup in the process.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a barber that specializes in fades you really have no business buying these trimmers.</li>
            <li>Learn as much as you can before buying one.  </li>
            <li>shipped item fast.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mom who&#x27;s in barber school and really wanted these.</li>
            <li>After spending way too much time researching a trimmer I decided on this one.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well once you adjust the blade the power and the tension screw.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to every guy out there looking for a very close shave</li>
            <li>Not as close as I like, but very close.  </li>
            <li>I will say I use this trimmer with the combination of the Wahl 5-Star Shaver to get a really close shave as a razor.  </li>
            <li>My old Andis finally broke and I had it for many years.</li>
            <li>I was excited to open them and use them in the salon today.</li>
            <li>This buzzer is exactly what I was looking for…Real close shave for the whole face, but def soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>A pretty good edger and dry shaver that leaves little to no stubble.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is powerful and can be adjusted to make out-lining extremely precise and skin tight.</li>
            <li>Just as described these work great for my every other day shave very sharp and cuts well would recommend to a friend or family</li>
            <li>On my previous model, I was able to unscrew the blades and align the cut as close as 0mm.  </li>
            <li>However, there is no doubt in its ability to get the job done; a classic barber tool.</li>
            <li>Just bought this and sure enough 31 days later it literally fell apart on my vanity counter while trying to trim my moustache.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for the sole purpose of touching up my hair on the sideburns and back of the neck</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a calm by-the-speed-limit driver buying &amp; giving a corvette a bad review knowing they should have bought a car more suitable for their driving needs.  </li>
            <li>then I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for some trimmers...</li>
            <li>The blade can be a little better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this thing 3 stars not because its a bad trimmer, in fact this may be one of the best trimmers out there.</li>
            <li>but seems very well made and professional.</li>
            <li>the andis works great but the cover came with a crack which made me a littel sad</li>
            <li>so I use them everyday many times a day.</li>
            <li>I guess with magnetic motors that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok, not the worst trimmers I&#x27;ve used, but definitely far from the best!</li>
            <li>The Styliner II is relatively quiet, stays cool, and produces a professionally groomed result.</li>
            <li>Just like an old country western quick draw.</li>
            <li>The cut won&#x27;t be as low, but it&#x27;ll be low enough, and if you use the right after shave moisturizer/lotion (I highly recommend Axe Shield Face hydrator, sold on amazon and at Target), then you&#x27;ll be smooth</li>
            <li>Way more solid and powerful than the usual consumer-marketed trimmers.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>I used to have to replace my trimmers with new ones about twice a year because they would burn out.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the box is brand new</li>
            <li>I just bay a new one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what else to say besides try them out if you&#x27;re looking for a new addition to you clipper selection.</li>
            <li>I like the new design and updated power button except, the direction of the on/off switch.</li>
            <li>After inspecting the product, it appeared to be new and there were no signs of hair in the packaging.</li>
            <li>I received a brand new replacement the day after I sent the RMA.  </li>
            <li>If your a new barber, at home here &amp; there barber, or non-buzz cut barber</li>
            <li>This new model has an \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; blade head that has the blades screwed together.  </li>
            <li>Even today they still live up to the Andis&#x27; reputation of quality.</li>
            <li>It leaves smooth precise lines and my clients has not experienced and cuts on scrapes from the styliner II.</li>
            <li>I am sure this will last me a long time and makes my daily routine much faster.</li>
            <li>He also has very sensitive skin, prone to bumps</li>
            <li>The first one I got a tiny piece of the corner of the blade broke off, but Amazon switched it out without any hassles for a new one.</li>
            <li>The only time I had to re-order this was because I dropped my first one and broke the plastic around the blade.</li>
            <li>First of all this trimmwr must be set correctly look up on YouTube the proper way to set this do not touch tension screw aka</li>
            <li>M3 gets hot, is heavier, &amp; double in price.  </li>
            <li>I use this trimmer to shave my head and face, usually I do both once every week or two, mostly because I&#x27;m lazy, it cuts very close without burning my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any bumps or cuts, easy to take care of and use.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found that gives me the clean cut without the bumps for ten plus years now.</li>
            <li>The Styliner II gives a sharp clean cut all around.</li>
            <li>I needed  new trimmers because I dropped the old pair and broke them.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to adjust my blades pretty much leaving these useless to me, so I emailed amazon and was promptly shipped out a new pair with upgraded shipping ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s choppy and seems to get stuck and catch on my skin/hair easily easily.</li>
            <li>So, I did a small survey of my own, watching U-Tube videos of barbers who rated several types of trimmers.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing, I have a ton of clippers and hair products and this is one of my favorites, I use it to trim down my beard before shaving because my hair is coarse.</li>
            <li>Smooth, light, doesn&#x27;t get hot (of course after an hour of cutting, it should be though),</li>
            <li>I am a black male and so are most of my customers.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t overheat, super sharp and precision blades.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful and close trimming razor, one that I enjoyed using twice before it failed on</li>
            <li>The most smooth close cutting clippers i have evered owned</li>
            <li>I like andis professional style</li>
            <li>I have had my andi Professional trimmers for over 8 yrs now.</li>
            <li>I am a professional hair dresser</li>
            <li>So much so that this is the only trimmer I&#x27;ve used since I was 16.  </li>
            <li>He is 2 year and 7 month old.</li>
            <li>So the old blades I had cannot be used.</li>
            <li>When I received the trimmer, it did in fact match his old trimmer and the one on the andis website, but it did not look like the photo shown here</li>
            <li>its almost as if they came with old blades....</li>
            <li>go completely bald&lt;</li>
            <li>now it make a loud noise.</li>
            <li>I have tried at least a dozen cheaper trimmers through the years and some were ok</li>
            <li>and they are already making loud noises.</li>
            <li>I have tried at least a dozen cheaper trimmers through the years and some were ok</li>
            <li>These clippers were so loud that I had to return them.  </li>
            <li>just so I could measure just how AMAZINGLY LOUD these clippers were.    </li>
            <li>I had to get used to it compared to my old one.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anybody whether it is for home use or professional use.</li>
            <li>I work in a busy barber shop</li>
            <li>This product is not meant to give you a completely shaved look.</li>
            <li>But if you have some basic trimming skills, you can trim your beard very well with this product.</li>
            <li>My earlier trimmers with batteries were damaged very soon so this product with a cable to the power plug is a welcoming change.</li>
            <li>Better than anything I&#x27;ve used in the past!</li>
            <li>It has not left any gash marks or major blemishes on my skin, and still manages to give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews say that clippers get real hot, are heavy, or just do not cut well.</li>
            <li>Then after 4 months, the following things happened which, overall, make this a pretty crappy product in my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend to all Barbers and regular people alike</li>
            <li>, I like how close it cuts and it&#x27;s wide enough to cover a lot of space quickly.</li>
            <li>I am not sure about price as it was not my primary consideration but</li>
            <li>Very satisfactory long term service.</li>
            <li>This trimmer/styliner is exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>I am really disappointed because I liked these trimmers and they were working really well at first.  </li>
            <li>The style liners are a strong, smooth cutting clipper, but not very sharp compared to the outliners and hero&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Then when I ordered a replacement, the new version was built differently with a blade that was screw on/off rather than pull off.</li>
            <li>New one seems destined to provide similar service.</li>
            <li>Has long as you keep it clean, last for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is my second pair, I usually do not drop my clippers like that but even if you drop your trimmers like the peanut or detailers they dont shatter like these styliner 2s do...</li>
            <li>This product is user friendly, quiet, little or no vibration.</li>
            <li>The Styliner II does not get hot, is lightweight, cuts sharp with ease and is sleek looking.  </li>
            <li>unlike some of the other machines it doesn&#x27;t get hot</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this one that finally broke I bought it back in 2000</li>
            <li>If you keep it lubricated and away from rust, you&#x27;ll enjoy this dull looking trimmer for years.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for any trimming and especially for those of use that use it to shave vs. traditional razors.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for any trimming and especially for those of use that use it to shave vs. traditional razors.</li>
            <li>The only dislike I had was when it started making a really loud zinging noise, but to stop that you have to tighten the screw with a flathead.</li>
            <li>no nicks but cuts close enough that my wife saw the cut and noticed it was considerably closer</li>
            <li>This new version is the total opposite.</li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;m black.</li>
            <li>I almost cut my skin raking it so hard to cut the hair on my neck to give myself a clean shapeup..</li>
            <li>They can create a crispy edge up nearly as fast as the other two trimmers named.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is fast and sharp, I use it instead of shaving to avoid shaving rash.</li>
            <li>It is a great clipper but terrible that I had to purchase another blade right away.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t too expensive and they don&#x27;t get hot quick at all.</li>
            <li>guy is heavy duty and does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>And to make matters worse, one of the screws became easily stripped so</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected, brand new just like it&#x27;s listed.</li>
            <li>I had to sign for it which was unnecessary but the product was fine.</li>

            <li> I use this to shave my beard line up my beard as well it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I have owned two pair of these clippers, I won&#x27;t own another one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but would have been better if it cuts a bit closer.</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews, and brought it a month ago.</li>
            <li> i liked these clipper till they fell off the counter and chipped the blades no longer useable till i replace</li>

            <li> It line&#x27;s up perfectly and great for dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> the hair is nice cool!!</li>
            <li> GREAT, PURCHASED FOR MY SON FOR HIS BIRTHDAY ALONG WITH OTHER ITEMS, HE LOVED THEM IDEAL FOR FACE AND EDGING UP.</li>
            <li> Came brand new in the box and beeb working excellent since opened and started using!</li>
            <li> Andis Styliner is a great trimmer and Amazon shipped them quickly and on time.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, I&#x27;m a prefessional barber and this machine cuts nice and clean every time great for shape ups and bald fades.</li>
            <li> Good quality and strong motor.</li>
            <li> A solid product, good quality, all around the best edger and trimmer I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> Adjustment screw is metal which is a good thing since the cheap plastic screw tend to get damaged over the years.</li>
            <li> I use the Oster T-edgers, for professional use they are the best, but, that&#x27;s just my two cents.</li>
            <li> Andis is just the best on the market and even professional barbers use it as well</li>
            <li> So far I have been very impressed with the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer, if you ask any barber that specializes in tapering, line-ups, &amp; designs they&#x27;ll tell you this is the best trimmer by far.  </li>
            <li> These have been an excellent purchase thus far, Ive had them for about a month or so now.</li>
            <li> this is the most effective and reliable tool in every barber&#x27;s repertoire..</li>
            <li> :) nice and durable.</li>
            <li> GOOD AND ORIGINAL QUALITY</li>
            <li> Says it works great and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> At first it was great; I could use it instead of shaving to have a 1-day of growth look (and avoid bumps I get on my neck when shaving with a razor).  </li>
            <li> WORKS PERFECTLY FINE!</li>
            <li> It is also very smooth.</li>
            <li> CUTS GREAT AND SMOOTH AND ALWAYS STAY COOL</li>
            <li> Sleek and powerful to cut the skin, smooth and cool running motor, best tool to have when doing shape-ups.</li>
            <li> I really love these things.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for years and will continue to use them for many more to come.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Love using this.</li>
            <li> They vibrate like hell, they&#x27;re a nightmare to adjust the blades, and the housing isn&#x27;t the most durable.</li>
            <li> This trimmer, to most, may be an acquired taste.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you oil it after every use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> I love this andis styliner...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li> Much much better better than cordless.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Andis products (I already own the Andis Master, T Edjer, and T Outliner).</li>
            <li> Mostly my fault but a warning in the manual</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> More the  20 years.</li>
            <li> smaller clipper is excellent</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Great for children and adults my son&#x27;s edge up was so crispy with these andis with a gentle blade, they came to me set close</li>
            <li> the top screw bottom</li>
            <li> I went with this brand because the Wahl brand had too many complaints of the product being used.</li>
            <li> Of course I cleaned it with alcohol just to make sure.</li>
            <li> I have had many over 30 years and this will be my go to every time.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Low noise, perfect for edging and detailing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for a year now and love every bit of it.  </li>
            <li> I even like these trimmers better than the Andis Styliner M3s.  </li>
            <li> I liked the product I recommend is comfortable to use</li>
            <li> I am infinitely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love these, beyond pleased with the results they delivered.</li>
            <li> Love the price also.</li>
            <li> Like many men I would get bumps if I shaved with a razor.</li>
            <li> Great item fast delivery</li>
            <li> The Master set worked flawlessly, and they were quiet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll choose something better this time.</li>
            <li> the second pair have been received and are flawless .</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with these clippers at this time.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than the t outliner in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I may buy more.</li>
            <li> Awesome for simple trims.</li>
            <li> Top of the line product here I don&#x27;t see why you would choice anything else.</li>
            <li> My father was in love with these clippers.</li>
            <li> i love the feel of it and the power it has.</li>
            <li> and i love the way it cuts</li>
            <li> We know most brothas have problems with using straight-edge razors because our hair curls under the skin.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> It was very clean</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anybody looking for a good quality trimmer, a close shave, and a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t get hot after just minutes of usage like some others do.</li>
            <li> My barber using these exact clippers on his customers and cuts really good</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and he says it gave him the best and smoothest shave in a long time.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anybody looking for a good quality trimmer, a close shave, and a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t get hot after just minutes of usage like some others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quickly gets my edges lined up as nicely as the barber shop.</li>
            <li> good runs good barley used it for 2 days, further ratings to come</li>
            <li> Provides crispy clean lines!</li>
            <li> They are NOT the most maneuverable trimmer available.</li>
            <li> I bought  this product after carefully doing my homework on the best product for trimming and outlining hair and this came up.</li>
            <li> It is ideal for daily shaving and edging up your hairline.</li>
            <li> Its great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it is ideal for both the home and commercial purposes...</li>
            <li> &#x27;burns are super straight; the T-blade is a joy to use.</li>
            <li> Pretty good clippers cuts close for that clean edge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of other trimmers to shave my head as well as razors and this one seems to be the best option</li>
            <li> Excellent product  would suggest this over other clippers</li>
            <li> It was an easy decision from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plus and feels strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product to anyone in need of a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, who cuts his own hair, and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN THE BEST FUNCTIONAL TRIMMER YOUR GIRLFRIEND</li>
            <li> What I realized is that none of those are made for shaping fine lines on beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer doesn&#x27;t get hot, quiet workhorse !!</li>
            <li> Runs smooth and shaves smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> It gives a close, clean shave and is extremely smooth and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Great for mustache, under the chin and neck area, especially if you want to avoid in grown hair.</li>
            <li> They are NOT the lightest trimmer available.</li>
            <li> and they still didn&#x27;t give me the precise edges I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My babe has great facial hair that he maintains himself &amp; these</li>
            <li> and i enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Sure wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again, for what that&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Great buy for trimming your hair around ear, liner on back.  </li>
            <li> It is a great trimmer, only noisy.  </li>
            <li> Bought this siad free shippin</li>
            <li> Def not as smooth of a feel as post waxing</li>
            <li> The product does display a quality fit and finish however.  </li>
            <li> Over all a definitely great trimmer if you use it properly.</li>
            <li> Good but extremely loud.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are far superior to the T-edger.</li>
            <li> IMHO, this is far superior to anything produced by Oster, Wahl, etc.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to shave right AFTER you shower, and maintain the clippers well.</li>
            <li> I did mention she&#x27;s 29 weeks pregnant right, so she notices EVERYTHING!!  </li>
            <li> so i got my moneys worth, and this one works just as good as the older model</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this particular unit, the first worked flawlessly for over 10 years - had to retire it because it crashed to the ground too many times and</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very easy and gives a real close cut.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Not disappointing!</li>
            <li> and they are crisp and sharp excellent product and purchase</li>
            <li> I need to have a certain power level in order to give myself a good clean cut, but at that power level, it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and it gives a clean cut.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give his as clean of a shave as a razor does, but he likes how it doesn&#x27;t irritate his face.  </li>
            <li> It cuts so close and gives a clean finish.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer has a great feel in quality, balanced in weight, and provides a close in dry shave.</li>
            <li> I also use andis cleaner/lube after each use to prolong the life of the product i recommend everyone properly clean and lube theirs</li>
            <li> I had to use a special tool to get screw out and blade off.</li>
            <li> Hard to adjust perfectly, doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as the 000 blade on my Andis clippers.</li>
            <li> a brief review indicated that the price was fair,</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t even after 3 years of daily usage... if you take good care of it.</li>
            <li> Overall - good purchase for price from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good trimmer for removing the bulk of hair on the sides and back of your head</li>
            <li> But the overall shape of the tool can be improved, a more ergonomic design would make outlining easier and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> But I can assure you that they are so loud that I honestly think that if you worked at a place that required you to use them, you would have to request ear plugs for both you and your customer.    </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that they were electric instead of battery operated, but the loudness was completely unbearable.  </li>
            <li> Earlier I had one that was really good quality.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Stays REALLY cool after running for a while.  </li>
            <li> If you do this though, and your hair is very curly/nappy like mine, say hello to more razor bumps.</li>
            <li> She loves them and says they are great, they give a fine edge and tight details.</li>
            <li> I have a previous version of this item and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Theoretically it can be done, but there are too many pieces to hold onto and to put pressure on in different directions at once to ensure a good cut without the blade teeth poking up and able to cut you.</li>
            <li> other than that its a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have quick hands, this might be an issue for you.  </li>
            <li> but none cut this close or were as quick to use.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> But the trimmer&#x27;s documentation had in bold lettering, &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li> but none cut this close or were as quick to use.</li>
            <li> does the job quick and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Super close trimmers and don&#x27;t agitate the skin.</li>
            <li> She used the styliners for about three trims the very first week</li>
            <li> The sound it makes is absolutely deafening and thus you can&#x27;t have it on for more than 10 seconds without getting absolutely annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It eventually cuts close enough after u stroke so very many times.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and this trimmer works smoothly and does the job!</li>
            <li> Great quality for little money.</li>
            <li> The clippers cut really close and precise.</li>
            <li> The power is amazing and it runs very quietly,</li>
            <li> I really like how smooth this clipper glides effortlessly.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> But I bought this one for my kid and it is kind of too big to trim his hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Is quiet and does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> I own three different Andis clippers and I use this one specifically for balding out my head before fading.</li>
            <li> Overall, it gets the job done pretty well, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to any stylist, barber or a man doing his own grooming at home.</li>
            <li> Though they are a bit heavier the cut is worth it.</li>
            <li> These trimmers provide straight lines, a clean shave at a quick pace.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and delivers a nice cut.</li>
            <li> After I re-boxed this item to return it, I came into possession of a \\&quot;Sound Level Meter\\&quot; that measures precisely how loud an item is.  </li>
            <li> Powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li> worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful.</li>
            <li> Better than the Oster T liner by far.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great haircut, you need the personal Andis Professional Styliner II</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I find it very powerful, and it gives a very close shave (i would say that it leaves about 0.1 mm of beard).</li>
            <li> It also shipped out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer mainly because it is the most gentle that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The clippers perform well right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The blade in this shaver does quite a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is smooth and not too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this trimmer-it does everything I expected it to do without any problem.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer gives a clean good shave but it vibrates a little too much as a matter of expectation.</li>
            <li> In my honest opinion, once you&#x27;ve gotten used to all the drawbacks this trimmer has, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a better edger out there.</li>
            <li> Blades are super sharp and nice quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still in great shape, but I can&#x27;t get it aligned enough to use it, so I&#x27;m actually going to look for another one.</li>
            <li> Good clippers but plan on making several adjustments to get rid of the loud vibration noise.  </li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve been a Wahl fan; since many of my professional hair stylist friends persuaded me otherwise, I decided to give Andis a shot.  </li>
            <li> I like this one very much.</li>
            <li> They were in original package and were brand new.</li>
            <li> It is a great trimmer, very hard to cut skin with, and does not get hot quickly...</li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave and doesn&#x27;t get hot at all from my experience with it.</li>
            <li> I first purchased them when I worked at Ft.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> The motor made a funny noise the first day and you have to shake it to make it stop.</li>
            <li> this unit is ready to go!</li>
            <li> The old version cut smoothly.</li>
            <li> (it actually looks nicer and more sleek in my opinion).  </li>
            <li> He said &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t get hot like the others ones&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is my first time every trying to use a styliner, the styliner itself doesn&#x27;t heat up after 15min of use, however the blade does.  </li>
            <li> As most who have bought this trimmer, I use it to shave with because I cannot shave close with a regular or electric razor because it causes ingrown hairs and breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Thanks joel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this trimmer running hot either.</li>
            <li> I got these to replace my t outliners that have get too hot when I&#x27;m shaving my face and head.  </li>
            <li> Once blade is adjusted it works wonders I love these things I will never go to a different brand I must admit I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> My first inclination was to contact Amazon because of their stellar return poilcy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of product from Andis and the quality is always consistent.</li>
            <li> If you adjust, make sure to watch a youtube video first to learn proper adjusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave and doesn&#x27;t get hot at all from my experience with it.</li>
            <li> most who have bought this trimmer, I use it to shave with because I cannot shave close with a regular or electric razor because it causes ingrown hairs and breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is the first pair of Kenneth Cole shoe I have bought with which I have an issue.  </li>
            <li> We received the first set and the clipper box was damaged as well as the clippers.</li>
            <li> i love andis products and that is only reaffirmed with this product...</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for my husband as a Christmas present and he is utterly pleased with them.</li>
            <li> my andis styliner II is my first choice.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace an original Styliner which was probably 18-20 years old.</li>
            <li> It took me hair cuts to the next level with crisp clean line ups!</li>
            <li> Strong andis trimmer, precise and sharp.</li>
            <li> what a difference,,it does alot better clean cut in a less time.</li>
            <li> Clippers are well made, quiet, good selection of guides for different hair lengths and side trimming, etc.</li>
            <li> Clean lines and very powerful for fading and dry shaving.</li>
            <li> At first it worked really well - cut my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a professional, solid, quality feel to it and the blades are extremely easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> These are Great trimmers out of the box, hits sharp but not enough to cut your clients.</li>
            <li> I been using cheap clippers all my life for my personal care,,its my first time to try this profesional trimmer,,oohhh</li>
            <li> Cuts really close</li>
            <li> I really recommend these.</li>
            <li> Straight out the box</li>
            <li> I took the trimmers apart and there was absolutely nothing I could do to fix them.</li>
            <li> really hope this product that I got was defective.</li>
            <li> cuts  very well just a bit noisy</li>
            <li> Really like this product for the price</li>
            <li> I paid $50+ for such a cheap quality item.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are very reliable too.</li>
            <li> You really get to know a company if there is a hiccup in the process.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a barber that specializes in fades you really have no business buying these trimmers.</li>
            <li> Learn as much as you can before buying one.  </li>
            <li> shipped item fast.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom who&#x27;s in barber school and really wanted these.</li>
            <li> After spending way too much time researching a trimmer I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well once you adjust the blade the power and the tension screw.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to every guy out there looking for a very close shave</li>
            <li> Not as close as I like, but very close.  </li>
            <li> I will say I use this trimmer with the combination of the Wahl 5-Star Shaver to get a really close shave as a razor.  </li>
            <li> My old Andis finally broke and I had it for many years.</li>
            <li> I was excited to open them and use them in the salon today.</li>
            <li> This buzzer is exactly what I was looking for…Real close shave for the whole face, but def soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> A pretty good edger and dry shaver that leaves little to no stubble.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful and can be adjusted to make out-lining extremely precise and skin tight.</li>
            <li> Just as described these work great for my every other day shave very sharp and cuts well would recommend to a friend or family</li>
            <li> On my previous model, I was able to unscrew the blades and align the cut as close as 0mm.  </li>
            <li> However, there is no doubt in its ability to get the job done; a classic barber tool.</li>
            <li> Just bought this and sure enough 31 days later it literally fell apart on my vanity counter while trying to trim my moustache.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for the sole purpose of touching up my hair on the sideburns and back of the neck</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a calm by-the-speed-limit driver buying &amp; giving a corvette a bad review knowing they should have bought a car more suitable for their driving needs.  </li>
            <li> then I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for some trimmers...</li>
            <li> The blade can be a little better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this thing 3 stars not because its a bad trimmer, in fact this may be one of the best trimmers out there.</li>
            <li> but seems very well made and professional.</li>
            <li> the andis works great but the cover came with a crack which made me a littel sad</li>
            <li> so I use them everyday many times a day.</li>
            <li> I guess with magnetic motors that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok, not the worst trimmers I&#x27;ve used, but definitely far from the best!</li>
            <li> The Styliner II is relatively quiet, stays cool, and produces a professionally groomed result.</li>
            <li> Just like an old country western quick draw.</li>
            <li> The cut won&#x27;t be as low, but it&#x27;ll be low enough, and if you use the right after shave moisturizer/lotion (I highly recommend Axe Shield Face hydrator, sold on amazon and at Target), then you&#x27;ll be smooth</li>
            <li> Way more solid and powerful than the usual consumer-marketed trimmers.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> I used to have to replace my trimmers with new ones about twice a year because they would burn out.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the box is brand new</li>
            <li> I just bay a new one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say besides try them out if you&#x27;re looking for a new addition to you clipper selection.</li>
            <li> I like the new design and updated power button except, the direction of the on/off switch.</li>
            <li> After inspecting the product, it appeared to be new and there were no signs of hair in the packaging.</li>
            <li> I received a brand new replacement the day after I sent the RMA.  </li>
            <li> If your a new barber, at home here &amp; there barber, or non-buzz cut barber</li>
            <li> This new model has an \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; blade head that has the blades screwed together.  </li>
            <li> Even today they still live up to the Andis&#x27; reputation of quality.</li>
            <li> It leaves smooth precise lines and my clients has not experienced and cuts on scrapes from the styliner II.</li>
            <li> I am sure this will last me a long time and makes my daily routine much faster.</li>
            <li> He also has very sensitive skin, prone to bumps</li>
            <li> The first one I got a tiny piece of the corner of the blade broke off, but Amazon switched it out without any hassles for a new one.</li>
            <li> The only time I had to re-order this was because I dropped my first one and broke the plastic around the blade.</li>
            <li> First of all this trimmwr must be set correctly look up on YouTube the proper way to set this do not touch tension screw aka</li>
            <li> M3 gets hot, is heavier, &amp; double in price.  </li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to shave my head and face, usually I do both once every week or two, mostly because I&#x27;m lazy, it cuts very close without burning my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any bumps or cuts, easy to take care of and use.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that gives me the clean cut without the bumps for ten plus years now.</li>
            <li> The Styliner II gives a sharp clean cut all around.</li>
            <li> I needed  new trimmers because I dropped the old pair and broke them.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t able to adjust my blades pretty much leaving these useless to me, so I emailed amazon and was promptly shipped out a new pair with upgraded shipping ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s choppy and seems to get stuck and catch on my skin/hair easily easily.</li>
            <li> So, I did a small survey of my own, watching U-Tube videos of barbers who rated several types of trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing, I have a ton of clippers and hair products and this is one of my favorites, I use it to trim down my beard before shaving because my hair is coarse.</li>
            <li> Smooth, light, doesn&#x27;t get hot (of course after an hour of cutting, it should be though),</li>
            <li> I am a black male and so are most of my customers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t overheat, super sharp and precision blades.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful and close trimming razor, one that I enjoyed using twice before it failed on</li>
            <li> The most smooth close cutting clippers i have evered owned</li>
            <li> I like andis professional style</li>
            <li> I have had my andi Professional trimmers for over 8 yrs now.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hair dresser</li>
            <li> So much so that this is the only trimmer I&#x27;ve used since I was 16.  </li>
            <li> He is 2 year and 7 month old.</li>
            <li> So the old blades I had cannot be used.</li>
            <li> When I received the trimmer, it did in fact match his old trimmer and the one on the andis website, but it did not look like the photo shown here</li>
            <li> its almost as if they came with old blades....</li>
            <li> go completely bald&lt;</li>
            <li> now it make a loud noise.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least a dozen cheaper trimmers through the years and some were ok</li>
            <li> and they are already making loud noises.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least a dozen cheaper trimmers through the years and some were ok</li>
            <li> These clippers were so loud that I had to return them.  </li>
            <li> just so I could measure just how AMAZINGLY LOUD these clippers were.    </li>
            <li> I had to get used to it compared to my old one.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anybody whether it is for home use or professional use.</li>
            <li> I work in a busy barber shop</li>
            <li> This product is not meant to give you a completely shaved look.</li>
            <li> But if you have some basic trimming skills, you can trim your beard very well with this product.</li>
            <li> My earlier trimmers with batteries were damaged very soon so this product with a cable to the power plug is a welcoming change.</li>
            <li> Better than anything I&#x27;ve used in the past!</li>
            <li> It has not left any gash marks or major blemishes on my skin, and still manages to give a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews say that clippers get real hot, are heavy, or just do not cut well.</li>
            <li> Then after 4 months, the following things happened which, overall, make this a pretty crappy product in my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend to all Barbers and regular people alike</li>
            <li> , I like how close it cuts and it&#x27;s wide enough to cover a lot of space quickly.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about price as it was not my primary consideration but</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory long term service.</li>
            <li> This trimmer/styliner is exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed because I liked these trimmers and they were working really well at first.  </li>
            <li> The style liners are a strong, smooth cutting clipper, but not very sharp compared to the outliners and hero&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Then when I ordered a replacement, the new version was built differently with a blade that was screw on/off rather than pull off.</li>
            <li> New one seems destined to provide similar service.</li>
            <li> Has long as you keep it clean, last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair, I usually do not drop my clippers like that but even if you drop your trimmers like the peanut or detailers they dont shatter like these styliner 2s do...</li>
            <li> This product is user friendly, quiet, little or no vibration.</li>
            <li> The Styliner II does not get hot, is lightweight, cuts sharp with ease and is sleek looking.  </li>
            <li> unlike some of the other machines it doesn&#x27;t get hot</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this one that finally broke I bought it back in 2000</li>
            <li> If you keep it lubricated and away from rust, you&#x27;ll enjoy this dull looking trimmer for years.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for any trimming and especially for those of use that use it to shave vs. traditional razors.</li>

            <li> The only dislike I had was when it started making a really loud zinging noise, but to stop that you have to tighten the screw with a flathead.</li>
            <li> no nicks but cuts close enough that my wife saw the cut and noticed it was considerably closer</li>
            <li> This new version is the total opposite.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m black.</li>
            <li> I almost cut my skin raking it so hard to cut the hair on my neck to give myself a clean shapeup..</li>
            <li> They can create a crispy edge up nearly as fast as the other two trimmers named.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is fast and sharp, I use it instead of shaving to avoid shaving rash.</li>
            <li> It is a great clipper but terrible that I had to purchase another blade right away.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t too expensive and they don&#x27;t get hot quick at all.</li>
            <li> guy is heavy duty and does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> And to make matters worse, one of the screws became easily stripped so</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected, brand new just like it&#x27;s listed.</li>
            <li> I had to sign for it which was unnecessary but the product was fine.</li>
            <li> It is pretty heavy compared to the grey t-outliners.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s heavy but heavy means good quality and very fast cutting speed.  </li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s heavy but heavy means good quality and very fast cutting speed.</li>
            <li> I can only shave with these trimmers due to razor bumps and sensitive skin on my face and head.</li>
            <li> Not cool, New version,SUCK</li>
            <li> Ive had a few buzzers lately and none gets as close as easily.</li>
            <li> I find it very difficult to cut someone or yourself using it (unlike the T-Outliner &amp; Outliner II).It is also lighter than the Outliners and does not get as hot as quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a big fanatic of Andis, their products are well built, very durable and would last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and decided the rechargeables didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> ANDIS STYLINER PRODUCTS ALWAYS LAST FOR THE LONG HAUL!</li>
            <li> and the motor will hopefully last as long as my boyfriends has!</li>
            <li> I was using the Andis T-edger for years but didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I purchased the Andis Professional 26700 Styliner II Personal Trimmer.</li>
            <li> This last one only worked for its first use now broken.</li>
            <li> I bing using this cliper for a long time.</li>
            <li> They lost a long time.</li>
            <li> They are of sturdy construction and the cord is long.</li>
            <li> I use them every 2-4 weeks(depending on how long I want to grow my hair out).</li>
            <li> I wish I had stopped wasting money on cheaper trimmers long ago.</li>
            <li> The first one I received was broken, and the second one worked for about 2 months before the motor started sounding like a tractor.  </li>
            <li> I have only had to buy new blades when they get dull.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the activation switch seems reversed and a little awkward to use but otherwise great.</li>
            <li> ; as long as he likes it, I like it!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day to shave my entire face.  </li>
            <li> In terms of cutting ability, it  has done an excellent job for my lineups (without cutting the skin).</li>
            <li> The factory set offset is perfect for cutting closely without danger of cutting the client.</li>
            <li> , i use it on the daily and hasnt let me down.</li>
            <li> In addition the price was less than what i pay at local retailers.</li>
            <li> Had the other for so long until the motor burned out.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that they were a little quieter.</li>
            <li> I tried several trimmers I found at Wal-mart, but I had to press firmly and repeatedly using them</li>
            <li> Trimmer is made of heavy duty plastic and is smaller than it looks.</li>
            <li> The blades that came with them didn&#x27;t last but a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because I got tired of my Wahl hero&#x27;s, which I didn&#x27;t care for too much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut as well as expected</li>
            <li> I use it to close shave my head everyday and the blades just aren&#x27;t close enough.  </li>
            <li> I have went through a number of clippers over the past few years, using everything from beard trimmers to other well respected clippers (Oster Fast Feed was ineffective as a balding clipper and stopped working in less than a year).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it, and gave it a 3 star rating only because the device failed on me after 2 times of use.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY and moving on to a new brand!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even cut as close as the other Andis.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t run hit like my other andis clippers.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t cut the edges Sharp.</li>
            <li> This razor is extremely sharp after zero blading.</li>
            <li> In other words, they aren&#x27;t adjustable.    </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t do (due to mechanical changes in manufacture) what I needed it to.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s if you go against the grain, or in other words, against the direction that your hair grows.</li>
            <li> With this Andis trimmer, I got professional results without having to press down hard and it took up less of my time to get line-ups done.</li>
            <li> Use it for personal grooming, and definitely has decreased the rate of ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> This product, if you want it to, will cut your hair down very very low and give you a REAL TIGHT shape-up (or line-up, as they say in other parts of the US, bleh).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little rough on the skin and just doesn&#x27;t do the job too well in the end.    </li>
            <li> While each of those are a bit easier to use, it all comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> Shave WITH the grain, in the direction of your hair growth, from your face all the way down to your throat, if you want to prevent razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I will still be using my Norelco for trimming the length of my beard but the styliner is going to keep me looking sharp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other trimmers on here to compare and tried to save a little money but</li>
            <li> The trimmer looked to have been previously opened.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the fact that this cost less then the andid t outliner line.</li>
            <li> Maybe this isn&#x27;t for lining black men&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This model, slightly upgraded, does not...    </li>
            <li> I was seriously tempted to tear the package open again,</li>
            <li> After using these less than a week a corner of the blade broke off.</li>
            <li> Also you need to have your hair trimmed down fairly tight or these will get hung up which hurts.  </li>
            <li> The only complain that I have is that it vibrates a lot and after a while you get this funny feeling in your hand due to its violent vibrations</li>
            <li> clippers have a few sharp spots where they bit a little.</li>
            <li> Got this as a father&#x27;s day gift from my little brother</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to very well but think I would prefer one with a cutting height attachment.</li>
            <li> Andis Outliner, Oster T-finisher, Wahl 5 star detailer to name a few.</li>
            <li> I tried this product a few days ago after receiving it and it DID NOT cut as close as it says it does.</li>
            <li> After looking online, I noted a few sites where it was acknowledged as one of the hardest blades to adjust in the business.  </li>
            <li> Too heavy.</li>
            <li> This thing was described as a professional tool, but it started making random shrieking noises during use around the time it was no longer returnable.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was dead on arrival.</li>
            <li> Use everyday and limits razor bumps too</li>
            <li> It lasted just a few days</li>
            <li> It occasionally gives out odd sounds if I hold it the wrong way.</li>
            <li> The design look dull and old in comparison to the flashy trimmers that are out on the market, BUT at the end of the day, you need this to keep you looking like</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 different blades but both are the same bad experience.</li>
            <li> If any one gave this trimmer a bad review, they really don&#x27;t know how to use it.  </li>
            <li> The buzzer started vibrating violently as if the the motor inside was too powerful.</li>
            <li> I am so annoyed with this product and the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m not highly impressed</li>
            <li> Not sure whether you are sending defective trimmers...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this trimmers especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way.  </li>
            <li> I have used these edgers professionally, they are bad to bite or scrape a patron on cleaning the neck or around the ears.</li>
            <li> One slow glide and done.</li>
            <li> His beard grows in thick and he likes the trimmer for shaving his face.  </li>
            <li> So I will say recommend this Trimmer for all the brothas with thick beards.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down for Andis, but Amazon rocks!!!</li>
            <li> (I have not changed the default power settings which in itself is a little weird with a screw to rotate).</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself runs fairly quiet, vibration isn&#x27;t too bad, and it cuts close without ever catching/pulling your hair or skin.</li>
            <li> The blades at the end are so sharp they started cutting into the skin as soon as you apply the slightest pressure when you move it along side your neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kaput, broken,</li>
            <li> Andis stands behind their products without hesitation.</li>
            <li> but they should not have broken like that.</li>
            <li> Got tired of paying a barber for what I could be doing myself.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after being frustrated with not getting sharp lines with any wireless trimmers that I had bought over the years.</li>
            <li> I sent an email to the seller and they never had the common courtesy to respond!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend these, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Andis trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I used it only 10 times and one day during shave its blade fell apart dangerously, I am shocked !!</li>
            <li> unfortunately I can not return it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong and you won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I recieved a weak or faulty trimmer, but I am very very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when it eventually goes out of alignment, and they all do at some point, adjusting it turns out to be nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> As a Blackman who suffers from razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> He uses it all the time when cutting hair.</li>
            <li> These clippers are heavy and terrible!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for over 15 years</li>
            <li> Without cutting me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard, cutting my hair and shaving with clippers since the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It will be your go-to trimmer when all else fails!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how bad this thing is, but that&#x27;s my experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a bad experience.</li>
            <li> Do not go by any bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too painful to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so annoying.  </li>
            <li> I am SO frustrated!</li>
            <li> Seller has been horrible to work with.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> they work great and I have not had great liners in awhile.</li>
            <li> NO COMPLAINTS! WORKS PERFECTLY FINE! ANDIS STYLINER PRODUCTS ALWAYS LAST FOR THE LONG HAUL! WE WILL BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the purchase. I&#x27;ve used it before and it gives a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Styliner II for months now and I can say it&#x27;s a great trimmer. It gives me a close shave and doesn&#x27;t get hot at all from my experience with it. I recommend this to anybody looking for a good quality trimmer, a close shave, and a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t get hot after just minutes of usage like some others do.</li>
            <li> Andis hair trimmers are some of the best made. i have used them for years with no problems. i have used others but they do not cut as good as Andis!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this trimmer-it does everything I expected it to do without any problem.  I am not sure about price as it was not my primary consideration but a brief review indicated that the price was fair,</li>
            <li> My barber using these exact clippers on his customers and cuts really good so i decided to buy a pair. The clippers cut really close and precise. Great for lineups and tapers. Cuts really close and I didn&#x27;t have to adjust them. I really recommend these.</li>
            <li> I like andis professional style I I cause my bump the hair is nice cool!! Than bumper razor is problems</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer mainly because it is the most gentle that I&#x27;ve used. I find it very difficult to cut someone or yourself using it (unlike the T-Outliner &amp; Outliner II).It is also lighter than the Outliners and does not get as hot as quickly. The only dislike I had was when it started making a really loud zinging noise, but to stop that you have to tighten the screw with a flathead. It is a great trimmer, very hard to cut skin with, and does not get hot quickly...I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really love these things. I have been using them for years and will continue to use them for many more to come.</li>
            <li> Andis are supposed to be cream of the crop products but in my experience they&#x27;re not.  I&#x27;ve had two Pivot Pro (each one lasted about one year) and after the second one&#x27;s blade actually broke I decided to get a different one.  The clerk at Sally Beauty Supply recommended the Styliner II so I got that one.  It has been a nightmare ever since.  My wife trims my head every 2 weeks with it and she needs to adjust the calibration screw 4 or 5 times during the cut.  It&#x27;s just so annoying.  It&#x27;s also a little rough on the skin and just doesn&#x27;t do the job too well in the end.    I may have gotten a defective unit but I didn&#x27;t return it to the store in time so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  Still 0 out of 3 Andis machines is enough for me to move to a different brand so I ordered myself a Wahl Peanut to see how it does.</li>
            <li> Good but extremely loud.</li>
            <li> I have had my andi Professional trimmers for over 8 yrs now. Have never had a problem with them. I have only had to buy new blades when they get dull. I am a professional hair dresser so I use them everyday many times a day. I first purchased them when I worked at Ft.Sill at the barber shop. I would at time shave over 100 heads in a day with these. I love them. I used to have to replace my trimmers with new ones about twice a year because they would burn out. Going on over 8 years with these. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> clippers have a few sharp spots where they bit a little. but seems very well made and professional.</li>
            <li> Very good Styliner.Good job</li>
            <li> Love using this. Better than anything I&#x27;ve used in the past! Has long as you keep it clean, last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It will be your go-to trimmer when all else fails! It is in its DNA not to disappoint you, and mines haven&#x27;t even after 3 years of daily usage... if you take good care of it. The design look dull and old in comparison to the flashy trimmers that are out on the market, BUT at the end of the day, you need this to keep you looking like you just walk out of the barber&#x27;s chair. This trimmer can give you a smooth shave, a very nice lined up beard or shape up. Great for mustache, under the chin and neck area, especially if you want to avoid in grown hair. You won&#x27;t need to keep shaving the same area over and over and over again. One slow glide and done. The power is amazing and it runs very quietly, If you keep it lubricated and away from rust, you&#x27;ll enjoy this dull looking trimmer for years.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU CAN GET OVER THE LOOK AND THE DESIGN OF IT, THE FUNCTIONALITY IS TOP NOTCH! HANDS DOWN THE BEST FUNCTIONAL TRIMMER YOUR GIRLFRIEND WON&#x27;T BUY FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to shave my head and face, usually I do both once every week or two, mostly because I&#x27;m lazy, it cuts very close without burning my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any bumps or cuts, easy to take care of and use.  I&#x27;ve used all kinds of other trimmers to shave my head as well as razors and this one seems to be the best option, I like how close it cuts and it&#x27;s wide enough to cover a lot of space quickly.</li>
            <li> What can I say about these trimmers? They are NOT the lightest trimmer available. They are NOT the most maneuverable trimmer available. They vibrate like hell, they&#x27;re a nightmare to adjust the blades, and the housing isn&#x27;t the most durable. So why, you ask me, would I give it 5 stars? THEY WORK. In my honest opinion, once you&#x27;ve gotten used to all the drawbacks this trimmer has, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a better edger out there. I&#x27;ve used a bunch of edgers. Andis Outliner, Oster T-finisher, Wahl 5 star detailer to name a few. While each of those are a bit easier to use, it all comes down to preference. Some bikers prefer Ducatis. Others Harley-Davidson. This trimmer, to most, may be an acquired taste. However, there is no doubt in its ability to get the job done; a classic barber tool.</li>
            <li> Quickly gets my edges lined up as nicely as the barber shop. I tried several trimmers I found at Wal-mart, but I had to press firmly and repeatedly using them and they still didn&#x27;t give me the precise edges I was looking for. With this Andis trimmer, I got professional results without having to press down hard and it took up less of my time to get line-ups done.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re shipped to me very quickly and they work great!</li>
            <li> I bought this after being frustrated with not getting sharp lines with any wireless trimmers that I had bought over the years. I have tried Norelco, Wahl, Remington, Phillips and others. What I realized is that none of those are made for shaping fine lines on beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guy is heavy duty and does exactly what I wanted. Blades are super sharp and nice quality. Trimmer is made of heavy duty plastic and is smaller than it looks. Operation wise Its quite when tuned correctly but there is a bit of vibration when operating. I guess with magnetic motors that&#x27;s normal. Adjustment screw is metal which is a good thing since the cheap plastic screw tend to get damaged over the years. I am sure this will last me a long time and makes my daily routine much faster. I will still be using my Norelco for trimming the length of my beard but the styliner is going to keep me looking sharp!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the trimmers I received.  They were exactly what I wanted.  We have used these trimmers in our salon for years. They were in original package and were brand new. I have used them already and they are performing great.  Andis Styliner is a great trimmer and Amazon shipped them quickly and on time.</li>
            <li> Hard to adjust perfectly, doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as the 000 blade on my Andis clippers.</li>
            <li> Just bought this and sure enough 31 days later it literally fell apart on my vanity counter while trying to trim my moustache.  It&#x27;s kaput, broken, junk.  Would be nice if seller would email me and offer a refund!!</li>
            <li> Ive had andis outliner T switch blades from II to T.. ihad the same clippers for about 8-9 years no problem only oil and change blade.. there the top choice of pro!!!!  outliner? or styliner? the styliners were good too had the before i got my OTs</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get my two year warranty which I paid for??????</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. I use it as a replacement for my razor and it never irritates my skin. You should buy the lubricator/cleanser to help maintain it.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and this trimmer works smoothly and does the job! I definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Andis trimmers.  I can only shave with these trimmers due to razor bumps and sensitive skin on my face and head. So much so that this is the only trimmer I&#x27;ve used since I was 16.  I&#x27;ve tried others they just don&#x27;t come close to this line and style.  Smooth, light, doesn&#x27;t get hot (of course after an hour of cutting, it should be though), no nicks but cuts close enough that my wife saw the cut and noticed it was considerably closer and my face was smoother.  I did mention she&#x27;s 29 weeks pregnant right, so she notices EVERYTHING!!  I&#x27;ve bought other trimmers on here to compare and tried to save a little money but as they say, you get what you pay for.  Spend wisely as these are an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Good product. But I bought this one for my kid and it is kind of too big to trim his hair. He is 2 year and 7 month old.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; does amazing lineups!  My babe has great facial hair that he maintains himself &amp; these give him that great line he is so meticulous about. He even lined up my son before picture day!  Good investment &amp; my man is HAPPY!</li>
            <li> The motor made a funny noise the first day and you have to shake it to make it stop. While its making that noise if you try to cut hair it will cut you. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a representation of all of the clippers maybe I just got a defected one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great machine since the firts minute you use it help do your work. I must for a hair stailist</li>
            <li> The only reason why I rated these a 4 star was because of the blades. The blades that came with them didn&#x27;t last but a few months. I kept them oiled and cleaned. I replaced them and now they are getting the job done.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. He perfectly lines up our sons with no problem. Learn how to adjust and clean them, perfect cut every time. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;T-Trimmer\\&quot; is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used. Straight out the box this unit is ready to go! Just make sure you oil it after every use.</li>
            <li> My gf bought these for her salon and they did not work. She used the styliners for about three trims the very first week she had them, then the mechanism that moves the blade stopped moving. I took the trimmers apart and there was absolutely nothing I could do to fix them. I have a pair of Andis T-Outliners that always work, so when Amazon let us exchange them we got those instead. Now we both have a pair of trusty T-Outliners. An identical problem happened with her Andis Fade Masters too a couple years ago. Thumbs down for Andis, but Amazon rocks!!!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with these clippers until they died after 4 years of use. I would have hoped for at least a few more years than that. After all, they are used only on my head, not at a barber shop. Then when I ordered a replacement, the new version was built differently with a blade that was screw on/off rather than pull off. So the old blades I had cannot be used. The old version cut smoothly. This new version is the total opposite. It&#x27;s choppy and seems to get stuck and catch on my skin/hair easily easily. I have tried 2 different blades but both are the same bad experience. And to make matters worse, one of the screws became easily stripped so I had to use a special tool to get screw out and blade off. I&#x27;d give zero stars to this if possible.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the sole purpose of touching up my hair on the sideburns and back of the neck (you know, instead of going to the barber once a week). At first it worked really well - cut my hair so close to the skin I might as well have been shaving. Then after 4 months, the following things happened which, overall, make this a pretty crappy product in my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The metal part of the head piece of the buzzer broke off, so now I cant use the side of it (see pic).&lt;br /&gt;2. The buzzer started vibrating violently as if the the motor inside was too powerful. I tried tightening the screws, but nothing helped. The sound it makes is absolutely deafening and thus you can&#x27;t have it on for more than 10 seconds without getting absolutely annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;3. The blades at the end are so sharp they started cutting into the skin as soon as you apply the slightest pressure when you move it along side your neck. It&#x27;s too painful to use and I&#x27;ve tried multiple buzzers before and this shouldn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this product that I got was defective. I can&#x27;t believe how bad this thing is, but that&#x27;s my experience. So stay away if you can!</li>
            <li> I have owned two pair of these clippers, I won&#x27;t own another one. The Andis edgers are nothing like the clippers, which, the Andis clippers are awesome by the way. I have used these edgers professionally, they are bad to bite or scrape a patron on cleaning the neck or around the ears. I use the Oster T-edgers, for professional use they are the best, but, that&#x27;s just my two cents. I don&#x27;t know why I gave it two stars, I guess where I owned 2 of them, I gave each one star.</li>
            <li> I bought  this product after carefully doing my homework on the best product for trimming and outlining hair and this came up. I tried this product a few days ago after receiving it and it DID NOT cut as close as it says it does. I almost cut my skin raking it so hard to cut the hair on my neck to give myself a clean shapeup.. I am so annoyed with this product and the money I spent on it. I sent an email to the seller and they never had the common courtesy to respond!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good clippers cuts close for that clean edge</li>
            <li> I got this 8 months ago to use to trim my beard. At first it was great; I could use it instead of shaving to have a 1-day of growth look (and avoid bumps I get on my neck when shaving with a razor).  Unfortunately, when it eventually goes out of alignment, and they all do at some point, adjusting it turns out to be nearly impossible. Theoretically it can be done, but there are too many pieces to hold onto and to put pressure on in different directions at once to ensure a good cut without the blade teeth poking up and able to cut you. I even bought a product that was supposed to help with this task that you snap the blades into, but it just didn&#x27;t help. After looking online, I noted a few sites where it was acknowledged as one of the hardest blades to adjust in the business.  It&#x27;s still in great shape, but I can&#x27;t get it aligned enough to use it, so I&#x27;m actually going to look for another one.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> As a Blackman who suffers from razor bumps.  This proved to be a great investment.  Worked great.</li>
            <li> the andis works great but the cover came with a crack which made me a littel sad but yeah great outliner</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend to replace the one I dropped and broke (ooops).  I looked on the andis website to find the same trimmer and found out it was the styliner II.  I found it here on Amazon, but ordered it with hesitation since the photo did not match his trimmer or the photo the andis website had.  When I received the trimmer, it did in fact match his old trimmer and the one on the andis website, but it did not look like the photo shown here (it actually looks nicer and more sleek in my opinion).  His beard grows in thick and he likes the trimmer for shaving his face.  It doesn&#x27;t give his as clean of a shave as a razor does, but he likes how it doesn&#x27;t irritate his face.  His friend who is a barber recommended it to him.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with andis styliner 2. It is smooth and somehow it fits perfectly on my hands.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is a barber. He loves it. He uses it all the time when cutting hair. He said &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t get hot like the others ones&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. I had to sign for it which was unnecessary but the product was fine.</li>
            <li> GOOD AND ORIGINAL QUALITY</li>
            <li> Came as promised and at a uch lower price than buying it locally</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok, not the worst trimmers I&#x27;ve used, but definitely far from the best! I think they would be the best if the blade was adjustable.</li>
            <li> I love this andis styliner... Great for shaping my goatee.</li>
            <li> As described.  My only complaint is that the activation switch seems reversed and a little awkward to use but otherwise great.</li>
            <li> I had no idea of what was out there.  So, I did a small survey of my own, watching U-Tube videos of barbers who rated several types of trimmers.  The Andis trimmer was mentioned in several well done presentations.  It was an easy decision from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks to all the barbers who took the time to opine on trimmer preference.</li>
            <li> I been using cheap clippers all my life for my personal care,,its my first time to try this profesional trimmer,,oohhh what a difference,,it does alot better clean cut in a less time.DONT HESITATE GO FOR IT.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because I got tired of my Wahl hero&#x27;s, which I didn&#x27;t care for too much. The style liners are a strong, smooth cutting clipper, but not very sharp compared to the outliners and hero&#x27;s. They can create a crispy edge up nearly as fast as the other two trimmers named. I prefer the outliners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but would have been better if it cuts a bit closer. It eventually cuts close enough after u stroke so very many times. If I knew where to go, I would have taken mine to see if they can set the blades to cut a bit closer.</li>
            <li> love em, good ol andis~!</li>
            <li> stopped working one week after receiving</li>
            <li> My boys use this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Too heavy. Didn&#x27;t cut as well as expected</li>
            <li> Very very good trimmer. Bought it for close to a year now and i enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Got it on time works great!!</li>
            <li> These clippers are heavy and terrible!! I have adjusted them over and over again and just cant seem to get a good cut....its almost as if they came with old blades....</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Effortless to use&lt;br /&gt;Cuts evenly&lt;br /&gt;Leaves that perfect \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; look&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cut your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go completely bald&lt;br /&gt;Not cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;Best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair to save on barber costs and this product is great. I need close crops and even shave my scalp and use this. Andis is just the best on the market and even professional barbers use it as well</li>
            <li> Great product!  Provides a good shave....performs edging alright.  Overall - good purchase for price from Amazon.  I would reccomend this item at this price point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this thing 3 stars not because its a bad trimmer, in fact this may be one of the best trimmers out there. I have tried them all. It is excellent for shapeups but the problem i have is within the motor. If you drop these things once it is done! I dropped mine and replaced the blade after it broke and it will not cut at all. This is my second pair, I usually do not drop my clippers like that but even if you drop your trimmers like the peanut or detailers they dont shatter like these styliner 2s do...other than that its a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the box is brand new and it looks good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  Its working line a charm. Good for edging and design work. Provides crispy clean lines! No complaints!</li>
            <li> cuts  very well just a bit noisy</li>
            <li> This thing was described as a professional tool, but it started making random shrieking noises during use around the time it was no longer returnable. Sure wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again, for what that&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The first one I received was broken, and the second one worked for about 2 months before the motor started sounding like a tractor.  Waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t even cut as close as the other Andis.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the quality of the product. I thought I was buying from amazon, but it turned out I purchased from a third party. The trimmer looked to have been previously opened. It was very clean so I figured just the box was opened or something. Upon trying to use it I cut my head!  I contracted andis who told me I had to return it to the seller. Seller has been horrible to work with. I will be gilding a claim with amazon today.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and he says it gave him the best and smoothest shave in a long time. He also has very sensitive skin, prone to bumps and this did not cause that, so I think it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> This trimmer gives a clean good shave but it vibrates a little too much as a matter of expectation. Good product tho and will recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, who cuts his own hair, and he absolutely loves it! Says it works great and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It was the best choice.... it was a No brained to go with that clipper best of the best Yes...</li>
            <li> This buzzer is exactly what I was looking for…Real close shave for the whole face, but def soft on the skin. Runs smooth and shaves smooth and easy. Ive had a few buzzers lately and none gets as close as easily. Andis is is the way to go...</li>
            <li> I used it about 4-5 times and it already broke. all it does now it make a loud noise. blades don&#x27;t move. I wont be buying anything else here</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer out there!  Doesn&#x27;t overheat, super sharp and precision blades. Don&#x27;t let the fact that this cost less then the andid t outliner line. It&#x27;s way better. You don&#x27;t even need to set the blad! !</li>
            <li> Great buy for trimming your hair around ear, liner on back.  Much much better better than cordless. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> CUTS GREAT AND SMOOTH AND ALWAYS STAY COOL NO HEATING UP</li>
            <li> Just as described these work great for my every other day shave very sharp and cuts well would recommend to a friend or family</li>
            <li> Really like this product for the price you cqnt beat it! Came brand new in the box and beeb working excellent since opened and started using!</li>
            <li> I bought the styliner II and Andis 5 Star trimmer at the same time. The styliner II&#x27;s were a but bulky for a trimmer and takes some getting used to. Also out of the box I had to get the blades sharpened and shortly thereafter I zero gapped them. I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for over 15 years and I&#x27;m a huge fan of Andis products (I already own the Andis Master, T Edjer, and T Outliner). Overall I&#x27;m not highly impressed but perhaps after some getting used to I may change my mind. If you&#x27;re choosing between the 5 Star and Styliner II - go with the 5 Star they are the truth.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, I&#x27;m a prefessional barber and this machine cuts nice and clean every time great for shape ups and bald fades.</li>
            <li> Good clippers but plan on making several adjustments to get rid of the loud vibration noise.  Also you need to have your hair trimmed down fairly tight or these will get hung up which hurts.  I learned that the hard way.  Mostly my fault but a warning in the manual would have been appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again.  :)</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve been a Wahl fan; since many of my professional hair stylist friends persuaded me otherwise, I decided to give Andis a shot.  This is a powerful and close trimming razor, one that I enjoyed using twice before it failed on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a professional, solid, quality feel to it and the blades are extremely easy to keep clean.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it, and gave it a 3 star rating only because the device failed on me after 2 times of use.</li>
            <li> The blade in this shaver does quite a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is smooth and not too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> Is the best ! I bing using this cliper for a long time. More the  20 years. So when it needs to be remplasement I just bay a new one.</li>
            <li> This is my first time every trying to use a styliner, the styliner itself doesn&#x27;t heat up after 15min of use, however the blade does.  If you don&#x27;t have quick hands, this might be an issue for you.  It occasionally gives out odd sounds if I hold it the wrong way.</li>
            <li> This product is user friendly, quiet, little or no vibration. would recommend to anyone for daily usage. Excellent  product value for money</li>
            <li> I use about once a week to edge up my beard. Its works just like you would expect it to.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer doesn&#x27;t get hot, quiet workhorse !!</li>
            <li> As most who have bought this trimmer, I use it to shave with because I cannot shave close with a regular or electric razor because it causes ingrown hairs and breakouts.  This trimmer is a miracle for me.  I have tried at least a dozen cheaper trimmers through the years and some were ok but none cut this close or were as quick to use.  Yes it&#x27;s heavy but heavy means good quality and very fast cutting speed.  I would highly recommend this for any trimming and especially for those of use that use it to shave vs. traditional razors.</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews, and brought it a month ago. I used it only 10 times and one day during shave its blade fell apart dangerously, I am shocked !! I don&#x27;t see any screw came out of it, so technically there is no way I can put it back.&lt;br /&gt; I paid $50+ for such a cheap quality item. Now its already passed a month limit, so  unfortunately I can not return it. I will never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I buy one of these every 7 years. Works great.</li>
            <li> Clippers are well made, quiet, good selection of guides for different hair lengths and side trimming, etc. smaller clipper is excellent</li>
            <li> Got this as a father&#x27;s day gift from my little brother and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  Good quality and strong motor. Thanks joel!</li>
            <li> I just used this to edge my husband&#x27;s haircut.  It cuts so close and gives a clean finish.  Is quiet and does a nice job.  It beats the Wahl I had been using.</li>
            <li> Great for children and adults my son&#x27;s edge up was so crispy with these andis with a gentle blade, they came to me set close so I didn&#x27;t have to set the blade, I highly recommend to all Barbers and regular people alike</li>
            <li> Worked well out of the box!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome trimmer. I own three different Andis clippers and I use this one specifically for balding out my head before fading. The trimmer itself runs fairly quiet, vibration isn&#x27;t too bad, and it cuts close without ever catching/pulling your hair or skin. The build quality is solid and the unit itself is all plastic (except for the blade of course). I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this trimmer running hot either. I really like how smooth this clipper glides effortlessly. If you&#x27;re looking for a good trimmer for removing the bulk of hair on the sides and back of your head then I would highly recommend this trimmer. These trimmers are very reliable too. They lost a long time. The only time I had to re-order this was because I dropped my first one and broke the plastic around the blade.</li>
            <li> This is my shaver for years, if you are a brother that is plagued with shaving bumps with a close shave this is your solution.  This is the only product I have found that gives me the clean cut without the bumps for ten plus years now.</li>
            <li> These are Great trimmers out of the box, hits sharp but not enough to cut your clients. It is pretty heavy compared to the grey t-outliners.</li>
            <li> Worked as described. I don&#x27;t know what else to say besides try them out if you&#x27;re looking for a new addition to you clipper selection.</li>
            <li> I got these to replace my t outliners that have get too hot when I&#x27;m shaving my face and head.  These clippers are a smoother cut, and they don&#x27;t give me any irritation on my face.  They also don&#x27;t run hit like my other andis clippers.  My only wish is that they were a little quieter.</li>
            <li> First of all this trimmwr must be set correctly look up on YouTube the proper way to set this do not touch tension screw aka the top screw bottom two screws  will adjust to set the blade flush</li>
            <li> Excellent product  would suggest this over other clippers</li>
            <li> Out of the box it does not cut close. But this trimmer can be adjusted to any amount of closeness you desire. It took me time but now I zeroed in on how close I need the blade to give me that barber trim line I want.  Without cutting me. WITHOUT using a RAZOR.  It&#x27;s all about adjusting the blade.  5 screws.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this model for the last 25 years and after I discovered blades could be adjusted to provide an even closer shave I refuse to use a razor on my face. In addition the price was less than what i pay at local retailers.</li>
            <li> Excellent set of clippers</li>
            <li> wish it came with guards</li>
            <li> I was telling my barber how I would always cut myself on the neck &amp; mustache areas when shaving with a regular blade. He then advised me to buy this trimmer. I find it very powerful, and it gives a very close shave (i would say that it leaves about 0.1 mm of beard). Overall, it gets the job done pretty well, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Once blade is adjusted it works wonders I love these things I will never go to a different brand I must admit I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> The holy grail of trimmers!! They don&#x27;t get any better than this! I will definitely recommend these, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I just purchased these in May and they are already making loud noises. I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it out and loosening the screws and it&#x27;s still screaming at me.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is AWSOME.  I bought this trimmer to trim my hair and mustache and this cevice cuts great.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it on someone else.  Oh, and the price is good as well.  I recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this one that finally broke I bought it back in 2000 so i got my moneys worth, and this one works just as good as the older model I get ingrown hairs on my beard and use this to give me a great shave without any fear of razor bumps</li>
            <li> I like the new design and updated power button except, the direction of the on/off switch. It&#x27;s in reverse which I don&#x27;t like and I have to get use too. Sleek and powerful to cut the skin, smooth and cool running motor, best tool to have when doing shape-ups. I see the barbers use it all the time when giving line-up&#x27;s so I had to get one. You can&#x27;t go wrong and you won&#x27;t regret buying it. Trust me!</li>
            <li> works very good. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this share.</li>
            <li> I went with this brand because the Wahl brand had too many complaints of the product being used. After inspecting the product, it appeared to be new and there were no signs of hair in the packaging. Of course I cleaned it with alcohol just to make sure. In terms of cutting ability, it  has done an excellent job for my lineups (without cutting the skin). It also gives a close shave without the irritation of a regular electric razor.</li>
            <li> Good buzzer for styling beards. I use it to line up my beard, it&#x27;s very easy and gives a real close cut.</li>
            <li> Strong andis trimmer, precise and sharp.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmers. Clean lines and very powerful for fading and dry shaving. I would definitely recommend to any stylist, barber or a man doing his own grooming at home. I have had many over 30 years and this will be my go to every time. LOVE</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Andis Trimmer I purchased in the last year that has malfunctioned within a very short time. This last one only worked for its first use now broken. NOT HAPPY and moving on to a new brand!</li>
            <li> This trimmer/styliner is exactly what I wanted and expected. I can not envision another trimmer/styliner that will exceed the performance of this of the &amp;#34;ANDIS II&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t cut the edges Sharp.</li>
            <li> Works great. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Great clippers!!!! Low noise, perfect for edging and detailing.</li>
            <li> Not disappointing! The trimmer has a great feel in quality, balanced in weight, and provides a close in dry shave.</li>
            <li> My trimmer arrived DOA.  Would not power on.  My first inclination was to contact Amazon because of their stellar return poilcy.  But the trimmer&#x27;s documentation had in bold lettering, &amp;#34;If you experience any problems with our product DO NOT return to place of purchase.&amp;#34;  So I called the toll-free number.  I emailed them a copy of my Amazon order and they sent me a prepaid shipping label for the RMA.  I boxed up the defective product and dropped it at my local UPS Store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andis didn&#x27;t wait to receive the returned product.  I received a brand new replacement the day after I sent the RMA.  The trimmer works great!  My goatee looks like a million bux.  You really get to know a company if there is a hiccup in the process.  Andis stands behind their products without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of product from Andis and the quality is always consistent. I&#x27;ve never had a bad experience. This a brand you can definitely trust.</li>
            <li> As an appretice barber it is always best to start out with good quality materials that will lend to perfecting your skills.&lt;br /&gt;These trimmers are a great asset.</li>
            <li> I have went through a number of clippers over the past few years, using everything from beard trimmers to other well respected clippers (Oster Fast Feed was ineffective as a balding clipper and stopped working in less than a year).  I had been in search of a go-to balding clipper to shave my head as close as possible and finally decided on this product after reading a number of reviews.  So far I have been very impressed with the performance of this product.  It gives a close, clean shave and is extremely smooth and easy to handle.  It has not left any gash marks or major blemishes on my skin, and still manages to give a very close shave.  One thing to keep in mind is that it is not adjustable, so it is best for lining, shaping, and shaving.</li>
            <li> Good price arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Good, but I did not see the T- Blade included inside the box. According to the package extra T- Blade is included. Urgent reply is needed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as it should for the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for about 2 years now. They are of sturdy construction and the cord is long. These clippers do not do the job they are made for. It gives you a close shave but I need a trimmer that is made for lining and designs in hair of all types. I am a black male and so are most of my customers. Maybe this isn&#x27;t for lining black men&#x27;s hair. That&#x27;s why I only give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> It is a great trimmer, only noisy.  I need to have a certain power level in order to give myself a good clean cut, but at that power level, it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product my husband like this product..</li>
            <li> I never trimmed myself up before, but I&#x27;m going away for college soon and I needed to learn eventually. These were perfect to start off with. The Styliner II gives a sharp clean cut all around. They weren&#x27;t too expensive and they don&#x27;t get hot quick at all. I use them every 2-4 weeks(depending on how long I want to grow my hair out). Haven&#x27;t failed me yet. It also shipped out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for a year now and love every bit of it.  If any one gave this trimmer a bad review, they really don&#x27;t know how to use it.  This is by far the best trimmer, if you ask any barber that specializes in tapering, line-ups, &amp; designs they&#x27;ll tell you this is the best trimmer by far.  If you&#x27;re not a barber that specializes in fades you really have no business buying these trimmers. If your a new barber, at home here &amp; there barber, or non-buzz cut barber I would go with Wahl products &amp; not Andis products.  Do not go by any bad reviews.  This trimmer is the best for people who know what they&#x27;re doing with it.  It&#x27;s like a calm by-the-speed-limit driver buying &amp; giving a corvette a bad review knowing they should have bought a car more suitable for their driving needs.  Same goes for clippers &amp; trimmers.  Before buying any clippers or trimmers I advise watching any youtube videos on them.  Learn as much as you can before buying one.  Also you must care for them after every cut, cleaning &amp; oiling properly.  I even like these trimmers better than the Andis Styliner M3s.  The Styliner II does not get hot, is lightweight, cuts sharp with ease and is sleek looking.  M3 gets hot, is heavier, &amp; double in price.  Also note if you adjust the blade to zero gap, you will have an even sharper cut.  If you adjust, make sure to watch a youtube video first to learn proper adjusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for seller, was awesome, best price online, shipped item fast.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great. I cut my children&#x27;s hair and it performs with ease.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend ordering this trimmer to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this particular unit, the first worked flawlessly for over 10 years - had to retire it because it crashed to the ground too many times and even duck-tape couldn&#x27;t hold it together! I would give this 5 stars but I went to the Caribbean for 3 weeks, and while it did work, the blade in that short period of time started to rust. Otherwise, I&#x27;m an Andis guy and I use it for my face and head because if I use a blade, I&#x27;m guaranteed to get bumps. Good product.</li>
            <li> It was a xmas gift for my fiance, He loves it! he tried it out on the boys and his self! no problems&amp;#60; as long as he likes it, I like it!</li>
            <li> Best clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> This is a good machine it is awesome.It works perfectly! 😄</li>
            <li> I liked the product I recommend is comfortable to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Styliner II for months now and I can say it&#x27;s a great trimmer. It gives me a close shave and doesn&#x27;t get hot at all from my experience with it. I recommend this to anybody looking for a good quality trimmer, a close shave, and a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t get hot after just minutes of usage like some others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As most who have bought this trimmer, I use it to shave with because I cannot shave close with a regular or electric razor because it causes ingrown hairs and breakouts. This trimmer is a miracle for me. I have tried at least a dozen cheaper trimmers through the years and some were ok but none cut this close or were as quick to use. Yes it&#x27;s heavy but heavy means good quality and very fast cutting speed. I would highly recommend this for any trimming and especially for those of use that use it to shave vs. traditional razors.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom who&#x27;s in barber school and really wanted these. Arrived earlier than expected, brand new just like it&#x27;s listed.</li>
            <li> Not as close as I would like but, there cool.👌🏽</li>
            <li> very great product highly recommended</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my beard line up my beard as well it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> This is the first pair of Kenneth Cole shoe I have bought with which I have an issue.  The insole in both foot of shoe has shifted leaving me with an unbalanced feeling when walking. Because it is glued in,  it doesn&#x27;t even allow me to properly reposition it as when I attempt to pull it,  pieces of the material begins to rip from the insole itself.</li>
            <li> Bought this siad free shippin but i still got charged with the fee, cuts good sounds good runs good barley used it for 2 days, further ratings to come</li>
            <li> After spending way too much time researching a trimmer I decided on this one. I am infinitely pleased with it. I wish I had stopped wasting money on cheaper trimmers long ago. It is ideal for daily shaving and edging up your hairline.</li>
            <li> The tooth on the blade was chipped when I opened the box. It is a great clipper but terrible that I had to purchase another blade right away.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who is a hair stylist. She loves them and says they are great, they give a fine edge and tight details.</li>
            <li> Use it for personal grooming, and definitely has decreased the rate of ingrowns.  Def not as smooth of a feel as post waxing but the aesthetics are the same and unlike some of the other machines it doesn&#x27;t get hot and the motor will hopefully last as long as my boyfriends has!</li>
            <li> I was previously researching what trimmers I should get &amp; came across this particular model. After reading reviews and product description I decided to get these. I used these one time and I absolutely love these, beyond pleased with the results they delivered.</li>
            <li> I luv these clippers giving my son shape ups a couple of times now and they are crisp and sharp excellent product and purchase</li>
            <li> GREAT, PURCHASED FOR MY SON FOR HIS BIRTHDAY ALONG WITH OTHER ITEMS, HE LOVED THEM IDEAL FOR FACE AND EDGING UP.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful and can be adjusted to make out-lining extremely precise and skin tight. But the overall shape of the tool can be improved, a more ergonomic design would make outlining easier and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This razor is extremely sharp after zero blading. It&#x27;s a plus and feels strong. Love the price also.</li>
            <li> Do not line good at all!!</li>
            <li> A must have if you shave your head.  It line&#x27;s up perfectly and great for dry shaving.  I use it to shave and then use a razor after.  saves a ton of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard, cutting my hair and shaving with clippers since the 80&#x27;s. I was using the Andis T-edger for years but didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I purchased the Andis Professional 26700 Styliner II Personal Trimmer. These trimmers are far superior to the T-edger. Though they are a bit heavier the cut is worth it. These trimmers provide straight lines, a clean shave at a quick pace. Like many men I would get bumps if I shaved with a razor. These trimmers provide an excellent smooth shave without causing irritation. Guess you can tell I&#x27;m extremely happy knowing I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area of my face, in an effort to get a close shave. These do the job so get yours today!!!</li>
            <li> Great buy for a great price.</li>
            <li> Great item fast delivery</li>
            <li> The styliner II is an excellent trimmer. It is quiet and delivers a nice cut. Its great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a previous version of this item and it works beautifully.  This model, slightly upgraded, does not...    I use it to close shave my head everyday and the blades just aren&#x27;t close enough.  On my previous model, I was able to unscrew the blades and align the cut as close as 0mm.  This new model has an \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; blade head that has the blades screwed together.  In other words, they aren&#x27;t adjustable.    The product does display a quality fit and finish however.  It just doesn&#x27;t do (due to mechanical changes in manufacture) what I needed it to.</li>
            <li> I am a big fanatic of Andis, their products are well built, very durable and would last a lifetime. I strongly recommend this product to anyone in need of a trimmer. This is a must get!</li>
            <li> Great product, it was brought for my son to use and he loves and tells his friends where he got it.</li>
            <li> I am using this solely to trim my mustache and sideburns. Nothing fancy. Let me tell you, this is one terrific piece of equipment. The lines I get on my &#x27;stache and &#x27;burns are super straight; the T-blade is a joy to use. The Styliner II is relatively quiet, stays cool, and produces a professionally groomed result. It does a great job and feels substantial in the hand. IMHO, this is far superior to anything produced by Oster, Wahl, etc. Build quality is first-rate. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was dead on arrival. It didn&#x27;t work out the box. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> These clippers were so loud that I had to return them.  After I re-boxed this item to return it, I came into possession of a \\&quot;Sound Level Meter\\&quot; that measures precisely how loud an item is.  I was seriously tempted to tear the package open again, just so I could measure just how AMAZINGLY LOUD these clippers were.    Since I was returning them, I decided not to worry about it.  But I can assure you that they are so loud that I honestly think that if you worked at a place that required you to use them, you would have to request ear plugs for both you and your customer.    I liked the fact that they were electric instead of battery operated, but the loudness was completely unbearable.  I bought the trimmers and a Master set.  The Master set worked flawlessly, and they were quiet.  But the trimmer was a no-go.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is fast and sharp, I use it instead of shaving to avoid shaving rash. Way more solid and powerful than the usual consumer-marketed trimmers. The first one I got a tiny piece of the corner of the blade broke off, but Amazon switched it out without any hassles for a new one.</li>
            <li> No problems buying the productos. This is not a productos review</li>
            <li> I ordered these trimmers on March 21 and they died on me 3 weeks ago!  The return policy won&#x27;t allow me to return them.  I am really disappointed because I liked these trimmers and they were working really well at first.  Too pricey to not even last a year.  I will not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> A solid product, good quality, all around the best edger and trimmer I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> Powerful trimmer. I had to get used to it compared to my old one. I&#x27;m a stylist and decided the rechargeables didn&#x27;t last long so I&#x27;m trying this corded one.</li>
            <li> I bought it to trim my beard it works good but it&#x27;s a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, I have a ton of clippers and hair products and this is one of my favorites, I use it to trim down my beard before shaving because my hair is coarse. does the job quick and efficiently. I also use andis cleaner/lube after each use to prolong the life of the product i recommend everyone properly clean and lube theirs it helps a lot...</li>
            <li> I appreciate the return policy. We received the first set and the clipper box was damaged as well as the clippers. I received the 2nd box in a timely manner but they are still not working as well as the set my son borrowed from a friend. Not sure whether you are sending defective trimmers...</li>
            <li> I use it every other day to shave my entire face.  Its lasted for probably a year, no issues, and never any damn ingrown hairs or razor burn.</li>
            <li> Earlier I had one that was really good quality. Somehow I lost one of the screw but still working even after ten years. This one makes lot of noise which I do not know why.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. I had to make some adjustments to the blade but now they cut perfect!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for some trimmers...</li>
            <li> trimmer worked great for 4-5 months - then quit on me. I&#x27;ll choose something better this time.</li>
            <li> worth the money.  Use everyday and limits razor bumps too</li>
            <li> bought these and they came with an already stripped screw (but didn&#x27;t appear to be used) so I wasn&#x27;t able to adjust my blades pretty much leaving these useless to me, so I emailed amazon and was promptly shipped out a new pair with upgraded shipping ...the second pair have been received and are flawless . I have adjusted them and they are one of my go to trimmers for designs and final edge up..i love andis products and that is only reaffirmed with this product... Quality build and will stand the test of time...take care of them and they will take care of you. I cant give a 5 start because 5 is perfect and well, nothing is perfect haha but these are as close to perfect as trimmers get . I would recommend to anybody whether it is for home use or professional use. Andis all the way!</li>
            <li> I get shaving bum,ps when i shave so i have to use clippers to shave my face and not a blade. These have been an excellent purchase thus far, Ive had them for about a month or so now.</li>
            <li> A pretty good edger and dry shaver that leaves little to no stubble.</li>
            <li> The clippers perform well right out of the box. I am satisfied with these clippers at this time. This will be my choice from here on.</li>
            <li> Good quality close cut, blade can be adjusted to zero gap which gives a crispy line I&#x27;ve own mine since 2003 changed blade twice</li>
            <li> After using these less than a week a corner of the blade broke off. I haven&#x27;t dropped them, banged them nothing. I work in a busy barber shop so they did see a lot of use in the week but they should not have broken like that. I&#x27;m not sure if I recieved a weak or faulty trimmer, but I am very very disappointed in this product. I have to replace them a week after taking them out of the box.</li>
            <li> These trimmers exceeded my every expectation. They are sharp and precise. The factory set offset is perfect for cutting closely without danger of cutting the client. The cord could be longer, but that is my only gripe. As close as you&#x27;re going to get without using a razor.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than the t outliner in my opinion. The blade can be a little better but overall it&#x27;s good. #4stars</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for my husband as a Christmas present and he is utterly pleased with them. I am so happy! Some reviews say that clippers get real hot, are heavy, or just do not cut well. My husband says these are great. I will research and buy him another set for Father&#x27;s Day. Amazon, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> Awesome. Super close trimmers and don&#x27;t agitate the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these 3 days ago. I was excited to open them and use them in the salon today. Out of the box they worked great around the ears. I read they may need some adjustments, so I followed several youtube videos and adjusted the blade. They DO not cut longer neck hairs or around the back hairline. I am SO frustrated! Returning them ASAP.</li>
            <li> Great unit. I may buy more.</li>
            <li> Great clippers.Closest you can get to pro.</li>
            <li> Not cool, New version,SUCK</li>
            <li> Awesome for simple trims.</li>
            <li> It is powerful. This product is not meant to give you a completely shaved look. But if you have some basic trimming skills, you can trim your beard very well with this product. My earlier trimmers with batteries were damaged very soon so this product with a cable to the power plug is a welcoming change. It was actually recommended to me by the lady who cuts my hair and this product did not disappoint. The only complain that I have is that it vibrates a lot and after a while you get this funny feeling in your hand due to its violent vibrations (I have not changed the default power settings which in itself is a little weird with a screw to rotate). Over all a definitely great trimmer if you use it properly.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well once you adjust the blade the power and the tension screw.</li>
            <li> Just like an old country western quick draw. When deciding the best trimmer to use in any situation my andis styliner II is my first choice. Just sit back and let the trimmer do the job for you. It leaves smooth precise lines and my clients has not experienced and cuts on scrapes from the styliner II. Top of the line product here I don&#x27;t see why you would choice anything else.</li>
            <li> My old Andis finally broke and I had it for many years. I like this one very much. It is also very smooth.</li>
            <li> i liked these clipper till they fell off the counter and chipped the blades no longer useable till i replace that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just gotta replacement blade. thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product. I would recommend this for anyone that has problems with razor bumps and likes a close shave without the use of a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> Better than the Oster T liner by far. Gets a closer shave and makes straighter lines</li>
            <li> Best clippers for shape up!</li>
            <li> I cut hair from home and I heard a lot about these trimmers so I ordered them. I am very impressed with the product I absolutely love it. It took me hair cuts to the next level with crisp clean line ups!</li>
            <li> It lasted just a few days and then it died...</li>
            <li> This is my second pair. Had the other for so long until the motor burned out. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this trimmers especially for the price. Great buy!</li>
            <li> The andis styliner ll are perfect for me and my dads face. My father was in love with these clippers. Great quality for little money. Will buy a second pair soon.</li>
            <li> this close shaving trimmer is second to none...this is the most effective and reliable tool in every barber&#x27;s repertoire..it is ideal for both the home and commercial purposes...I recommend it to every guy out there looking for a very close shave</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Bought to replace an original Styliner which was probably 18-20 years old. Very satisfactory long term service. New one seems destined to provide similar service.</li>
            <li> Great cut, best clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased from anywhere!</li>
            <li> Have owned this for about two months.  Got tired of paying a barber for what I could be doing myself.  Good cut.  Stays REALLY cool after running for a while.  No issues with the product at all.  Already paid for itself in haircuts.</li>
            <li> Teeth chipped off, after falling from my hand onto the floor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American, with the nappiest hair on Earth. Proud of it, but maaan the razor bumps that follow a shave! This product, if you want it to, will cut your hair down very very low and give you a REAL TIGHT shape-up (or line-up, as they say in other parts of the US, bleh). But that&#x27;s if you go against the grain, or in other words, against the direction that your hair grows. If you do this though, and your hair is very curly/nappy like mine, say hello to more razor bumps. Shave WITH the grain, in the direction of your hair growth, from your face all the way down to your throat, if you want to prevent razor bumps. The cut won&#x27;t be as low, but it&#x27;ll be low enough, and if you use the right after shave moisturizer/lotion (I highly recommend Axe Shield Face hydrator, sold on amazon and at Target), then you&#x27;ll be smooth sailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is great. Just be sure to shave right AFTER you shower, and maintain the clippers well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It works good but you have  to go over the line you are making a couple of times</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to very well but think I would prefer one with a cutting height attachment.</li>
            <li> I purchased a pair of these same clippers about 20 years ago.  Even today they still live up to the Andis&#x27; reputation of quality.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer is supper👌</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great haircut, you need the personal Andis Professional Styliner II</li>
            <li> Great trimmer with a lot of power.</li>
            <li> The most smooth close cutting clippers i have evered owned</li>
            <li> Best clipper &amp;#34;after adjusting them of course</li>
            <li> gives a good close cut if you want to go bald</li>
            <li> No issues. On time. Properly wrapped. Cost as agreed. I cannot thinkof anything else to fill the word quota. Bye.</li>
            <li> I needed  new trimmers because I dropped the old pair and broke them.  These are the best trimmers I&#x27;ve owned in 20 years.</li>
            <li> well worth the money. don&#x27;t get t linners by andis stylelinner are the best</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son.  He said it&#x27;s the closest shave he&#x27;s ever gotten on his neck and does a nice job of shaping his beard.</li>
            <li> this thing cute real good, i use it on the daily and hasnt let me down. i love the feel of it and the power it has. i 0gapped it and i love the way it cuts :) nice and durable.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m black. We know most brothas have problems with using straight-edge razors because our hair curls under the skin.  This trimmer gives me a close shave.  Not as close as I like, but very close.  I will say I use this trimmer with the combination of the Wahl 5-Star Shaver to get a really close shave as a razor.  So I will say recommend this Trimmer for all the brothas with thick beards.</li>
