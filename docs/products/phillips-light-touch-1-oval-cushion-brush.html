            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>(Light Touch #1)!  </li>
            <li>so happy that  I found it while searching for a new hairbrush!</li>
            <li>Great brush, recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>Best brush ever hands down.</li>
            <li>The Phillips Light Touch #2 is the purse size hair brush.  </li>
            <li>The Phillips Light Touch #1 is a full size.  </li>
            <li>Great for long hair and tender heads!  </li>
            <li>Great for everyday use and all kinds of hair.</li>
            <li>Having looked everywhere locally for this brush and buying many, many other brushes that I thought would work I found the original on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>the bristles didn&#x27;t have very much coating on the ends.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then I have bought four others in various designs to see if there was something better.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The women in the family with long hair love them.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace original from 2007 which finally bit the dust and bristles</li>
            <li>He likes this particular brush because he says it&#x27;s gentle on his scalp.</li>
            <li>I only use the full size ( #1).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Little balls at end of each bristle really smooth out knots and do not scrape your scalp when brushing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t reviewed this brush already.  </li>
            <li>you want special brushes for styling like small round brushes in different diameters that might be better.  </li>
            <li>Been using these for over 15 years and my last one is 6 years old!</li>

            <li> Best brush ever hands down. At least for me I have long straight hair and it glides through like silk. I have been using these for 20 plus years and as long as I can find them I&#x27;ll never use another.</li>
            <li> Best hairbrush ever. I will be so sad if they quit making them. It&#x27;s the only brush we ever use.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a family member to replace one that he&#x27;s had for about 10 years. He likes this particular brush because he says it&#x27;s gentle on his scalp. Based on his comments, I&#x27;d give it 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes.  Have been using them for years.  The women in the family with long hair love them.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t reviewed this brush already.  When I decided to let my hair grow longer bought this brush years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have bought four others in various designs to see if there was something better.  Little balls at end of each bristle really smooth out knots and do not scrape your scalp when brushing.  Boar bristles and other animal types do not work as well as this one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want special brushes for styling like small round brushes in different diameters that might be better.  As my hair gets longer, getting up mornings and taming the tangles from pillows turns and laying on the back of my head without a pillow make such a mess sometimes it is spectacular, but not for public viewing, that is when this excellent brush lines up all the hair about where it is suppose to be.  If I lost all my other brushes I would not replace them this ONE is enough.  Happy Trails</li>

            <li> I have been using this brand and style for thirty years plus. I have long hair and a sensative scalp, it is the only hair brush, that I have found, that doesn&#x27;t pull or break your hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>

            <li> This is a nice sturdy hair brush. Bought this to replace original from 2007 which finally bit the dust and bristles started comming out.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush replacing one which began to wear out after over 10 years use</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes!!  Have been using the for about 30+ years!!  I was so happy to find them on Amazon!  I was going to give up hope!!&lt;br /&gt;They are not as well made as they were 30 years ago but, they are still the best brush I have ever used!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Have used this style for years.</li>
            <li> GREAT hairbrush, just make sure you get the full size hair brush (Light Touch #1)!  I been using them for over 20 years.  This brush comes in two sizes. The Phillips Light Touch #1 is a full size.  The Phillips Light Touch #2 is the purse size hair brush.  I only use the full size ( #1).  I think the purse size (#2) is too small.  The brush will say either 1 or 2 on the handle.  Buy the &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;.  I end up losing the brush before it wears out.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!!! So happy to find it more reasonable then in a salon!</li>
            <li> I purchased my this Phillips brush in 1994 and had worn it out after 20 years!  Having looked everywhere locally for this brush and buying many, many other brushes that I thought would work I found the original on Amazon!  I am sooooo happy.</li>
            <li> this has been my brush for over 20 years...nothing else compares</li>
