            <li>and it can tangle very easy, so</li>
            <li>The Herbal Essences color-treated care formula was close, but it never quite smelled as good as the original smoothing formula.  </li>

            <li>Personally, this is the best scent ever created!!!</li>
            <li>then probally but my love conditioner is Aussie moist, my hair is in love with it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Will order more</li>
            <li>Then they stopped selling, so I was thrilled to see it available again.</li>
            <li>Was so glad to find it on here :)</li>
            <li>For some reason my hair has decided it doesn&#x27;t like most shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li>missing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have found Herbal Essences smooth collection to use because it&#x27;s actually affordable, smells great and works!</li>
            <li>It’s a very light and gentle shampoo and conditioning set, smells good, and I love the way my hair feels afterward.</li>
            <li>This line of products does a great job of keeping my chemically highlighted hair looking soft and manageable while not messing up my skin.</li>
            <li>Better than the super expressive stuff I usually buy smells great too.  </li>
            <li>I love Herbal Essences, this conditioner leaves hair instantly smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth, and looking great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great bargain in a big bottle.  </li>
            <li>My husband liked the way it smelled so much he stopped using his shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I have a keratin treatment and the sulfate free</li>
            <li>Smooth but not greasy hair.</li>
            <li>I used it throughout the vacation and remembered why I liked using it so much.</li>
            <li>I was able to comb the tangles right out</li>
            <li>and I got excited “</li>
            <li>I figured it smells way too good to actually work!</li>
            <li>, It did leave my hair pretty soft, not that tangled and smelled good.</li>
            <li>I love to load up on conditioner, but it was alot better than other conditioners that I have tried for sure, I will use every now and</li>
            <li>It smells feminine and clean at the same time but best of all, actually makes my hair feel smoother!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair super frizzy either</li>
            <li>Love this classic conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner actually matches the original scent even better than the shampoo, and honestly, the new formula actually does a better smoothing job than the original.  </li>
            <li>It will be perfect for alot of ladies, but I have very thick hair</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, wish it came in the larger size with a pump.</li>
            <li>My hair somehow looks freshly washed and styled on day 3,</li>
            <li>I just recently decided to try this line, I have never tried it before believe it or not, I agree with the other ladies the smell is good!!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be cool if the bottle of conditioner was sent with the top on next time...</li>
            <li>(makes hair smoother/shinier), but I resent how they promote it as \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; (and the matching shampoo as \\&quot;silicone free\\&quot;)...many conditioners are sulfate free and shampoos silicone free; what&#x27;s really rare and desirable is the opposite:  </li>
            <li>tried it on my three year old daughter Paige because her hair seems to get tangled really easily</li>
            <li>When I saw there was a new smooth collection I was willing to give it a shot!&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are thinking about how much you miss this.... you need to get it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using so many different brands of shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair very shiny!  </li>
            <li>3 stars because this product works pretty well</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely repurchase, I know it&#x27;ll be good during the summer months when my hair gets dry and straw-like.</li>
            <li>and I must say, this fragrance is not only fantastic, but it LASTS.</li>
            <li>must say that I didn&#x27;t really notice my hair any smoother.</li>
            <li>A lot of brands, including Herbal Essences modern looking bottles, make my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I like that it is reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I started losing so much hair each time we washed out hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner makes hair soft, full, airy, bouncy, and very natural.</li>
            <li>With the Smooth collection, my hair actually felt soft AND smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend these.</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo/conditioning set when I was younger (and less picky about my hair) and I remember loving the smell.</li>
            <li>i alternate with a extra cheap brand.</li>
            <li>Lots of shampoos/conditioners have products that are intended to make your hair shiny and soft but will aggravate body acne.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to comb out long wet hair.</li>
            <li>love this smell, i&#x27;ve been using it for years but be warned: a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I think this is an old formula that Clairol decided to put back on the market.  </li>
            <li>When you rinse off your hair all of those oils, waxes, and other baddies that make you locks look fabulous run down your back/body and clog up your pores.</li>

            <li> I also use the other conditioner by Herbal Essence in the yellow bottle  which is the one for &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;(same as this bottle only yellow), and I didn&#x27;t notice my hair any shinier but the fragrance (once again) is what has me hooked on these products!!</li>
            <li> At this point when I dry my hair, that&#x27;s when the bad shampoo and conditioners show their true worth and my hair feels rough and sticks out.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and don&#x27;t rinse it completely out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight brown hair that gets a slight wave if naturally dried, so I blow dry and slightly straighten it.</li>
            <li> He has black, thick, coarse hair, and his hair much is softer as well when it&#x27;s not full of gel.</li>
            <li> It seems like whenever I buy something just because of the scent it makes my hair feel rough and have lots of fly-aways sticking out everywhere.</li>
            <li> Weird title, right?</li>
            <li> It makes me mad when companies use these tactics to make their products seem healthier/more natural than they really are.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> if used everyday it tends to make my hair a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I was reintroduced to the product this past summer at my parent’s vacation home</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the very few shampoos I can use on my allergic scalp without any problems.  </li>
            <li> when normally it loses all its style and bounce after the 1st day.</li>
            <li> The cap came as broken so when I opened the package there was conditioner everywhere.</li>
            <li> They keep taking it off the shelves and make it difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is supposed smell like, but it&#x27;s awful!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe the terrible fragrance.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This conditioner makes hair soft, full, airy, bouncy, and very natural. Also smells amazing! The smell and effect lasts days. My hair somehow looks freshly washed and styled on day 3, when normally it loses all its style and bounce after the 1st day.</li>
            <li> I used Herbal Essence products when they first came out and loved them!!! I don&#x27;t know what this is supposed smell like, but it&#x27;s awful! I can&#x27;t even describe the terrible fragrance. Will not buy ahain</li>
            <li> I think this is an old formula that Clairol decided to put back on the market.  It&#x27;s one of the very few shampoos I can use on my allergic scalp without any problems.  It&#x27;s a great bargain in a big bottle.  A HUGE &amp;#34;THANK YOU&amp;#34; to Clairol for this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I love Herbal Essences, this conditioner leaves hair instantly smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see these re-released!  The Herbal Essences color-treated care formula was close, but it never quite smelled as good as the original smoothing formula.  This re-release smells just as I remember it!  The conditioner actually matches the original scent even better than the shampoo, and honestly, the new formula actually does a better smoothing job than the original.  I HIGHLY recommend these.</li>
            <li> I have used a ton of conditioners that smell awesome, but after the first day, the fragrance fades. I condition my hair every 3 to 4 days and I must say, this fragrance is not only fantastic, but it LASTS. You may not notice this if you wash and/or condition daily.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I didn&#x27;t really notice my hair any smoother. I also use the other conditioner by Herbal Essence in the yellow bottle  which is the one for &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;(same as this bottle only yellow), and I didn&#x27;t notice my hair any shinier but the fragrance (once again) is what has me hooked on these products!!</li>
            <li> works great, smells great and is cheap</li>
            <li> Wooo hoodoo! It&#x27;s back. I&#x27;ve missed you!  It&#x27;s my waist length fine hairs best friend!!!</li>
            <li> Growing up in the 90&#x27;s I had this conditioner coupled with the shampoo. The smell is just like I remember! My friends and family comment how wonderful my hair looks and smells. If you are thinking about how much you miss this.... you need to get it!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  Leaves my hair smelling and looking great!  Love HE products</li>
            <li> I used this in the 90&#x27;s and loved it. I&#x27;ve been using so many different brands of shampoo/conditioner I never found anything that has been so good to my hair. This combined with the shampoo and an oil from a different company, this has left my hair shiner than I can remember, it&#x27;s so soft and smooth I&#x27;m constantly playing with it. I have naturally straight brown hair that gets a slight wave if naturally dried, so I blow dry and slightly straighten it. Even with the heat that&#x27;s used, my hair still looks wonderful. My husband liked the way it smelled so much he stopped using his shampoo and conditioner and it now using this. He has black, thick, coarse hair, and his hair much is softer as well when it&#x27;s not full of gel.</li>
            <li> Better than the super expressive stuff I usually buy smells great too.  Keep one at the gym and one at the boyfriends</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!! IT WORKS BETTER THEN MY MATRIX AND REDKEN PRODUCTS. I CAN&#x27;T USE ANYTHING WITH SULFATES IN IT SO I BOUGHT THIS TO TRY IT. OH MY GOSH, IT WORKS BETTER THEN ANYTHING THAT I HAVE EVER USED!!!! WOULD RECOMMEND TO SOMEONE WITH DRY/ DAMAGED HAIR.</li>
            <li> I love the throwback hair products from this line and I LOVE the smell of this product.  Once I smelled it in the store I just could not resist.  It makes my hair super soft to the touch.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair super frizzy either but it doesn&#x27;t give my curls any extra oomph, so that&#x27;s why I took off one star.  It actually makes my curls smaller and looser, versus say a conditioner made specifically for curly hair.  It also makes my hair very shiny!  I would definitely repurchase, I know it&#x27;ll be good during the summer months when my hair gets dry and straw-like.</li>
            <li> Weird title, right? Lots of shampoos/conditioners have products that are intended to make your hair shiny and soft but will aggravate body acne. When you rinse off your hair all of those oils, waxes, and other baddies that make you locks look fabulous run down your back/body and clog up your pores. This line of products does a great job of keeping my chemically highlighted hair looking soft and manageable while not messing up my skin. Plus, it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Item is as described and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because this product works pretty well (makes hair smoother/shinier), but I resent how they promote it as \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; (and the matching shampoo as \\&quot;silicone free\\&quot;)...many conditioners are sulfate free and shampoos silicone free; what&#x27;s really rare and desirable is the opposite:  a *conditioner* without silicones and a *shampoo* without sulfates.  It makes me mad when companies use these tactics to make their products seem healthier/more natural than they really are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be cool if the bottle of conditioner was sent with the top on next time...</li>
            <li> makes my hair look healthy :)  I have a keratin treatment and the sulfate free is a must for me :)</li>
            <li> Personally, this is the best scent ever created!!! I would compare the way the product works to Tresseme, but it smells way better, and let&#x27;s be honest, we all want it because Herbal Essences stopped making it that one time... !!! I am stocking up in case that ever happens again!</li>
            <li> I just recently decided to try this line, I have never tried it before believe it or not, I agree with the other ladies the smell is good!!!!! and it does leave your hair smelling good, It did leave my hair pretty soft, not that tangled and smelled good. It just didn&#x27;t seem to be as conditioning as I need. It will be perfect for alot of ladies, but I have very thick hair and it can tangle very easy, so I love to load up on conditioner, but it was alot better than other conditioners that I have tried for sure, I will use every now and then probally but my love conditioner is Aussie moist, my hair is in love with it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this classic conditioner.  It has and will be the only conditioner that gets out tangles in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Will order more</li>
            <li> love this smell, i&#x27;ve been using it for years but be warned: a little goes a long way. if used everyday it tends to make my hair a little greasy. i alternate with a extra cheap brand.</li>
            <li> The cap came as broken so when I opened the package there was conditioner everywhere.</li>
            <li> Wish P&amp;G would keep this stuff stocked on the shelves permanently.  They keep taking it off the shelves and make it difficult to find.  I don&#x27;t buy any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used to always use this shampoo and conditioner set. Then they stopped selling, so I was thrilled to see it available again.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite! Was so glad to find it on here :)</li>
            <li> For some reason my hair has decided it doesn&#x27;t like most shampoos and conditioners. A lot of brands, including Herbal Essences modern looking bottles, make my hair feel greasy. This does not do that. Smooth but not greasy hair. Great smell too.</li>
            <li> This review is on the product, not the seller. I used this shampoo/conditioning set when I was younger (and less picky about my hair) and I remember loving the smell. I didn’t notice that it went off the shelves as I’m ALWAYS switching up my hair care regime. I was reintroduced to the product this past summer at my parent’s vacation home and I got excited “I remember this stuff, it smells so good.” I used it throughout the vacation and remembered why I liked using it so much. When I ran out of my salon shampoo and conditioner this last time I decided to go the drug store route, like I said, I’m always switching it up, I got this product and I’ve been using it and love it! It’s a very light and gentle shampoo and conditioning set, smells good, and I love the way my hair feels afterward.</li>
            <li> Awesome price great smell great product you cant go wrong, wont  find it cheaper not even in a dollar store</li>
            <li> This conditioner is affordable and smells awesome. It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth, and looking great. I like that it is reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> We had to stop using this product.  My daughter and I started losing so much hair each time we washed out hair.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> For over a decade, they pulled this stuff off the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;When it came back, I thought I&#x27;d cry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d bathe in it.&lt;br /&gt;The way it makes your hair smell?  Amazing.</li>
            <li> We have used this conditioner on our hair for decades. It makes it easy to comb out long wet hair. I recommend it for everybody. A little goes a long way and don&#x27;t rinse it completely out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, wish it came in the larger size with a pump.</li>
            <li> I love shampoo and conditioners that smell good but for some reason, my hair doesn&#x27;t! It seems like whenever I buy something just because of the scent it makes my hair feel rough and have lots of fly-aways sticking out everywhere. For this reason I&#x27;ve never tried Herbal Essences. I figured it smells way too good to actually work! When I saw there was a new smooth collection I was willing to give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with this product line! I LOVE the smell. It smells feminine and clean at the same time but best of all, actually makes my hair feel smoother! It felt good when I was using it and seemed to get my hair really clean but the true test is the hairdryer! At this point when I dry my hair, that&#x27;s when the bad shampoo and conditioners show their true worth and my hair feels rough and sticks out. With the Smooth collection, my hair actually felt soft AND smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my three year old daughter Paige because her hair seems to get tangled really easily so I need a really good conditioner! I was able to comb the tangles right out and I loved the way her hair smelled! When she cuddled up to me after her bath, the smell was as good as that baby smell I have been missing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have found Herbal Essences smooth collection to use because it&#x27;s actually affordable, smells great and works!</li>
