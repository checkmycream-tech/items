            <li>I love the buffing block - the best I&#x27;ve tried and the nail file is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li>It is a good size, making it easy to hang on to.  </li>
            <li>This is THE BEST AND ONLY nail kit that works better than advertised!</li>
            <li>The lotion is not too strong and the nail buffer is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product for caring for my cuticles.</li>
            <li>I love the results and</li>
            <li>The lotion is my favorite part about this set.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>My nails were just so shiny and healthy</li>
            <li>Makes even brittle, ridged nails, nice, smooth, and shiney.</li>
            <li>yes they do and what&#x27;s even better,</li>
            <li>Love how shiny my nails look after they&#x27;ve been buffed and the cuticle oil works too.  </li>
            <li>Buffer makes your nails shiny and healthy looking, so much better than polish and the lotion is teriffic  also.</li>
            <li>Love, love,&lt;br /</li>
            <li>&gt;  love the cuticle oil,  finger nails and toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I looked for it here.</li>
            <li>I love lotions and creams and everything in the Seacret&#x27;s line</li>
            <li>the product itself works fine</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic, though.</li>
            <li>I love this product it worked fantastic and the results were great but the buffer block was worn out after 3 uses not exactly a quality product.:</li>
            <li>The price is better on Amazon that buying direct from the maker in most cases.</li>
            <li>Same as buffer good for 5 manicures.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The buffer block is worth the money alone.</li>
            <li>I love the natural shine it gives me.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>The nail file is great, but not long lasting.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have used these products before and find the cuticle oil and nail buffer especially to work like magic.  </li>
            <li>This kit was much more reasonable at Amazon and as usual I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>your into eco friendly natural beauty products, this is a must.</li>
            <li>Fine product used earlier also.</li>
            <li>But its much cheaper on here.</li>
            <li>Way too much of it.</li>
            <li>so much I want to share with my girl friends</li>
            <li>but they are only available as a package with the rest of the items.</li>
            <li>So I was accosted during a recent visit to The Grove in L.A., by a lovely young girl who grabbed my hand and did a demo of these products and tried to get me to spend $199 to purchase the kit.  </li>
            <li>Its all natural!!!</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I bought my first Seacret nail collection at an estate sale, new in the box.  </li>
            <li>I originally came upon it when a pushy French man was trying to sell it to me at the mall.</li>
            <li>It lasts for quite a long time and is far better than any I have found in drug stores.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall is how quickly you have to buy another block.</li>
            <li>The rest of the kit is normal nail care stuff that I already had simular versions to.</li>
            <li>Your NATURAL NAILS LOOK BEAUTIFUL, the only thing missing in this kit is the  \\&quot;white pencil\\&quot; for your nail tips.</li>
            <li>The nail buffer can get your nails looking like they have a clear coat of polish on them.  </li>
            <li>My nails are hard, shiny &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>apparently I was invisible) and he used it on my finger nails.</li>

            <li> kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion and oil and file all last longer than the buffer, which doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>

            <li> The cuticle oil is just like any other cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> I like this nail care collection because it is good quality without an outrageous price.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely prefer the vanilla coconut option that they unfortunately stopped making.</li>
            <li> Would have given the kit 5 stars but the lotion is thin and watery.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is THE BEST AND ONLY nail kit that works better than advertised! The file and buffer block lasts for years.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  My nails are hard, shiny &amp; smooth. The buffing block is what makes it so incredible.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Someone tried to sell us this in the mall for triple the price. But its much cheaper on here. The only downfall is how quickly you have to buy another block. But the shine stays so long. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Best thing I&#x27;ve done for my nails. A lot cheaper than salon manicures</li>
            <li> I love this product for caring for my cuticles. The quality and service  provided to get it to me quickly and packaged in quality is superb.</li>
            <li> Time consuming. It takes about 20 minutes to do it and then you have to remember to do which treatment in one week, two, or three weeks. I got it for some toe fungus I got after marching through a lot of water when I was gone for BCT. BUT it did get rid of the fungus.</li>
            <li> One star off because they don&#x27;t make vanilla-coconut anymore.&lt;br /&gt;One star off because IMO you should get 2 of the buffer blocks in each kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion and oil and file all last longer than the buffer, which doesn&#x27;t last very long at all. The product is fantastic, though. I love the results and the lotion and oils are great. The buffer is genus, though the file is just an every day file, but still a nice addition to the kit. It would also be nice if it came with a nail kit pouch as the box it comes in breaks, but I just bought a separate pouch for this purchase. This is my second time buying this product and I definitely prefer the vanilla coconut option that they unfortunately stopped making.</li>
            <li> According with the expectations</li>
            <li> The lotion is my favorite part about this set. Its a pomegranate scent and it really is amazing. The rest of the kit is normal nail care stuff that I already had simular versions to. It&#x27;s a nice gift set for someone and theres nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I originally came upon it when a pushy French man was trying to sell it to me at the mall. He was telling me how awful and ugly my nails were (no, he was actually telling my boyfriend....apparently I was invisible) and he used it on my finger nails. Voila! My nails were just so shiny and healthy looking!&lt;br /&gt;I came home and ordered ASAP. My hands look and feel amazing, and my nails have never been so nice!</li>
            <li> I do most of my own manicures so this kit was a welcome addition to my nail care routine. I purchased the Seacret kit several years ago at a mall kiosk for an outrageous price. This kit was much more reasonable at Amazon and as usual I am well pleased. Would have given the kit 5 stars but the lotion is thin and watery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product. Tried in the mall but didn&#x27;t buy it there.&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived already looks like used...broken also...&lt;br /&gt;But the product itself works fine and I can polish my nail at home now!</li>
            <li> The buffer block is worth the money alone. Makes even brittle, ridged nails, nice, smooth, and shiney. However the buffer does not last a long time. Good for 5 manicures. The cuticle oil is just like any other cuticle oil. Way too much of it. The lotion is soothing and softens dry skin. You can feel and see the difference in your skin after applying. The nail file is great, but not long lasting. Same as buffer good for 5 manicures.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used the Seacret Nail Care Collection kit. It appears to be what I need. I will take it with me to my manicurist.</li>
            <li> So I was accosted during a recent visit to The Grove in L.A., by a lovely young girl who grabbed my hand and did a demo of these products and tried to get me to spend $199 to purchase the kit.  Errr...no way!  I did what any savvy woman would do....go on to Amazon to see if I could find the product and what do you know...yes they do and what&#x27;s even better, the price....$20!!  Love how shiny my nails look after they&#x27;ve been buffed and the cuticle oil works too.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this is a great product at a great price. gave 5 of these sets for christmas. Your NATURAL NAILS LOOK BEAUTIFUL, the only thing missing in this kit is the  \\&quot;white pencil\\&quot; for your nail tips.Buffer makes your nails shiny and healthy looking, so much better than polish and the lotion is teriffic  also.Love, love,&lt;br /&gt;  love the cuticle oil,  finger nails and toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if your into eco friendly natural beauty products, this is a must.</li>
            <li> Products arrived very much on time and in excellent condition.  I have been using the products and my nails look good and healthy.  I like this nail care collection because it is good quality without an outrageous price.  I personally like the pomegranate fragrance of the body lotion.  I like this set so much I want to share with my girl friends so I am giving a number of these nail care kits to them for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I bought my first Seacret nail collection at an estate sale, new in the box.  It has been a great product!!  I especially like the oil for my nails and cuticles.  It works wonders on dry cuticles.  Give it a try...</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I purchased it at the mall where I had been accosted by a kiosk salesman at a weak moment. Spent way too much money on this and other products. It is a good product though, and the prices are much better through Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I looked for it here.</li>
            <li> The buffer is really excellent.  The three different levels work well to file and buff my nails.  It is a good size, making it easy to hang on to.  It lasts for quite a long time and is far better than any I have found in drug stores.  Wish I could just buy the oil and buffer w/replacements for the buffer but they are only available as a package with the rest of the items.</li>
            <li> I love the buffing block - the best I&#x27;ve tried and the nail file is gentle yet effective.  I&#x27;ll mix the lotion with a drop of the cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> Loved the quality and fragrance.  If you have problems with your nails, this is a great solution.  It would also make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Fine product used earlier also.</li>
            <li> This is a great beauty product for anyone. The lotion is not too strong and the nail buffer is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I love lotions and creams and everything in the Seacret&#x27;s line is awesome.  The price is better on Amazon that buying direct from the maker in most cases.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I love the natural shine it gives me. The buffer helps me because In don&#x27;t have to use chemicals on my nails. Its all natural!!!</li>
            <li> Because it didn&#x27;t have declaration fee i couldnt take the parcel, it turned back from the border. So i can&#x27;t comment about the product.</li>
            <li> Great Christmas Gift. I bought this for some of my Co workers for dry winter hands. They loved it! Worth every penny</li>
            <li> https://www.seacretdirect.com/sashaeut/en/us/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save 50-60% just use the link above ^^</li>
            <li> I have used these products before and find the cuticle oil and nail buffer especially to work like magic.  The nail buffer can get your nails looking like they have a clear coat of polish on them.  Nice kit.</li>
            <li> I love this product it worked fantastic and the results were great but the buffer block was worn out after 3 uses not exactly a quality product.:(</li>
