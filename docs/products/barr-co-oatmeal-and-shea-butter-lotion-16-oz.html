            <li>I gave this as a gift and received rave praise of my choice based on the feel of this lotion and the lovely scent plus the results of true moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and I almost returned it out of frustration, but fortunately I figured it out.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Making my skin and my wife&#x27;s skin smooth.</li>
            <li>The bottle is exactly what I hoped and looks perfect with the old classic feel of the room.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased two bottles of this lotion and one tube of the rich hand cream.</li>
            <li>but the scent is why I love it so much</li>
            <li>I love this product and, while I think it is very expensive, I gladly spend the money because this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I mostly wanted a bottle that felt classic and was labeled</li>

            <li>I rarely leave feedback</li>
            <li>Well worth the $</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to see that I wasn&#x27;t the only one struggling to open it.</li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s a clean, mild, natural scent.  </li>
            <li>This winter was particularly long and harsh yet I was the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever been in my own skin.  </li>

            <li>Smells so nice and really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li>This light and refreshing cream is the only cream that i have found that actually helped moisturize my skin and not make it itchy like over the counter drug store creams.  </li>

            <li>Thank you, Candles on Main!</li>

            <li>Rec&#x27;d fast and well packaged from seller.  </li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>Not that you would purchase a lotion for the packaging, but the glass bottle and label are really unusual and stand out.</li>
            <li>I got rough elbows and this smooth them right out -</li>
            <li>With the other hand turn the top part of the pump (the head) where the lotion is supposed to get out.</li>

            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it took me such a long time to open it.</li>
            <li> (sorry for my english, it&#x27;s not my first language) :&lt;</li>
            <li> br /&gt;1- open the bottle by slightly detaching the pump from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;3- place one hand in the gap and hold firmly the closure and the bottle at the same time</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the other reviews, I figured out how to work the pump.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;2- leave 3 cm (more or less) between the base of the pump (the closure) and the neck of the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to push the pump down in front while turning.</li>
            <li> You can get it for less from Anthropologie however, so</li>
            <li> Turn it for few seconds until the spiral spring pops up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might have to try 2 to 3 times.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for use in the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I even passed it along to a friend who suffers from the same dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> And when it arrived, lotion had leaked out and hardened around the outside of the base of the cap.</li>
            <li> After trying for days and even searching on the web (too bad i haven&#x27;t seen Jackie and Leslie comment before)</li>

            <li> This lotion goes perfectly with the soap. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs very quickly. The smell is heavenly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is the best and most addicting lotion!!</li>
            <li> I have bought several bottles as holiday gifts for the bast several years. The lotion is spectacular. It makes a great gift for co-workers, or teachers. The glass bottle is beautiful and adds to the niceness of the gift.</li>
            <li> The lotion is great and smells wonderful. But I almost couldn&#x27;t get the pump mechanism to work. And when it arrived, lotion had leaked out and hardened around the outside of the base of the cap.</li>
            <li> This lotion is rich, thick and creamy. I have very dry skin and finding something that wasn&#x27;t in a plastic bottle has been challenging. I was so happy to come across this lotion. It was a bit challenging getting the pump to work and I almost returned it out of frustration, but fortunately I figured it out. You have to push the pump down in front while turning. Why they don&#x27;t include instructions is beyond me. But I&#x27;m halfway through my bottle and will be ordering more. You can get it for less from Anthropologie however, so I&#x27;ll probably be ordering my next bottle from them and saving the $6. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it took me such a long time to open it. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s gluten free or not, so I can only hope for the best.</li>
            <li> This light and refreshing cream is the only cream that i have found that actually helped moisturize my skin and not make it itchy like over the counter drug store creams.  This winter was particularly long and harsh yet I was the most comfortable I&#x27;ve ever been in my own skin.  I even passed it along to a friend who suffers from the same dry, itchy skin.  It worked wonder for my friend as well.  Now i buy 2 one for me and one for my friend.  LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product! It&#x27;s hydrating, smells delicious, non-greasy, and leaves my skin smooth! Use it daily, especially after showering!</li>
            <li> Very good body/hand lotion but they have to change the bottle pump!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to see that I wasn&#x27;t the only one struggling to open it. After trying for days and even searching on the web (too bad i haven&#x27;t seen Jackie and Leslie comment before) I went back to the store to exchange it, thinking I had a defective item. 5 people there tried to open it until one manager succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is her trick (sorry for my english, it&#x27;s not my first language) :&lt;br /&gt;1- open the bottle by slightly detaching the pump from it.&lt;br /&gt;2- leave 3 cm (more or less) between the base of the pump (the closure) and the neck of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;3- place one hand in the gap and hold firmly the closure and the bottle at the same time (The closure and the dip tube of the pump and the neck of the bottle should be placed and blocked in the space between your index and thumb).&lt;br /&gt;4- With the other hand turn the top part of the pump (the head) where the lotion is supposed to get out. Turn it for few seconds until the spiral spring pops up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might have to try 2 to 3 times. The manager in the store did it one shot but back home I succeed after the 2nd time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I love this product and, while I think it is very expensive, I gladly spend the money because this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The large bottle has lasted me quite a while. I didn&#x27;t have any problem opening the package - you just twist it open.</li>
            <li> The pump was the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the other reviews, I figured out how to work the pump.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is very happy. Great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion for our guest powder room.  I mostly wanted a bottle that felt classic and was labeled so guest could help themselves.  Oh my word!  The lotion is amazing.  The scent is light and the lotion is quickly absorbed by the skin leaving it soft and clean feeling.  The bottle is exactly what I hoped and looks perfect with the old classic feel of the room.  I rarely leave feedback but I appreciate reading others when I&#x27;m shopping and hope this helps people decide to try this for themselves.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! I have used so many different kinds over the years and this is the greatest  No plastic bottle either!  The pump works great too.  I had no problem with it.  My skin feels so silky smooth.  I Tried the lotion in Anthropologie at the mall and promptly bought it! For those who care it is Vegan to boot.  The extra amount for shipping doesn&#x27;t matter if it is delivered to your door and you save your gas.</li>

            <li> Great stuff, arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Barr co Oatmeal and Shea Butter Lotion is one of the best body lotions I have ever used.  I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> Awesome awesome awesome. Well worth the $</li>
            <li> We have been using this for years.  One of my dear friends receives this from me every year on her birthday.  It is the one lotion her husband tolerates because of his sensitivity to perfumes.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very thick, and great for softening dry skin, as well as leaving the most fabulous scent. Try entire line...awesome!</li>
