            <li>I have acne prone skin, with hormonal triggers, and this stuff covers great without screaming HEY</li>

            <li>THE ORGANIC ONE IS AWESOME ALSO  any more questions email me at tanya_derkatch@hotmail.com</li>
            <li>This is the perfect colour for me, it goes on flawlessly and while it can look a little cakey if you use too much, it&#x27;s perfect when you know what works for you.</li>
            <li>I used it for years, having found it to be simply superior to anything else.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage without looking powdery.  </li>
            <li>Very good and shipped very fast thank you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of powder, but this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I thought that this cover up would provide good coverage because it&#x27;s a pretty good brand</li>
            <li>I have a very light ivory beige skin tone</li>
            <li>i have very light skin btw,  </li>
            <li>*LOVE</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it, I have found that my skin looks so much better</li>
            <li>most days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed more acne flaring up as well.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this foundation about 5 years ago</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been discontinued in Australia so thank goodness for amazon making it available to me!</li>
            <li>I love this powder.  </li>
            <li>I love this powder.</li>
            <li>this gives a nice glow to skin and feels light.  </li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>i started putting this one on then touching up or putting a bit more of with the ORGANIC TRANSLUCENT LIGHT POWDER one and found it looks perfect and more natural that way.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to know for acne is when you are done applying it, PAT IN ON YOUR ACNE SPOTS</li>
            <li>It also comes off easily.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin and can sometimes get rashes from things like certain medals, but I don&#x27;t have too many problems with make-up.</li>
            <li>Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Loose Talc-Free Powder is a great and inexpensive alternative to more pricey brands of cover ups and powders.</li>
            <li>My pores looked huge.</li>
            <li>Light but covers well without looking &#x27;powdery&#x27;.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m too cheap), but this one was thrown out within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else lives up to this one for light coverage without clogging my skin/pores.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin look fabulous.</li>
            <li>ANOTHER important detail.</li>
            <li>This powder is nice and provides decent coverage.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE YOUR LOTION IS VERY DRY BEFORE APPLYING IT or it will be spotted and will not look good.</li>
            <li>I will probably use this for every day and in addition purchase the Bobbi Brown brightening powder for special occasions.</li>
            <li>It can look cakey if you put enough on for good redness coverage though.</li>
            <li>i cant say if it does much for those but mine are fine and i just want my blackheads, acne and redness covered.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use much, or it looks too yellow on my fair (freckled) skin.</li>
            <li>i BUY this because its the right shade</li>
            <li>I also loved the way it eliminated the dark circles around my eyes, simply by applying a bit more in that</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>No painful, hugely swollen issues anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product for daily extended use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend a proper sunscreen underneath if you are going to the beach or something though :)</li>
            <li>For now, I&#x27;m better off with naked skin.</li>
            <li>but i put on like 3 layers of it first.</li>
            <li>It offers reasonable coverage while being light, and it never irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li>It really does wonders for the skin.</li>
            <li>Does not cover very well at all</li>
            <li>i was always embarrassed and everyone could tell i had so much cakey makeup on.</li>
            <li>and my skin is pretty clear.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it effectively covers any blemishes or imperfections, without looking too caked on or artificial.</li>
            <li>but its so easy to touch up in seconds anywhere and its easier to remove then other makeups which stay on skin even after its washed.</li>
            <li>It also doubles as sun protection for me on a normal day where I&#x27;m exposed to the sun periodically throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It has such great coverage and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>i could NEVER touch up my old makeups after they dried or they turned even more orange and cakey</li>
            <li>confess, I still have it in my glove box and have, in a pinch, used it maybe 4 times in the last 2 months, luckily without major incident.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After years of exhaustive searches for acne products, spending tons of money and having no success, a light bulb went off one day</li>
            <li>Not sure about how many words i have to write</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin, who is seeking a product designed to give them a clearer looking complexion.</li>
            <li>i do NOT put it on near my son or let him in when im applying it</li>
            <li>pat it with my fingers and it looks natural then.</li>
            <li>Strangely enough, I have other PF products that seem fine.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be similar to bare minerals brand, but it is much chalkier.</li>
            <li>Just normal little zits right on the hormonal dot.  </li>
            <li>one more annoying thing is this makeup does come off easily if you rub your face on something</li>
            <li>Before, I could regularly rely on 4-6 major cystic events on my face in any given month.</li>
            <li>You have to shake it to make the powder come out, and the little brush doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it does spread and cover well and go on evenly as long as you do it properly and practise a bit.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make it feel gross - especially in Summer when other makeup literally melts off your face!</li>
            <li> I did use the almay smart shade CC luminous primer underneath which is very pale pink and probably helped also.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed any other facial product of mine other than the powder.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it is a little too yellow for me.  </li>
            <li> It does come off considerably during the day, though, so you have to reapply at least once throughout.</li>
            <li> loose powder to this loose powder and since the change, I started getting little bumps that I assume is from irritation to the powder.</li>
            <li> I was starting to look sallow which has been really making me look tired and drained lately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because I spent $14 for it, but luckily I found the organic wear at a different store.</li>
            <li> Other colors tend to be too dark.  </li>
            <li> I did half my face and it lifted and brightened w/o any other added makeup.</li>
            <li> I tried probably at LEAST 30 different foundations in my life and NONE compare to this.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup but hate the brush, so I use one from another mineral kit that I used up</li>
            <li> The little brush was gimmicky - threw it away and use my Eco Tools blush brush instead.</li>
            <li> i have a FEW WRINKLES.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It keeps me from being sunburnt and has no strong smell.</li>
            <li> Its cakey and when you finally rub and rub to get it even it has a weird lite burning sensation or something.</li>
            <li> lastly one weird thing that happens depending on the moisturizer i use.</li>
            <li> The color was fake, the coverage was oddly thick and yet highlighted the few dark spots I have.  </li>
            <li> its hard to explain</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all!</li>
            <li> i inhale quite a bit which is the only bad thing of this product</li>
            <li> do it in a bathroom with the fan going because the minerals go in the air pretty badly and are bad to breath in.</li>
            <li> (all the others looked even worse)</li>
            <li> i used a thick liquid crap foundation for years by revlon that took over half an hour to put on!!!</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> (seriously i tried with around 30 of them!!</li>
            <li> I looked like one of those old-ladies desperate to layer on the pancake make-up.</li>
            <li> This covers so well its crazy.</li>
            <li> makes my pouch dirty...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad</li>
            <li> I can touch up in less then a minute throughout the day with no side effect!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The powder color and application isn&#x27;t too bad, but some clumps up in places sometimes.</li>
            <li> this product shocked me at how well the COVERAGE is.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER: the plastic thing it comes in is horribly designed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I *LOVE* the function of this foundation.  I used it for years, having found it to be simply superior to anything else. I have acne prone skin, with hormonal triggers, and this stuff covers great without screaming HEY, IM OBVIOUSLY OBSCURING A GIANT ZIT! I also loved the way it eliminated the dark circles around my eyes, simply by applying a bit more in that area.&lt;br /&gt;The Problem: Cystic Acne.  I never had it before I started using this product. Now I do. Regardless of whether this product is the sole cause, or a contributor in a host of factors, here is the truth I now know: stopping use stopped the acne.&lt;br /&gt;After years of exhaustive searches for acne products, spending tons of money and having no success, a light bulb went off one day and I thought, \\&quot;The only thing I haven&#x27;t tried is changing my makeup.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;It is NO coincidence that I have not had ONE cystic acne outbreak in the 2 months since I quit using this product.  Before, I could regularly rely on 4-6 major cystic events on my face in any given month. Now? Just normal little zits right on the hormonal dot.  No painful, hugely swollen issues anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product for daily extended use. Since I&#x27;ve stopped using it, I have found that my skin looks so much better that I do not feel like I need a foundation most days.&lt;br /&gt;I confess, I still have it in my glove box and have, in a pinch, used it maybe 4 times in the last 2 months, luckily without major incident.</li>
            <li> I went from the &amp;#34;organic wear&amp;#34; loose powder to this loose powder and since the change, I started getting little bumps that I assume is from irritation to the powder. I&#x27;ve also noticed more acne flaring up as well. I haven&#x27;t changed any other facial product of mine other than the powder. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because I spent $14 for it, but luckily I found the organic wear at a different store. The powder color and application isn&#x27;t too bad, but some clumps up in places sometimes. I just can&#x27;t believe how irritated my skin is from it! I have pretty fair skin and can sometimes get rashes from things like certain medals, but I don&#x27;t have too many problems with make-up. Weird.</li>
            <li> Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Loose Talc-Free Powder is a great and inexpensive alternative to more pricey brands of cover ups and powders. The shade was perfect for my fair complexion. What&#x27;s more, it effectively covers any blemishes or imperfections, without looking too caked on or artificial. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin, who is seeking a product designed to give them a clearer looking complexion. Just great!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this foundation about 5 years ago and i&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It&#x27;s been discontinued in Australia so thank goodness for amazon making it available to me! This is the perfect colour for me, it goes on flawlessly and while it can look a little cakey if you use too much, it&#x27;s perfect when you know what works for you. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make it feel gross - especially in Summer when other makeup literally melts off your face! It also doubles as sun protection for me on a normal day where I&#x27;m exposed to the sun periodically throughout the day. I&#x27;d recommend a proper sunscreen underneath if you are going to the beach or something though :)</li>
            <li> This powder is great for those of us that have Rosacea.  I can powder just a bit on to immediately soothe my redness.</li>
            <li> Not sure about how many words i have to write but YUCK. Didnt know what i was thinking but you can buy this in the corner drugstore. Its cakey and when you finally rub and rub to get it even it has a weird lite burning sensation or something. I ordered missha bb cream on anothers reviewers advice and have never used a make up thats so delicious. Im going to try their cashmere powder. I figure if the bb cream is so awesome the powder may be too.</li>
            <li> I love this powder.  It offers reasonable coverage while being light, and it never irritates my skin.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I love this powder. Light but covers well without looking &#x27;powdery&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup but hate the brush, so I use one from another mineral kit that I used up</li>
            <li> I like it, but it is a little too yellow for me.  Other colors tend to be too dark.  I can&#x27;t use much, or it looks too yellow on my fair (freckled) skin.</li>
            <li> I like it. I was starting to look sallow which has been really making me look tired and drained lately so I purchased this in translucent bc I have a very light ivory beige skin tone and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot to see if it would help. It does work and doesn&#x27;t look powdery. It really does wonders for the skin. I did half my face and it lifted and brightened w/o any other added makeup. I will probably use this for every day and in addition purchase the Bobbi Brown brightening powder for special occasions. I did use the almay smart shade CC luminous primer underneath which is very pale pink and probably helped also. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the texture. I was hoping it would be similar to bare minerals brand, but it is much chalkier.</li>
            <li> I almost never toss makeup in the trash (I&#x27;m too cheap), but this one was thrown out within 2 weeks.  The color was fake, the coverage was oddly thick and yet highlighted the few dark spots I have.  My pores looked huge. I looked like one of those old-ladies desperate to layer on the pancake make-up. Strangely enough, I have other PF products that seem fine. For now, I&#x27;m better off with naked skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing else lives up to this one for light coverage without clogging my skin/pores. I refuse to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Does not cover very well at all and my skin is pretty clear. Also the brush fell apart as I was using it. Bristles were on my face. Never again</li>
            <li> This is a great powder.  Nice coverage without looking powdery.  The little brush was gimmicky - threw it away and use my Eco Tools blush brush instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of powder, but this is by far the best! It has such great coverage and a little goes a long way. I will totally be buying this again (:</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It makes your skin look fabulous.</li>
            <li> I am 27 with some acne and redness. i have been using this product for years. I tried probably at LEAST 30 different foundations in my life and NONE compare to this. this product shocked me at how well the COVERAGE is. i used a thick liquid crap foundation for years by revlon that took over half an hour to put on!!! (all the others looked even worse) i was always embarrassed and everyone could tell i had so much cakey makeup on. I did not know a powder could actually FULLY COVER acne until tried this one.  This covers so well its crazy. the best part is  I can touch up in less then a minute throughout the day with no side effect!!!!!! i could NEVER touch up my old makeups after they dried or they turned even more orange and cakey (seriously i tried with around 30 of them!! including (maybelline, loreal, revlon, cover girl, clinic, mac etc)  The most important thing to know for acne is when you are done applying it, PAT IN ON YOUR ACNE SPOTS OR THEY WONT BE COVERED FULLY. same with red spots. the brush will not cover it fully.  ANOTHER important detail. i BUY this because its the right shade but when you pat it on it appears a bit lighter. i used translucent medium for my forehead, side of nose and side of face and TRANSLUCENT MEDIUM TO PAT ON ACNE so it doesn&#x27;t look whiter on those spots. i have very light skin btw,  this is the only makeup i found that does not clog pores or cause acne at all. MAKE SURE YOUR LOTION IS VERY DRY BEFORE APPLYING IT or it will be spotted and will not look good. do it in a bathroom with the fan going because the minerals go in the air pretty badly and are bad to breath in. i inhale quite a bit which is the only bad thing of this product and it goes on everything in my bathroom after a bit. i do NOT put it on near my son or let him in when im applying it so he doesn&#x27;t inhale it.  it does spread and cover well and go on evenly as long as you do it properly and practise a bit.  i have a FEW WRINKLES. i cant say if it does much for those but mine are fine and i just want my blackheads, acne and redness covered. this gives a nice glow to skin and feels light.  one more annoying thing is this makeup does come off easily if you rub your face on something but its so easy to touch up in seconds anywhere and its easier to remove then other makeups which stay on skin even after its washed. i do swim with this makeup but i put on like 3 layers of it first. lots comes off but some definitely stays and still covers ok.  lastly one weird thing that happens depending on the moisturizer i use. sometimes i have to wait then pat it with my fingers and it looks natural then. then i apply another layer with the brush. its hard to explain but it just happens sometimes.  i started putting this one on then touching up or putting a bit more of with the ORGANIC TRANSLUCENT LIGHT POWDER one and found it looks perfect and more natural that way. THE ORGANIC ONE IS AWESOME ALSO  any more questions email me at tanya_derkatch@hotmail.com</li>
            <li> This powder is nice and provides decent coverage. HOWEVER: the plastic thing it comes in is horribly designed. I have to carry it around in a Ziplock bag because the powder goes everywhere. You have to shake it to make the powder come out, and the little brush doesn&#x27;t work very well so I use it with a larger powder brush.</li>
            <li> Very good and shipped very fast thank you</li>
            <li> I thought that this cover up would provide good coverage because it&#x27;s a pretty good brand but I was wrong. It didn&#x27;t cover any of my blemishes or scars at all. I didn&#x27;t even feel like I had any makeup on. I&#x27;m mad I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> makes my pouch dirty... Not satisfied at all!</li>
            <li> This gives medium coverage by itself with no foundation underneath. It also doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin, which is a huge plus. It does come off considerably during the day, though, so you have to reapply at least once throughout. It keeps me from being sunburnt and has no strong smell. It also comes off easily. It can look cakey if you put enough on for good redness coverage though. I like this, but the color didn&#x27;t match me anymore.</li>
