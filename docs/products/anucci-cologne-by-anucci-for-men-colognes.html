            <li>I bought this for my father as a gift, it&#x27;s his favorite because everyone stops him to ask what the scent is that he&#x27;s wearing.</li>
            <li>Its inexpensive and ok.  </li>

            <li>strong smell</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and the light scent is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy Boucheron give this one a try, price-wise</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this fragrance for my husband, but I decided to keep it for myself.  </li>
            <li>It originally retailed over $65</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found this fragrance again.</li>
            <li>If you want to stand out ( in a good way) above the rest, this product will do it for you.</li>
            <li>love it  very shipping</li>
            <li>Some have compared it to a high end barbershop scent, others a very soothing and smooth floral.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Annuci is rich and natural, the floral notes blend well with the woody notes, none of which strike me as synthetic or metallic.</li>
            <li>One spray on my wrist lasts pretty much all the work day (&amp;#62; 8 hours).  </li>
            <li>It lasts long and the ladies love it.</li>
            <li>Good price, but the spray does not last quite as long as I would like it to, maybe because the atomizer sprays a bit too much each time it is pressed.</li>
            <li>It was launched in 1989 as a fresh masculine scent for men.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an unusual scent, because although it&#x27;s marketed for men, it&#x27;s actually very floral.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very wearable for either sex.  </li>
            <li>The price is much cheaper than Dillard&#x27;s department store.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift and he loves it, I loved the price, and I received it earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I cannot describe this scent other than I love it on my husband.  </li>
            <li>I use it only for special occassions.</li>
            <li>The transaction left a sweet taste in my ...</li>
            <li>This scent blends sumptuously with all of my high end fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, and it makes a cute little pop when you pull off the cap.</li>
            <li>My father used it a lot and my little brother loves fragrances so he fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>The Annuci is a classic scent and is still not widely known about.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this one.</li>
            <li>I would say around the early 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>There was a time when I could buy Annucci only at the high end Department Stores.</li>
            <li>I mean a sweet smell on my body!</li>
            <li>This is the cologne that was once a markee cologne in Dept stores during the mid 80&#x27;s to early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I will reorder this in the near future.</li>
            <li>Anucci is a rich and complex floral fragrance for men.</li>

            <li> Alas, times have removed this classic scent to online ordering only.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected for my mate.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, and just a little is needed.</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorites, as I refuse to become one of the sheep that follow down the mainstream cologne market.</li>
            <li> When I received it I was Crushed!!</li>
            <li> Very little, but a little went a long way.</li>
            <li> I also received it in just a few days.</li>
            <li> However, there&#x27;s something in it that makes it smell faintly of green grass.  </li>
            <li> It is manly, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Certainly not my favorite and doubt</li>
            <li> It is hard to find</li>
            <li> People will ask you what you are using, but lets keep this our little secret.</li>
            <li> but my husband threw it in the garbage because he hated it so much</li>
            <li> This was a bad pay smells weak</li>
            <li> I would hate to see this product become unavailable online one day.</li>
            <li> This product smelled terrible.</li>

            <li> Anucci is a rich and complex floral fragrance for men. It was launched in 1989 as a fresh masculine scent for men. Some have compared it to a high end barbershop scent, others a very soothing and smooth floral. (To me) Annuci is rich and natural, the floral notes blend well with the woody notes, none of which strike me as synthetic or metallic. Another bonus is it&#x27;s projection, longevity, and complexity as it changes over time. If you enjoy Boucheron give this one a try, price-wise it&#x27;s a safe blind buy. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Overall this one deserves five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Fragrance Reviewer</li>
            <li> great price and delivered quickly</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this fragrance for my husband, but I decided to keep it for myself.  This scent blends sumptuously with all of my high end fragrances.  I spray Anucci in the palm of my hand and mix with one of my fragrances such as Tocca, Coach, or Flowerbomb to achieve a sensual mysterious fragrance.</li>
            <li> i have used the product for over a year and find it to be excellent man cologne...</li>
            <li> The product was just as they said it was, but it was packaged lying down and some of the cologne actually leaked out. Very little, but a little went a long way. (all over my hands and clothes). I also received it in just a few days.</li>
            <li> There was a time when I could buy Annucci only at the high end Department Stores. Alas, times have removed this classic scent to online ordering only. This has always been one of my favorites, as I refuse to become one of the sheep that follow down the mainstream cologne market. If you want to stand out ( in a good way) above the rest, this product will do it for you. People will ask you what you are using, but lets keep this our little secret. I would hate to see this product become unavailable online one day.</li>
            <li> love it  very shipping</li>
            <li> Anucci, according to Basenotes.com, was released in 1989.  It&#x27;s an unusual scent, because although it&#x27;s marketed for men, it&#x27;s actually very floral.  Jasmine is the predominant note.  However, there&#x27;s something in it that makes it smell faintly of green grass.  Sillage is moderate.  Longevity is very good.  One spray on my wrist lasts pretty much all the work day (&amp;#62; 8 hours).  It&#x27;s marketed for men, but because of its floral nature, women should not dismiss trying it!  It&#x27;s very wearable for either sex.  If one likes Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s Jennifer Aniston perfume, one may like Anucci. However, unlike Jennifer Aniston which is notorious for its short longevity and negligible sillage, Anucci has staying power.  The bottle is kitschy; it&#x27;s two golf balls.  However it&#x27;s solid etched glass.  It&#x27;s sturdy, and it makes a cute little pop when you pull off the cap.</li>
            <li> The was a gift for my stepfather and he loved it. It has a great smell which is not too strong. This was a great gift for a gentleman.   T</li>
            <li> This is the cologne that was once a markee cologne in Dept stores during the mid 80&#x27;s to early 90&#x27;s. But like father time it came and went. Still it&#x27;s a great cologne that has a style all of it&#x27;s own. I have worn it off and on since the 80&#x27;s and I still come back to it. If you haven&#x27;t tried it and you&#x27;re looking for something with that is uniquely different this is the one. Men, this will captivate your Lady and you&#x27;ll make this cologne a part of your collection always. Hunting oils prevail!!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot describe this scent other than I love it on my husband.  It&#x27;s a cologne unlike any other and it stands out above the mainstream colognes.  Only wish I would have known about it long ago.  It&#x27;s one of my all time favorites!</li>
            <li> This was a bad pay smells weak</li>
            <li> it is a good product.  It smells wonderful on my husband.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loved this fragrance. I will reorder this in the near future. Also this fragrance smells terrific and I love smelling it on him. The price is much cheaper than Dillard&#x27;s department store.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and so does my beau.  The scent is very unique and stimulating  to the olfactory senses.  Love it on my dad and my man.  Glad it is no longer available in stores, everyone does not have it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances. It lasts a long time, and just a little is needed. It also gets alot of compliments.</li>
            <li> You will always get compliments each time your man uses Anucci for Men. The scent is fresh and refreshing. It was once offered only in upscale stores such as Macy&#x27;s but now it&#x27;s become what a find is a forgotten name. You can&#x27;t beat the price! It originally retailed over $65</li>
            <li> Most underrated cologne out there</li>
            <li> Nice classic scent at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for 15 years. The bottle will last about 2 years, using it once-a-day. It is manly, but not overwhelming. It is best after settling into your skin for 2-3 hours. It changes aroma quite a bit during the day, and smells best about the time I get to bed. It is my favorite cologne, and my wife LOVES it. I never smell it on anyone else, but that is part of the allure: it isn&#x27;t being worn by everyone else.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and the price was much better than I found in retail outlets. Thanks! The transaction left a sweet taste in my ... I mean a sweet smell on my body!</li>
            <li> I looked for about a year for this product and found that it was no  longer avaible. My grandaughter told me to try the internet and I found it on amazon.com. If you want your man to smell great try this  product Anucci.</li>
            <li> This cologne is Great!.  It lasts long and the ladies love it. I use it only for special occassions.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father as a gift, it&#x27;s his favorite because everyone stops him to ask what the scent is that he&#x27;s wearing. It does smell amazing on him, and comes in a cute bottle.</li>
            <li> Good price quick ship good product</li>
            <li> Its inexpensive and ok.  Certainly not my favorite and doubt I&#x60;ll repurchase it again.  Paul Sebastian &amp;#34;Brownstone, if you can find a Bottle of this discontinued Fragrance is a &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; have.</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes you can buy.....great fragrance, and it stays.</li>
            <li> can not find in stores and have loved this for years......always get a compliment when wearing.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, with a really fun scent, although I have never liked the name, and I have used it for years.  Good price, but the spray does not last quite as long as I would like it to, maybe because the atomizer sprays a bit too much each time it is pressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. My father used it a lot and my little brother loves fragrances so he fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and he loves it, I loved the price, and I received it earlier than expected. Thumbs Up!!</li>
            <li> good I like it  strong smell</li>
            <li> Awesome. Just what I expected for my mate.</li>
            <li> This product smelled terrible. Nothing like it does in the stores. I would have returned it but my husband threw it in the garbage because he hated it so much</li>
            <li> I have used the body  oils before and I do like the scent and I love the original it was perfect</li>
            <li> Very Pleased.....Thank You</li>
            <li> It was a gift and was pleased with product! I have used it for years and believed it would make a good gift!</li>
            <li> The Annuci is a classic scent and is still not widely known about.  It is very affordable and the light scent is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this fragrance again. I can remember a friend of mine would wear this scent back in college. I would say around the early 90&#x27;s and I absolutely LOVED it!!! When I received it I was Crushed!! It does not smell the same. Oh well I still have my memories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a fan of this fragrance that is the reason why I keep one at work and one at home.</li>
            <li> I love this and is very good and last for 24 hours</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne!  It is hard to find and I was thrilled to get it on Amazon!  I can tell you I like this cologne on my husband.....but scent like underware is a very personal choice type item.  You will just have to try it for yourself to see if this is someting you like to wear or a scent you like being around!</li>
