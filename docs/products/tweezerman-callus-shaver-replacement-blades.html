            <li>works great and safely removes callous</li>
            <li>The tweezerman callus remover works great, and the magic lies in the blades.</li>
            <li>I got these for my husband and he is very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Was very glad to get the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>I save lots of money doing my own pedicures, which are absolutely as good as those at the salon.</li>
            <li>I love this product and you will too!</li>
            <li>but these are not any better!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Always nice to look on Amazon</li>
            <li>shaves real close and fits perfect in my shaver</li>
            <li>Really works great and there are plenty of replacement blades that fit perfectly into the tweezerman callus shaver.  </li>
            <li>Would have liked it if the blade and the corn plane ends were labeled, but closer comparison to the blade that came with my shaver revealed that there are 2 lines on the blade end, and 1 line on the corn plane end.</li>
            <li>best refills for the best way to remove dead skin</li>
            <li>clean feet after I used them , Happy Feet</li>
            <li>For this kind of price you can&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>Use with a very light touch.</li>
            <li>What more can be said?</li>
            <li>These blades fit my 40 year old Credo callus shaver perfectly and perform as desired.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal and works really well.  </li>
            <li>SUB SEQUENTIALLY, CAUSING ONE TO MAYBE ORDER MORE OFTEN, MAYBE?</li>
            <li>im glad i found this online.</li>
            <li>I love the quantity and the price.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this online.</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>The blades fit my old shaver perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the best price on the internet and believe me I checked everywhere!</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s probably better to use a pumice stone on your feet, but I still use the blade and the stone.  </li>
            <li>They fit the tweezerman and do the job!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been pleased with Tweezerman products, and these are not an exception.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>And when we use up these ones, I&#x27;ll probably order some more.</li>
            <li>Loved the first time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a pedicure in the winter months via the Nail Shop, but I do my own at home and these fit just fine in my Callus Shaver.</li>
            <li>Make sure you soak your foot in warm water right before you start removing the callus.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find them on Amazon, and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>needed em for my callus shaver - glad to find em so cheap</li>
            <li>Good product and fast service</li>
            <li>In other words, a perfect razor blade.</li>
            <li>I tried other means but this product works best.  </li>
            <li>Easy to attach.</li>
            <li>I usally have to look all over for these, but I ordered and they came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy replacement.</li>
            <li>A few years most work the best for me.</li>
            <li>Excellent blades, very sharp and durable.  </li>
            <li>and they are of top quality at a super price</li>
            <li>Quickly shipped!</li>
            <li>The blades fit perfectly and are very sharp</li>
            <li>Great blades...wish they were available in a smaller amount.</li>
            <li>Easily fit my existing shaver.  </li>
            <li>A lifetime supply, vs the 2 or 3 pack retail ones available as refills at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nifty, effective device.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use it to clean up my foot callus.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m comfortable using this product.</li>
            <li>just remove the thickness of the callus and then use a pumice stone to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>Plus with my Prime membership and free two day shipping I have what I want almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this brand because I noticed that at my pharmacy the brand had gotten so cheap that it was like paper...</li>
            <li>The price was great compared to local shopping places.  </li>
            <li>works as good as my old one</li>
            <li>I paid twice as much for a pack of these at a local store, so very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>This is why I love Amazon because I love a bargain as much as I love super high heels.</li>
            <li>Originally bought the tool from Rite Aid</li>
            <li>The way the blade holder is designed it can easily be removed and a fresh one reloaded with no fear of slicing up your fingers.</li>
            <li>In between I clean them up myself.</li>
            <li>nice sharp blades worked very well good quality product</li>
            <li>Very sharp and came in original packaging very satisfied!</li>
            <li>Well it just the razor, its great sharp and its doing what it supose to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d received the tool as a gift and quickly went through the blades.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and work great.  </li>
            <li>I love super hot, super high heel shoes.</li>
            <li>They are compatible with most standard shavers, so it&#x27;s a fairly sure thing that you&#x27;ll get the right blades right away.</li>
            <li>That said, these blades are fantastic and my nurse&#x27;s feet really appreciate them.</li>
            <li>You also want to use a fresh blade every time</li>
            <li>I am so glad to not have to buy a whole new callus shaver!  </li>
            <li>Works well and price is right.</li>
            <li>Takes a little skill to learn how to use, but these will solve your feet problems if you have enthusiastic callouses!</li>
            <li>While super high heel shoes look really sexy on they can definitely leave your feet a bit battered (totally worth it to me though!).</li>
            <li>(although sorry Amazon DSW has the best deals on hot shoes!).</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>These blades to be exact.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement blades.</li>
            <li>I pulled the first blade out and it cut through my callus like butter.  </li>
            <li>I am able to fight back now.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect in my shaver and cut down calluses that accumulate on the balls of my feet by paring away paper-thin slices which allows for careful precision when this needs to be done.</li>
            <li>A bargain on super high heels is nirvana</li>
            <li>i am surprised more people don&#x27;t go this route and just replace the blades rather than buy a new shaver</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement blades when they are hard to find locally in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li>You want to lightly shave off the tiniest amount of the callus and check frequently to see how much you have removed.</li>
            <li>Standard blades, very sharp and happy with the quality.</li>
            <li>Need to be replaced more frequently if blade is always getting wet as rust builds up quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades are the standard size which should fit any callus shaver.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely amazed me.</li>
            <li>THAT AT WHATEVER PRICE YOU&#x27;LL BE PAYING TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>, I HOLD THE MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUB QUALITY OF THE BLADES.</li>
            <li>It fit my off brand, generic callus shaver.</li>
            <li>and i got it really fast</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the blades, and the tool!</li>
            <li>You really need to change the blades often for shaving weightlifting/crossfit calluses from your hands.  </li>
            <li>Really removes the calluses</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Not even my blacksmith good create such a dangerously sharp tool.</li>
            <li>be more sharp.</li>
            <li>You have to hold the shaver very flat and use light pressure.</li>
            <li>High quality and highly recommend for replacement blades for the callus shaving tool.</li>
            <li>I live in Massachusetts and they don&#x27;t allow salons to use Callus Shavers, probably a good thing since they only require nail techs have 100 hours training before letting them loose on the public, but I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really sharp and will lightly shave the callus away</li>
            <li>Fits shaver and works like it was new.  </li>
            <li>One day I may have the courage to try them again, but until then I will live in fear.</li>
            <li>These are super sharp, so don;t apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I actually didnt have a Tweezerman brand handle, but it fit so they must be universal.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I tried this brand and it is fantastic, very sharp and shaves off my tough calloses safely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for replacement callus plane blades for years, and it was good to find the same quality blades - indeed, the same manufacturer - as I had used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I love doing this myself, but have had a hard time finding the replacement blades in the store.</li>
            <li>Remember to use this tool right after the shower, it wont work properly on dry feet!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll have to re-order more of these for at least 2 years.</li>
            <li>and now I have whole bunch and can replace them regularly.  </li>
            <li>If you see blood, you have gone WAYYY to far.</li>
            <li>That &amp;#34;walking on ball-bearing&amp;#34; feeling is when one or more of the sweat glands becomes clogged and the only way to get relief is to remove the dead tissue that is causing the discomfort.</li>
            <li>Upon arrival, it turned out they were, it&#x27;s completely unnecessary to purchase an additional shaver if you already own one.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten how sharp these little devils are when they&#x27;re fresh out of the box!!!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace the dull ones that originally came with my callus shaver when it was new.</li>
            <li>These blades take the extra dry skin right off.</li>
            <li>This cuts off the dead skin, very well!!</li>
            <li>I love this for very thick calluses.</li>
            <li>This tool is the only thing that removes them completely.</li>
            <li>These blades are for use in the same devise used at the salon where I used to get professional pedicures.</li>
            <li>I get thick callouses on my heels in the summer time (thanks to flip flops) and I am an avid cook so my knives give me callouses on my fingers too.</li>
            <li>Please be aware this can be dangerous if you remove too much too quickly.</li>
            <li>the blades are not so sharp and they do not remove much of callus.</li>
            <li>These are harder to find in this amount at a decent price and they work well too.</li>
            <li>I just make sure the hard portions are gone, careful not to go too deep.</li>
            <li>So each blade actually has 4 sharp surfaces before you have to toss the whole thing and use another.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp, only get 1 use per blade.</li>
            <li>I tried them on soft skin, dry skin.</li>

            <li> Really works great and there are plenty of replacement blades that fit perfectly into the tweezerman callus shaver.  </li>
            <li> Would have liked it if the blade and the corn plane ends were labeled, but closer comparison to the blade that came with my shaver revealed that there are 2 lines on the blade end, and 1 line on the corn plane end.</li>
            <li> best refills for the best way to remove dead skin</li>
            <li> clean feet after I used them , Happy Feet</li>

            <li> This was a great deal and works really well.  </li>
            <li> SUB SEQUENTIALLY, CAUSING ONE TO MAYBE ORDER MORE OFTEN, MAYBE?</li>

            <li> I love the quantity and the price.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found this online.</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> The blades fit my old shaver perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the best price on the internet and believe me I checked everywhere!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s probably better to use a pumice stone on your feet, but I still use the blade and the stone.  </li>
            <li> They fit the tweezerman and do the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been pleased with Tweezerman products, and these are not an exception.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> And when we use up these ones, I&#x27;ll probably order some more.</li>
            <li> Loved the first time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a pedicure in the winter months via the Nail Shop, but I do my own at home and these fit just fine in my Callus Shaver.</li>
            <li> Make sure you soak your foot in warm water right before you start removing the callus.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find them on Amazon, and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> needed em for my callus shaver - glad to find em so cheap</li>
            <li> Good product and fast service</li>
            <li> In other words, a perfect razor blade.</li>
            <li> I tried other means but this product works best.  </li>
            <li> Easy to attach.</li>
            <li> I usally have to look all over for these, but I ordered and they came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy replacement.</li>
            <li> A few years most work the best for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades, very sharp and durable.  </li>
            <li> and they are of top quality at a super price</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped!</li>
            <li> The blades fit perfectly and are very sharp</li>
            <li> Great blades...wish they were available in a smaller amount.</li>
            <li> Easily fit my existing shaver.  </li>
            <li> A lifetime supply, vs the 2 or 3 pack retail ones available as refills at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nifty, effective device.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use it to clean up my foot callus.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m comfortable using this product.</li>
            <li> just remove the thickness of the callus and then use a pumice stone to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> Plus with my Prime membership and free two day shipping I have what I want almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this brand because I noticed that at my pharmacy the brand had gotten so cheap that it was like paper...</li>
            <li> The price was great compared to local shopping places.  </li>
            <li> works as good as my old one</li>
            <li> I paid twice as much for a pack of these at a local store, so very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This is why I love Amazon because I love a bargain as much as I love super high heels.</li>
            <li> Originally bought the tool from Rite Aid</li>
            <li> The way the blade holder is designed it can easily be removed and a fresh one reloaded with no fear of slicing up your fingers.</li>
            <li> In between I clean them up myself.</li>
            <li> nice sharp blades worked very well good quality product</li>
            <li> Very sharp and came in original packaging very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Well it just the razor, its great sharp and its doing what it supose to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d received the tool as a gift and quickly went through the blades.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and work great.  </li>
            <li> I love super hot, super high heel shoes.</li>
            <li> They are compatible with most standard shavers, so it&#x27;s a fairly sure thing that you&#x27;ll get the right blades right away.</li>
            <li> That said, these blades are fantastic and my nurse&#x27;s feet really appreciate them.</li>
            <li> You also want to use a fresh blade every time</li>
            <li> I am so glad to not have to buy a whole new callus shaver!  </li>
            <li> Works well and price is right.</li>
            <li> Takes a little skill to learn how to use, but these will solve your feet problems if you have enthusiastic callouses!</li>
            <li> While super high heel shoes look really sexy on they can definitely leave your feet a bit battered (totally worth it to me though!).</li>
            <li> (although sorry Amazon DSW has the best deals on hot shoes!).</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> These blades to be exact.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I pulled the first blade out and it cut through my callus like butter.  </li>
            <li> I am able to fight back now.  </li>
            <li> They are perfect in my shaver and cut down calluses that accumulate on the balls of my feet by paring away paper-thin slices which allows for careful precision when this needs to be done.</li>
            <li> A bargain on super high heels is nirvana</li>
            <li> i am surprised more people don&#x27;t go this route and just replace the blades rather than buy a new shaver</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement blades when they are hard to find locally in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> You want to lightly shave off the tiniest amount of the callus and check frequently to see how much you have removed.</li>
            <li> Standard blades, very sharp and happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> Need to be replaced more frequently if blade is always getting wet as rust builds up quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades are the standard size which should fit any callus shaver.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely amazed me.</li>
            <li> THAT AT WHATEVER PRICE YOU&#x27;LL BE PAYING TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> , I HOLD THE MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUB QUALITY OF THE BLADES.</li>
            <li> It fit my off brand, generic callus shaver.</li>
            <li> and i got it really fast</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the blades, and the tool!</li>
            <li> You really need to change the blades often for shaving weightlifting/crossfit calluses from your hands.  </li>
            <li> Really removes the calluses</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Not even my blacksmith good create such a dangerously sharp tool.</li>
            <li> be more sharp.</li>
            <li> You have to hold the shaver very flat and use light pressure.</li>
            <li> High quality and highly recommend for replacement blades for the callus shaving tool.</li>
            <li> I live in Massachusetts and they don&#x27;t allow salons to use Callus Shavers, probably a good thing since they only require nail techs have 100 hours training before letting them loose on the public, but I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really sharp and will lightly shave the callus away</li>
            <li> Fits shaver and works like it was new.  </li>
            <li> One day I may have the courage to try them again, but until then I will live in fear.</li>
            <li> These are super sharp, so don;t apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I actually didnt have a Tweezerman brand handle, but it fit so they must be universal.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I tried this brand and it is fantastic, very sharp and shaves off my tough calloses safely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for replacement callus plane blades for years, and it was good to find the same quality blades - indeed, the same manufacturer - as I had used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I love doing this myself, but have had a hard time finding the replacement blades in the store.</li>
            <li> Remember to use this tool right after the shower, it wont work properly on dry feet!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll have to re-order more of these for at least 2 years.</li>
            <li> and now I have whole bunch and can replace them regularly.  </li>
            <li> If you see blood, you have gone WAYYY to far.</li>
            <li> That &amp;#34;walking on ball-bearing&amp;#34; feeling is when one or more of the sweat glands becomes clogged and the only way to get relief is to remove the dead tissue that is causing the discomfort.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, it turned out they were, it&#x27;s completely unnecessary to purchase an additional shaver if you already own one.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how sharp these little devils are when they&#x27;re fresh out of the box!!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the dull ones that originally came with my callus shaver when it was new.</li>
            <li> These blades take the extra dry skin right off.</li>
            <li> This cuts off the dead skin, very well!!</li>
            <li> I love this for very thick calluses.</li>
            <li> This tool is the only thing that removes them completely.</li>
            <li> These blades are for use in the same devise used at the salon where I used to get professional pedicures.</li>
            <li> I get thick callouses on my heels in the summer time (thanks to flip flops) and I am an avid cook so my knives give me callouses on my fingers too.</li>
            <li> Please be aware this can be dangerous if you remove too much too quickly.</li>
            <li> the blades are not so sharp and they do not remove much of callus.</li>
            <li> These are harder to find in this amount at a decent price and they work well too.</li>
            <li> I just make sure the hard portions are gone, careful not to go too deep.</li>
            <li> So each blade actually has 4 sharp surfaces before you have to toss the whole thing and use another.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp, only get 1 use per blade.</li>
            <li> I tried them on soft skin, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and only require adult usage, Not recommended for juveniles use.</li>
            <li> Twenty blades will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am carefully using the new sharp blade to maintain my feet.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN A LONG FAN OF TWEEZERMANS&#x27; PRODUCTS UNTIL NOW.</li>
            <li> I spent entire kit on 2 sessions</li>
            <li> These are hard to find but I got them on Amazon in quantity, German-made, sharp and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I do lots of hiking &amp; the only other way to deal with</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, evenly cut, and properly flexible.</li>
            <li> and if I forget to dry it off or leave in the shower and it rusts, who cares!  </li>
            <li> But because they are often hard to find in the brick &amp; mortar stores, I&#x27;ll definitely not waste my time looking and will just order from here.</li>
            <li> it is not what I expected</li>
            <li> I understand these are not legal in some states&#x27; salons anymore.</li>
            <li> But be careful because they are EXTREMELY sharp.</li>
            <li> Sharp</li>
            <li> I have callouses on my feet because I take long hikes everyday for exercise.  </li>
            <li> These things are really sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp as all heck</li>
            <li> Blades are sharper than any other blade in the Realm.  </li>
            <li> When one side becomes dull, simply flip it over and use the other side.</li>
            <li> Only use this product on thick calluses on the ball and heel of your foot.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blade.</li>
            <li> I have super bad dead skin build up on my heels and have to do a self-pedi about once a week.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to get down to the raw skin</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the amount of dead skin shavings that come off my feet after just a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li> Purchased a few boxes to have on hand to use with my Tweezerman Callus Shaver.  </li>
            <li> No more sanding or using a file.</li>
            <li> If you hold it at even the tiniest degree of elevation and use any pressure you&#x27;ll take of chunks of skin which will leave your foot raw and hurt a lot!  </li>
            <li> This item was hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I FOUND THESE BLADES TO BE SO DULL</li>
            <li> Get rid of all my hard callouses with one side.  </li>
            <li> The heel has to be at least 4 inches</li>
            <li> but if they were thick they would not be as functional as they are.</li>
            <li> I cut myself pretty badly and have been afraid of them since.  </li>
            <li> I mean this!</li>
            <li> They are very thin</li>
            <li> I have to say that every month or so when the evil dry feet come around</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to use this with the remover.  </li>
            <li> I will not buy these ever again--totally useless!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find these blades in stores, and when you do find them, they cost about $4 for one blade.</li>
            <li> I gouged one area of my toe so badly it bled and needed a bandaid for 3 days.</li>
            <li> and they scare the crap out of me when I have to change them.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought these to replace the dull ones that originally came with my callus shaver when it was new. I had forgotten how sharp these little devils are when they&#x27;re fresh out of the box!!! Use with a very light touch. I mean this! I gouged one area of my toe so badly it bled and needed a bandaid for 3 days.That said, these blades are fantastic and my nurse&#x27;s feet really appreciate them. Calluses are not something you want to totally remove because they&#x27;re protecting your feet. However when they are at the point where it feels like you&#x27;re walking on ball-bearings, something needs to be done. That &amp;#34;walking on ball-bearing&amp;#34; feeling is when one or more of the sweat glands becomes clogged and the only way to get relief is to remove the dead tissue that is causing the discomfort. Years ago I had a podiatrist remove it but prefer taking care of this myself in the privacy and convenience of my home. I was amazed at the amount of dead skin shavings that come off my feet after just a few minutes of use. If your feet feel tender, stop! You CAN remove too much of the callus and then your feet will be tender to walk on for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are the standard size which should fit any callus shaver. The way the blade holder is designed it can easily be removed and a fresh one reloaded with no fear of slicing up your fingers. When one side becomes dull, simply flip it over and use the other side. So each blade actually has 4 sharp surfaces before you have to toss the whole thing and use another. I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll have to re-order more of these for at least 2 years. But because they are often hard to find in the brick &amp; mortar stores, I&#x27;ll definitely not waste my time looking and will just order from here.</li>

            <li> Quick delivery and excellent product</li>
            <li> Sharp and I think they are good quality</li>
            <li> This item was hard to find in stores.  I needed replacement blades and found them here.  They are perfect and do the trick.</li>
            <li> Easily fit my existing shaver.  Great quality of blades.  Received my blades the next day!  Would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> A lifetime supply, vs the 2 or 3 pack retail ones available as refills at the drug store.  (Plus, my Walgreen&#x27;s quit carrying them)</li>
            <li> I looked for these in CVS and RiteAid and couldn&#x27;t find them. So happy I found them here- for very cheap!</li>
            <li> Great product, price, and delivered on time</li>
            <li> These blades get the job done. They are very thin but if they were thick they would not be as functional as they are. Good quality. Easy to attach.</li>
            <li> What more can be said? Everything was as advertised. Fits shaver and works like it was new.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Returned with the callus planer as it didn&#x27;t do the job!</li>
            <li> These blades fit my 40 year old Credo callus shaver perfectly and perform as desired. I&#x27;m happy to have found them.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement blades when they are hard to find locally in brick and mortar stores. Always nice to look on Amazon and there it is!</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and works really well.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who want&#x27;s a great deal at a great price!</li>
            <li> Its exactly what it says.  I actually didnt have a Tweezerman brand handle, but it fit so they must be universal.</li>

            <li> I have callouses on my feet because I take long hikes everyday for exercise.  This tool is the only thing that removes them completely.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely amazed me. I can&#x27;t complain.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to use this with the remover.  Have used this four times, and haven&#x27;t cut myself at all.</li>
            <li> You need to buy these for your callus shaver because these blades are smaller than regular double edge blades.  They fix perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for replacement callus plane blades for years, and it was good to find the same quality blades - indeed, the same manufacturer - as I had used in the past.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> good blades, convenient to get on amazon.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN A LONG FAN OF TWEEZERMANS&#x27; PRODUCTS UNTIL NOW. I FOUND THESE BLADES TO BE SO DULL THAT AT WHATEVER PRICE YOU&#x27;LL BE PAYING TOO MUCH. BEING THAT I KNOW THIS PRODUCT, I HOLD THE MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUB QUALITY OF THE BLADES. SUB SEQUENTIALLY, CAUSING ONE TO MAYBE ORDER MORE OFTEN, MAYBE? WELL, I&#x27;M NOT DOING IT, I&#x27;M SWITCHING PRODUCTS. SAVE YOUR MONEY I WISHED I HAD DONE SO!</li>
            <li> This item is an excellent value! It fit my off brand, generic callus shaver. You get a good amount of blades for the money. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> nice sharp blades worked very well good quality product</li>
            <li> These things are really sharp.  I cut myself pretty badly and have been afraid of them since.  One day I may have the courage to try them again, but until then I will live in fear.</li>
            <li> These are harder to find in this amount at a decent price and they work well too.</li>
            <li> These blades are for use in the same devise used at the salon where I used to get professional pedicures. I save lots of money doing my own pedicures, which are absolutely as good as those at the salon.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected. I love this product and you will too!</li>
            <li> Purchased a few boxes to have on hand to use with my Tweezerman Callus Shaver.  Perfect, great deal, shipped quickly.  I am set!</li>
            <li> im glad i found this online. this workd great with my tweezer man. i happy that all the blades we wraped. i will order ths again without a doubt.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought these replacement razors.  Loved the first time.  BEST bang for your buck out there.  Get rid of all my hard callouses with one side.  Arrived in two days to boot.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I tried this brand and it is fantastic, very sharp and shaves off my tough calloses safely.</li>
            <li> shaves real close and fits perfect in my shaver and i got it really fast so i have no issues with this at all great product</li>
            <li> does what it is suppose to do.  I usally have to look all over for these, but I ordered and they came very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d received the tool as a gift and quickly went through the blades. They weren&#x27;t sold where the tool was sold. I was pleased to find them on Amazon, and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any luck finding these replacement blades locally so I decided to order them online &amp; these are a great value!</li>
            <li> Just like the ones in the stores--which I can never find anymore.</li>
            <li> IT WAS ON TIME, GOOD QUALITY, AND GOOD PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s a company that produce good shaver blades.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t even have to leave your house to get this product.</li>
            <li> Very handy and great . Very sharp and only require adult usage, Not recommended for juveniles use. I love the quantity and the price.</li>
            <li> Easy replacement. i am surprised more people don&#x27;t go this route and just replace the blades rather than buy a new shaver</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found this online. It is very difficult to find these blades in stores, and when you do find them, they cost about $4 for one blade.</li>
            <li> The blades fit perfectly and are very sharp so I know they will last a while before I need to replace them again.</li>
            <li> Good price for what you get.  Twenty blades will last a long time.  Good quality and good price.  Best buy.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. Prior to purchase I could not find whether or not these blades were compatible with any callus shaver. Upon arrival, it turned out they were, it&#x27;s completely unnecessary to purchase an additional shaver if you already own one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 of these razors ,  and they work like they are supposed to, LOL....&lt;br /&gt;Very clean feet after I used them , Happy Feet...&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend !!!</li>
            <li> Razor blade,  it cuts!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful solution to home treatment of corns and calluses.  Really works great and there are plenty of replacement blades that fit perfectly into the tweezerman callus shaver.  It&#x27;s a really nifty, effective device.</li>
            <li> These are a great quality and price and fit beautifully in my callus shaver.  Sharp as all heck and they scare the crap out of me when I have to change them.  *shiver*  In other words, a perfect razor blade.</li>
            <li> Meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  What you would expect from a razor.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Would have liked it if the blade and the corn plane ends were labeled, but closer comparison to the blade that came with my shaver revealed that there are 2 lines on the blade end, and 1 line on the corn plane end. So, mystery solved. Great price and blades were sharper than the stock blade.</li>
            <li> Well it just the razor, its great sharp and its doing what it supose to. What can i say..its good product.</li>
            <li> WORKED OUT GREAT. GLAD I FOUND WHERE TO BUY THEM.</li>
            <li> Works great. Came quickly and just as described.</li>
            <li> These callus blades do a remarkable job of removing corns and callus. I would recommend this product to anyone who is having problems with corns are calluses.</li>
            <li> This blades and combo with either argan oil or heel of approval from Bath and Body works will make a very big difference.</li>
            <li> the blades are not so sharp and they do not remove much of callus. it is not what I expected</li>
            <li> Works like it should!</li>
            <li> works great and safely removes callous</li>
            <li> The blades fit my old shaver perfectly.  It is so easy to use it to clean up my foot callus. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Standard blades, very sharp and happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and came in original packaging very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love super hot, super high heel shoes. The heel has to be at least 4 inches or I won&#x27;t even look at them. While super high heel shoes look really sexy on they can definitely leave your feet a bit battered (totally worth it to me though!). I live in Massachusetts and they don&#x27;t allow salons to use Callus Shavers, probably a good thing since they only require nail techs have 100 hours training before letting them loose on the public, but I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist so I&#x27;m comfortable using this product. Please be aware this can be dangerous if you remove too much too quickly. You have to hold the shaver very flat and use light pressure. If you hold it at even the tiniest degree of elevation and use any pressure you&#x27;ll take of chunks of skin which will leave your foot raw and hurt a lot!  You want to lightly shave off the tiniest amount of the callus and check frequently to see how much you have removed. You don&#x27;t want to get down to the raw skin just remove the thickness of the callus and then use a pumice stone to smooth it out. Make sure you soak your foot in warm water right before you start removing the callus. After you use the pumice stone rub some cream on the foot to finish. Only use this product on thick calluses on the ball and heel of your foot. You also want to use a fresh blade every time so it&#x27;s really sharp and will lightly shave the callus away this is why buying in bulk is a good idea if calluses are a problem for you. This is definitely the best price on the internet and believe me I checked everywhere! I always do before I buy anything online and 8 out of 10 times Amazon has the best price. Plus with my Prime membership and free two day shipping I have what I want almost immediately.  This is why I love Amazon because I love a bargain as much as I love super high heels. A bargain on super high heels is nirvana (although sorry Amazon DSW has the best deals on hot shoes!).</li>
            <li> Excellent blades, very sharp and durable.  If you have a callus shaver, these are what you&#x27;re looking for. Thank you</li>
            <li> Not very sharp, only get 1 use per blade. The ones I bought  at Family Dollar lasted longer then theses.</li>
            <li> best refills for the best way to remove dead skin</li>
            <li> High quality and highly recommend for replacement blades for the callus shaving tool.</li>
            <li> The tweezerman callus remover works great, and the magic lies in the blades. These blades to be exact. I get thick callouses on my heels in the summer time (thanks to flip flops) and I am an avid cook so my knives give me callouses on my fingers too. These blades take the extra dry skin right off. Highly recommend the blades, and the tool!</li>
            <li> Fits the J.A. Henckels Callus remover perfectly</li>
            <li> Was trying to find these for a while. Nice and sharp. Exact replacement blades. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I get my brows done once a month. In between I clean them up myself. These are the perfect size to do it.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades. Need to be replaced more frequently if blade is always getting wet as rust builds up quickly.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s probably better to use a pumice stone on your feet, but I still use the blade and the stone.  A lot of times when I look for the refills in the pharmacies, I can never find any, so I am happy that I can order them here now.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to not have to buy a whole new callus shaver!  I pulled the first blade out and it cut through my callus like butter.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> needed em for my callus shaver - glad to find em so cheap</li>
            <li> This cuts off the dead skin, very well!!</li>
            <li> I love this for very thick calluses. I do lots of hiking &amp; the only other way to deal with some of them is literally with a dremel. But be careful because they are EXTREMELY sharp. Which is a good thing, but you just have to watch out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brand because I noticed that at my pharmacy the brand had gotten so cheap that it was like paper...but these are not any better!  I will not buy these ever again--totally useless!</li>
            <li> You really need to change the blades often for shaving weightlifting/crossfit calluses from your hands.  These work great.</li>
            <li> I had bought blade replacements before, but these are the best i have bought.  They are very sharp and work great.  The price was great compared to local shopping places.  I will get these again.</li>
            <li> Razors are breaking at once. I tried them on soft skin, dry skin. Result is the same. I spent entire kit on 2 sessions</li>
            <li> Worked perfect with my tweezerman callus shaver...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t kow if it is possible, but these seem to be sharper than the ones from the local store.  i will continue to get these.</li>
            <li> Comes in a tiny package.  You get two tiny boxes with the blades.  They fit the tweezerman and do the job! So if you want to save some money just get the replacment blades.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon, couldn&#x27;t find any where else and they are of top quality at a super price</li>
            <li> I have super bad dead skin build up on my heels and have to do a self-pedi about once a week.  Just discovered these and they are perfect, cheap, work well and if I forget to dry it off or leave in the shower and it rusts, who cares!  Next time I&#x27;m going to get the bigger box!</li>
            <li> An excellent replacement for the originals that came with the item. Can&#x27;t seem to find them in stores anymore. I am carefully using the new sharp blade to maintain my feet.</li>
            <li> my wife loves then a great tool</li>
            <li> So happy I found these. Originally bought the tool from Rite Aid but they didn&#x27;t sell the razor replacement. I literally used my last one for over a year. Found these and they fit perfectly and now I have whole bunch and can replace them regularly.  Remember to use this tool right after the shower, it wont work properly on dry feet!</li>
            <li> Great blades...wish they were available in a smaller amount.</li>
            <li> the Tweezerman Callus Shaver Replacement Blades the razor and works great on removing the callus on my feet would tell anyone to use it</li>
            <li> These are the best blades for callus shavers. They are very sharp, evenly cut, and properly flexible. They are compatible with most standard shavers, so it&#x27;s a fairly sure thing that you&#x27;ll get the right blades right away. I&#x27;ve always been pleased with Tweezerman products, and these are not an exception.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband and he is very pleased with them.Has lots of callus on his feet. This product works great.</li>
            <li> Always a great product.  Really removes the calluses but you must take care not to cut your feet.  Very sharp blade.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Tweezerman product from Amazon and it was time to replace the blades. They get the job done, but the blade that came with the product was a lot sharper.</li>
            <li> I love doing this myself, but have had a hard time finding the replacement blades in the store. These are super sharp, so don;t apply too much pressure. You will pay for it the next day with sore feet. I just make sure the hard portions are gone, careful not to go too deep. If you see blood, you have gone WAYYY to far.</li>
            <li> The quality is very good and they work as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find but I got them on Amazon in quantity, German-made, sharp and very reasonably priced. They are perfect in my shaver and cut down calluses that accumulate on the balls of my feet by paring away paper-thin slices which allows for careful precision when this needs to be done. Use with caution. I understand these are not legal in some states&#x27; salons anymore. You&#x27;ve got to know what you&#x27;re doing when you used these.</li>
            <li> it is not working well that i expected.&lt;br /&gt;it did not shave callus well enough.&lt;br /&gt;should be more sharp. thanks</li>
            <li> A few years most work the best for me. I tried other means but this product works best.  The best for Callus</li>
            <li> For this kind of price you can&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> After needing help to figure out how to use the appliance that these blades go in, it&#x27;s a wonderful gadget - the callus shaver. Was very glad to get the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped! Just what I needed. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Takes a little skill to learn how to use, but these will solve your feet problems if you have enthusiastic callouses!</li>
            <li> Great! I love it! I&#x27;ve said all I need to say about the product. I&#x27;d recommend it. I do not have anymore to say about this product.</li>
            <li> Das ist guter verkaufer</li>
            <li> I have to say that every month or so when the evil dry feet come around I am able to fight back now.  Blades are sharper than any other blade in the Realm.  Not even my blacksmith good create such a dangerously sharp tool.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast service</li>
            <li> Good deal.  The callus shaver is the best thing since sliced bread.  No more sanding or using a file.</li>
            <li> great product, have been using then for over a decade.</li>
            <li> Works well and price is right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a pedicure in the winter months via the Nail Shop, but I do my own at home and these fit just fine in my Callus Shaver.</li>
            <li> I paid twice as much for a pack of these at a local store, so very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> These Tweezerman Callus Shaver Replacement Blades totally replaced the blades in my Tweezerman Callus Shaver.  And when we use up these ones, I&#x27;ll probably order some more.</li>
