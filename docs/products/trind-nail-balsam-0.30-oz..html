    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The Trind Nail Balsam is an excellent moisturiser for nails and cuticles.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product; recommend it to friends all the time.</li>
            <li>I find I get the best results by removing my polish and using this nail balsam 2 or 3 times a day on the days that I don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Excellent product..</li>
            <li>my nails are in the best shape ever ..</li>
            <li>THANK YOU, TRIND, for giving me what I never thought I could have - nails that I feel good about!</li>
            <li>The Trind line of nail care works great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy because that nail always split along one of the ridges.  </li>
            <li>this is great stuff.</li>
            <li>This Trind nail balsam is a wonderful healthy treat for your nails.  </li>
            <li>Nail polish stays looking good without peeling for almost two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I would say this is good stuff</li>
            <li>was so good</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it here,for a great price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased w/the Trind nail products.</li>
            <li>And the Balsam moisturizes so my nails are still very healthy and don&#x27;t split.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I just cannot find anything else that adds moisture better than Trind!</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying the routine also!</li>
            <li>These three products are effective in moderating nail defects.  </li>
            <li>Kind of buffed the surface also.  </li>
            <li>Much to my great surprise and delight, my nails are significantly stronger than ever before.</li>
            <li>I began using the Balsam and Nail Repair about six months ago and have lovely nails again.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>So I looked elsewhere online, and was able to find it.</li>
            <li>I hope others have better results, but for me, I&#x27;m tossing this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the grind products.  </li>
            <li>( DHC was better than Estee Lauder).  </li>
            <li>okay?</li>
            <li>Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Then I rub it into the nail and reapply more Balsam for another 1/2 hr.</li>
            <li>and my nails are even better than before.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m enjoying my healthier nails</li>
            <li>Be sure and try it...</li>
            <li>I love that this is oil free so I can rub the liquid in to moisturize my nails after allowing it to sit on them for two minutes as directed then immediately paint my nails.</li>
            <li>This has kept my nails from splitting and cracking and made them strong and flexible WITHOUT FORMALDEHYDE.  </li>
            <li>had all but given up on the prospect of any product working for me until I read something that confirmed what I&#x27;d suspected for some time</li>
            <li>Primarily, I feel this is an excellent value because the amount of product you&#x27;re getting for the price goes a pretty long way.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have significant problems, just some dryness and light ridges.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the balsam and the trind nail repair together for two months in a row and my nails are as strong as it was when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have always had pretty healthy nails</li>
            <li>I will then go to the salon or do my own gel nails at home depending on (I can&#x27;t get mine to last more than 2-3 weeks--</li>
            <li>I am still searching for a good strengthener/protector to wear on work days to protect my fragile nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But to be fair, I bought another brand at another beauty store, and my nails felt the same way.</li>
            <li>I have one nail that has ridges the full length of the nail.</li>
            <li>HAD soft, peeling nails, but now my nails are strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Made a huge positive difference!  </li>
            <li>My nails are strong, my cuticles neat and hands are pretty.</li>
            <li>This triplet of products alleviated her problems better than several nail-hardening products she had tried.  </li>
            <li>I have never used anything that made as significant a  positive difference as this product.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, here is what I did -</li>
            <li>For me it has been worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product was nice for a few weeks, then my cuticles were becoming more and more dry.</li>
            <li>This product is quick and easy and not messy to use.  </li>
            <li>It just soaks right into my nails and cuticles giving them the moisture they need.  </li>
            <li>so I started using that and was amazed to see an improvement right away.  </li>
            <li>I had tried several nail hardeners, Nailtek, Nailtique, Sally Hansen, OPI -- but they actually did more harm than good, making the nails more brittle and even yellow.  </li>
            <li>So in reality, the nail balsam&#x27;s dry your nails MORE!</li>
            <li>it was a short love affair.</li>
            <li>I finally found that my cuticles were better on the days I forgot to use this product.</li>
            <li>My cuticles and nails have been gross for so many years</li>
            <li>They were breaking and peeling consistently .</li>
            <li>exactly</li>
            <li>After the first 2 (even 3) weeks, my nails seemed a bit stronger, but they were still flimsy and still cracking at the sides.</li>
            <li>my* nails, I&#x27;m confident that it can help many, if not most others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first application.</li>
            <li>after using many different products.  </li>
            <li>my absolute fav nail stuff!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d pretty much lost hope that anything else was a possibility for me</li>
            <li>It worked as long as I was faithful to the regiment--every time I&#x27;d forget for more than a week they&#x27;d start splitting and breaking.  </li>
            <li>However, given how resistant to other products my nails have always been and how dramatically they&#x27;ve improved with Trind, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a fair try.</li>
            <li>My nails felt more dry and brittle after applying it.</li>
            <li>I really like how my nails look and feel after I use this treatment.</li>
            <li>But now I was worried about the long-term affects of that much acetone on my nails every time I soaked off the gel polish.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped my nails.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried other products, but this is the only one that has worked to give me good looking nails.</li>
            <li>My nails are strong, it&#x27;s the skin around them that gets dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>-  Essentially, products that are brushed on one layer on-top of another really can&#x27;t make a significant difference for nails in need of real help because the fresh product doesn&#x27;t make contact with (and thus can&#x27;t penetrate) the nail&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li>how different the over-all condition of my nails is right now for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>After 6 weeks of frequent use (much more frequent than prescribed), I&#x27;ve only gone through about 2/3.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My high hopes were shredded.</li>
            <li>No matter how quickly I acted or how tiny the initial split was, nothing would prevent these splits from progressing right across the nail.</li>
            <li>They require regular application and patience, but the results are well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and thought I was doomed, but last winter  I started to rub an eye cream that I&#x27;d purchased long ago into the nail and the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>For y-e-a-r-s my nails split and peeled so that the only course of action I had was to file them to the quick.</li>
            <li>Each day, the previous day&#x27;s layer must be removed with non-acetone polish remover and replaced with a fresh coat of Nail Balsam, followed by a fresh coat of</li>
            <li>Let me be clear - my mind was open enough to allow Trind a fair shot, but I definitely did not expect major results because frankly, I&#x27;ve heard it all before and products that are near-universally miraculous for others have never worked for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s only in the last 2 weeks (weeks 5 and 6 of consistent use) that I&#x27;ve started going &amp;#34;Woah, are these really MY nails?&amp;#34; If you&#x27;re starting out with super- crummy nails like mine, I recommend you go in expecting it to take a month of consistent, proper use (maybe even a little more) before you&#x27;re jumping for joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last winter I realized that my nails might have been peeling and soft most of my life because they were dry.  </li>
            <li>I have very soft nails</li>
            <li>This product along with the polish makes my nails look very professional.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to do the exact opposite of what it was suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not advertised as such, in my experience there were two critical components (two separate Trind products) to my significant nail improvement.</li>
            <li>and this is the first product that I&#x27;ve used that actually helps me grow my nails longer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, I did find one other product that seemed to make my nails a tiny bit stronger, but before trying Trind, they never got more than a little less flimsy and they never stopped splitting at the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Before using Trind, absolutely nothing, however highly recommended or raved about, helped enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to report that for the past 6 weeks, I have been using the Trind Nail Repair and Nail Balsam and they have actually *</li>
            <li>Although Trind seems confident that 2 weeks of daily use should be long enough to heal what ails your nails (heh!), in my case it took longer.</li>
            <li>After only a couple of applications, the nails are smoother, the ridges seem to be less prominent and the nails look and feel healthier.  </li>
            <li>which was that in order to see true improvement of real problem nails, both of these must be applied to naked nails daily for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>So far, everyone is in agreement with me.......</li>
            <li>So much so, that a couple of my nails literally broke off at the tips shortly after applying.</li>
            <li>Please note that this review is almost identical to the one I left for Trind Nail Repair because I used both products in order to see real improvement</li>
            <li>This product seems gentle enough, and appears to be working in getting my nails to grow.</li>
            <li>Really helps if you are following the Trind regimen!!</li>
            <li>I thought it is a sign of old age or dehydration----One review</li>
            <li>My nails had developed vertical ridges and one had a groove, probably from some injury, that caused continual splitting.  </li>
            <li>Then somewhere I read that dryness is frequently the underlying problem.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just say this because it works so much better than other, more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Not only have I had to file down my left hand to allow my right nails to catch up (I&#x27;m right handed and that side seems to be growing at a slower pace), but the ridges are not as deep as they used to be.  </li>
            <li>I had searched for &amp;#34;Trind Cuticle balsam&amp;#34;, which is my absolute life savor when it comes to dry skin around my nails, and this product came up</li>
            <li>* how I finally made my crummy nails much nicer, I will offer some info/advice below that I obtained from some  customer reviews at various sites around the web:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recently, no matter what, my nails had two main (possibly related) issues: 1.</li>
            <li>The whites are thicker and seem tougher and the nails seem healthier in general.</li>
            <li>So i searched for a fingernail moisturizer for both of us and was surprised to find such a thing.  </li>
            <li>so believe me, I&#x27;ve been watching out for the possibility that something other than Trind is responsible.</li>
            <li>I am using only the nail balsam, and no other products.  </li>
            <li>I have never had any length to my nails and they were thin and broke easily.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly though, I&#x27;ve been nothing short of shocked by the dramatic decrease in the ever-present splitting/cracking for the first time EVAR.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I would nurture any tiny amount of growth (with topical treatments, proper unidirectional filing, etc), the little white tips would always, always start splitting at the side some time before reaching about 1/8 inch.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My high hopes were shredded.</li>
            <li> No matter how quickly I acted or how tiny the initial split was, nothing would prevent these splits from progressing right across the nail.</li>
            <li> They require regular application and patience, but the results are well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and thought I was doomed, but last winter  I started to rub an eye cream that I&#x27;d purchased long ago into the nail and the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> For y-e-a-r-s my nails split and peeled so that the only course of action I had was to file them to the quick.</li>
            <li> Each day, the previous day&#x27;s layer must be removed with non-acetone polish remover and replaced with a fresh coat of Nail Balsam, followed by a fresh coat of</li>
            <li> Let me be clear - my mind was open enough to allow Trind a fair shot, but I definitely did not expect major results because frankly, I&#x27;ve heard it all before and products that are near-universally miraculous for others have never worked for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s only in the last 2 weeks (weeks 5 and 6 of consistent use) that I&#x27;ve started going &amp;#34;Woah, are these really MY nails?&amp;#34; If you&#x27;re starting out with super- crummy nails like mine, I recommend you go in expecting it to take a month of consistent, proper use (maybe even a little more) before you&#x27;re jumping for joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last winter I realized that my nails might have been peeling and soft most of my life because they were dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very soft nails</li>
            <li> This product along with the polish makes my nails look very professional.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to do the exact opposite of what it was suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not advertised as such, in my experience there were two critical components (two separate Trind products) to my significant nail improvement.</li>
            <li> and this is the first product that I&#x27;ve used that actually helps me grow my nails longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, I did find one other product that seemed to make my nails a tiny bit stronger, but before trying Trind, they never got more than a little less flimsy and they never stopped splitting at the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Before using Trind, absolutely nothing, however highly recommended or raved about, helped enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to report that for the past 6 weeks, I have been using the Trind Nail Repair and Nail Balsam and they have actually *</li>
            <li> Although Trind seems confident that 2 weeks of daily use should be long enough to heal what ails your nails (heh!), in my case it took longer.</li>
            <li> After only a couple of applications, the nails are smoother, the ridges seem to be less prominent and the nails look and feel healthier.  </li>
            <li> which was that in order to see true improvement of real problem nails, both of these must be applied to naked nails daily for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> So far, everyone is in agreement with me.......</li>
            <li> So much so, that a couple of my nails literally broke off at the tips shortly after applying.</li>
            <li> Please note that this review is almost identical to the one I left for Trind Nail Repair because I used both products in order to see real improvement</li>
            <li> This product seems gentle enough, and appears to be working in getting my nails to grow.</li>
            <li> Really helps if you are following the Trind regimen!!</li>
            <li> I thought it is a sign of old age or dehydration----One review</li>
            <li> My nails had developed vertical ridges and one had a groove, probably from some injury, that caused continual splitting.  </li>
            <li> Then somewhere I read that dryness is frequently the underlying problem.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just say this because it works so much better than other, more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Not only have I had to file down my left hand to allow my right nails to catch up (I&#x27;m right handed and that side seems to be growing at a slower pace), but the ridges are not as deep as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> I had searched for &amp;#34;Trind Cuticle balsam&amp;#34;, which is my absolute life savor when it comes to dry skin around my nails, and this product came up</li>
            <li> * how I finally made my crummy nails much nicer, I will offer some info/advice below that I obtained from some  customer reviews at various sites around the web:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recently, no matter what, my nails had two main (possibly related) issues: 1.</li>
            <li> The whites are thicker and seem tougher and the nails seem healthier in general.</li>
            <li> So i searched for a fingernail moisturizer for both of us and was surprised to find such a thing.  </li>
            <li> so believe me, I&#x27;ve been watching out for the possibility that something other than Trind is responsible.</li>
            <li> I am using only the nail balsam, and no other products.  </li>
            <li> I have never had any length to my nails and they were thin and broke easily.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly though, I&#x27;ve been nothing short of shocked by the dramatic decrease in the ever-present splitting/cracking for the first time EVAR.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I would nurture any tiny amount of growth (with topical treatments, proper unidirectional filing, etc), the little white tips would always, always start splitting at the side some time before reaching about 1/8 inch.</li>
            <li> or I would have), but other than that I&#x27;ve been as diligent as possible and as far as I can tell, the only thing that could account for the drastic change is Trind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dryness, not an absence of hardness.  </li>
            <li> know that this brand may seem expensive at first glance, but let me assure you that from my perspective, it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> However, when I was preparing for a month long vacation, I got intrigued with gel nails and decided to give them a try since I didn&#x27;t want to haul along all the extra bottles plus take the time.</li>
            <li> Following that, I applied every other day (same application routine as above) for about a week, and then I resumed near-daily use about a week ago.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, made my weak and painful nails feel better almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t read other testimonials saying 2 weeks wasn&#x27;t quite enough to see results (and in some cases, that it took several weeks for the WOW-style improvement), I might have given up.</li>
            <li> your initial purchase will last a little over 2 months, and if you use it as recommended, you&#x27;ll probably get enough product for 3 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who wish to know *</li>
            <li> I have recommended these products to several people, with peeling, chipping or other nail problems.  </li>
            <li> The honest-to-goodness truth is that in the last 2 weeks, my nails have grown little white tips that haven&#x27;t split and/or needed to be trimmed off at all!</li>
            <li> My nails had this \\&quot;weird\\&quot; feeling, almost as though this stuff drained the life out them, and were terribly dry.</li>
            <li> and when I stop nails get all dry again....</li>
            <li> By about the 3rd time I was showing a few white dry spots on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Although Trind prescribes the above routine daily for the first two weeks followed by a break and then intermittent application a couple of times a week, my nails were bad enough that I chose to follow guidelines I found in a number of reviews.</li>
            <li> Because they would always occur right where the nail bed ended and the tip began, if left unattended the inevitable result was a painful, unsightly (occasionally infected) mess.</li>
            <li> I have the pink Trind cuticle balsam too, but I find the Nail Balsam works just as well for both</li>
            <li> , it said it was the cuticle balsam, even showed a picture of the cuticle balsam (it being pink) but the product I was sent was the nail balsam- to help brittle nails, not the skin around them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably take a break for a few days again now and then do every other day (3 or 4 times a week) for awhile before I drop back to twice a week or less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the past 2 decades, I&#x27;ve spoken to about a billion nail techs and tried everything they recommended from brush-on treatments (e.g. Nailtiques, Pink Armor, etc) to lotions (e.g. Mane N&#x27; Tail Hoof Maker) to dietary remedies (e.g. gelatin, various vitamins).</li>
            <li> Also my husband has been annoyed that  a particular nail he needs for playing the guitar  keeps chipping and splitting.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day, followed by the Trind Nail Repair.  </li>
            <li> and I tried dozens of other products.</li>
            <li> I am endlessly searching for something to stop them from tearing and peeling.</li>
            <li> They were extremely weak/thin and overly flexible.</li>
            <li> so like all other polish does on me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how the salon does it--but on the other side it is cheaper at home.)  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t regret the money spent!</li>
            <li> (my nails were always so weird even high-end salon artificials would pop right off after a few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What an expense and not GOOD for my nails or my health in general.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that&#x27;s made a difference on my weak and peeling nails</li>
            <li> This is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I started using Trind nail repair almost 10 years ago when i went to a salon where they used it to bring my poor overused nails back to life.  </li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day as directed by the company I&#x27;m seeing faster growth (no miracle, but slightly faster than usual).</li>
            <li> What I mean by this is, they&#x27;re much less flexible and they feel thicker and &amp;#34;harder.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My nails used to have deep vertical ridges which allowed them to painfully split down to my nail bed.  </li>
            <li> The gel polish keeps them hard so they don&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> My wife had life-long nail problems -- weak, splintering, a mess!  </li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s what it did to mine.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot over-state</li>
            <li> I used to have weak nails for almost 8 years.</li>
            <li> I am an artist and cleaning brushes all day is tough on my nails.</li>
            <li> had been experiencing in the changing seasons and with a job which is tough on my nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I must start by explaining that life-long, I have had terrible, stubby nails with problems that were resistant to absolutely every remedy I could find (specifics below).</li>
            <li> Since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve typically worn my nails in this ugly, stubby condition</li>
            <li> I recommend Trind products, expensive though they are.</li>
            <li> Quite the accomplishment for one who continually failed to grow them because of splits.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I did.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Trind didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t work for my spouse, and the jury is still out on me as i can&#x27;t give up my eye cream trick</li>
            <li> Granted, I haven&#x27;t done a blind trial of Trind versus a placebo (I didn&#x27;t have someone to help with it every day</li>
            <li> I am a nurse, so my hands are in soap and water or alcohol based cleansers repeatedly on work days and my nails are in deplorable condition.</li>
            <li> and my nails got bad.</li>
            <li> Gel nail polish turned my nails into the very bad condition.  </li>
            <li> My nails felt HORRIBLE after applying this balsam.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product! I am glad I found it here,for a great price</li>
            <li> These three products are effective in moderating nail defects.  They require regular application and patience, but the results are well worth the effort.  My wife had life-long nail problems -- weak, splintering, a mess!  This triplet of products alleviated her problems better than several nail-hardening products she had tried.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Trind Nail Balsam is an excellent moisturiser for nails and cuticles.  I have the pink Trind cuticle balsam too, but I find the Nail Balsam works just as well for both and I won&#x27;t re-order the cuticle balsam.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle of the nail balsam.  I use it every other day, followed by the Trind Nail Repair.  It&#x27;s the only product that&#x27;s made a difference on my weak and peeling nails and I tried dozens of other products.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; recommend it to friends all the time. Haven&#x27;t had split or peeling nails in YEARS. No \\&quot;fake\\&quot; nails for me!</li>
            <li> I have recommended these products to several people, with peeling, chipping or other nail problems.  So far, everyone is in agreement with me.......THEY WORK!!</li>
            <li> Trind has changed my nails. I began using the Balsam and Nail Repair about six months ago and have lovely nails again. For y-e-a-r-s my nails split and peeled so that the only course of action I had was to file them to the quick. OPI, Mavala, Nalitiques, Daby, etc., etc., did nothing. I recommend Trind products, expensive though they are.</li>
            <li> I have never had any length to my nails and they were thin and broke easily.  I found and ad for TRind Nail repair and started using it.  I now have lengthly nails (I have to cut them now) Nail polish stays looking good without peeling for almost two weeks.  I have tried other products, but this is the only one that has worked to give me good looking nails. I love these products.</li>
            <li> I think this product has helped my nails become healthier.  I didn&#x27;t have significant problems, just some dryness and light ridges.  I used to get acrylic nails done every two weeks.  What an expense and not GOOD for my nails or my health in general.  I&#x27;m very pleased w/the Trind nail products.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with their Nail Polish Remover and Nail Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I HAD soft, peeling nails, but now my nails are strong and healthy.  Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like how my nails look and feel after I use this treatment. I find I get the best results by removing my polish and using this nail balsam 2 or 3 times a day on the days that I don&#x27;t work. I am a nurse, so my hands are in soap and water or alcohol based cleansers repeatedly on work days and my nails are in deplorable condition. I am endlessly searching for something to stop them from tearing and peeling. This product seems to help to moisturize them on the days that I don&#x27;t work. I am still searching for a good strengthener/protector to wear on work days to protect my fragile nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edited Jan 28, 2013** it was a short love affair. This product was nice for a few weeks, then my cuticles were becoming more and more dry. I finally found that my cuticles were better on the days I forgot to use this product. I have moved on to another product.</li>
            <li> This Trind nail balsam is a wonderful healthy treat for your nails.  I have been using it for about a year.  I have seen a difference in my nails and cuticles.  It just soaks right into my nails and cuticles giving them the moisture they need.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands ALOT in my line of work. My cuticles and nails have been gross for so many years I had just decided \\&quot;these are nurses hands\\&quot;. Not anymore. The Trind line of nail care works great. My nails are strong, my cuticles neat and hands are pretty. Buy this product!</li>
            <li> I am an artist and cleaning brushes all day is tough on my nails. They were breaking and peeling consistently . My manicurist suggested this nail balsam and within 2 weeks I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! My nails used to have deep vertical ridges which allowed them to painfully split down to my nail bed.  I&#x27;ve been using Trind Nail Balsam by itself (2x day), for a week now.  Not only have I had to file down my left hand to allow my right nails to catch up (I&#x27;m right handed and that side seems to be growing at a slower pace), but the ridges are not as deep as they used to be.  My nails look hydrated, and I have about an 1/8\\&quot; length on ALL 10 fingernails.  Quite the accomplishment for one who continually failed to grow them because of splits.  I give this product an A+.</li>
            <li> I did not buy it from Amazon. I tried to, but the seller was out of stock. So I looked elsewhere online, and was able to find it. I&#x27;m sorry I did. My nails felt HORRIBLE after applying this balsam. My nails felt more dry and brittle after applying it. So much so, that a couple of my nails literally broke off at the tips shortly after applying. And I did NOT break them. My nails had this \\&quot;weird\\&quot; feeling, almost as though this stuff drained the life out them, and were terribly dry. NO moisture at all. It seemed to do the exact opposite of what it was suppose to do.  But to be fair, I bought another brand at another beauty store, and my nails felt the same way. So in reality, the nail balsam&#x27;s dry your nails MORE! At least it&#x27;s what it did to mine. My high hopes were shredded. I hope others have better results, but for me, I&#x27;m tossing this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the grind products.  Helps to hydrate my nails so they don&#x27;t crack or split.</li>
            <li> Last winter I realized that my nails might have been peeling and soft most of my life because they were dry.  I&#x27;ve tried many products and thought I was doomed, but last winter  I started to rub an eye cream that I&#x27;d purchased long ago into the nail and the cuticle.  Kind of buffed the surface also.  Figured that I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose.  Made a huge positive difference!  Also my husband has been annoyed that  a particular nail he needs for playing the guitar  keeps chipping and splitting.  So i searched for a fingernail moisturizer for both of us and was surprised to find such a thing.  Unfortunately the Trind didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t work for my spouse, and the jury is still out on me as i can&#x27;t give up my eye cream trick ( DHC was better than Estee Lauder).  Have been using the Butter London polish occasionally as well....  Will let you know later if this works well for me in the future.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, made my weak and painful nails feel better almost instantly.  Daily use and I am seeing improvements in just over a week.</li>
            <li> Please note that this review is almost identical to the one I left for Trind Nail Repair because I used both products in order to see real improvement and I saw no reason to write two different rave testimonials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise that what you&#x27;re about to read is a legitimate customer review and not an advertisement or commercial product endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must start by explaining that life-long, I have had terrible, stubby nails with problems that were resistant to absolutely every remedy I could find (specifics below). Over the past 2 decades, I&#x27;ve spoken to about a billion nail techs and tried everything they recommended from brush-on treatments (e.g. Nailtiques, Pink Armor, etc) to lotions (e.g. Mane N&#x27; Tail Hoof Maker) to dietary remedies (e.g. gelatin, various vitamins). Before using Trind, absolutely nothing, however highly recommended or raved about, helped enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until recently, no matter what, my nails had two main (possibly related) issues: 1. They were extremely weak/thin and overly flexible. 2. No matter how much I would nurture any tiny amount of growth (with topical treatments, proper unidirectional filing, etc), the little white tips would always, always start splitting at the side some time before reaching about 1/8 inch. No matter how quickly I acted or how tiny the initial split was, nothing would prevent these splits from progressing right across the nail. Because they would always occur right where the nail bed ended and the tip began, if left unattended the inevitable result was a painful, unsightly (occasionally infected) mess. Thus once a split would start, I had no choice but to clip the entire tip off. Since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve typically worn my nails in this ugly, stubby condition and I&#x27;d pretty much lost hope that anything else was a possibility for me (my nails were always so weird even high-end salon artificials would pop right off after a few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I did find one other product that seemed to make my nails a tiny bit stronger, but before trying Trind, they never got more than a little less flimsy and they never stopped splitting at the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had all but given up on the prospect of any product working for me until I read something that confirmed what I&#x27;d suspected for some time -  Essentially, products that are brushed on one layer on-top of another really can&#x27;t make a significant difference for nails in need of real help because the fresh product doesn&#x27;t make contact with (and thus can&#x27;t penetrate) the nail&#x27;s surface. This, combined with the countless Trind testimonials all over the web inspired me to give it a try. Let me be clear - my mind was open enough to allow Trind a fair shot, but I definitely did not expect major results because frankly, I&#x27;ve heard it all before and products that are near-universally miraculous for others have never worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to report that for the past 6 weeks, I have been using the Trind Nail Repair and Nail Balsam and they have actually *drastically* improved my nails! Much to my great surprise and delight, my nails are significantly stronger than ever before. What I mean by this is, they&#x27;re much less flexible and they feel thicker and &amp;#34;harder.&amp;#34; Most importantly though, I&#x27;ve been nothing short of shocked by the dramatic decrease in the ever-present splitting/cracking for the first time EVAR. I say &amp;#34;dramatic decrease&amp;#34; because I&#x27;m scared to jinx it. okay? The honest-to-goodness truth is that in the last 2 weeks, my nails have grown little white tips that haven&#x27;t split and/or needed to be trimmed off at all! I seriously cannot over-state how different the over-all condition of my nails is right now for the first time in my life. I&#x27;m a scientist so believe me, I&#x27;ve been watching out for the possibility that something other than Trind is responsible. Granted, I haven&#x27;t done a blind trial of Trind versus a placebo (I didn&#x27;t have someone to help with it every day or I would have), but other than that I&#x27;ve been as diligent as possible and as far as I can tell, the only thing that could account for the drastic change is Trind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this brand may seem expensive at first glance, but let me assure you that from my perspective, it really isn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t just say this because it works so much better than other, more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried. Primarily, I feel this is an excellent value because the amount of product you&#x27;re getting for the price goes a pretty long way. After 6 weeks of frequent use (much more frequent than prescribed), I&#x27;ve only gone through about 2/3. So figure if you use it as often as I have (see below) your initial purchase will last a little over 2 months, and if you use it as recommended, you&#x27;ll probably get enough product for 3 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who wish to know *exactly* how I finally made my crummy nails much nicer, I will offer some info/advice below that I obtained from some  customer reviews at various sites around the web:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Although it&#x27;s not advertised as such, in my experience there were two critical components (two separate Trind products) to my significant nail improvement. These are Trind Nail Repair *and* Trind Nail Balsam. I followed what I&#x27;d read in several reviews which was that in order to see true improvement of real problem nails, both of these must be applied to naked nails daily for the first few weeks. Each day, the previous day&#x27;s layer must be removed with non-acetone polish remover and replaced with a fresh coat of Nail Balsam, followed by a fresh coat of Nail Repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Although Trind prescribes the above routine daily for the first two weeks followed by a break and then intermittent application a couple of times a week, my nails were bad enough that I chose to follow guidelines I found in a number of reviews. For what it&#x27;s worth, here is what I did - I used both products religiously every day (as described above) for 3 weeks solid and then took a break for about 4 days. Following that, I applied every other day (same application routine as above) for about a week, and then I resumed near-daily use about a week ago. I&#x27;ll probably take a break for a few days again now and then do every other day (3 or 4 times a week) for awhile before I drop back to twice a week or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Although Trind seems confident that 2 weeks of daily use should be long enough to heal what ails your nails (heh!), in my case it took longer. After the first 2 (even 3) weeks, my nails seemed a bit stronger, but they were still flimsy and still cracking at the sides. If I hadn&#x27;t read other testimonials saying 2 weeks wasn&#x27;t quite enough to see results (and in some cases, that it took several weeks for the WOW-style improvement), I might have given up. For me, it&#x27;s only in the last 2 weeks (weeks 5 and 6 of consistent use) that I&#x27;ve started going &amp;#34;Woah, are these really MY nails?&amp;#34; If you&#x27;re starting out with super- crummy nails like mine, I recommend you go in expecting it to take a month of consistent, proper use (maybe even a little more) before you&#x27;re jumping for joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I obviously can&#x27;t guarantee with 100% certainty that your nails will respond the way mine did - Lord knows, I have read thousands of reviews like this for products that did nothing for me. However, given how resistant to other products my nails have always been and how dramatically they&#x27;ve improved with Trind, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a fair try. If this can help *my* nails, I&#x27;m confident that it can help many, if not most others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has been helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And THANK YOU, TRIND, for giving me what I never thought I could have - nails that I feel good about!</li>
            <li> I bought this and the nail polish about 6 months ago and followed the instructions for growing my nails.  I have very soft nails and this is the first product that I&#x27;ve used that actually helps me grow my nails longer.  And the polish doesn&#x27;t come off after a day or so like all other polish does on me.</li>
            <li> Even though this is pretty expensive, you really do get what you pay for!  I just cannot find anything else that adds moisture better than Trind!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. This product seems gentle enough, and appears to be working in getting my nails to grow.</li>
            <li> Really helps if you are following the Trind regimen!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first application. My mails looked smoother and felt like they had been buffed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for several years. I stopped for a while and my nails got bad. I have one nail that has ridges the full length of the nail. I thought it is a sign of old age or dehydration----One review said using this eleminated to ridges, so I got faithful about using it and low and behold the ridges are gone. I am so happy because that nail always split along one of the ridges.  I would say this is good stuff and I will and have recommended it to friends and keep using it myself.</li>
            <li> I started using Trind nail repair almost 10 years ago when i went to a salon where they used it to bring my poor overused nails back to life.  It worked as long as I was faithful to the regiment--every time I&#x27;d forget for more than a week they&#x27;d start splitting and breaking.  However, when I was preparing for a month long vacation, I got intrigued with gel nails and decided to give them a try since I didn&#x27;t want to haul along all the extra bottles plus take the time. Fabulous!  The salon applied gel polish was so good I went for the entire month with no peeling.  But now I was worried about the long-term affects of that much acetone on my nails every time I soaked off the gel polish.  By about the 3rd time I was showing a few white dry spots on my nails.  So I went back to using just the Trind Nail Balsam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking off the gel polish I coat the nails with the Trind balsam and let it sit for about 1/2 hr.  (I can still do computer work with it on as it doesn&#x27;t drip.) Then I rub it into the nail and reapply more Balsam for another 1/2 hr. or I go to bed and let it moisturize overnight.  I will then go to the salon or do my own gel nails at home depending on (I can&#x27;t get mine to last more than 2-3 weeks--don&#x27;t know how the salon does it--but on the other side it is cheaper at home.)  I&#x27;ve been doing this for almost a year now and my nails are even better than before.  The gel polish keeps them hard so they don&#x27;t break and I only have to fuss 2-3 weeks.  And the Balsam moisturizes so my nails are still very healthy and don&#x27;t split.  Win-win.</li>
            <li> I love that this is oil free so I can rub the liquid in to moisturize my nails after allowing it to sit on them for two minutes as directed then immediately paint my nails. Oil based products can prevent nail polish from adhering to the nail. I have always had pretty healthy nails and since I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day as directed by the company I&#x27;m seeing faster growth (no miracle, but slightly faster than usual). The big difference has been a reduction in the recent peeling my nails had been experiencing in the changing seasons and with a job which is tough on my nails. The whites are thicker and seem tougher and the nails seem healthier in general. This is a little pricey but I&#x27;m enjoying my healthier nails and I don&#x27;t regret the money spent! I have been enjoying the routine also!</li>
            <li> So bummed- I had searched for &amp;#34;Trind Cuticle balsam&amp;#34;, which is my absolute life savor when it comes to dry skin around my nails, and this product came up, it said it was the cuticle balsam, even showed a picture of the cuticle balsam (it being pink) but the product I was sent was the nail balsam- to help brittle nails, not the skin around them. My nails are strong, it&#x27;s the skin around them that gets dry and cracked. The cuticle balsam shouldn&#x27;t be the picture here if that&#x27;s not what the product is</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. my nails are in the best shape ever .. after using many different products.  Gel nail polish turned my nails into the very bad condition.  This product has definately help solve my problem.</li>
            <li> I have yucky nails.  This product along with the polish makes my nails look very professional.  It has really helped my nails.</li>
            <li> been using this product for several years and when I stop nails get all dry again....this is great stuff. Be sure and try it...</li>
            <li> A miracle hads happened! I used to have weak nails for almost 8 years. I was used to not have my nails done, because of the peeling. I&#x27;m using the balsam and the trind nail repair together for two months in a row and my nails are as strong as it was when I was pregnant. You will not regret buying this... Ever!</li>
            <li> This has kept my nails from splitting and cracking and made them strong and flexible WITHOUT FORMALDEHYDE.  I am going to try to add to this the Trind Nail Repairing nail polish.  This product is quick and easy and not messy to use.  For me it has been worth the money.</li>
            <li> My nails had developed vertical ridges and one had a groove, probably from some injury, that caused continual splitting.  I had tried several nail hardeners, Nailtek, Nailtique, Sally Hansen, OPI -- but they actually did more harm than good, making the nails more brittle and even yellow.  Then somewhere I read that dryness is frequently the underlying problem.  Dryness, not an absence of hardness.  I had some Solar Oil cuticle oil around here so I started using that and was amazed to see an improvement right away.  But the oil does not stay on the nails.  So I started looking around for a product designed to combat dryness and discovered Trind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have written this in reviews but I myself never have -- but I will say it about this product:  if I could give it ten stars I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nail Balsam coats the nail and stays on the nail.  You can feel it on the surface of the nail.  After only a couple of applications, the nails are smoother, the ridges seem to be less prominent and the nails look and feel healthier.  I am using only the nail balsam, and no other products.  I have never used anything that made as significant a  positive difference as this product.  I wish I had understood earlier that the problem with my nails was dryness, not hardness, and had discovered this product.</li>
            <li> my absolute fav nail stuff!</li>
