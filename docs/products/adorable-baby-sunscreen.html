    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I applied this before taking the baby with me to the farmers market, and it worked great!</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>Worked great!!  </li>
            <li>I was really impressed with the consistency.  </li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t so greasy, this stuff would be perfect.</li>
            <li>NO reactions, just wonderful NO SUNBURNED skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Always give your baby thee best you can give with effort.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because of its excellent rating by EWG.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Safer ingredients than most products and works well!!!</li>
            <li>Sun coverage is very good.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, burn after 20min in the sun but with this product I never burn after hours in the sun.  </li>
            <li>It went on great, not greasy and best of all</li>
            <li>I, too, checked the EWG ratings and this does get great results for ingredient safety, UVA/UVB protection, etc.  </li>
            <li>Great quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We will continue to use this, great product.</li>
            <li>Great for school though.</li>
            <li>so I am happy with the protection</li>
            <li>It works great -</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>I also bought the face stick and that lasts longer and it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Good sun protection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product on skin but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>I felt like a greased pig at the county fair.</li>
            <li>There are two versions, the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;, both are good.</li>
            <li>I bought it in April at a great price and again in June for a LOT more.  </li>
            <li>Both are rated as very safe on the EWG sunscreen database,  but they don&#x27;t work if you sweat them off.  </li>
            <li>Kids love it and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to know this product is both safe and effective.  </li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a good product that is safe and works, this one is a good buy.</li>
            <li>I could not ask for any thing more for my baby!</li>
            <li>MUCH more practical that way!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>(love that!).</li>
            <li>If Loving Naturals can solve that problem they will get all five stars.  </li>
            <li>Customer service was responsive and nice.  </li>
            <li>good fit, good quality.</li>
            <li>This could also be hazardous because try holding onto a \\&quot;greased\\&quot; toddler.  </li>
            <li>I find it very easy to put on (not chalky or pasty).  </li>
            <li>(which is also good, my daughter is fine with it)</li>
            <li>It spreads on nicely and I love that I am not poisoning baby with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin (neither of my children have had issues with this formula and my son&#x27;s skin is fairly sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and it is very easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>It also comes off in the pool, and you can see the &amp;#34;oil slick&amp;#34; on the top of the water.  </li>
            <li>and I use it for myself , and I love it.</li>
            <li>my mind there are better options.  </li>
            <li>I found this and have used it for many months since without any problems.  </li>
            <li>I know that it&#x27;s safer to lie on top of your skin,  </li>
            <li>There are more safe ones on the market that aren&#x27;t as greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Babyganics product that worked MUCH better in terms of blocking the sun as that day</li>
            <li>so I went on the lookout for something better and came across this product on the EWG website and decided that despite the hefty price tag, I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used MANY).  </li>
            <li>I buy Adorable Baby SPF 30+ Sunscreen Non-Nano Zinc Oxide UVA/UVB for my son and love.</li>
            <li>It is a great quality product and rated very well on Skin Deep.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen that seems safe and nontoxic for baby and smooths reasonably well into the skin.</li>
            <li>Works great and and is the preferred brand for my dermatalogist friend for his daughter; good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>A tube or a more squeezable bottle would allow you to get all of it out.</li>
            <li>so I had been looking for another healthy sunblock for him.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>but I got it for my self since I have reaction to most chemicals.</li>
            <li>I read reviews about how healthy this one is compared to others, so I&#x27;ll give it 2 stars.  </li>
            <li>The Neutrogena one was so much better .  </li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>protects, safe, convienent.</li>
            <li>No sunburned baby at Disneyland for me. :-)</li>
            <li>but since all the family uses it constantly, it&#x27;s got to have the best ingredients.</li>
            <li>Used on my 6month old and loved it!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>Best part for me is that the dry patches are gone and even though he&#x27;s in the sun a lot we have yet to have a burn.</li>
            <li>I was aware of the harmful ingredients in some of the more popular brands on the market and wanted something safe to use on my children.  </li>
            <li>This formulation is fabulous for those of us who have sensitivity to many sunscreen ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I read another reviewer that said the product went on smooth \\&quot;like melted butter\\&quot; and that&#x27;s actually a pretty good description.  </li>
            <li>I have tried just about every natural sunscreen and this one is great.  </li>
            <li>And most importantly, he doesn&#x27;t burn when wearing this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s troublesome when I go to wash my hands after application, as even hand soap doesn&#x27;t dislodge it easily.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to discover that it is also very easily absorbed without leaving white traces.</li>
            <li>so it spreads easily.  </li>
            <li>And the tube is easy to squeeze for me.  </li>
            <li>it just spreads easy over the body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as easy to apply as any sunscreen and stays on well, including in water.    </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and not overly greasy.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very good for you  because it contains physical spf which stays on top of your skin as opposed to the ones that get absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is incredibly greasy and stays greasy long after, 30 min</li>
            <li>Sunscreen Non-Nano Zinc Oxide UVA/UVB 4.3 oz made by Loving Naturals for my pregnant wife (5 months pregnant)</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>works fine.</li>
            <li>If you are going away on a trip for a week or longer, purchase more than one bottle, it ran out quick.</li>
            <li>Adorable Baby is safe and they don&#x27;t burn, finally sunscreen that protects safely!</li>
            <li>It also has a super low rating on the safety list for SPF which is a good thing!</li>
            <li>This product has a great rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s skin deep website (Rated as a 1).  </li>
            <li>Best sun cream out there for kids, great protection and safe from bad chemicals.</li>
            <li>: SPF beyond about 30 isn&#x27;t important, as SPF 30 already blocks 97% of UVB.</li>
            <li>Plus, the added bonus of having it work right away rather than having to soak in was great when I had to apply to my rambunctious 14mth old.  </li>
            <li>The Adorable Baby product is rated very highly, blocks UVA effectively, and contains no questionable chemicals (just non-nano Zinc as the blocking agent).  </li>
            <li>great, easy to apply; little too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;,  but still love it</li>
            <li>After plenty of research as I am a market researcher, I found this product to be the best possible product for my new baby.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the fretting worrying kind of new mom (aren&#x27;t we all...)</li>
            <li>It is the most natural thing that I was able to find on the market.  </li>
            <li>All of the Loving Natural sunscreen products are that I have used.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#62;Smells like a sweet baby</li>
            <li>I almost never throw out a product 1/2 full but for this I made an exception.  </li>
            <li>Super super greasy.</li>
            <li>While it did it&#x27;s job in providing SPF, it made his hair super super greasy.</li>
            <li>Super greasy, my kids and I burn for some reason when we use this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It was very water resistant and easy to reapply.</li>
            <li>Went on easily and wasn&#x27;t really smelly.</li>
            <li>Seems to be fine, and I&#x27;d have given 5 stars, BUT I cannot squeeze it out easily, which is a major hassle.  </li>
            <li>I never saw it run or get into her eyes, she had a lot of fun in the pool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth it.  </li>
            <li>You need patience applying it, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product for my 7 month old grandson.</li>
            <li>I searched several websites to find the most natural and effective sunscreen for my children.  </li>
            <li>This one wins.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brand, it will be all that I put on my baby and continue to use on her as she gets older.</li>
            <li>It has no bad odors and it really protects well.  </li>
            <li>You have to re-apply it more then normal sun screen but its all natural!!</li>
            <li>After a lot of research, this sunscreen seemed the most gentle and natural.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old burns easily</li>
            <li>Spreads smoothly and softly!</li>
            <li>Not too mention this was very very oily/greasy.</li>
            <li>and I normally cut it with scissors to get what is left which normally lasts me one more month or more.</li>
            <li>It works great, going on clear and not to thick which means it&#x27;s easily spreadable.</li>
            <li>I use this sunscreen on my kids and myself - it is ideal, preventing burns on even the most sun sensitive of us, and curiously it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my acne go into overdrive like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to use an all natural award winning sunscreen and not walk around with pasted white skin so that my son and I look like night of the living dead zombies at the playground.</li>
            <li>If it was just softer it would be so much easier to squeeze!  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased Adorable Baby SPF 30+</li>
            <li>Therefore, I have to wipe it off first.</li>
            <li>Pay the extra money to protect your baby against the sun in a safe way.  </li>
            <li>It protects my daughters pasty white skin, and it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the bottle type and we will reload with more sunscreen for next summer.</li>
            <li>I rated this product 2 stars bc of the safe ingredients only.  </li>
            <li>He looks hot and sweaty with this on.  </li>
            <li>We shook it a ton and it first comes out all watery and greasy, and then some of the thicker stuff comes out.  </li>
            <li>: I like the fact that it really works!</li>
            <li>Goes on clear, just fantastic.  </li>
            <li>From my point of view this is a minor issue because there are so many brands we just can&#x27;t wear.  </li>
            <li>Also, I barely had to use any because it was so smooth and creamy, it spread all over my baby&#x27;s skin so effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>A little shiny at first but goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>It may cost a little more than others on the shelf, but worth it when putting on a baby to know it is the best possible product and the least toxic.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear unlike many other chemical free sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, dries quickly, no white sheen.  </li>
            <li>I love that it goes on clear and comparative to other natural sunscreens this gives more product for your money.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned from other reviews for the more &#x27;friendly&#x27; sunscreens that it wouldn&#x27;t rub in easily or be greasy but the consistency is just like any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Greasy but much easier to put on then most physical blocks, which are very pasty, stain clothes, and hard to get off your own hand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t block the sun very well.</li>
            <li>It really is quite greasy.  </li>
            <li>However, it is REALLY oily.</li>
            <li>Very oily where I don&#x27;t even want to pick him up when I put it on him because it will get all over me.</li>
            <li>Very oily, oil has separated from cream.  </li>
            <li>After much comparison, because that is what I do, weighing cost, vs. ounces vs. toxicity, this brand beat out all others.  </li>
            <li>Very oily...</li>
            <li>I preferred the Burn Out Kids,  but that was very greasy as well.  </li>
            <li>She was very well protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;We used this sunscreen at the beach in July on very sunny days.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product based on the EWG rating.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit sticky but works very well..</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This was very greasy, but I would have continued to use it...</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing about the product itself that I would change.  </li>
            <li>This one my 8 year old daughter likes better because it doesnt go on as white and is easier to rub in.  </li>
            <li>Not thick and pasty!</li>
            <li>I thought, or I should say hoped, her arms were pink because she was hot but after her bath at home it was confirmed that her arms did in fact get sunburned.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; is a bit more greasy and the white leaves a bit of a white film</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product from ADULTS and children.  </li>
            <li>As people of color often do not need a sunscreen with really high SPF, make one specifically for folks with darker skin at SPF 15.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this sunscreen, which was rated as one of the safer ones on the EWG Web site.  </li>
            <li>and I feel it is very important to have one without harsh chemicals for my child.  </li>
            <li>I wish the manufacturer would use the same kind of tube that you see all other sunscreens use.  </li>
            <li>little more pricey than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Safe to use for my little one and myself.  </li>
            <li>And, after all my research, I felt comfortable using this on him compared to the ones with lots of unknown ingredients.</li>
            <li>We use this product for a few years now and we still love it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s absolutely no common sense put into the bottle make and design.  </li>
            <li>but I was only out a couple hours so not sure if that was really a good test.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why it appears white when you apply it onto your skin , but quickly it becomes clear.</li>
            <li>Everything is in my baby&#x27;s mouth right now, and I didn&#x27;t even think twice about it being on her skin and possibly going into her mouth.</li>
            <li>Less oily than Raw elements but still doesn&#x27;t rub in all that great.</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t realistic to keep a baby indoors until they are 6 months old.</li>
            <li>Used this for the 1st time at the beach with my 9 month old!  </li>
            <li>We used it the following weekend when we took her swimming for the first time.</li>
            <li>Sand stuck to this product too (and no, sand does not excessively stick to every sunscreen</li>
            <li>pros outweigh the cons as far as I am conceerned!</li>
            <li>However, after 2 hours in the hot FL sun (and having reapplied it every 30 minutes the entire time we were out)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s non-nano and goes on clear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>Never had a burn on my 10 and 8 year old.  </li>
            <li>and I was worried about taking my 4 month old out into the sun without any protection.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural but it is greasy.</li>
            <li>I use this product on my 6 month old baby girl.</li>
            <li>This product is very sticky, but definitely works.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mind buying the pricier sunscreen, since this bottle will probably last me the whole summer.</li>
            <li>I completely recommend it</li>
            <li>I had been using Devita sunscreens before and will buy them again instead because they are also all natural, clear, contain non-nano zinc</li>
            <li>My sensitive daughter has no reactions to this.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try this product after doing some research on sunscreen for young children with eczema.  </li>
            <li>My pasty sensitive skin didn&#x27;t get burned or breakout.</li>
            <li>I used this on a 4 year old and 1 year old.  </li>
            <li>My one year old does not burn but we reapply anyway.  </li>
            <li>My boys have sensitive skin and even those sunscreens that say made for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was definitely out in the sun way more during the trip than she was, but I swam in the ocean, pool, and played volleyball everyday</li>
            <li>The feel is honestly rather sticky, but I don&#x27;t know how they could remedy that problem without adding irritating ingredients or decreasing it&#x27;s water resistance.</li>
            <li>The only CON is that it&#x27;s so rich that you need to wait a little before you get dressed , and you cannot put it on your face because it&#x27;s very shiny.</li>
            <li>This is understandable since they are expensive to produce and it will hopefully come down as more people decide to buy safe products for themselves and their kids.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it ti everyone, especially if you have a child.</li>
            <li>It is fairly small and we go through it quickly because we live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few others and prefer California Baby and Burn Out Kids to this brand, though it does a fine job if you can deal with the above issues.</li>
            <li>I live in South Florida so sunscreen is always necessary</li>
            <li>A little greaser than the other top rated ones I&#x27;m trying but moisturizes well</li>
            <li>very greasy, very hard to get out of the container when it is 1/2 full</li>
            <li>This sunscreen scored a 1 on a scale where 0-2 means low hazard, 3-6 is moderate hazard, and 7-10 is high hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clear, no white streaks&lt;br /&gt;100% natural&lt;br /&gt;UVA</li>
            <li>Out of the tube, it&#x27;s white and the consistency of butter; and like butter, your body heat rapidly melts it into a thinner liquid, which is clear.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have any direct experience with it, so I bought it again to try it out at home if you&#x27;re wondering why I purchased multiple tubes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not at all what I was hoping for given the higher than average price.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 3 year old who wears sunscreen daily to daycare.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried two different brands of natural SPF.</li>
            <li>I have only used the sunscreen for 1 week now and already have had to remove the top and squeeze and fold the (hard!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Slightly greasy at first (typical with sunscreen</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive (like most of the EWG highly rated sunscreens), especially if you buy it in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than Raw Elements, but it&#x27;s still an odd consistency</li>
            <li>With only a 1 Hazard Score by the EWG it was the safest natural product I could find to help protect the development of my future child.</li>
            <li>First, it is extremely GREASY!!  </li>
            <li>I also used half a container in one day (on 3 people, yes...I applied that much to try to prevent being burned).  </li>
            <li>High zinc oxide content,  spreads to look clear, applies easily, no fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It works really well, we were out in the sun/pool last weekend for over an hour and a half, and I never reapplied to her</li>
            <li>This can be good and bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was really impressed with the consistency.  </li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t so greasy, this stuff would be perfect.</li>
            <li> NO reactions, just wonderful NO SUNBURNED skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always give your baby thee best you can give with effort.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of its excellent rating by EWG.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Safer ingredients than most products and works well!!!</li>
            <li> Sun coverage is very good.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, burn after 20min in the sun but with this product I never burn after hours in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It went on great, not greasy and best of all</li>
            <li> I, too, checked the EWG ratings and this does get great results for ingredient safety, UVA/UVB protection, etc.  </li>
            <li> Great quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We will continue to use this, great product.</li>
            <li> Great for school though.</li>
            <li> so I am happy with the protection</li>
            <li> It works great -</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I also bought the face stick and that lasts longer and it is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Good sun protection.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product on skin but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I felt like a greased pig at the county fair.</li>
            <li> There are two versions, the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;, both are good.</li>
            <li> I bought it in April at a great price and again in June for a LOT more.  </li>
            <li> Both are rated as very safe on the EWG sunscreen database,  but they don&#x27;t work if you sweat them off.  </li>
            <li> Kids love it and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to know this product is both safe and effective.  </li>
            <li> But if you are looking for a good product that is safe and works, this one is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I could not ask for any thing more for my baby!</li>
            <li> MUCH more practical that way!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> (love that!).</li>
            <li> If Loving Naturals can solve that problem they will get all five stars.  </li>
            <li> Customer service was responsive and nice.  </li>
            <li> good fit, good quality.</li>
            <li> This could also be hazardous because try holding onto a \\&quot;greased\\&quot; toddler.  </li>
            <li> I find it very easy to put on (not chalky or pasty).  </li>
            <li> (which is also good, my daughter is fine with it)</li>
            <li> It spreads on nicely and I love that I am not poisoning baby with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin (neither of my children have had issues with this formula and my son&#x27;s skin is fairly sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and it is very easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> It also comes off in the pool, and you can see the &amp;#34;oil slick&amp;#34; on the top of the water.  </li>
            <li> and I use it for myself , and I love it.</li>
            <li> my mind there are better options.  </li>
            <li> I found this and have used it for many months since without any problems.  </li>
            <li> I know that it&#x27;s safer to lie on top of your skin,  </li>
            <li> There are more safe ones on the market that aren&#x27;t as greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Babyganics product that worked MUCH better in terms of blocking the sun as that day</li>
            <li> so I went on the lookout for something better and came across this product on the EWG website and decided that despite the hefty price tag, I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used MANY).  </li>
            <li> I buy Adorable Baby SPF 30+ Sunscreen Non-Nano Zinc Oxide UVA/UVB for my son and love.</li>
            <li> It is a great quality product and rated very well on Skin Deep.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen that seems safe and nontoxic for baby and smooths reasonably well into the skin.</li>
            <li> Works great and and is the preferred brand for my dermatalogist friend for his daughter; good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> A tube or a more squeezable bottle would allow you to get all of it out.</li>
            <li> so I had been looking for another healthy sunblock for him.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> but I got it for my self since I have reaction to most chemicals.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about how healthy this one is compared to others, so I&#x27;ll give it 2 stars.  </li>
            <li> The Neutrogena one was so much better .  </li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> protects, safe, convienent.</li>
            <li> No sunburned baby at Disneyland for me. :-)</li>
            <li> but since all the family uses it constantly, it&#x27;s got to have the best ingredients.</li>
            <li> Used on my 6month old and loved it!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> Best part for me is that the dry patches are gone and even though he&#x27;s in the sun a lot we have yet to have a burn.</li>
            <li> I was aware of the harmful ingredients in some of the more popular brands on the market and wanted something safe to use on my children.  </li>
            <li> This formulation is fabulous for those of us who have sensitivity to many sunscreen ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I read another reviewer that said the product went on smooth \\&quot;like melted butter\\&quot; and that&#x27;s actually a pretty good description.  </li>
            <li> I have tried just about every natural sunscreen and this one is great.  </li>
            <li> And most importantly, he doesn&#x27;t burn when wearing this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s troublesome when I go to wash my hands after application, as even hand soap doesn&#x27;t dislodge it easily.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy to discover that it is also very easily absorbed without leaving white traces.</li>
            <li> so it spreads easily.  </li>
            <li> And the tube is easy to squeeze for me.  </li>
            <li> it just spreads easy over the body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as easy to apply as any sunscreen and stays on well, including in water.    </li>
            <li> Goes on easy and not overly greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very good for you  because it contains physical spf which stays on top of your skin as opposed to the ones that get absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is incredibly greasy and stays greasy long after, 30 min</li>
            <li> Sunscreen Non-Nano Zinc Oxide UVA/UVB 4.3 oz made by Loving Naturals for my pregnant wife (5 months pregnant)</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> works fine.</li>
            <li> If you are going away on a trip for a week or longer, purchase more than one bottle, it ran out quick.</li>
            <li> Adorable Baby is safe and they don&#x27;t burn, finally sunscreen that protects safely!</li>
            <li> It also has a super low rating on the safety list for SPF which is a good thing!</li>
            <li> This product has a great rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s skin deep website (Rated as a 1).  </li>
            <li> Best sun cream out there for kids, great protection and safe from bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> : SPF beyond about 30 isn&#x27;t important, as SPF 30 already blocks 97% of UVB.</li>
            <li> Plus, the added bonus of having it work right away rather than having to soak in was great when I had to apply to my rambunctious 14mth old.  </li>
            <li> The Adorable Baby product is rated very highly, blocks UVA effectively, and contains no questionable chemicals (just non-nano Zinc as the blocking agent).  </li>
            <li> great, easy to apply; little too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;,  but still love it</li>
            <li> After plenty of research as I am a market researcher, I found this product to be the best possible product for my new baby.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the fretting worrying kind of new mom (aren&#x27;t we all...)</li>
            <li> It is the most natural thing that I was able to find on the market.  </li>
            <li> All of the Loving Natural sunscreen products are that I have used.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#62;Smells like a sweet baby</li>
            <li> I almost never throw out a product 1/2 full but for this I made an exception.  </li>
            <li> Super super greasy.</li>
            <li> While it did it&#x27;s job in providing SPF, it made his hair super super greasy.</li>
            <li> Super greasy, my kids and I burn for some reason when we use this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It was very water resistant and easy to reapply.</li>
            <li> Went on easily and wasn&#x27;t really smelly.</li>
            <li> Seems to be fine, and I&#x27;d have given 5 stars, BUT I cannot squeeze it out easily, which is a major hassle.  </li>
            <li> I never saw it run or get into her eyes, she had a lot of fun in the pool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth it.  </li>
            <li> You need patience applying it, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product for my 7 month old grandson.</li>
            <li> I searched several websites to find the most natural and effective sunscreen for my children.  </li>
            <li> This one wins.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brand, it will be all that I put on my baby and continue to use on her as she gets older.</li>
            <li> It has no bad odors and it really protects well.  </li>
            <li> You have to re-apply it more then normal sun screen but its all natural!!</li>
            <li> After a lot of research, this sunscreen seemed the most gentle and natural.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old burns easily</li>
            <li> Spreads smoothly and softly!</li>
            <li> Not too mention this was very very oily/greasy.</li>
            <li> and I normally cut it with scissors to get what is left which normally lasts me one more month or more.</li>
            <li> It works great, going on clear and not to thick which means it&#x27;s easily spreadable.</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen on my kids and myself - it is ideal, preventing burns on even the most sun sensitive of us, and curiously it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my acne go into overdrive like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to use an all natural award winning sunscreen and not walk around with pasted white skin so that my son and I look like night of the living dead zombies at the playground.</li>
            <li> If it was just softer it would be so much easier to squeeze!  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased Adorable Baby SPF 30+</li>
            <li> Therefore, I have to wipe it off first.</li>
            <li> Pay the extra money to protect your baby against the sun in a safe way.  </li>
            <li> It protects my daughters pasty white skin, and it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the bottle type and we will reload with more sunscreen for next summer.</li>
            <li> I rated this product 2 stars bc of the safe ingredients only.  </li>
            <li> He looks hot and sweaty with this on.  </li>
            <li> We shook it a ton and it first comes out all watery and greasy, and then some of the thicker stuff comes out.  </li>
            <li> : I like the fact that it really works!</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, just fantastic.  </li>
            <li> From my point of view this is a minor issue because there are so many brands we just can&#x27;t wear.  </li>
            <li> Also, I barely had to use any because it was so smooth and creamy, it spread all over my baby&#x27;s skin so effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> A little shiny at first but goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li> It may cost a little more than others on the shelf, but worth it when putting on a baby to know it is the best possible product and the least toxic.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear unlike many other chemical free sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, dries quickly, no white sheen.  </li>
            <li> I love that it goes on clear and comparative to other natural sunscreens this gives more product for your money.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned from other reviews for the more &#x27;friendly&#x27; sunscreens that it wouldn&#x27;t rub in easily or be greasy but the consistency is just like any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Greasy but much easier to put on then most physical blocks, which are very pasty, stain clothes, and hard to get off your own hand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t block the sun very well.</li>
            <li> It really is quite greasy.  </li>
            <li> However, it is REALLY oily.</li>
            <li> Very oily where I don&#x27;t even want to pick him up when I put it on him because it will get all over me.</li>
            <li> Very oily, oil has separated from cream.  </li>
            <li> After much comparison, because that is what I do, weighing cost, vs. ounces vs. toxicity, this brand beat out all others.  </li>
            <li> Very oily...</li>
            <li> I preferred the Burn Out Kids,  but that was very greasy as well.  </li>
            <li> She was very well protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;We used this sunscreen at the beach in July on very sunny days.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product based on the EWG rating.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit sticky but works very well..</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> This was very greasy, but I would have continued to use it...</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing about the product itself that I would change.  </li>
            <li> This one my 8 year old daughter likes better because it doesnt go on as white and is easier to rub in.  </li>
            <li> Not thick and pasty!</li>
            <li> I thought, or I should say hoped, her arms were pink because she was hot but after her bath at home it was confirmed that her arms did in fact get sunburned.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; is a bit more greasy and the white leaves a bit of a white film</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product from ADULTS and children.  </li>
            <li> As people of color often do not need a sunscreen with really high SPF, make one specifically for folks with darker skin at SPF 15.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this sunscreen, which was rated as one of the safer ones on the EWG Web site.  </li>
            <li> and I feel it is very important to have one without harsh chemicals for my child.  </li>
            <li> I wish the manufacturer would use the same kind of tube that you see all other sunscreens use.  </li>
            <li> little more pricey than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Safe to use for my little one and myself.  </li>
            <li> And, after all my research, I felt comfortable using this on him compared to the ones with lots of unknown ingredients.</li>
            <li> We use this product for a few years now and we still love it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no common sense put into the bottle make and design.  </li>
            <li> but I was only out a couple hours so not sure if that was really a good test.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it appears white when you apply it onto your skin , but quickly it becomes clear.</li>
            <li> Everything is in my baby&#x27;s mouth right now, and I didn&#x27;t even think twice about it being on her skin and possibly going into her mouth.</li>
            <li> Less oily than Raw elements but still doesn&#x27;t rub in all that great.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t realistic to keep a baby indoors until they are 6 months old.</li>
            <li> Used this for the 1st time at the beach with my 9 month old!  </li>
            <li> We used it the following weekend when we took her swimming for the first time.</li>
            <li> Sand stuck to this product too (and no, sand does not excessively stick to every sunscreen</li>
            <li> pros outweigh the cons as far as I am conceerned!</li>
            <li> However, after 2 hours in the hot FL sun (and having reapplied it every 30 minutes the entire time we were out)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s non-nano and goes on clear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> Never had a burn on my 10 and 8 year old.  </li>
            <li> and I was worried about taking my 4 month old out into the sun without any protection.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural but it is greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my 6 month old baby girl.</li>
            <li> This product is very sticky, but definitely works.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind buying the pricier sunscreen, since this bottle will probably last me the whole summer.</li>
            <li> I completely recommend it</li>
            <li> I had been using Devita sunscreens before and will buy them again instead because they are also all natural, clear, contain non-nano zinc</li>
            <li> My sensitive daughter has no reactions to this.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product after doing some research on sunscreen for young children with eczema.  </li>
            <li> My pasty sensitive skin didn&#x27;t get burned or breakout.</li>
            <li> I used this on a 4 year old and 1 year old.  </li>
            <li> My one year old does not burn but we reapply anyway.  </li>
            <li> My boys have sensitive skin and even those sunscreens that say made for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was definitely out in the sun way more during the trip than she was, but I swam in the ocean, pool, and played volleyball everyday</li>
            <li> The feel is honestly rather sticky, but I don&#x27;t know how they could remedy that problem without adding irritating ingredients or decreasing it&#x27;s water resistance.</li>
            <li> The only CON is that it&#x27;s so rich that you need to wait a little before you get dressed , and you cannot put it on your face because it&#x27;s very shiny.</li>
            <li> This is understandable since they are expensive to produce and it will hopefully come down as more people decide to buy safe products for themselves and their kids.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it ti everyone, especially if you have a child.</li>
            <li> It is fairly small and we go through it quickly because we live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few others and prefer California Baby and Burn Out Kids to this brand, though it does a fine job if you can deal with the above issues.</li>
            <li> I live in South Florida so sunscreen is always necessary</li>
            <li> A little greaser than the other top rated ones I&#x27;m trying but moisturizes well</li>
            <li> very greasy, very hard to get out of the container when it is 1/2 full</li>
            <li> This sunscreen scored a 1 on a scale where 0-2 means low hazard, 3-6 is moderate hazard, and 7-10 is high hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clear, no white streaks&lt;br /&gt;100% natural&lt;br /&gt;UVA</li>
            <li> Out of the tube, it&#x27;s white and the consistency of butter; and like butter, your body heat rapidly melts it into a thinner liquid, which is clear.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have any direct experience with it, so I bought it again to try it out at home if you&#x27;re wondering why I purchased multiple tubes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not at all what I was hoping for given the higher than average price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old who wears sunscreen daily to daycare.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried two different brands of natural SPF.</li>
            <li> I have only used the sunscreen for 1 week now and already have had to remove the top and squeeze and fold the (hard!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Slightly greasy at first (typical with sunscreen</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive (like most of the EWG highly rated sunscreens), especially if you buy it in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than Raw Elements, but it&#x27;s still an odd consistency</li>
            <li> With only a 1 Hazard Score by the EWG it was the safest natural product I could find to help protect the development of my future child.</li>
            <li> First, it is extremely GREASY!!  </li>
            <li> I also used half a container in one day (on 3 people, yes...I applied that much to try to prevent being burned).  </li>
            <li> High zinc oxide content,  spreads to look clear, applies easily, no fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It works really well, we were out in the sun/pool last weekend for over an hour and a half, and I never reapplied to her</li>
            <li> This can be good and bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely rich and moisturizing and thick!</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible and I&#x27;m now looking for a different brand it annoys me so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> Glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave baby with weird chalky white streaks or appearance.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it stays on after being in water for a long time (this only thing I like about it)</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it was immensely greasy, it still did its job and afforded me some relief that I was not putting something harmful and filled with questionable chemicals on my son.</li>
            <li> No tan lines, no skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty thick, and a little greasy, but it does go on clear and is moisturizing</li>
            <li> /&gt;This sunscreen rated as being a low health concern because it doesn&#x27;t use the harmful chemicals that other sunscreens may use, chemicals which have been linked to various diseases and issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although for only 4.3 oz it is extremely expensive, but it was worth the price for the protection for my wife and our future child.  </li>
            <li> I applied the product to my child before we left the house and then again after I noticed her arms were looking a bit pink.  </li>
            <li> She was out as long</li>
            <li> When it is near the end, I can see no option but to cut through the thick plastic and scrape out what&#x27;s left into a different container.  </li>
            <li> so I now by the California Baby sunscreen, available in stores, not as expensive, and no alcohol to dry out my kids skin.</li>
            <li> I could style his hair in various silly hairdos and his hair would stay exactly in the same spot no matter what.</li>
            <li> My son was getting dry patches on his skin from California Baby...</li>
            <li> I went to the beach this past weekend and was worried about my 5 and 1/2 month old being out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I struggle to get it out when it comes down to a certain level, the material is too hard</li>
            <li> I could have POSSIBLY looked past this if the product actually worked but it does not.  </li>
            <li> NOt so greesy and impossible to wash off  hands after applying (like most other brands).</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> it goes on thick, didn&#x27;t absorb at all and left my skin sticky for the entire day.</li>
            <li> There was not the slightest hint of pink to her skin with the other product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy about re-applying once I&#x27;m outside, but that didn&#x27;t seem to matter--still no burn.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this sunscreen a shot, I don&#x27;t like the chemicals in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> my hair and cloths stick to my skin after apply and it takes like 4 hours to get a little dry</li>
            <li> very forgetful</li>
            <li> It also seems to stay in place even on an active kid rolling around in the park and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen isn&#x27;t runny enough to use the hard plastic bottle the sunscreen comes in.  </li>
            <li> As other comments have said... it does come off greasy (I like to say SHINY!)</li>
            <li> like I sweated it all off within a half hour and reapplying was a chore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about a month and a half now for my infant daughter.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic alternative to my Neutrogena hydroplex and based on previous reviews</li>
            <li> It is less greasy and goes on easier.</li>
            <li> but I like how the skin looks slightly lighter in color</li>
            <li> Also it is not nearly strong enough for delicate baby/toddler skin.  </li>
            <li> but this leaves you a shiny mess</li>
            <li> For this price, I think I&#x27;m going to keep looking for something a little less greasy with an equivalent safety rating.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple sunscreens in the past 5 years, this is the one with the least harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> and she did not have a single burn on her delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if it is my son&#x27;s skin tone or the product, but I felt like my baby was getting a little tan when we were using this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to rain on the other reviewers&#x27; parade here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;shiney&amp;#34; when it goes on, but that helps you see where you&#x27;re applying it</li>
            <li> however it is a little oily to put on.</li>
            <li> This makes it a little problematic when I have a slippery baby in the pool</li>
            <li> but still it is a little sticky..</li>
            <li> :  feels somewhat oily, a little pricy</li>
            <li> It is costly for the little bottle.</li>
            <li> My little one gets it applied to him twice per day for play time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my dog as she is white with lots of pink, which is vulnerable.  </li>
            <li> A few things I came across in my research</li>
            <li> but I am not a huge fan of this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> is pale head from the sun.</li>
            <li> My toddler was playing on our hardwood floors after I applied it on him this morning, and I&#x27;ve since slipped twice in the oil slick that he left behind.  </li>
            <li> I got a bad sun burn, and my 1 and 3 year olds got their first sun burns ever.</li>
            <li> I am willing to use this product because of price and non-toxicity, but am disappointed it is so greasy.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to anyone else using the same pool as me!</li>
            <li> Usually I get my purchases within a week</li>
            <li> not sure if this is just the scent of the product?  </li>
            <li> Stuff is expensive and is a pain to get the last amount out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Quality-wise though I&#x27;m not sure which is healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if we got a dud product or what, but the sunscreen seems like it&#x27;s separated and it won&#x27;t mix together.  </li>
            <li> The link to the ewg.org database for any interested is:  [...]    </li>
            <li> Small, fits into the diaper bag to have at all times.</li>
            <li> It stained our clothing and felt very heavy on our skin.  </li>
            <li> Works well, no smell, non-toxic, but sort of expensive given the small amount in a single container</li>
            <li> Very ineffective protection and highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very thick, so a little hard to squeeze out of the container but not so hard to make me not like it.</li>
            <li> but I hardly used it.  </li>
            <li> I researched it on EWG - cosmetic database and found it to be the least toxic.  </li>
            <li> It lasted at least four hours if not longer on her</li>
            <li> I guess the shininess helps at least you to see where the product is and isn&#x27;t when you apply it.</li>
            <li> The formula is not too thick</li>
            <li> Is quite thick</li>
            <li> On to try to find a new product :(.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately lost my bottle after only a few uses which is why I bring this down to 4 stars because the price is just crazy!</li>
            <li> So mad that I spent the money...</li>
            <li> The only downside for me is the price :-(  </li>
            <li> I used it on the beach and because it was basically glue on my legs, I had sand and dust covering my legs by the end of the day that was quite tough to remove in the shower.</li>
            <li> My son had a horrible allergic reaction to children&#x27;s sunscreen when he was about 10 months old.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult to squeeze out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it is difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this is not the product for us.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a sunblock from my kids that does not contain dangerous ingredients.</li>
            <li> The Babyganics product was sticky though and sand stuck to it LIKE CRAZY</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t thick and greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue on your skin.  </li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s about a quarter used, it becomes nearly impossible to squeeze anything out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have a history of bad reactions to sunscreen (stinging,rashes and hives).  </li>
            <li> Product smells like it has gone bad upon arrival-</li>
            <li> *hate* the container.  </li>
            <li> And frankly, it&#x27;s annoying when I am in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was awful --</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> The bottle is the worst idea ever.  </li>
            <li> Terrible experience with this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> --it was so greasy and disgusting.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used this for the 1st time at the beach with my 9 month old!  It went on great, not greasy and best of all, he didn&#x27;t burn at all!  I was there for about 2 hours and did not reapply.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am willing to use this product because of price and non-toxicity, but am disappointed it is so greasy.  It also comes off in the pool, and you can see the &amp;#34;oil slick&amp;#34; on the top of the water.  Sorry to anyone else using the same pool as me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural.  No toxic ingredients.  Good sun protection.  I could not ask for any thing more for my baby!</li>
            <li> Safer ingredients than most products and works well!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very good for you  because it contains physical spf which stays on top of your skin as opposed to the ones that get absorbed into your skin. That&#x27;s why it appears white when you apply it onto your skin , but quickly it becomes clear. It&#x27;s extremely rich and moisturizing and thick! I am 29 and I use it for myself , and I love it. The only CON is that it&#x27;s so rich that you need to wait a little before you get dressed , and you cannot put it on your face because it&#x27;s very shiny. I use it when I am going to the beach or in the summer .... or on vacations.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is my son&#x27;s skin tone or the product, but I felt like my baby was getting a little tan when we were using this product. I switched over to the ThinkBaby sunscreen and his skin no longer darkened. Not too mention this was very very oily/greasy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t block the sun very well.</li>
            <li> It works great, going on clear and not to thick which means it&#x27;s easily spreadable. I unfortunately lost my bottle after only a few uses which is why I bring this down to 4 stars because the price is just crazy! It also took FOREVER to ship. Usually I get my purchases within a week, max two, this was 3-4 weeks, nuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very forgetful so I now by the California Baby sunscreen, available in stores, not as expensive, and no alcohol to dry out my kids skin.</li>
            <li> This product has a great rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s skin deep website (Rated as a 1).  It works well.  We havent had any problems with sunburns with our daughter.  I&#x27;m happy to know this product is both safe and effective.  It is a bit difficult to squeeze out of the bottle.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to rain on the other reviewers&#x27; parade here but I am not a huge fan of this sunscreen.  I, too, checked the EWG ratings and this does get great results for ingredient safety, UVA/UVB protection, etc.  It works well.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin (neither of my children have had issues with this formula and my son&#x27;s skin is fairly sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the 3 star rating???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I *hate* the container.  I have only used the sunscreen for 1 week now and already have had to remove the top and squeeze and fold the (hard!) plastic container to try and get any out.  If it was just softer it would be so much easier to squeeze!  I feel like I won&#x27;t get to use all of the sunscreen because of the packaging.  And frankly, it&#x27;s annoying when I am in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It really is quite greasy.  All of the Loving Natural sunscreen products are that I have used.  My kids&#x27; hair always looks dirty/unwashed after I apply the sunscreen to their ears, neck, and forehead (where it touches their hair).  Both the front and back sticky label has fallen off this bottle of sunscreen within one week of starting to use it if that tells you anything about its \\&quot;grease factor\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s expensive (like most of the EWG highly rated sunscreens), especially if you buy it in the summer.  I bought it in April at a great price and again in June for a LOT more.  (the April tube was sent to my day care so I didn&#x27;t have any direct experience with it, so I bought it again to try it out at home if you&#x27;re wondering why I purchased multiple tubes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my mind there are better options.  I have tried a few others and prefer California Baby and Burn Out Kids to this brand, though it does a fine job if you can deal with the above issues.</li>
            <li> We use this product for a few years now and we still love it.</li>
            <li> Never had a burn on my 10 and 8 year old.  Great quality.  I rebuy everytime.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Adorable Baby SPF 30+ Sunscreen Non-Nano Zinc Oxide UVA/UVB 4.3 oz made by Loving Naturals for my pregnant wife (5 months pregnant) after reading about it on EWG.ORG Skin Deep Database. With only a 1 Hazard Score by the EWG it was the safest natural product I could find to help protect the development of my future child. This will also be the product I use in the summers on my child when he/she is born, but I feel adults should use it too. It definitely did the trick on our recent trip in Aruba.  We both used it on ourselves and neither of us received sunburns.  I was definitely out in the sun way more during the trip than she was, but I swam in the ocean, pool, and played volleyball everyday I was there and the sunscreen lasted. Although for only 4.3 oz it is extremely expensive, but it was worth the price for the protection for my wife and our future child.  I highly recommend this product from ADULTS and children.  p.s. If you are going away on a trip for a week or longer, purchase more than one bottle, it ran out quick.</li>
            <li> great, easy to apply; little too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;,  but still love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the fretting worrying kind of new mom (aren&#x27;t we all...) and I was worried about taking my 4 month old out into the sun without any protection. It just isn&#x27;t realistic to keep a baby indoors until they are 6 months old. After a lot of research, this sunscreen seemed the most gentle and natural. I applied this before taking the baby with me to the farmers market, and it worked great! No tan lines, no skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty thick, and a little greasy, but it does go on clear and is moisturizing, baby didn&#x27;t mind it at all. We used it the following weekend when we took her swimming for the first time. It was very water resistant and easy to reapply. I never saw it run or get into her eyes, she had a lot of fun in the pool.&lt;br /&gt;We will continue to use this, great product.</li>
            <li> A little greaser than the other top rated ones I&#x27;m trying but moisturizes well</li>
            <li> My son had a horrible allergic reaction to children&#x27;s sunscreen when he was about 10 months old.  It was awful -- red blotches, running eyes and nose.  I found this and have used it for many months since without any problems.  It&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;shiney&amp;#34; when it goes on, but that helps you see where you&#x27;re applying it and it goes away.</li>
            <li> I like this product because of the piece of mind I get when putting it on my infant. However, it is REALLY oily. Very oily where I don&#x27;t even want to pick him up when I put it on him because it will get all over me. Therefore, I have to wipe it off first.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have a history of bad reactions to sunscreen (stinging,rashes and hives).  This stuff works even on our faces without stinging.  It also stays on.  This can be good and bad.  This would be an asset when swimming or exercising outdoors.  It&#x27;s troublesome when I go to wash my hands after application, as even hand soap doesn&#x27;t dislodge it easily.  Warmer water helps for washing it off.  From my point of view this is a minor issue because there are so many brands we just can&#x27;t wear.  These days everyone needs sunscreen.  This formulation is fabulous for those of us who have sensitivity to many sunscreen ingredients.  The fragrance is mild and pleasant.  The feel is honestly rather sticky, but I don&#x27;t know how they could remedy that problem without adding irritating ingredients or decreasing it&#x27;s water resistance. If Loving Naturals can solve that problem they will get all five stars.  I have another request.  As people of color often do not need a sunscreen with really high SPF, make one specifically for folks with darker skin at SPF 15.</li>
            <li> Product smells like it has gone bad upon arrival- not sure if this is just the scent of the product?  Very oily, oil has separated from cream.  Terrible.</li>
            <li> I lived that&#x27;s it&#x27;s natural but it is greasy. Would not use at the beach because the sand would stick to you. Great for school though.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I love that it goes on clear and comparative to other natural sunscreens this gives more product for your money.  Worked great!!  I will DEFINATELY but again!</li>
            <li> My kids don&#x27;t like the smell. Seems to work fine. No sunburn.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my 6 month old baby girl. It seems to work well however it is a little oily to put on.</li>
            <li> Used on myself--not a baby--and it works.  No burn in the sun.  Goes on easily, dries quickly, no white sheen.  I&#x27;m lazy about re-applying once I&#x27;m outside, but that didn&#x27;t seem to matter--still no burn.  Pricey, but I guess that&#x27;s what happens when you look for Non-Nanno creams.</li>
            <li> I went to the beach this past weekend and was worried about my 5 and 1/2 month old being out in the sun.  After plenty of research as I am a market researcher, I found this product to be the best possible product for my new baby.  I researched it on EWG - cosmetic database and found it to be the least toxic.  After much comparison, because that is what I do, weighing cost, vs. ounces vs. toxicity, this brand beat out all others.  It may cost a little more than others on the shelf, but worth it when putting on a baby to know it is the best possible product and the least toxic.  Everything is in my baby&#x27;s mouth right now, and I didn&#x27;t even think twice about it being on her skin and possibly going into her mouth. Also, I barely had to use any because it was so smooth and creamy, it spread all over my baby&#x27;s skin so effortlessly.  I was really impressed with the consistency.  I maybe used a quarter size covering all exposed areas (she was wearing a swimsuit).  It lasted at least four hours if not longer on her (I didn&#x27;t reapply because we were only on the beach four hours) and she did not have a single burn on her delicate skin.  Pay the extra money to protect your baby against the sun in a safe way.  It is worth it.  Go to that database and look up the over the counter brands - you will be horrified by what is in those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I also contacted their customer service to see when my shipment would arrive.  Customer service was responsive and nice.  And my shipment made it to my house so quickly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brand, it will be all that I put on my baby and continue to use on her as she gets older.</li>
            <li> Best sun cream out there for kids, great protection and safe from bad chemicals. You need patience applying it, but worth it.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t so greasy, this stuff would be perfect. It protects my daughters pasty white skin, and it&#x27;s safe. But it&#x27;s just so greasy and that greasiness doesn&#x27;t go away until you use soap on it. This makes it a little problematic when I have a slippery baby in the pool and I&#x27;m trying not to lost my grip on her. But if you are looking for a good product that is safe and works, this one is a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  Still, I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again unless they do something about the packaging.  The bottle is the worst idea ever.  The sunscreen isn&#x27;t runny enough to use the hard plastic bottle the sunscreen comes in.  After it&#x27;s about a quarter used, it becomes nearly impossible to squeeze anything out of the bottle.  I had to constantly uncap the bottle and dig my finger in the bottle to get anything out.  When it is near the end, I can see no option but to cut through the thick plastic and scrape out what&#x27;s left into a different container.  What a pain.  There&#x27;s absolutely no common sense put into the bottle make and design.  I wish the manufacturer would use the same kind of tube that you see all other sunscreens use.  MUCH more practical that way!</li>
            <li> Very oily...my hair and cloths stick to my skin after apply and it takes like 4 hours to get a little dry but still it is a little sticky..this doesn&#x27;t smell or get pale/white residue but so sticky that I can&#x27;t tolerate it. It&#x27;s a good product on skin but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well, no smell, non-toxic, but sort of expensive given the small amount in a single container</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews from people saying this sunscreen was not greasy and bought it and a tube of Burn Out Kids for a trip to Disney World.  I have never seen such a gross greasy sunscreen.  I know that it&#x27;s safer to lie on top of your skin,  but this leaves you a shiny mess and you start to sweat immediately.  I felt like I sweated it all off within a half hour and reapplying was a chore.  It stained our clothing and felt very heavy on our skin.  I preferred the Burn Out Kids,  but that was very greasy as well.  Both are rated as very safe on the EWG sunscreen database,  but they don&#x27;t work if you sweat them off.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I really love this product for my 7 month old grandson. NO reactions, just wonderful NO SUNBURNED skin!</li>
            <li> This product is very sticky, but definitely works. It spreads on nicely and I love that I am not poisoning baby with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about a month and a half now for my infant daughter. It works really well, we were out in the sun/pool last weekend for over an hour and a half, and I never reapplied to her and she didn&#x27;t get the slightest bit of burn. She was very well protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;It goes on clear, no white streaks&lt;br /&gt;100% natural&lt;br /&gt;UVA AND UVB protection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A little more pricey than others.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly greasy at first (typical with sunscreen though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind buying the pricier sunscreen, since this bottle will probably last me the whole summer. I completely recommend it</li>
            <li> My kids don&#x27;t like how oily it is. It separates after a while and becomes too oily. Will not rebuy.</li>
            <li> &amp;#62;Smells like a sweet baby should.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Spreads out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;No tan or turned red whenever we went out. I would know since I forgot to put it on him one day.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Au Natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always give your baby thee best you can give with effort.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I like this better than Raw Elements, but it&#x27;s still an odd consistency (maybe that&#x27;s just organic products though). Less oily than Raw elements but still doesn&#x27;t rub in all that great. This product was greasy on my face. I was looking for an organic alternative to my Neutrogena hydroplex and based on previous reviews thought this would blend the same way so I could put make up over it but no way! Seemed to block the sun but I was only out a couple hours so not sure if that was really a good test.</li>
            <li> Not thick and pasty! Spreads smoothly and softly! Used on my 6month old and loved it!</li>
            <li> As a sunscreen it works well but this stuff is like rubbing grapeseed oil all over your kid. Super super greasy. I am changing brands.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of its excellent rating by EWG. I wanted a sunblock from my kids that does not contain dangerous ingredients. I was very happy to discover that it is also very easily absorbed without leaving white traces. I started to use it too.</li>
            <li> good fit, good quality. works fine.</li>
            <li> It seems to work and I don&#x27;t mind the consistency at all. We haven&#x27;t had any burns w/ this product.</li>
            <li> I was concerned from other reviews for the more &#x27;friendly&#x27; sunscreens that it wouldn&#x27;t rub in easily or be greasy but the consistency is just like any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.  Plus, the added bonus of having it work right away rather than having to soak in was great when I had to apply to my rambunctious 14mth old.  I also got the stick, just in case there was a consistency issue but I hardly used it.  I would recommend the bottle type and we will reload with more sunscreen for next summer.</li>
            <li> When applied you feel like you are covered in grease. That&#x27;s why it stays on after being in water for a long time (this only thing I like about it) and it is difficult to wash off. I cannot imagine wearing this sunscreen every day. I had been using Devita sunscreens before and will buy them again instead because they are also all natural, clear, contain non-nano zinc but they disappear on your skin.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this sunscreen, which was rated as one of the safer ones on the EWG Web site.  I have to say, though, it is the oiliest sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  My toddler was playing on our hardwood floors after I applied it on him this morning, and I&#x27;ve since slipped twice in the oil slick that he left behind.  For this price, I think I&#x27;m going to keep looking for something a little less greasy with an equivalent safety rating.</li>
            <li> My sensitive daughter has no reactions to this.  I use it as well.  It has no bad odors and it really protects well.  It leaves a bit of a residue feeling that goes away over time.  We don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen based on research by using a well-known website that rates products on their chemical safety. This sunscreen scored a 1 on a scale where 0-2 means low hazard, 3-6 is moderate hazard, and 7-10 is high hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen rated as being a low health concern because it doesn&#x27;t use the harmful chemicals that other sunscreens may use, chemicals which have been linked to various diseases and issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used this sunscreen at the beach in July on very sunny days. My son never got burned, nor did he end up with tan lines so I am happy with the protection it provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is how greasy the formula is. My son would not keep his sun hat on so I rubbed this into his scalp to try and protect is pale head from the sun. While it did it&#x27;s job in providing SPF, it made his hair super super greasy. It was so greasy that after 5 washings with multiple types of shampoos, it still was in his hair. I could style his hair in various silly hairdos and his hair would stay exactly in the same spot no matter what. This was after 5 washings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it was immensely greasy, it still did its job and afforded me some relief that I was not putting something harmful and filled with questionable chemicals on my son.</li>
            <li> Terrible experience with this sunscreen! So mad that I spent the money... I tried it once - it goes on thick, didn&#x27;t absorb at all and left my skin sticky for the entire day. I used it on the beach and because it was basically glue on my legs, I had sand and dust covering my legs by the end of the day that was quite tough to remove in the shower. Definitely don&#x27;t recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Goes on clear unlike many other chemical free sunscreens. The formula is not too thick so it spreads easily.  Smell is relatively unscented.</li>
            <li> I sent back because it was too greasy.  Would never work on the beach with all that sand;(.  There are more safe ones on the market that aren&#x27;t as greasy.</li>
            <li> You have to re-apply it more then normal sun screen but its all natural!! Love it! And its not pasty at all either.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product based on the EWG rating.  I live in South Florida so sunscreen is always necessary and I feel it is very important to have one without harsh chemicals for my child.  Sadly, this is not the product for us.  First, it is extremely GREASY!!  I read another reviewer that said the product went on smooth \\&quot;like melted butter\\&quot; and that&#x27;s actually a pretty good description.  It was as if I had slathered my child in melted butter she was so greasy.  This could also be hazardous because try holding onto a \\&quot;greased\\&quot; toddler.  I could have POSSIBLY looked past this if the product actually worked but it does not.  I applied the product to my child before we left the house and then again after I noticed her arms were looking a bit pink.  We were only in the sun for a total of one hour so I should not have even had to reapply but I did so anyway (after we were about 1/2 hour into our 1 hour of sun exposure) because I didn&#x27;t want her to get sunburned.  I thought, or I should say hoped, her arms were pink because she was hot but after her bath at home it was confirmed that her arms did in fact get sunburned.  I&#x27;ve used a Babyganics product that worked MUCH better in terms of blocking the sun as that day we were in the sun for almost two hours and you would never know it.  There was not the slightest hint of pink to her skin with the other product.  The Babyganics product was sticky though and sand stuck to it LIKE CRAZY so I went on the lookout for something better and came across this product on the EWG website and decided that despite the hefty price tag, I would give it a try.  Sand stuck to this product too (and no, sand does not excessively stick to every sunscreen and I&#x27;ve used MANY).  So this product is swiftly being return and the quest shall continue.  I rated this product 2 stars bc of the safe ingredients only.  The product itself simply does not work though.</li>
            <li> I buy Adorable Baby SPF 30+ Sunscreen Non-Nano Zinc Oxide UVA/UVB for my son and love. It is a great quality product and rated very well on Skin Deep.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it ti everyone, especially if you have a child.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen that seems safe and nontoxic for baby and smooths reasonably well into the skin.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Virtually no chemicals!  High zinc oxide content,  spreads to look clear, applies easily, no fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  feels somewhat oily, a little pricy&lt;br /&gt;The pros outweigh the cons as far as I am conceerned!</li>
            <li> Works great and and is the preferred brand for my dermatalogist friend for his daughter; good enough for me.  Stuff is expensive and is a pain to get the last amount out of the bottle. A tube or a more squeezable bottle would allow you to get all of it out.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every natural sunscreen and this one is great.  it&#x27;s non-nano and goes on clear.  And the tube is easy to squeeze for me.  I think I&#x27;ll wind up using it too.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to use an all natural award winning sunscreen and not walk around with pasted white skin so that my son and I look like night of the living dead zombies at the playground.</li>
            <li> Super greasy, my kids and I burn for some reason when we use this sunscreen.  Not at all what I was hoping for given the higher than average price.</li>
            <li> My son was getting dry patches on his skin from California Baby... (which is also good, my daughter is fine with it) so I had been looking for another healthy sunblock for him. I am so glad I tried this. As other comments have said... it does come off greasy (I like to say SHINY!) but it doesn&#x27;t seem to block the pores or anything it just spreads easy over the body. I actually find it helpful so I can see where I missed. Best part for me is that the dry patches are gone and even though he&#x27;s in the sun a lot we have yet to have a burn. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is for babies but I got it for my self since I have reaction to most chemicals. It is a bit sticky but works very well..I didn&#x27;t get any rashes or eyes burn..</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen on my kids and myself - it is ideal, preventing burns on even the most sun sensitive of us, and curiously it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my acne go into overdrive like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about how healthy this one is compared to others, so I&#x27;ll give it 2 stars.  However, it leaves your baby SO greasy.  It&#x27;s like putting oil all over.  He looks hot and sweaty with this on.  The Neutrogena one was so much better .  Quality-wise though I&#x27;m not sure which is healthier.</li>
            <li> Glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave baby with weird chalky white streaks or appearance.  And most importantly, he doesn&#x27;t burn when wearing this.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but if you are buying any sunscreen that rates well from EWG, you have to pay the price.  I use Badger and this brand and like them both.  This one my 8 year old daughter likes better because it doesnt go on as white and is easier to rub in.  Sun coverage is very good.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product after doing some research on sunscreen for young children with eczema.  It works great - it isn&#x27;t thick and greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue on your skin.  It is costly for the little bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if we got a dud product or what, but the sunscreen seems like it&#x27;s separated and it won&#x27;t mix together.  We shook it a ton and it first comes out all watery and greasy, and then some of the thicker stuff comes out.  I tried to mix it up in my hands and put it on my baby anyway--it was so greasy and disgusting.  It worked, in that my daughter didn&#x27;t get sunburned.  But it was so gross we went out and bought something else immediately.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s: I like the fact that it really works! My pasty sensitive skin didn&#x27;t get burned or breakout. y skin.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: I felt like a greased pig at the county fair.</li>
            <li> I researched sunscreen lotions for our babies and found ewg.org, which rates 1800 products yearly, incuding testing UVA transmission (SPF rating is information about UVB transmission only).  The Adorable Baby product is rated very highly, blocks UVA effectively, and contains no questionable chemicals (just non-nano Zinc as the blocking agent).  The link to the ewg.org database for any interested is:  [...]    I find it very easy to put on (not chalky or pasty).  Out of the tube, it&#x27;s white and the consistency of butter; and like butter, your body heat rapidly melts it into a thinner liquid, which is clear.  It&#x27;s as easy to apply as any sunscreen and stays on well, including in water.    A few things I came across in my research: SPF beyond about 30 isn&#x27;t important, as SPF 30 already blocks 97% of UVB. I don&#x27;t want oxybenzone (as it might be hormone disruptor) or retinyl palmitate (might promotes skin tumors) in sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I searched several websites to find the most natural and effective sunscreen for my children.  I was aware of the harmful ingredients in some of the more popular brands on the market and wanted something safe to use on my children.  I used this on a 4 year old and 1 year old.  My 4 year old burns easily so we apply sunscreen every 45 minutes to an hour.  My one year old does not burn but we reapply anyway.  Both of my children burned with this sunscreen.  Very ineffective protection and highly disappointed. Although Coppertone dries their skin out and they suffer from eczema, they don&#x27;t burn with Coppertone sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, just fantastic.  Is quite thick but once you leave it to soak for a while, i didn&#x27;t even notice it.  Safe to use for my little one and myself.  Will be getting another supply once this runs out.</li>
            <li> Greasy but much easier to put on then most physical blocks, which are very pasty, stain clothes, and hard to get off your own hand. Makes it looks like your kid is sweating up a storm. I guess the shininess helps at least you to see where the product is and isn&#x27;t when you apply it. It also seems to stay in place even on an active kid rolling around in the park and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. Kids love it and it works great.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. I applied before my sons field day at school and while I was their I reapplied. I got totally sun burned! Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Small, fits into the diaper bag to have at all times. NOn-toxic!!! (love that!). NOt so greesy and impossible to wash off  hands after applying (like most other brands). protects, safe, convienent. 5 stars! thanks</li>
            <li> I almost never throw out a product 1/2 full but for this I made an exception.  This sunscreen is incredibly greasy and stays greasy long after, 30 min plus, application. Also it is not nearly strong enough for delicate baby/toddler skin.  In only 2 two hour trips into the sun with this sunscreen my daughter got burned. She was out as long if not longer w/ the Neutrogena Baby sunscreen and got no color at all. (Though the Neutrogena leaves her zinc oxide white and streaky....). I would stay away from this product try Neutrogena or Mustela.</li>
            <li> very greasy, very hard to get out of the container when it is 1/2 full</li>
            <li> No sunburned baby at Disneyland for me. :-) And, after all my research, I felt comfortable using this on him compared to the ones with lots of unknown ingredients. Went on easily and wasn&#x27;t really smelly. Very thick, so a little hard to squeeze out of the container but not so hard to make me not like it. Will continue using on my toddler.</li>
            <li> Finally a sunscreen without harmful chemicals!  My boys have sensitive skin and even those sunscreens that say made for sensitive skin made my boys eyes burn and itch and their noses would be stuffed up for days.  Adorable Baby is safe and they don&#x27;t burn, finally sunscreen that protects safely!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this sunscreen a shot, I don&#x27;t like the chemicals in other sunscreens. However, after 2 hours in the hot FL sun (and having reapplied it every 30 minutes the entire time we were out) I got a bad sun burn, and my 1 and 3 year olds got their first sun burns ever. This simply did not work for us. I also used half a container in one day (on 3 people, yes...I applied that much to try to prevent being burned).  On to try to find a new product :(. This was very greasy, but I would have continued to use it...had it actually worked.</li>
            <li> Use this product every year.  I am very fair skinned, burn after 20min in the sun but with this product I never burn after hours in the sun.  Does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dog as she is white with lots of pink, which is vulnerable.  Seems to be fine, and I&#x27;d have given 5 stars, BUT I cannot squeeze it out easily, which is a major hassle.  I use this on my face as well, and my kids, but again, I bought it for my pooch.  She hasn&#x27;t gotten a burn so it must be working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update~I want to repeat how OBNOXIOUS squeezing this out of the bottle is.  It is nearly impossible and I&#x27;m now looking for a different brand it annoys me so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I plan to buy every summer now. No white residue. Goes on easy and not overly greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old who wears sunscreen daily to daycare.  I absolutely love it and it is very easy to put on.  A little shiny at first but goes on nicely.  There is absolutely nothing about the product itself that I would change.  It is the most natural thing that I was able to find on the market.  The only downside for me is the price :-(  This is understandable since they are expensive to produce and it will hopefully come down as more people decide to buy safe products for themselves and their kids.  It is fairly small and we go through it quickly because we live in Florida.  My little one gets it applied to him twice per day for play time.  I also bought the face stick and that lasts longer and it is a great product.  I have the california baby face stick as well and wish that I came across this one before I got the Cal baby.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried two different brands of natural SPF. This and Badger. This one wins. It is less greasy and goes on easier. It also has a super low rating on the safety list for SPF which is a good thing!</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple sunscreens in the past 5 years, this is the one with the least harmful ingredients. It does not make my eyes or my children&#x27;s eyes watery. There are two versions, the &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;, both are good. The &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; is a bit more greasy and the white leaves a bit of a white film but I like how the skin looks slightly lighter in color , feels like my yellow skin gets a bit of &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34;. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the bottle. I struggle to get it out when it comes down to a certain level, the material is too hard and I normally cut it with scissors to get what is left which normally lasts me one more month or more. If not for the bottle I would give it 5 stars. It is a bit pricey but since all the family uses it constantly, it&#x27;s got to have the best ingredients.</li>
