            <li>they look very nice, fit comfortably and shipped on time.</li>
            <li>The crystals are nice, they do not look cheap.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to fix this issue by using some adhesive foam that I happened to already have:</li>
            <li>Now they fit nice and snug.</li>

            <li>they got here on time :-)</li>

            <li>They are just ok.</li>
            <li>Look ok from a distance, but up close, bleah.</li>
            <li>They are unique and I love wearing them!</li>
            <li>I just love the quality and they are a show stopper.</li>
            <li>i do love them though i was very excited opening the package</li>
            <li>These arrived quickly, and they are very lovely.</li>
            <li>These arrived super quick and in great shape.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fat fingers and these fit great..</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the way they look &amp; the way they feel; on the fingers they will fit...</li>
            <li>I got 10 pieces in 3 different sizes that fit just perfectly.</li>
            <li>Overall, good quality and will be a good addition to my witch costume for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the items, and for the great customer service!</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>i was able to use them on my Halloween outfit and even after for some fun dress up with my niece and nephew!</li>
            <li>Other than that, they are amayzing and awesome.</li>
            <li>Wicked Cool!</li>
            <li>i love them, but i had to cut them because the nails were to big after that they are great and now can fit any one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s beautiful but they send only 8 fingers ........</li>
            <li>They are pretty, and I wish they were bigger, because then they would have been perfect.</li>
            <li>Looks even better in person and arrived SUPER quick!</li>
            <li>I was fine with the size</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>So I quickly ran inside and opened up the package and took many pictures of them before I put them on.</li>
            <li>Thats how strong and secure they feel.</li>
            <li>Thumbs fit fine though</li>
            <li>They fit great and on all my fingers nice and tight.</li>
            <li>I bought this and had to mix and match nails from both hands to fit just one.</li>
            <li>I am not petite and these fit me too</li>
            <li>those claws in that picture fit a hand of that size, just saying.  </li>
            <li>And I cannot even bend the metal or stretch it if I wanted to make it fit.</li>
            <li>They still worked good enough for Halloween costume one night but would have been more comfortable</li>
            <li>fabulous adjunct to Halloween costume</li>
            <li>but they had weird finger sizes that couldn&#x27;t fit the hand good ship time though it was awesome but needs improve me</li>
            <li>they fit on my fingers...</li>
            <li>Some may have a problem with the fit</li>
            <li>comfortable.</li>
            <li>I really liked these nails though didn&#x27;t receive right amount of right pair sizes...</li>
            <li>but they were actually metal very nice</li>
            <li>These are the closest I could find to the original claws in the movie.</li>
            <li>but in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the fit was a bit smaller for i have smaller&lt;</li>
            <li>Required quite a bit of clean up to be workable.</li>
            <li>I am very well pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Really cool and fits on all my fingers</li>
            <li>she loved them going to save for hawloween next year</li>
            <li>these rings are too cool.  </li>
            <li>But they&#x27;ll be good for initial costume showcasing and pictures.  </li>
            <li>, it looks cool and will be used.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in good condition, and earlier than estimated.  </li>
            <li>I am very very happy they came in the mail last Friday and while I was walking back from</li>
            <li>They fit nice, sometimes just gotta play with the middle ones a bit</li>
            <li>a bit big on her fingers, but fit fine when she wore them on top of her gloves.</li>
            <li>But they are pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>However, the large ones don&#x27;t fit my thumbs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d fit someone with large hands.  </li>
            <li>otherwise great quality, heavy metal and feel substantial.</li>
            <li>Otherwise they are pretty cool</li>
            <li>I have very thin fingers (my wedding ring is a size 3.5), and these fit perfectly on me.  </li>
            <li>otherwise these are going to fall right off.</li>
            <li>Right color.</li>
            <li>but when wearing them over long gloves they stay on very well.&lt;br /&gt;They came in a timely manner, in good packaging and all the pieces were there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>EXCEPT the curve of the large ring is waaaaay different that the curve of the medium size, so it looks off.&lt;br /&gt;I am still going to wear the ones that fit, I just wish more did.&lt;br /&gt;They are made from a sturdy metal &amp; the crystals have held up well.</li>
            <li>I love these, they are different sizes to best fit your fingers, keep in mind that they are factory made so they won&#x27;t fit evey figure as you&#x27;d like them too, or you might have one or two a little lose or tight.  </li>
            <li>Some people have mentioned them not fitting all that great.</li>
            <li>Cheap, as expected, and fit me!</li>
            <li>I wish you can get more and in different colors too and desings</li>
            <li>Item arrived exactly as described and was separately packaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are wonderful claws for cosplay, they do NOT look cheesy.</li>
            <li>They look and feel intense!</li>
            <li>These nails look really great and are well constructed, but they are very small.  </li>
            <li>The ones that do look nice, but in my case it&#x27;s not even enough to make up one complete hand.</li>
            <li>They came on time, fit my fingers, and are just really pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Great buy for the unique individual who wants something new for their wardrobe.</li>
            <li>They look nifty and are pretty solidly constructed for how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>They really should have specified the sizes that come with this.</li>
            <li>Generic sizes for all fingers actually fit well.</li>
            <li>i say thanks</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I did end up loosing some, but that was me just not being responsible.</li>
            <li>only make  8 fit.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Only about 3 of the rings fit my fingers and the rest do not.</li>
            <li>Fit almost all my fingers (except the ring finger that was too big).</li>
            <li>There are some talons where i can slide up to the mid section of my finger, and others where they barely fit at the tip of the finger.</li>
            <li>I feel i can do some real damage with them...</li>
            <li>I felt it looked different and some of them didnt fit my fingers.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really for me</li>
            <li>Getting ready to order another set.</li>
            <li>Fingers all fit some are too big</li>
            <li>so I really like them</li>
            <li>fast shipment</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These claws came in and I really like them.</li>
            <li>The claws are not sharp and they are very well made I will be having a lot of fun with them</li>
            <li>Like others said, they were cheap and too small to fit my fingers.  </li>
            <li>The pinky claw is a little tight but all other claws fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li>exactly as described, no missing stones.</li>
            <li>They came in individual baggies too which was cool because I didn&#x27;t lose the stones when i opened the package.</li>
            <li>some of the rings are too tight, wish there were more sizes</li>
            <li>its for normal to semi-large hands.</li>
            <li>They came in a timely manner but they only sent one thumb and one of the other ring fingers doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li>I think my hands are average size, and these fit all my fingers decently.  </li>
            <li>This item was exactly as described and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>At first we were shorted 5 claws, but once we got ahold of the shop they were quick to help and send our missing ones.</li>
            <li>I have a large pinky, ring size 8, and I did not expect it to fit anyway, but it was beyond too small for</li>
            <li>These look so deadly, but are easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li>I love these, super creepy..</li>
            <li>just cut a little piece of foam and stuck it underneath each nail, along the top inner part of the ring.</li>
            <li>large size for the thumb did not fit my thumb, size 10, but did fit my middle finger.</li>
            <li>Personally, i dont care about the jewels much; if one breaks off, i wouldnt care.</li>
            <li>a little loose on my fingers but still pretty cool looking</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made to fit children and small women.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I had cheap plastic claws that would pop off if you touched anything.</li>
            <li>If your fingers run on the larger side most of these flat out will not fit.</li>
            <li>Not a smooth as the pic made it look but fits and are very pretty</li>
            <li>Be aware that they are made for tiny fingers and the molding flash/general fit and finish is really poor.</li>
            <li>my pinky.&lt;br /&gt;The middle size for the index, middle &amp; ring fingers were okay for my ring finger, size 10, and index finger, but did not fit my middle finger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two of the ten &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; are a tight fit but nonetheless, it was delivered way ahead of schedule and all in one piece (or ten in this case).</li>
            <li>I have skinny fingers, though, so I had to push the rings far back on my knuckles</li>
            <li>Glued on pretty tight.</li>
            <li>Took a little rearranging but finally found the right size for each finger.</li>
            <li>Will be a fun add on for my malificent costume &amp; other goth events!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true - if you have small fingers like me, they&#x27;re a little on the large side (especially my ring finger).</li>
            <li>but these are pretty narrow and snug.</li>
            <li>They serve no purpose other than looking super bad-ass and I wear them randomly just for fun!</li>
            <li>My main issue is two of them were rather sharp inside, poking me often when I tried them on, I plan to counteract this with a bandage.</li>

            <li> The crystals are nice, they do not look cheap.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to fix this issue by using some adhesive foam that I happened to already have:</li>
            <li> Now they fit nice and snug.</li>

            <li> These arrived quickly, and they are very lovely.</li>
            <li> These arrived super quick and in great shape.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fat fingers and these fit great..</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the way they look &amp; the way they feel; on the fingers they will fit...</li>
            <li> I got 10 pieces in 3 different sizes that fit just perfectly.</li>
            <li> Overall, good quality and will be a good addition to my witch costume for Halloween.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the items, and for the great customer service!</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> i was able to use them on my Halloween outfit and even after for some fun dress up with my niece and nephew!</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are amayzing and awesome.</li>
            <li> Wicked Cool!</li>
            <li> i love them, but i had to cut them because the nails were to big after that they are great and now can fit any one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s beautiful but they send only 8 fingers ........</li>
            <li> They are pretty, and I wish they were bigger, because then they would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> Looks even better in person and arrived SUPER quick!</li>
            <li> I was fine with the size</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> So I quickly ran inside and opened up the package and took many pictures of them before I put them on.</li>
            <li> Thats how strong and secure they feel.</li>
            <li> Thumbs fit fine though</li>
            <li> They fit great and on all my fingers nice and tight.</li>
            <li> I bought this and had to mix and match nails from both hands to fit just one.</li>
            <li> I am not petite and these fit me too</li>
            <li> those claws in that picture fit a hand of that size, just saying.  </li>
            <li> And I cannot even bend the metal or stretch it if I wanted to make it fit.</li>
            <li> They still worked good enough for Halloween costume one night but would have been more comfortable</li>
            <li> fabulous adjunct to Halloween costume</li>
            <li> but they had weird finger sizes that couldn&#x27;t fit the hand good ship time though it was awesome but needs improve me</li>
            <li> they fit on my fingers...</li>
            <li> Some may have a problem with the fit</li>
            <li> comfortable.</li>
            <li> I really liked these nails though didn&#x27;t receive right amount of right pair sizes...</li>
            <li> but they were actually metal very nice</li>
            <li> These are the closest I could find to the original claws in the movie.</li>
            <li> but in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the fit was a bit smaller for i have smaller&lt;</li>
            <li> Required quite a bit of clean up to be workable.</li>
            <li> I am very well pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Really cool and fits on all my fingers</li>
            <li> she loved them going to save for hawloween next year</li>
            <li> these rings are too cool.  </li>
            <li> But they&#x27;ll be good for initial costume showcasing and pictures.  </li>
            <li> , it looks cool and will be used.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good condition, and earlier than estimated.  </li>
            <li> I am very very happy they came in the mail last Friday and while I was walking back from</li>
            <li> They fit nice, sometimes just gotta play with the middle ones a bit</li>
            <li> a bit big on her fingers, but fit fine when she wore them on top of her gloves.</li>
            <li> But they are pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> However, the large ones don&#x27;t fit my thumbs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d fit someone with large hands.  </li>
            <li> otherwise great quality, heavy metal and feel substantial.</li>
            <li> Otherwise they are pretty cool</li>
            <li> I have very thin fingers (my wedding ring is a size 3.5), and these fit perfectly on me.  </li>
            <li> otherwise these are going to fall right off.</li>
            <li> Right color.</li>
            <li> but when wearing them over long gloves they stay on very well.&lt;br /&gt;They came in a timely manner, in good packaging and all the pieces were there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> EXCEPT the curve of the large ring is waaaaay different that the curve of the medium size, so it looks off.&lt;br /&gt;I am still going to wear the ones that fit, I just wish more did.&lt;br /&gt;They are made from a sturdy metal &amp; the crystals have held up well.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are different sizes to best fit your fingers, keep in mind that they are factory made so they won&#x27;t fit evey figure as you&#x27;d like them too, or you might have one or two a little lose or tight.  </li>
            <li> Some people have mentioned them not fitting all that great.</li>
            <li> Cheap, as expected, and fit me!</li>
            <li> I wish you can get more and in different colors too and desings</li>
            <li> Item arrived exactly as described and was separately packaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are wonderful claws for cosplay, they do NOT look cheesy.</li>
            <li> They look and feel intense!</li>
            <li> These nails look really great and are well constructed, but they are very small.  </li>
            <li> The ones that do look nice, but in my case it&#x27;s not even enough to make up one complete hand.</li>
            <li> They came on time, fit my fingers, and are just really pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Great buy for the unique individual who wants something new for their wardrobe.</li>
            <li> They look nifty and are pretty solidly constructed for how cheap they are.</li>
            <li> They really should have specified the sizes that come with this.</li>
            <li> Generic sizes for all fingers actually fit well.</li>
            <li> i say thanks</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I did end up loosing some, but that was me just not being responsible.</li>
            <li> only make  8 fit.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Only about 3 of the rings fit my fingers and the rest do not.</li>
            <li> Fit almost all my fingers (except the ring finger that was too big).</li>
            <li> There are some talons where i can slide up to the mid section of my finger, and others where they barely fit at the tip of the finger.</li>
            <li> I feel i can do some real damage with them...</li>
            <li> I felt it looked different and some of them didnt fit my fingers.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really for me</li>
            <li> Getting ready to order another set.</li>
            <li> Fingers all fit some are too big</li>
            <li> so I really like them</li>
            <li> fast shipment</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These claws came in and I really like them.</li>
            <li> The claws are not sharp and they are very well made I will be having a lot of fun with them</li>
            <li> Like others said, they were cheap and too small to fit my fingers.  </li>
            <li> The pinky claw is a little tight but all other claws fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li> exactly as described, no missing stones.</li>
            <li> They came in individual baggies too which was cool because I didn&#x27;t lose the stones when i opened the package.</li>
            <li> some of the rings are too tight, wish there were more sizes</li>
            <li> its for normal to semi-large hands.</li>
            <li> They came in a timely manner but they only sent one thumb and one of the other ring fingers doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li> I think my hands are average size, and these fit all my fingers decently.  </li>
            <li> This item was exactly as described and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> At first we were shorted 5 claws, but once we got ahold of the shop they were quick to help and send our missing ones.</li>
            <li> I have a large pinky, ring size 8, and I did not expect it to fit anyway, but it was beyond too small for</li>
            <li> These look so deadly, but are easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> I love these, super creepy..</li>
            <li> just cut a little piece of foam and stuck it underneath each nail, along the top inner part of the ring.</li>
            <li> large size for the thumb did not fit my thumb, size 10, but did fit my middle finger.</li>
            <li> Personally, i dont care about the jewels much; if one breaks off, i wouldnt care.</li>
            <li> a little loose on my fingers but still pretty cool looking</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made to fit children and small women.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I had cheap plastic claws that would pop off if you touched anything.</li>
            <li> If your fingers run on the larger side most of these flat out will not fit.</li>
            <li> Not a smooth as the pic made it look but fits and are very pretty</li>
            <li> Be aware that they are made for tiny fingers and the molding flash/general fit and finish is really poor.</li>
            <li> my pinky.&lt;br /&gt;The middle size for the index, middle &amp; ring fingers were okay for my ring finger, size 10, and index finger, but did not fit my middle finger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two of the ten &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; are a tight fit but nonetheless, it was delivered way ahead of schedule and all in one piece (or ten in this case).</li>
            <li> I have skinny fingers, though, so I had to push the rings far back on my knuckles</li>
            <li> Glued on pretty tight.</li>
            <li> Took a little rearranging but finally found the right size for each finger.</li>
            <li> Will be a fun add on for my malificent costume &amp; other goth events!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true - if you have small fingers like me, they&#x27;re a little on the large side (especially my ring finger).</li>
            <li> but these are pretty narrow and snug.</li>
            <li> They serve no purpose other than looking super bad-ass and I wear them randomly just for fun!</li>
            <li> My main issue is two of them were rather sharp inside, poking me often when I tried them on, I plan to counteract this with a bandage.</li>
            <li> they just didn&#x27;t fit over my false nails.</li>
            <li> The claws are a little small, for a child they are fine or a teen....</li>
            <li> I wear a ladie&#x27;s size large glove and they are very tight.</li>
            <li> but i only got 5, and it came with one small, 2 medium and 2 large rings.</li>
            <li> These false nails are cool.  </li>
            <li> not disappointed with the rings just the size is made for say small fingers the only way I can use these is either cut the ring and open up to my size or buy some other rings that are my size and apply the nails to the secondary rings.</li>
            <li> I can actually use the nails to scratch, etc., without fear of them slipping off.</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t be worn long because they start to hurt your fingertips.</li>
            <li> To wear it a long time as a costume I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Ring sizes need to be bigger or sets need to be offered in other sizes...</li>
            <li> if they were sharp enough.</li>
            <li> The claws are a little on the bigger size but that is just because my fingers are on the smaller side.</li>
            <li> they was the wrong color actually some were black and some were pewter and some of them dont fit well</li>
            <li> so I am making them into single claw necklaces.  </li>
            <li> However they are not adjustable and are clearly made with small feminine fingers in mind.</li>
            <li> They are cool looking, but because they are not adjustable, they are almost useless.  </li>
            <li> cuz theyre kinda loose on me</li>
            <li> Only thing i would let down on is that some f the diamonds were glued wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are covered in tiny black beads.</li>
            <li> The thumb nails are not the same and some of them were to tight on my fingers.</li>
            <li> I had to sand down the sharp edges left by the molding process before I could wear them.  </li>
            <li> The sizes are a little off, but everyones fingers are different.</li>
            <li> A little big for fingers</li>
            <li> I have small fingers) and their not sharp, which goes along with Otakon&#x27;s weapon policies.</li>
            <li> If you have larger fingers, these may not fit well and the rings are not adjustable.  </li>
            <li> apparently has small fingers</li>
            <li> The other issue is a few of them seemed smaller than their twin, causing a couple of my fingers to turn red at the tips as I practice wore them, I&#x27;m not sure what to do to help that yet.</li>
            <li> small size for the pinky finger is sooooo teeny tiny.</li>
            <li> They were small they hurt my pinkie and thumb,and the ring finger was a bit big.</li>
            <li> At least i for my money back</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the set with different sizes to someone with thick hands.</li>
            <li> they look FAAAAAAAB but no very comfortable</li>
            <li> The rings could go almost all the way down my fingers</li>
            <li> because the nails curve down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to do anything with them on, but they look cool</li>
            <li> They are well made and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome costume addition, but beware, they will scare small children, and they are somewhat sharp, so don&#x27;t go trying to grab anyone without being careful.</li>
            <li> These are very small, made for a petite female, or a child.</li>
            <li> I lost half of them in my car</li>
            <li> Some of the black stones in it had come off when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I have very small fingers, so some of the rings were a little big.</li>
            <li> but there are a few problems I encountered.</li>
            <li> they dont chip or make your fingers green.</li>
            <li> I expect them to stay firmly attached.</li>
            <li> The item showed up at least 10 days sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m missing one from the pack.</li>
            <li> they are a little small for my fingers</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also a little big which is weird because I have fat fingers</li>
            <li> So you get what you pay for. :/</li>
            <li> MEEEEEEEEEEOOOOWWWWW PUURRRRRFECT for that small job</li>
            <li> Ive got small hands</li>
            <li> I usually ended up not wearing them at all, except for maybe when someone took a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It fits for small hands.</li>
            <li> so just be careful if you have false nails</li>
            <li> Small sizes, the thumbs are too tight, ( I have thin womens hands</li>
            <li> A little snug for my small fingers but not too uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> this is not for small hands!</li>
            <li> (my ring finger is about 4 to give you some perspective as to how thin my fingers are).</li>
            <li> I bought these and figured they would look awful since the price was so agreeable, but I was very surprised!</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t see wearing them for too long at the Halloween party since it&#x27;s very difficult to grip anything (like a cup!)</li>
            <li> I got these and was a little disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t adjustable.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but how could you go wrong</li>
            <li> I just wanted to look kinda creepy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I recieved one of them the wrong size</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I&#x27;m doing a Blind Mag cosplay.</li>
            <li> but i have very very thin fingers.</li>
            <li> and so cold</li>
            <li> Very tedious.</li>
            <li> The hopping wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> painful to use.  </li>

            <li> Generic sizes for all fingers actually fit well. Will be using these along with a power tripper for a violet wand. They look like great electro play conductors.</li>
            <li> Freaking awesome!! They serve no purpose other than looking super bad-ass and I wear them randomly just for fun! The pinky claw is a little tight but all other claws fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li> 4 of them were to big</li>
            <li> These look great, slightly better in person than pictured. The crystals are nice, they do not look cheap. They arrived quickly! I am very well pleased with this purchase. I am not petite and these fit me too: 5&#x27;8\\&quot;, glove size 7 1/2, ring finger is size 8.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to get them but they never made it.  At least i for my money back</li>
            <li> I had to sand down the sharp edges left by the molding process before I could wear them.  Afterwards, however, they are awesome!</li>
            <li> These nails look awesome and are going to be perfect for my costume but there are a few problems I encountered. My main issue is two of them were rather sharp inside, poking me often when I tried them on, I plan to counteract this with a bandage. The other issue is a few of them seemed smaller than their twin, causing a couple of my fingers to turn red at the tips as I practice wore them, I&#x27;m not sure what to do to help that yet.</li>
            <li> These claws look awesome. I love, love, love the way they look &amp; the way they feel; on the fingers they will fit...&lt;br /&gt;The small size for the pinky finger is sooooo teeny tiny. I have a large pinky, ring size 8, and I did not expect it to fit anyway, but it was beyond too small for my pinky.&lt;br /&gt;The middle size for the index, middle &amp; ring fingers were okay for my ring finger, size 10, and index finger, but did not fit my middle finger.&lt;br /&gt;The large size for the thumb did not fit my thumb, size 10, but did fit my middle finger. EXCEPT the curve of the large ring is waaaaay different that the curve of the medium size, so it looks off.&lt;br /&gt;I am still going to wear the ones that fit, I just wish more did.&lt;br /&gt;They are made from a sturdy metal &amp; the crystals have held up well.</li>
            <li> They look and feel very nice! Solid, sparkly, substantial. Very cool. Some people have mentioned them not fitting all that great. It&#x27;s true - if you have small fingers like me, they&#x27;re a little on the large side (especially my ring finger). However, I was able to fix this issue by using some adhesive foam that I happened to already have: [[ASIN:B000VQHS5I B000VQHS5I]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just cut a little piece of foam and stuck it underneath each nail, along the top inner part of the ring. Now they fit nice and snug. I can actually use the nails to scratch, etc., without fear of them slipping off. And they look awesome!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really big... The rings could go almost all the way down my fingers</li>
            <li> my niece real love it nail claw i say thanks</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! exactly as described, no missing stones. just arrived, will update if any fall out to soon... gorgeous &amp; fits well with the additional sizes!!! Will be a fun add on for my malificent costume &amp; other goth events!!!</li>
            <li> some of the rings are too tight, wish there were more sizes</li>
            <li> i wear them all the time and get a lot of compliments! the only problem is it says 10 pcs but i only got 5, and it came with one small, 2 medium and 2 large rings. oh well.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my outfit for the renaissance fair. Read the reviews and seemed like a good buy. I was wrong. These are very small, made for a petite female, or a child. I am sure there is not way those claws in that picture fit a hand of that size, just saying.  And I cannot even bend the metal or stretch it if I wanted to make it fit. They are pretty, and I wish they were bigger, because then they would have been perfect. /shrug Oh well, forewarned.</li>
            <li> These nails look really great and are well constructed, but they are very small.  They&#x27;re made to fit children and small women.  I wear a ladie&#x27;s size large glove and they are very tight.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! Especially for the price. Very sturdy and fast shipping. Everything was packed so safely. The sizes are a little off, but everyones fingers are different.</li>
            <li> Really cool and fits on all my fingers</li>
            <li> I enjoyed them. they fit perfectly on each finger they are my style I wish you can get more and in different colors too and desings</li>
            <li> All of the nails are one size. The only thing I can put them on is my thumb.</li>
            <li> These were great for my Halloween outfit. They fit great and on all my fingers nice and tight. I did end up loosing some, but that was me just not being responsible. I am going to purchase more!</li>
            <li> I really liked these nails though didn&#x27;t receive right amount of right pair sizes...like only 1 pinky and 3 thumbs... They still worked good enough for Halloween costume one night but would have been more comfortable had there been a set of each size.</li>
            <li> I got these and was a little disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t adjustable. They can&#x27;t be worn long because they start to hurt your fingertips. If your planning to pose in pictures its fie. To wear it a long time as a costume I would not recommend. But they are pretty cheap. So you get what you pay for. :/</li>
            <li> They came in a timely manner but they only sent one thumb and one of the other ring fingers doesn&#x27;t fit right but otherwise its great</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly, and they are very lovely. However, the large ones don&#x27;t fit my thumbs. That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this a 5.</li>
            <li> The thumb nails are not the same and some of them were to tight on my fingers.</li>
            <li> Ring sizes need to be bigger or sets need to be offered in other sizes... These are great if your fingers are the size of a childs but if you want to wear these like I did without having them fall off you had better invest in some good nail glue otherwise these are going to fall right off.</li>
            <li> very nice, sturdy and beautiful crystals...they just didn&#x27;t fit over my false nails. they do have a curve to them so just be careful if you have false nails</li>
            <li> GREAT  but not size adjustable  and so cold only make  8 fit.  well made  ,sturdy .  fabulous adjunct to Halloween costume</li>
            <li> Great addition to my witches costume</li>
            <li> I love them. It&#x27;s impossible to do anything with them on, but they look cool and I use them for photoshoots all the time.  They&#x27;re also a little big which is weird because I have fat fingers</li>
            <li> they look very nice, fit comfortably and shipped on time. i was able to use them on my Halloween outfit and even after for some fun dress up with my niece and nephew!</li>
            <li> purrfect for wife she loved them going to save for hawloween next year she was so suprised when she opened them</li>
            <li> Nice but they had weird finger sizes that couldn&#x27;t fit the hand good ship time though it was awesome but needs improve me</li>
            <li> I love these, they are different sizes to best fit your fingers, keep in mind that they are factory made so they won&#x27;t fit evey figure as you&#x27;d like them too, or you might have one or two a little lose or tight.  Other than that, they are amayzing and awesome. LOVE  IT!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these as part of a dragon costume. They were much more substantial than I was expecting and looked great!</li>
            <li> These false nails are cool.  I think my hands are average size, and these fit all my fingers decently.  I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d fit someone with large hands.  They are well made and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome costume addition, but beware, they will scare small children, and they are somewhat sharp, so don&#x27;t go trying to grab anyone without being careful.</li>
            <li> Fun product and wonderful experience. I will definitely buy from this company again. Item arrived exactly as described and was separately packaged. I ordered them as accessories for a costume my daughter was constructing for a convention. She was very pleased with the quality and appearance of the items.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE AWESOME.  The gems have held up- they fit on my fingers... you can be a demon or a raven or a skyrim creature or whatever you want.  these rings are too cool.  I lost half of them in my car so I am making them into single claw necklaces.  SCHMEXY.</li>
            <li> Love them. Took a little rearranging but finally found the right size for each finger. A little snug for my small fingers but not too uncomfortable.  Shipping took a bit but it was within the estimated delivery date. Love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that if you have wider set finger tips these may not be for you....</li>
            <li> I got 10 pieces in 3 different sizes that fit just perfectly. Right color. Fast delivery. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a smooth as the pic made it look but fits and are very pretty</li>
            <li> A little big for fingers but when wearing them over long gloves they stay on very well.&lt;br /&gt;They came in a timely manner, in good packaging and all the pieces were there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are wonderful claws for cosplay, they do NOT look cheesy. I used them to cosplay Catwoman, and I received many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this seller to everyone!</li>
            <li> The perfect claws  I just can&#x27;t stop wearing them..I am very very happy they came in the mail last Friday and while I was walking back from the mail box people were wondering why I was so happy. So I quickly ran inside and opened up the package and took many pictures of them before I put them on. After putting them on I had an itch..MEEEEEEEEEEOOOOWWWWW PUURRRRRFECT for that small job then I went outside and showed everyone I knew. Now everyone want&#x27;s me to scratch their back and all of my friends want a pair so I told them where to get them now all of my friends and me are going to be running around soon acting like Werecat&#x27;s. The claws are not sharp and they are very well made I will be having a lot of fun with them and I will buy another set of them.</li>
            <li> They are cool looking, but because they are not adjustable, they are almost useless.  They fall off constantly.  I tried using them for a play and they ended up flying into the audience.  I wish they would make the rings adjustable as that would solve the problem!</li>
            <li> Pros vs Cons:  Pros: 1. Really adorable and great concept. 2. Great for cosplay/dressing up. Especially as Catwoman. 3. Just as the picture displays.  Cons: 1. IF you have tiny fingers like I do, these are not for you. Only about 3 of the rings fit my fingers and the rest do not.</li>
            <li> THESE CAME AS PICTURED AND BEFORE THE TIME THAT WAS STATED. GET A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS WITH THEM, IN FACT I&#x27;M THE ONLY ONE WITH THESE FINGER BLINGS...THANK YOU</li>
            <li> a little loose on my fingers but still pretty cool looking</li>
            <li> Ive got small hands so these fit perfect. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the set with different sizes to someone with thick hands. But they have the option for all larges too. Sturdy and well assembled. Reliable.</li>
            <li> Very nice, fit perfectly and are very durable.</li>
            <li> Really nice! Fit almost all my fingers (except the ring finger that was too big). Only thing i would let down on is that some f the diamonds were glued wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used them for halloween and won a 50$ american express card during halloween!</li>
            <li> Purchased for a dragon costume. Wonderful decision! Cheap, as expected, and fit me! Love them.</li>
            <li> CRAZZZZZZY KOOL ...LOOOOVEIT !!!</li>
            <li> They look nifty and are pretty solidly constructed for how cheap they are. However they are not adjustable and are clearly made with small feminine fingers in mind. If your fingers run on the larger side most of these flat out will not fit. The ones that do look nice, but in my case it&#x27;s not even enough to make up one complete hand.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL! I am very much into the goth/BDSM lifestyle and these are great for any occasion/costume. Looks even better in person and arrived SUPER quick! About two days later ! Awesome product at an awesome price. &amp;#60;3  Wicked Cool!</li>
            <li> Like others said, they were cheap and too small to fit my fingers.  Not pointy; will not scratch.</li>
            <li> not disappointed with the rings just the size is made for say small fingers the only way I can use these is either cut the ring and open up to my size or buy some other rings that are my size and apply the nails to the secondary rings. Otherwise they are pretty cool I bought them for a costume based on Ravenna from Snow White and the Huntsman, instead I am the Raven King,  GypsyJames</li>
            <li> I have petite hands. There are some talons where i can slide up to the mid section of my finger, and others where they barely fit at the tip of the finger. But these are excellent quality. Made of metal. I feel i can do some real damage with them...if they were sharp enough. The jewels look like they were handmade. Glued on pretty tight. Personally, i dont care about the jewels much; if one breaks off, i wouldnt care. I could actually carry these with me and use them as a weapon for protection. Thats how strong and secure they feel.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fingers (my wedding ring is a size 3.5), and these fit perfectly on me.  If you have larger fingers, these may not fit well and the rings are not adjustable.  Overall, good quality and will be a good addition to my witch costume for Halloween.  But I don&#x27;t see wearing them for too long at the Halloween party since it&#x27;s very difficult to grip anything (like a cup!) because the nails curve down.  But they&#x27;ll be good for initial costume showcasing and pictures.  :)</li>
            <li> Great Product. Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife.  She had a vampire costume and, for that, these were perfect.</li>
            <li> only two didnt fit-one on each hand. besides that, it was awesome! this is not for small hands! its for normal to semi-large hands. they dont chip or make your fingers green.</li>
            <li> I needed some claws to go with my cat costume that I&#x27;ll be wearing for Halloween. In the past, I had cheap plastic claws that would pop off if you touched anything. I usually ended up not wearing them at all, except for maybe when someone took a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw these and purchased them without reading the description (not plastic!). They look and feel intense! I tried them on, but I haven&#x27;t worn them while trying to go about my day. I expect them to stay firmly attached. I also expect to receive a lot of comments on them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s beautiful but they send only 8 fingers ........</li>
            <li> Some of the black stones in it had come off when I opened it. I had to glue them back. Very tedious. They came in individual baggies too which was cool because I didn&#x27;t lose the stones when i opened the package. The rings are too big for my fingers. Thumbs fit fine though but even the pinkie ones are too big. *apparently has small fingers*</li>
            <li> I bought these and figured they would look awful since the price was so agreeable, but I was very surprised! I have very small fingers, so some of the rings were a little big. I just bought some spacers and they fit perfectly. Very happy!</li>
            <li> The hopping wasn&#x27;t too bad. The product itself was OK (I guess) I felt it looked different and some of them didnt fit my fingers. Wasn&#x27;t really for me</li>
            <li> This item was exactly as described and exactly what I expected. The item showed up at least 10 days sooner than expected. Getting ready to order another set.</li>
            <li> they was the wrong color actually some were black and some were pewter and some of them dont fit well</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re awesome but I received all thumb size and one pinkie size.</li>
            <li> i love them, but i had to cut them because the nails were to big after that they are great and now can fit any one.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend bought these for her catwoman costume. a bit big on her fingers, but fit fine when she wore them on top of her gloves. Looks awesome!</li>
            <li> These arrived super quick and in great shape. They fit nice, sometimes just gotta play with the middle ones a bit cuz theyre kinda loose on me but i have very very thin fingers.</li>
            <li> The claws are a little small, for a child they are fine or a teen.... but how could you go wrong you get a set, not just 5 fingers but all ten, so there ya have it, it looks cool and will be used.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fat fingers and these fit great..look really cool, just don&#x27;t bother trying to pick anything up or do anything with them on lol</li>
            <li> Great for any event and the claws are sexy</li>
            <li> They were small they hurt my pinkie and thumb,and the ring finger was a bit big.</li>
            <li> they look FAAAAAAAB but no very comfortable</li>
            <li> painful to use.  don&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> I adore these claws! I&#x27;m using these for my next cosplay and I can&#x27;t wait to use these in the next convention. The claws are a little on the bigger size but that is just because my fingers are on the smaller side.</li>
            <li> Small sizes, the thumbs are too tight, ( I have thin womens hands so this was a big surprise) otherwise great quality, heavy metal and feel substantial. great price for this item.</li>
            <li> I bought these to go with my catwoman costume. I have thin fingers and they fit well (my ring finger is about 4 to give you some perspective as to how thin my fingers are).</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good condition, and earlier than estimated.  This was a gift.  It fits for small hands.</li>
            <li> These look so deadly, but are easy to put on and take off. I especially like that the pinkie and thumb are different sizes from the others.</li>
            <li> This is awesome I love them it gives a style</li>
            <li> Love  these. They are for any costume be catwoman or whatever. Really happy I order these. A must have item</li>
            <li> The nail claws were awesome a real quality product I was expecting some cheap plastic but they were actually metal very nice</li>
            <li> This item is BEAUTIFUL! I ordered a set for each hand. I can&#x27;t wait to wear them out! I now have to get them in gold!</li>
            <li> Fingers all fit some are too big but I have tiny hands but that&#x27;s ok I just wanted to look kinda creepy so I really like them</li>
            <li> At first we were shorted 5 claws, but once we got ahold of the shop they were quick to help and send our missing ones. They are absolutely wonderful and fit my fingers really well. :) Thanks so much for the items, and for the great customer service!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase.  They arrived just in time for Halloween and they were amazing. Great quality and price.  I was fine with the size but these are pretty narrow and snug. Some may have a problem with the fit so take this into consideration when making your purchase.</li>
            <li> I love these, super creepy.. but in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the fit was a bit smaller for i have smaller&lt;br /&gt;fingers. Still love them through!!</li>
            <li> Claws are nice and durable. Unfortunately I recieved one of them the wrong size so I&#x27;m missing one from the pack. Bummer</li>
            <li> prettier than the pic. comfortable. good quality. fast shipment</li>
            <li> Two of the ten &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; are a tight fit but nonetheless, it was delivered way ahead of schedule and all in one piece (or ten in this case).</li>
            <li> The finishing touch to my Catwoman costume.  Everyone loved the claw rings.  I have skinny fingers, though, so I had to push the rings far back on my knuckles so I wouldn&#x27;t lose them.  They were sturdy and seemed well-made.</li>
            <li> Liked them I would&#x27;ve loved em if they were size adjustable but it wasn&#x27;t described that way so its ok... they got here on time :-)</li>
            <li> Awesome! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous nail. They are covered in tiny black beads. A perfect fit.Love them.</li>
            <li> They are just ok. Be aware that they are made for tiny fingers and the molding flash/general fit and finish is really poor. Required quite a bit of clean up to be workable. Look ok from a distance, but up close, bleah.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for a great price. Some were too big for my fingers, but that&#x27;s understandable with standardized sizing for the three medium size rings.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I&#x27;m doing a Blind Mag cosplay. These are the closest I could find to the original claws in the movie. They fit perfect (mind you I have small fingers) and their not sharp, which goes along with Otakon&#x27;s weapon policies. They were delivered a day early which was great! Since I&#x27;m on a time crunch for putting together everything. All in all a great product, and they are worth 5 stars!</li>
            <li> These claws came in and I really like them. They are unique and I love wearing them! They came on time, fit my fingers, and are just really pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Great buy for the unique individual who wants something new for their wardrobe.</li>
            <li> they are a little small for my fingers but i can make them work i do love them though i was very excited opening the package</li>
            <li> Just want everyone to you needa purchase these because they are amazing. I just love the quality and they are a show stopper. I am truly very happy in this evistment.such beautiful nails.</li>
