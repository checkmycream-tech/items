            <li>The steam pressure is good.</li>
            <li>I was initially very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Very glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Invest in something of MUCH better quality and safety for SURE!!</li>
            <li>I love this steamer!</li>
            <li>This steamer works great and is easy to carry.</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose; steamer button opens your pores and lets out warm steam.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and I have used it once looks nice.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this steamer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than I hoped...</li>
            <li>I know I will buy more when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took me and my gf awhile to choose a mini steamer and we&#x27;re glad we bought this.</li>
            <li>I love the arm extension piece, its functionality separates this steamer from others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I think there are better steamers out there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it :)</li>
            <li>It is mostly plastic</li>
            <li>Just to make sure I knew how this steamer looked in size</li>
            <li>a dud i pulled it up (as I do most things) on youtube</li>
            <li>This steamer gives good consistent steam even 3 years of use.</li>
            <li>Great Steam, Fast, and light weight.</li>
            <li>And since the steamer worked perfectly before this, I just won&#x27;t use aromatherapy and I&#x27;ll be back in business asap and enjoying the use of a light, easy to use steamer that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It warms quickly, looks pretty and is a great value for the cost.</li>
            <li>My face looks much better and easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Steamer works fine, I wish the arm was a bit longer, easy to travel with</li>
            <li>She has used it three times so far and is super happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my product overall.</li>
            <li>Would have done this originally had i known</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this steamer at this price.</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to use and is powerful.</li>
            <li>Just a question, how do you clean the arm?</li>
            <li>, ozone function to purify water, starts to steam w/in about 3-5 mins after powering up and filled w/ water, steam output was just right for me and not overdone.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The unit heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>here is my experience: The machine does produce steams, but it also spits out the very hot water to your face.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s good enough to get me steamed up in the comfort of my own home before doing my facial regiment.  </li>
            <li>The steamer stopped working after 3 months after being rarely used.</li>
            <li>Just like w/ a coffeemaker a test run is suggested to allow the appliance to clear itself of any reminants and make sure its functioning well.</li>
            <li>:Very easy to assemble/disassemble, auto shut off when water level gets low</li>
            <li>Travels extremely well and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>, how quickly it arrived after I ordered it, and how very well I was taken care of.  </li>
            <li>Good little steamer for at-home facials.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the fact that I can add essential oils.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying my mini facial steamer.  </li>
            <li>I love my facial steamer.  </li>
            <li>Overall, love the steamer and will be using weekly.</li>
            <li>The regular option steam is not as strong but still does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my new steamer and plan to use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li>Hope I can get my refund to my credit card real soon.</li>
            <li>Although the instructions are a tad bootleg lol...</li>
            <li>so doesn&#x27;t take up too much space</li>
            <li>and i was so ready to use the steamer i didnt do the test cycle</li>
            <li>I have used the unit several times and am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>Its simple to use, clean and pack away.</li>
            <li>It works so well, that I put away my large standup professional steamer.</li>
            <li>But THankfully, as soon as I contacted the seller at Silver Fox, he immediately offered to send a new head a no charge.</li>
            <li>It almost seems like the company refferbished it and sent it out to a new customer.</li>
            <li>Needed a quick facial rejuvenation but ran into scheduling conflicts after calling several different spas...eventually said to myself instead of me spending thousands of $$ on spa packages and temporary facial rejuvenation/relief at the spa thought why not do it myself and so far I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>Return it right the way and purchased a professional facial steamer today.  </li>
            <li>This product beats many other portable facial steamers</li>
            <li>it offers OZONE (kills bacteria)</li>
            <li>so it may not hold up well if subjected to professional wear and tear.  </li>
            <li>: I suggest you do a test cycle and allow the steamer to go through 1-2 cycles on its own once prior to use...for me it was late</li>
            <li>The only draw back is that after the first time auto shut of steamer, you will have to wait for like 15-20 min before u can start it again.</li>
            <li>It took several months but when the manufacturer would not honor their warrenty, this seller sent me a new arm.</li>
            <li>I had it for less than 2 months and the plastic arm had already cracked in 2 places and it drips and spits out boiling hot water.</li>
            <li>I used Young Living Essential oils in the opening that says &amp;#34;add essential oils here&amp;#34; and this ruined the steamer head.</li>
            <li>I surely don&#x27;t recommend this product (not sure about similar products of other brands).</li>
            <li>Also, after reading all the reviews please please please if you have Normal skin only use the steamer for 3-10 minutes, Combonation Skin 5-8 minutes, Dry skin 3-5 minutes max, and oily skin 8-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was concerned about a small thing with the facial steamer when I first received it and was very pleasantly surprised when I received a call from the company, and within a day the situaiton was taken care of beyond my expectaitons.  </li>
            <li>I have become used to experiencing bad or no customer service these days, that when I receive such good care, it has to be noted.  </li>

            <li> I have become used to experiencing bad or no customer service these days, that when I receive such good care, it has to be noted.  </li>
            <li> The water being spitted out was very hot and can get somebody seriously burned.</li>
            <li> But it consistently spits out the dangerous hot water to my face as long as it starts to produce steam.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, especially since it happened right after I was able to return it.</li>
            <li> Having read other reviews, I have been extra careful with the extension tubes although they do not seem too fragile to me - so no problems there.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about purchasing this product because other reviews said it would spit hot water, but I&#x27;ve used the steamer multiple times and have not experienced any spitting what so ever.</li>
            <li> I like my little mini facial steamer.  </li>
            <li> I think that the company including Amazon should be careful of selling this product.</li>
            <li> I felt like the a dangerous hot water bomb hanging above my head.</li>
            <li> Oh and don&#x27;t even unscrew this bowl, leave it screwed on and dump excess water out the extension spout by turning it upside down.</li>
            <li> I mark it down slightly because the plastic bowl cracked around the rim when i was screwing it in</li>
            <li> The steam is not very strong.</li>
            <li> Also the Ozone steam has an odd smell when it&#x27;s on but</li>
            <li> It is going to be a big issue if somebody get seriously injuried on her FACE.     </li>
            <li> Less things to carry around</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this steamer is complete JUNK!</li>
            <li> I wish this product was a little cheaper considering you can tell it&#x27;s made in another country and not in North America (1 star deducted).</li>
            <li> It makes a very dangerous sound while the water spitting out.</li>
            <li> It is a totally waste.</li>
            <li> and there was this applicance smell that eventually went away (got ignored) after a few mins.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember Lots of Steam is not good for Dry Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The manual was a little confusing.</li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> VERY DANGEROUS, TOTAL JUNK!</li>
            <li> The only annoying part is that sometimes it \\&quot;spits\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using steam beyond 10 minutes can make your issues worse.</li>
            <li> I waited for like 30mins, water never boiled, think there has broken parts.  </li>
            <li> It disintegrated and cracked the plastic and a weird chemical smell</li>
            <li> After that the steamer stopped heating the water and is useless.</li>
            <li> I have a bad experience with this product...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I am quite happy with this product. It serves its purpose; steamer button opens your pores and lets out warm steam. Ozone button lets out thicker white steam. The only annoying part is that sometimes it \\&quot;spits\\&quot; out a bit of liquid which scared me in the beginning but I got used to it by now. My face looks much better and easier to clean. I would say go for it. My skin looks a lot younger and fresher.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this steamer. It works so well, that I put away my large standup professional steamer. Plus I love the fact that I can add essential oils. It is extremely easy to use and is powerful. Travels extremely well and very easy to clean. I was concerned about purchasing this product because other reviews said it would spit hot water, but I&#x27;ve used the steamer multiple times and have not experienced any spitting what so ever.</li>
            <li> I was initially very pleased with the product.  I used distilled water every time and after four uses I noticed the head started to split.  I can not locate the manufacuter of this product even though it has a one year warranty.  It took several months but when the manufacturer would not honor their warrenty, this seller sent me a new arm.</li>
            <li> This is very good handy product for bi weekly steaming. I have been using it for 2 years now and no complaints. I use once in a month.  The only draw back is that after the first time auto shut of steamer, you will have to wait for like 15-20 min before u can start it again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this steamer is complete JUNK! I had it for less than 2 months and the plastic arm had already cracked in 2 places and it drips and spits out boiling hot water. VERY DANGEROUS, TOTAL JUNK! Invest in something of MUCH better quality and safety for SURE!!</li>
            <li> ***12/29/2011 UPDATE*** It&#x27;s better than I hoped...Great Steam, Fast, and light weight. I know I will buy more when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a licensed Esthetician I need a mobile steamer and hopefully it lives up to the reviews I will keep you informed. For now let&#x27;s start with 5 starts and we will back to review once received. Also, after reading all the reviews please please please if you have Normal skin only use the steamer for 3-10 minutes, Combonation Skin 5-8 minutes, Dry skin 3-5 minutes max, and oily skin 8-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember Lots of Steam is not good for Dry Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using steam beyond 10 minutes can make your issues worse. Also if your steamer spits water your either NOT using distilled water, your turning on the Ozone too soon (wait the 5 recommended minutes) or it needs cleaning with vinegar and water solution.</li>
            <li> I love this steamer! I&#x27;m an Esthetician and work out of a couple of different facial rooms. This steamer works great and is easy to carry.</li>
            <li> The steamer stopped working after 3 months after being rarely used. I am very disappointed, especially since it happened right after I was able to return it.</li>
            <li> I ordered for a portable mini facial stteamer. It arrived on time and I have used it once looks nice.</li>
            <li> I have a bad experience with this product...after six months stop working and I didn&#x27;t use too often</li>
            <li> Good little steamer for at-home facials. I&#x27;m happy with my product overall. Tip &#x3D; watch the Youtube video from Massage Tools to see how it works. Note the steam level she&#x27;s showing in the video is with the Ozone option turned on. The regular option steam is not as strong but still does the job. I wish this product was a little cheaper considering you can tell it&#x27;s made in another country and not in North America (1 star deducted). Also the Ozone steam has an odd smell when it&#x27;s on but no biggy. I&#x27;m happy with my new steamer and plan to use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Having read other reviews, I have been extra careful with the extension tubes although they do not seem too fragile to me - so no problems there.  The unit heats quickly.  I have not used the Aromatherapy feature yet.  I have used the unit several times and am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Looks like USPS delivers over a decade. We couldn&#x27;t get this item. Do not buy if USPS is the carrier</li>
            <li> Try it once I opened the box, the water never boiled!  I waited for like 30mins, water never boiled, think there has broken parts.  Return it right the way and purchased a professional facial steamer today.  Hope I can get my refund to my credit card real soon.</li>
            <li> It took me and my gf awhile to choose a mini steamer and we&#x27;re glad we bought this. She has used it three times so far and is super happy with the results. Just a question, how do you clean the arm? The manual was a little confusing. Do you soak the arm with vinegar? Is there another way?</li>
            <li> Steamer works fine, I wish the arm was a bit longer, easy to travel with</li>
            <li> I use this for out-call facial business. I love the arm extension piece, its functionality separates this steamer from others I have tried. The steam pressure is good. Its simple to use, clean and pack away. One word of caution...I used Young Living Essential oils in the opening that says &amp;#34;add essential oils here&amp;#34; and this ruined the steamer head. It disintegrated and cracked the plastic and a weird chemical smell began to come out w the steam. But THankfully, as soon as I contacted the seller at Silver Fox, he immediately offered to send a new head a no charge. And since the steamer worked perfectly before this, I just won&#x27;t use aromatherapy and I&#x27;ll be back in business asap and enjoying the use of a light, easy to use steamer that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I purchased this steamer a month ago and used for about 5 times now (only about 3 minutes every time). here is my experience: The machine does produce steams, but it also spits out the very hot water to your face. I have never used any greasy stuff in the water, neither did I add water outside the limit mark.  I used only purified water. But it consistently spits out the dangerous hot water to my face as long as it starts to produce steam. It makes a very dangerous sound while the water spitting out. I felt like the a dangerous hot water bomb hanging above my head. The water being spitted out was very hot and can get somebody seriously burned. I surely don&#x27;t recommend this product (not sure about similar products of other brands). It is a totally waste. I think that the company including Amazon should be careful of selling this product. It is going to be a big issue if somebody get seriously injuried on her FACE.     [[ASIN:B0011UEP7C Portable Mini Facial Steamer with Ozone]]</li>
            <li> The steam is not very strong. I think there are better steamers out there but this is for the budget challenged individuals.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping. Although the instructions are a tad bootleg lol... This product beats many other portable facial steamers b/c it offers OZONE (kills bacteria) which is a MUST for a steamer.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service!  I was concerned about a small thing with the facial steamer when I first received it and was very pleasantly surprised when I received a call from the company, and within a day the situaiton was taken care of beyond my expectaitons.  I have become used to experiencing bad or no customer service these days, that when I receive such good care, it has to be noted.  As for the steamer...fabulous!  I am very happy with the product, how quickly it arrived after I ordered it, and how very well I was taken care of.  I will buy from this company again!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this portable mini facial steamer, I was carrying around the bigger one for my mobile spa services. Very glad I bought this. Less things to carry around</li>
            <li> Stay away from this product! I used it once and it has stopped working.  It almost seems like the company refferbished it and sent it out to a new customer. It&#x27;s horrible!!</li>
            <li> I like my little mini facial steamer.  It is small so doesn&#x27;t take up too much space &amp; it&#x27;s good enough to get me steamed up in the comfort of my own home before doing my facial regiment.  I&#x27;d recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying my mini facial steamer.  I&#x27;ve told all my friends about this product!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for home use.  It is mostly plastic so it may not hold up well if subjected to professional wear and tear.  I use it in my &#x27;basement spa&#x27; where I do facials for family and friends.  It warms quickly, looks pretty and is a great value for the cost.</li>
            <li> I love my facial steamer.  Try to use it every day.</li>
            <li> I use this when i shave with a safety razor and brush. My skin quality has improved a ton as a result. This steamer gives good consistent steam even 3 years of use. I mark it down slightly because the plastic bowl cracked around the rim when i was screwing it in and i had to superglue it back together. Still works, would again. Oh and don&#x27;t even unscrew this bowl, leave it screwed on and dump excess water out the extension spout by turning it upside down. Would have done this originally had i known</li>
            <li> Needed a quick facial rejuvenation but ran into scheduling conflicts after calling several different spas...eventually said to myself instead of me spending thousands of $$ on spa packages and temporary facial rejuvenation/relief at the spa thought why not do it myself and so far I&#x27;m satisfied w/ my choice. My take on Port Mini Facial Steamer ordered from Silver Fox:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:Very easy to assemble/disassemble, auto shut off when water level gets low, ozone function to purify water, starts to steam w/in about 3-5 mins after powering up and filled w/ water, steam output was just right for me and not overdone.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I suggest you do a test cycle and allow the steamer to go through 1-2 cycles on its own once prior to use...for me it was late and i was so ready to use the steamer i didnt do the test cycle and there was this applicance smell that eventually went away (got ignored) after a few mins. Just like w/ a coffeemaker a test run is suggested to allow the appliance to clear itself of any reminants and make sure its functioning well. Just to make sure I knew how this steamer looked in size so I wouldnt get stuck w/ a dud i pulled it up (as I do most things) on youtube [...] not sure if its the exact same one but similar. Overall, love the steamer and will be using weekly.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this steamer at this price. As the saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34; literally used it once the day it arrived. After that the steamer stopped heating the water and is useless. Now I can&#x27;t return it either.</li>
            <li> Wonderful; just like my esteticians.</li>
