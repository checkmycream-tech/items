            <li>I love this product and would reccommend it to everyone!</li>

            <li>I had nice soft,fine hair.</li>

            <li>This is by far the best hair product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>My hair has very fine strands</li>
            <li>It prevents irritation and leaves my legs very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Your hair will feel really nice and smooth if you leave it on for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>it didnt feel better until after i used conditioner.</li>
            <li>its the only product i use and im very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I even posted on their site and they told me to use more of the product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way Wen makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>IDID EXPECT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE GREAT PRESS THIS PRODUCT RECEIVES.  </li>
            <li>I DID RETURN THIS PRODUCT - GLAD</li>
            <li>And I absolutely love the smell and cooling effect of the conditioner when I leave it on.</li>
            <li>I think the Lavender is intended more for my hair type (wavy)</li>
            <li>and I love the smell</li>
            <li>I have searched for products for many many years that will allow me to wash and go without putting a ton of products in my hair.</li>
            <li>I pile it all on top of my head and put a shower cap over it 6)</li>
            <li>So many pros to just the 1 con...</li>
            <li>I always end up putting more than I need.  </li>
            <li>But any more consecutive day use leaves hair greasy, even with aggresive rinsing, my hair was greasy at the roots.</li>
            <li>My wife has used the product before and has been pleased with the results, so with this order, just replenished her supply.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My friends all comment on how healthy my hair always is.  </li>
            <li>She raves about it and has been using it for almost a year and her hair is better and better.</li>
            <li>cause you never know unless you do :)</li>
            <li>My hair will remain soft, clean, manageable, and best of all no FRIZZ!</li>
            <li>Love this product..and the shipping is fantastic..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to make sure the product is evenly distributed.  </li>
            <li>It works EXACTLY as promised (huge surpise to me!!)</li>
            <li>I also scrub my scalp with my fingernails to make sure it gets clean.  </li>
            <li>Although I love the smell of the Sweet Almond Mint, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a \\&quot;one size fits</li>
            <li>The most important thing to do is rinse, rinse, rinse it all out until your hair is squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine to medium</li>
            <li>I have been using the WEN Cleansing Conditioner for over a year on my fine color treated hair</li>
            <li>However, it makes your hair super greasy real quick.</li>
            <li>The Sweet Almond Mint is for normal hair and should work for most people.e research before you purchase one to make sure it with work with your hair type!  </li>
            <li>I have to say it has made a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>As always, Wenn products are fabulous.</li>
            <li>I am able to wash, leave some in, use gel and my hair is pretty manageable throughout the day.</li>
            <li>If you want a clean scalp and don&#x27;t want dandruff, I don&#x27;t recommend Wen.</li>
            <li>It does take some getting used to ( believing you can get your hair and scalp clean without \\&quot;suds&#x27;)</li>
            <li>My hair does seem much more healthy, soft and moisturized after using WEN.  </li>
            <li>Wen cleansing conditioner is far better than any shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>if you have curly hair do yourself a favor and give this a try, it wasn&#x27;t that great for the first like 3 months, but now i can say its the only thing i use for my hair</li>
            <li>I like WEN sweet almond mint</li>
            <li>I purchased the sweet almont mint cleansing cream about a month ago.</li>
            <li>It is full, bouncy &amp; shiny and my hairdresser couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in just 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I might look into the Sally knock-off that others are talking about on here, and see if that works better - a much friendlier price.</li>
            <li>Its a fantastic product and definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Since I use WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, my hair is not frizzy anymore.</li>
            <li>WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16oz and 6oz Travel Size]]</li>
            <li>B0006Q0H5G WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16oz]]</li>
            <li>I like the sweet almond mint.  </li>
            <li>My hair started drying out and getting frizzy at the ends again, so I started using the sweet almond mint again.  </li>
            <li>The Sweet Almond Mint is for normal hair and should work for most people.</li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t even begin to clean your scalp.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because my best friend has it and her hair is unbelievable!!</li>
            <li>Because of it&#x27;s great length, my hair would become tangled in a few hours and by the end of the day it could take me up to five minutes to comb.</li>
            <li>My hair also used to be very damaged and now I feel a huge difference in it&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>I wash everyday and my hair always looks great.  </li>
            <li>I definitly do not think it is worth the money</li>
            <li>Also the minty fresh fragrance, makes me feel so refreshed.....</li>
            <li>First of all, I was sent a peach scent instead of the sweet almond mint I ordered.</li>
            <li>The other reviews stating that this is a good product must get compensation for doing so.  </li>
            <li>I am going to order the Almond product today, and am very hopeful it will reduce the natural frizzy texture of my very fine, but</li>
            <li>It has body for the first time.  </li>
            <li>My hair does have a lot more volume and overall looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the different Wen types, but I love this one the most.</li>
            <li>I received this exact cleansing conditioner by itself in the mail over a week ago</li>
            <li>so you have to test it our first.  </li>
            <li>So, this is my first time</li>
            <li>It was heathy, until at 19 i decided to get my first relaxer.</li>
            <li>but it is a bit higher than I&#x27;d like to pay for something that I have to replace every month.</li>
            <li>My hair feels MUCH more clean after using WEN than it did with other shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li>, it smells good and it turned my dry hair into soft hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but gave it a 4 STAR only because I wish it was designed not to have to use so much for one shampooing...</li>
            <li>is that, like many other people who have reviewed this product, I find that for good reason, it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li>I usually pay a premium for good hair products, so I&#x27;m no stranger to paying for quality</li>
            <li>And, it behaves a little bit better than it used to!  </li>
            <li>I now only use it once a week as a conditioning treatment and I like it just fine that way.</li>
            <li>After using it for 2 weeks - as directed - my hair became very greasy around my roots.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product but that will never be the case.  </li>
            <li>and I sweat 2 times a day which really dries out my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets really frizzy in the heat &amp; humidity and the wen styling cream works wonders.  </li>
            <li>this whole week i&#x27;v put NOTHING else into my hair.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that it looks much longer than before I used this product.</li>
            <li>no matter how much conditioner I use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used it for 8 straight days now.....</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance of the Wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Because my mom didn&#x27;t believe in relaxing her girls hair, my hair had to be pressed out if i wanted it straight.</li>
            <li>It still flips out where it wants to when I&#x27;m trying to straighten it</li>
            <li>EXACTLY as they read on the bottle: I personally...1) Run water completely thru hair first 2)</li>
            <li>I was also worried that it wouldn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as traditional shampoo.  </li>
            <li>absolutely and highly recommend WEN Hair Care products to anyone who is not bald and cares to look</li>
            <li>I have to point out though that this combo offer of one 16 oz full size and one 6 oz \\&quot;travel\\&quot; size is only a travel deal if you are traveling by car, train or cruise ship, because the travel size is 6 ounces.     </li>
            <li>I have only used the sweet almond mint and fig</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need half an hour in the bathroom, because my hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li>Was skeptical, but have to admit that I really think this works great.  </li>
            <li>But once at a while I still use it, I think it would be better that I did not use the same brand or same ingredient all the time.</li>
            <li>I think the price is way too high for what you get.  </li>
            <li>Wen is, by far, the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever found for my thin, mediterranean curly hair which tends toward dry and wispy unless I use Wen.</li>
            <li>The different scents that are available are actually formulated for different types of hair (dry, oily, normal, etc...), so do some research before you purchase one to make sure it with work with your hair type!  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how gross I feel right now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white and have very straight hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very soft and silky, like when I was a kid.   </li>
            <li>FINALLY, my hair looks heathy again, i actally see that baby texture after the first wash.</li>
            <li>I used the product the first night I got it, following the directions to the tee.  </li>
            <li>Once all the product is rinsed out, add a tiny amount to the very ends of your hair and rinse it out like you would a normal conditioner (a really tiny amount to the very tips of your hair).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually growing new hair!!</li>
            <li>When my hair was completely air-dried, it looked frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Leave it on for 20 minutes then wash it off completely.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky, soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li>When I use one of my \\&quot;other\\&quot; shampoos I notice that my hair is not as soft or manageable.  </li>
            <li>I can leave my hair in it&#x27;s natural curly state or straighten it.</li>
            <li>and it feels soft</li>
            <li>that 4th day to color, my scalp is never dried out after and my hair feels like silk when I am done.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly comb thru my hair so the Wen is completely distributed 5)</li>
            <li>I may be 63, but I&#x27;m blessed with natural oils in my hair.</li>
            <li>I first read over the directions on how to use WEN, I thought it would take a long time.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough that if your hair is greasy when you use this, then you need to make sureyou are getting it on your scalp and that you are rinsing it very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I can not go without washing my hair the next day because it doesn&#x27;t smell fresh enough and because it feels waxy.  </li>
            <li>Normally I shampoo every other day, but using Wen, it feels weighted the first day.   </li>
            <li>The price is a little high - but the product is worth it...</li>
            <li>I could never use up all the product they want to sell you in the infomercial for $29/month; it seems to last me much longer than they expect, but I have short hair.</li>
            <li>I have VERY rarely used conditioners because they have left my hair feeling a bit heavy.</li>
            <li>I was constantly fighting my hair when it seems to constantly do the exact opposite of what I want it to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have wavy, fine (but thick) hair which I blow dry straight</li>
            <li>WEN is very simple to use and really doesn&#x27;t take long.  </li>
            <li>Using Wen Almond cleansing conditioner makes my hair perfectly soft and hydrated thruout the entire day (like it was when I was 22!)</li>
            <li>After using the \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot;, my hair felt very greasy and heavy, so much so that I had to wash it again with a regular shampoo from Wal Mart.  </li>
            <li>but if you wet your hair very well before you apply it, then plenty gets to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Just order the full size &amp; put some in a small container for your flights.</li>
            <li>However, when I DID wash it every morning with normal shampoo, it was dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>With relaxing,drying, and using a curling iron my poor soft and fine hair didn&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look like the WEN models, but it is much easier to manage and takes less time to do.</li>
            <li>I am 37yrs old and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single morning, by noon it is a total greaseball!</li>

            <li> I also scrub my scalp with my fingernails to make sure it gets clean.  </li>
            <li> Although I love the smell of the Sweet Almond Mint, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a \\&quot;one size fits</li>
            <li> The most important thing to do is rinse, rinse, rinse it all out until your hair is squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine to medium</li>
            <li> I have been using the WEN Cleansing Conditioner for over a year on my fine color treated hair</li>
            <li> However, it makes your hair super greasy real quick.</li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond Mint is for normal hair and should work for most people.e research before you purchase one to make sure it with work with your hair type!  </li>
            <li> I have to say it has made a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> As always, Wenn products are fabulous.</li>
            <li> I am able to wash, leave some in, use gel and my hair is pretty manageable throughout the day.</li>
            <li> If you want a clean scalp and don&#x27;t want dandruff, I don&#x27;t recommend Wen.</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to ( believing you can get your hair and scalp clean without \\&quot;suds&#x27;)</li>
            <li> My hair does seem much more healthy, soft and moisturized after using WEN.  </li>
            <li> Wen cleansing conditioner is far better than any shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li> if you have curly hair do yourself a favor and give this a try, it wasn&#x27;t that great for the first like 3 months, but now i can say its the only thing i use for my hair</li>
            <li> I like WEN sweet almond mint</li>
            <li> I purchased the sweet almont mint cleansing cream about a month ago.</li>
            <li> It is full, bouncy &amp; shiny and my hairdresser couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in just 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I might look into the Sally knock-off that others are talking about on here, and see if that works better - a much friendlier price.</li>
            <li> Its a fantastic product and definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Since I use WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, my hair is not frizzy anymore.</li>
            <li> WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16oz and 6oz Travel Size]]</li>
            <li> B0006Q0H5G WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16oz]]</li>
            <li> I like the sweet almond mint.  </li>
            <li> My hair started drying out and getting frizzy at the ends again, so I started using the sweet almond mint again.  </li>
            <li> The Sweet Almond Mint is for normal hair and should work for most people.</li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t even begin to clean your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my best friend has it and her hair is unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s great length, my hair would become tangled in a few hours and by the end of the day it could take me up to five minutes to comb.</li>
            <li> My hair also used to be very damaged and now I feel a huge difference in it&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> I wash everyday and my hair always looks great.  </li>
            <li> I definitly do not think it is worth the money</li>
            <li> Also the minty fresh fragrance, makes me feel so refreshed.....</li>
            <li> First of all, I was sent a peach scent instead of the sweet almond mint I ordered.</li>
            <li> The other reviews stating that this is a good product must get compensation for doing so.  </li>
            <li> I am going to order the Almond product today, and am very hopeful it will reduce the natural frizzy texture of my very fine, but</li>
            <li> It has body for the first time.  </li>
            <li> My hair does have a lot more volume and overall looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the different Wen types, but I love this one the most.</li>
            <li> I received this exact cleansing conditioner by itself in the mail over a week ago</li>
            <li> so you have to test it our first.  </li>
            <li> So, this is my first time</li>
            <li> It was heathy, until at 19 i decided to get my first relaxer.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit higher than I&#x27;d like to pay for something that I have to replace every month.</li>
            <li> My hair feels MUCH more clean after using WEN than it did with other shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> , it smells good and it turned my dry hair into soft hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but gave it a 4 STAR only because I wish it was designed not to have to use so much for one shampooing...</li>
            <li> is that, like many other people who have reviewed this product, I find that for good reason, it weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> I usually pay a premium for good hair products, so I&#x27;m no stranger to paying for quality</li>
            <li> And, it behaves a little bit better than it used to!  </li>
            <li> I now only use it once a week as a conditioning treatment and I like it just fine that way.</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks - as directed - my hair became very greasy around my roots.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but that will never be the case.  </li>
            <li> and I sweat 2 times a day which really dries out my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets really frizzy in the heat &amp; humidity and the wen styling cream works wonders.  </li>
            <li> this whole week i&#x27;v put NOTHING else into my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that it looks much longer than before I used this product.</li>
            <li> no matter how much conditioner I use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it for 8 straight days now.....</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance of the Wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Because my mom didn&#x27;t believe in relaxing her girls hair, my hair had to be pressed out if i wanted it straight.</li>
            <li> It still flips out where it wants to when I&#x27;m trying to straighten it</li>
            <li> EXACTLY as they read on the bottle: I personally...1) Run water completely thru hair first 2)</li>
            <li> I was also worried that it wouldn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as traditional shampoo.  </li>
            <li> absolutely and highly recommend WEN Hair Care products to anyone who is not bald and cares to look</li>
            <li> I have to point out though that this combo offer of one 16 oz full size and one 6 oz \\&quot;travel\\&quot; size is only a travel deal if you are traveling by car, train or cruise ship, because the travel size is 6 ounces.     </li>
            <li> I have only used the sweet almond mint and fig</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need half an hour in the bathroom, because my hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical, but have to admit that I really think this works great.  </li>
            <li> But once at a while I still use it, I think it would be better that I did not use the same brand or same ingredient all the time.</li>
            <li> I think the price is way too high for what you get.  </li>
            <li> Wen is, by far, the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever found for my thin, mediterranean curly hair which tends toward dry and wispy unless I use Wen.</li>
            <li> The different scents that are available are actually formulated for different types of hair (dry, oily, normal, etc...), so do some research before you purchase one to make sure it with work with your hair type!  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how gross I feel right now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white and have very straight hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very soft and silky, like when I was a kid.   </li>
            <li> FINALLY, my hair looks heathy again, i actally see that baby texture after the first wash.</li>
            <li> I used the product the first night I got it, following the directions to the tee.  </li>
            <li> Once all the product is rinsed out, add a tiny amount to the very ends of your hair and rinse it out like you would a normal conditioner (a really tiny amount to the very tips of your hair).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually growing new hair!!</li>
            <li> When my hair was completely air-dried, it looked frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Leave it on for 20 minutes then wash it off completely.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky, soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li> When I use one of my \\&quot;other\\&quot; shampoos I notice that my hair is not as soft or manageable.  </li>
            <li> I can leave my hair in it&#x27;s natural curly state or straighten it.</li>
            <li> and it feels soft</li>
            <li> that 4th day to color, my scalp is never dried out after and my hair feels like silk when I am done.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly comb thru my hair so the Wen is completely distributed 5)</li>
            <li> I may be 63, but I&#x27;m blessed with natural oils in my hair.</li>
            <li> I first read over the directions on how to use WEN, I thought it would take a long time.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough that if your hair is greasy when you use this, then you need to make sureyou are getting it on your scalp and that you are rinsing it very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I can not go without washing my hair the next day because it doesn&#x27;t smell fresh enough and because it feels waxy.  </li>
            <li> Normally I shampoo every other day, but using Wen, it feels weighted the first day.   </li>
            <li> The price is a little high - but the product is worth it...</li>
            <li> I could never use up all the product they want to sell you in the infomercial for $29/month; it seems to last me much longer than they expect, but I have short hair.</li>
            <li> I have VERY rarely used conditioners because they have left my hair feeling a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> I was constantly fighting my hair when it seems to constantly do the exact opposite of what I want it to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have wavy, fine (but thick) hair which I blow dry straight</li>
            <li> WEN is very simple to use and really doesn&#x27;t take long.  </li>
            <li> Using Wen Almond cleansing conditioner makes my hair perfectly soft and hydrated thruout the entire day (like it was when I was 22!)</li>
            <li> After using the \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot;, my hair felt very greasy and heavy, so much so that I had to wash it again with a regular shampoo from Wal Mart.  </li>
            <li> but if you wet your hair very well before you apply it, then plenty gets to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Just order the full size &amp; put some in a small container for your flights.</li>
            <li> However, when I DID wash it every morning with normal shampoo, it was dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> With relaxing,drying, and using a curling iron my poor soft and fine hair didn&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look like the WEN models, but it is much easier to manage and takes less time to do.</li>
            <li> I am 37yrs old and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single morning, by noon it is a total greaseball!</li>
            <li> I have a color and flat hair.</li>
            <li> My hair and highlights last almost twice as long now!!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my hair would be clean enough, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t do this, you&#x27;ll have very greasy results and your hair will be dull</li>
            <li> Also, living in the hot humid weather in Florida which is not good for people who want their hair to look like a million bucks every day.</li>
            <li> My usage will be perhaps once a week, but just since I cannot cleanse my hair with it each time - sorry, as I really enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m going through the awkward growing-out stage of an inverted bob, however, so that is most of the reason for that).  </li>
            <li> so I have to go back to my regular shampoo, conditioner, and leave ins for a few days, but can go back to WEN with no problem.</li>
            <li> It is made from a long list of herbs and no additives.  </li>
            <li> and I like the sweet almond mint much better because the fig has a horrible smell (to me).  </li>
            <li> I have long wavy/curly hair that frizzes and tends to be dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Normally I wash my hair every other day but while using WEN I need to wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> I USED THE PRODUCT - X 4 - AND MY HAIR WAS AS DRY AS EVER</li>
            <li> Even after having just washed my hair and let it air dry, my hair can look oily.</li>
            <li> (this is the main complaint I see on these reviews).  </li>
            <li> My hair is course dry and extremely frizzy, and for me hair styling typically meant a minimum of five different products, starting from shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, pre heat treatment serum and blowdrying/straightening....   </li>
            <li> then I rinse completely for at least 3 minutes and towel/air dry.</li>
            <li> Since using this, my hair is baby soft and I loose hardly any hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use to wash my hair every other day to avoid dry out, but now I have to was every day</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair never changed.. it was the same as when I used the much cheaper salon bought shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but if it continues to work like this, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Wen is expensive but so worth it.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my middle back, it is somewhat thick and a little coarse from dying it about every 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I seriously cannot believe how soft my hair is.</li>
            <li> I expect the humidity there to make my frizzies even worse, so I have high hopes, Chaz.    </li>
            <li> I know longer have to use any other products to manage my hair so that is a factor in the cost.</li>
            <li> I noticed after I ordered this that there were other blends to try -</li>
            <li> I just ordered the other WEN Hair Conditioner with Lavender.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product for quite some time that didn&#x27;t have all the detergents in it that other shampoos have.  </li>
            <li> After use this one I could feel that my hair a little dry compaire to the WEN fig.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair again for up to 4 days, depending on how active I&#x27;ve been.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I was extremely skeptical about this product becuz most infomercial products are cr*p, but I was totally desperate and after researching it on QVC, Amazon, and reading numerous reviews on it, I decided to take a chance and slap down the $55.</li>
            <li> The down fall...</li>
            <li> At the end of the shower, I turn the water temp down to a luke-warm setting to rinse WEN out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Cuts down on split ends and smooths the hair.  </li>
            <li> Additionally I have also noticed that I have less hair loss.  </li>
            <li> TSA flight restrictions for air travel limit containers to 3 ounces or less.</li>
            <li> Even if I use other products to control the frizz, they will make my hair look and feel stiff and greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair was hard to control and never soft before Wen.</li>
            <li> I am very irritated that I spent almost $50 for this \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot; and unfortunately will never use it again!</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair and Wen helps keep it from being so dry and gives it body.  </li>
            <li> and then I put a little bit in my hair after towel drying</li>
            <li> I also keep adding a little water as I massage the conditioner into my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to get my hair colored every 4 weeks, due to the fading and roots.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair ended up very unhealthy and dry since I went through a phase where I was having it highlighted a lot regularly for over a year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few times since, still frizzy.  </li>
            <li> But using it as an everyday product without shampooing your hair got my hair greasy and oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Well, since using WEN now for a few weeks, I can say that I had nothing to worry about on both those items.  </li>
            <li> Since I have coarse and frizzy hair, blow drying my hair after using only this product and none of the serum makes it look dry and lifeless :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product has left my hair extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li> So I have decided to stick with the less expensive product for obvious reasons..</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t usually look frizzy,</li>
            <li> I think this product may be geered toward people who have hard to manage kinky/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Could hardly blowdry my hair.  </li>
            <li> and this product made my hair waxy, dull and lifeless.</li>
            <li> The downside for me is my hair gets tired of products after a few weeks</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone and I am appalled at the reviews I ready before I bought it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive and it makes my hair greasy compared to other shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat difficult to work with in general, so I wasn&#x27;t totally disappointed because I&#x27;ve had issues with other shampoos and conditioners not working with my hair type.  </li>
            <li> my long dry and damaged hair felt awful after i washed it.</li>
            <li> I use 12 pumps of Wen on my hair cuz my hair is very thin and just past my shoulders 3)</li>
            <li> It made it worse.  </li>
            <li> but it just kept getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but it&#x27;s better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too expensive and that 16oz bottle has lasted longer than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to get the product all the way to the scalp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive!  </li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> this stuff is very expensive but will now save me lots of money.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It feels as if my hair had a very expensive spa treatment!</li>
            <li> It made my hair greasy and worst of all, gave me dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and my hair is DISGUSTING!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I like WEN sweet almond mint, it smells good and it turned my dry hair into soft hair. I&#x27;ll order it again. The down fall... it&#x27;s expensive and it makes my hair greasy compared to other shampoos. Normally I wash my hair every other day but while using WEN I need to wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.  When my hair was completely air-dried, it looked frizzy.  My hair doesn&#x27;t usually look frizzy, just wavy.  I&#x27;ve tried it a few times since, still frizzy.  It&#x27;s expensive, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but gave it a 4 STAR only because I wish it was designed not to have to use so much for one shampooing...</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel really nice and smooth if you leave it on for 15-20 minutes. But using it as an everyday product without shampooing your hair got my hair greasy and oily by the end of the day. I kinda started breaking out on my face because of this. So i&#x27;m using it as a deep conditioner once a week. Leave it on for 20 minutes then wash it off completely.</li>
            <li> Love this product..and the shipping is fantastic..my sister in law&#x27;s birthday was on Saturday and I ordered this on Tuesday...she got it on Friday...and she loved it...</li>
            <li> i had been talking about wanting to try this product for the longest time.  my long dry and damaged hair felt awful after i washed it. it didnt feel better until after i used conditioner. then a friend gave me wen as a gift and now im hooked. its the only product i use and im very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I have ever tried.  Try it, you will be impressed at how good your hair not only feels but looks!</li>
            <li> I think this product may be geered toward people who have hard to manage kinky/curly hair.  I&#x27;m white and have very straight hair.  After using it for 2 weeks - as directed - my hair became very greasy around my roots.  It was like it was over conditioned.  I now only use it once a week as a conditioning treatment and I like it just fine that way.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I won&#x27;t use anything else again. I&#x27;m actually growing new hair!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but that will never be the case.  First, it doesn&#x27;t even begin to clean your scalp.  It made my hair greasy and worst of all, gave me dandruff.  I even posted on their site and they told me to use more of the product.  It made it worse.  If you want a clean scalp and don&#x27;t want dandruff, I don&#x27;t recommend Wen.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market.  My hair feels so different, like it is someone elses hair.  It has body for the first time.  It is expensive, but if it continues to work like this, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This gave me 100% satisfaction. Because of it&#x27;s great length, my hair would become tangled in a few hours and by the end of the day it could take me up to five minutes to comb. Since using this, my hair is baby soft and I loose hardly any hair in the shower. My hair also used to be very damaged and now I feel a huge difference in it&#x27;s health. I will buy this product over and over again. If my hair could, it would sing a thousand praises to Chaz Dean.</li>
            <li> I purchased the sweet almont mint cleansing cream about a month ago. I have mixed feelings about this product. My hair does have a lot more volume and overall looks and feels healthier. However, it makes your hair super greasy real quick. I use to wash my hair every other day to avoid dry out, but now I have to was every day or it is a big pile of slime. GROSS! I definitly do not think it is worth the money and I will never purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t decide if I like this stuff or not.  My hair does not look like the people on the infomercials but I do not use 40 pumps!  It&#x27;s too expensive!  But my hair is definately softer when I do use it.  I can not go without washing my hair the next day because it doesn&#x27;t smell fresh enough and because it feels waxy.  I purchased WEN to control my frizzy curly hair and it has not done that.  I will not be purchasing this product again.  I am going to try One.  I do like DevaCurl Products.</li>
            <li> I love the way Wen makes my hair feel. My hair was hard to control and never soft before Wen. I have tried several of the different Wen types, but I love this one the most. My hair is silky, soft, and manageable. Wen is expensive but so worth it. I know longer have to use any other products to manage my hair so that is a factor in the cost. Thank you Chaz Dean!</li>
            <li> I am a Power Yoga Instructor and the classes are done at 90 degrees and I sweat 2 times a day which really dries out my hair.  One of my instructors told me about the WEN system and that I had to try it.  I have to say it has made a huge difference in my hair.  It is full, bouncy &amp; shiny and my hairdresser couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in just 4 weeks.  When I use one of my \\&quot;other\\&quot; shampoos I notice that my hair is not as soft or manageable.  My hair gets really frizzy in the heat &amp; humidity and the wen styling cream works wonders.  NO frizz!  Love it and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I USED THE PRODUCT - X 4 - AND MY HAIR WAS AS DRY AS EVER - FRIZZ,COARSE PERSIST . IDID EXPECT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE GREAT PRESS THIS PRODUCT RECEIVES.  I DID RETURN THIS PRODUCT - GLAD IT WORKS FOR SOME-</li>
            <li> I have tried this conditioner - and yes, I followed the instructions.  Although I love the smell of the Sweet Almond Mint, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; for hair types.  I noticed after I ordered this that there were other blends to try - so I might look into that.  My hair is somewhat difficult to work with in general, so I wasn&#x27;t totally disappointed because I&#x27;ve had issues with other shampoos and conditioners not working with my hair type.  I think the price is way too high for what you get.  I might look into the Sally knock-off that others are talking about on here, and see if that works better - a much friendlier price.</li>
            <li> My hair is course dry and extremely frizzy, and for me hair styling typically meant a minimum of five different products, starting from shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, pre heat treatment serum and blowdrying/straightening....   now with Wen, though I still use my serum prior to blowdrying, all I need is the cleansing conditioner. And I absolutely love the smell and cooling effect of the conditioner when I leave it on. Also the minty fresh fragrance, makes me feel so refreshed..... Additionally I have also noticed that I have less hair loss.  Its a fantastic product and definitely worth a try. Who knows you may get hooked to it as I did!  And oh, when you do have the time.. try applying this to your hair, and then sitting in the jacuzzi..... feels like you are in a spa!  For me the only drawback is that, I cannot  agree to the fact that this is the only product my hair needs. Since I have coarse and frizzy hair, blow drying my hair after using only this product and none of the serum makes it look dry and lifeless :(</li>
            <li> i&#x27;v been using this stuff for about 6 months now, it took me a while to get use to. but it payed off! this whole week i&#x27;v put NOTHING else into my hair. no mouse, sray, gell(use to use all of it) this stuff is very expensive but will now save me lots of money. if you have curly hair do yourself a favor and give this a try, it wasn&#x27;t that great for the first like 3 months, but now i can say its the only thing i use for my hair</li>
            <li> Incredible changes in my hair! I suffered from frizzy hair since I color my hair every 3-4 weeks. Also, living in the hot humid weather in Florida which is not good for people who want their hair to look like a million bucks every day. Since I use WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, my hair is not frizzy anymore.I have more[[ASIN:B00183EZQI WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16oz and 6oz Travel Size]] shiny looking and sleek hair now. Also, I noticed that it looks much longer than before I used this product. I don&#x27;t need half an hour in the bathroom, because my hair is more manageable. I just ordered the other WEN Hair Conditioner with Lavender. I can&#x27;t wait to try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely and highly recommend WEN Hair Care products to anyone who is not bald and cares to look good.[[ASIN:B0006Q0H5G WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner - 16oz]]</li>
            <li> This almond mint is the second WEN cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve tried. I tried it because I like the smell of almond, but found that the mint smell is the only thing I smell.  Both the Almond Mint and Lavender  cleaned my hair beautifully.  I think the Lavender is intended more for my hair type (wavy) and I love the smell so I think I will go back to the Lavender when this one is finished.</li>
            <li> Wen&#x27;s Sweet Almond Mint Conditioner is a wonderful product. I have curly hair that looks frizzy no matter how much conditioner I use. Even if I use other products to control the frizz, they will make my hair look and feel stiff and greasy. Wen, when used according to the directions is the only product I need to use. I can leave my hair in it&#x27;s natural curly state or straighten it. My hair will remain soft, clean, manageable, and best of all no FRIZZ!</li>
            <li> I have long wavy/curly hair that frizzes and tends to be dry and brittle. I have searched for products for many many years that will allow me to wash and go without putting a ton of products in my hair. I am able to wash, leave some in, use gel and my hair is pretty manageable throughout the day. I can run my fingers through my hair without it frizzing like before and it feels soft and it&#x27;s shiny. The downside for me is my hair gets tired of products after a few weeks so I have to go back to my regular shampoo, conditioner, and leave ins for a few days, but can go back to WEN with no problem. My hair doesn&#x27;t look like the WEN models, but it is much easier to manage and takes less time to do. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> Wen is, by far, the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever found for my thin, mediterranean curly hair which tends toward dry and wispy unless I use Wen. I&#x27;m DONE with shampoo and conditioners, this does it ALL in one step and then I put a little bit in my hair after towel drying and I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair again for up to 4 days, depending on how active I&#x27;ve been. Plus, I color my hair and always wait til that 4th day to color, my scalp is never dried out after and my hair feels like silk when I am done. This IS the good stuff!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I was extremely skeptical about this product becuz most infomercial products are cr*p, but I was totally desperate and after researching it on QVC, Amazon, and reading numerous reviews on it, I decided to take a chance and slap down the $55. I received this exact cleansing conditioner by itself in the mail over a week ago and I&#x27;ve used it for 8 straight days now.....OMG!!! It works EXACTLY as promised (huge surpise to me!!) I seriously cannot believe how soft my hair is. I am 37yrs old and if I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single morning, by noon it is a total greaseball! However, when I DID wash it every morning with normal shampoo, it was dry and brittle. I could never get a happy medium. Before buying this stuff, I also tried using just conditioner (no shampoo) on my hair, thinking it would probably get the same results as this stuff. Nope, it was totally greasy by noon. Using Wen Almond cleansing conditioner makes my hair perfectly soft and hydrated thruout the entire day (like it was when I was 22!) without ANY greasiness! Just follow the instructions EXACTLY as they read on the bottle: I personally...1) Run water completely thru hair first 2) I use 12 pumps of Wen on my hair cuz my hair is very thin and just past my shoulders 3) I massage it in really good 4) I thoroughly comb thru my hair so the Wen is completely distributed 5) I pile it all on top of my head and put a shower cap over it 6) then I shower for 5 minutes with it soaking in 7) then I rinse completely for at least 3 minutes and towel/air dry. I use a non-sulfate clarifying shampoo once every 10 days. That&#x27;s it!! This stuff rocks and I&#x27;ll probly use it the rest of my life!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am going to order the Almond product today, and am very hopeful it will reduce the natural frizzy texture of my very fine, but dense red colored hair, before my trip to Panama next month. I expect the humidity there to make my frizzies even worse, so I have high hopes, Chaz.    I have to point out though that this combo offer of one 16 oz full size and one 6 oz \\&quot;travel\\&quot; size is only a travel deal if you are traveling by car, train or cruise ship, because the travel size is 6 ounces.     TSA flight restrictions for air travel limit containers to 3 ounces or less. So, the supposedly travel size will be confiscated at the airport. Kind of defeats the purpose of ordering this combo package with a trip in mind. Just order the full size &amp; put some in a small container for your flights.</li>
            <li> Wen cleansing conditioner is far better than any shampoo I have ever used! It is made from a long list of herbs and no additives.  It feels as if my hair had a very expensive spa treatment!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping it would help me control my kinky curly hair. It has transformed my hair in a lot of ways. The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; I can come up with is that, like many other people who have reviewed this product, I find that for good reason, it weighs my hair down. Even after having just washed my hair and let it air dry, my hair can look oily. So many pros to just the 1 con... I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product because my hair feels and smells good after a wash and set at the hair salon.  However, the salon will add shampoo when you are not looking because this stuff doees lather up.  It works very good in conditioning and cleaning the hair.  I always end up putting more than I need.  I wish it would last but it doesn&#x27;t.  I won&#x27;t recommend this to everyone so you have to test it our first.  Everyone is different and have different texture of hair.  My hair is fine to medium and I wanted to stop using shampoo(s).  So, this is my first time and I like it.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance of the Wen cleansing conditioner. I may be 63, but I&#x27;m blessed with natural oils in my hair. I have VERY rarely used conditioners because they have left my hair feeling a bit heavy. I do get the same feeling from using this product. Normally I shampoo every other day, but using Wen, it feels weighted the first day.   My usage will be perhaps once a week, but just since I cannot cleanse my hair with it each time - sorry, as I really enjoy the fragrance. It just doesn&#x27;t perform for me as I hoped.</li>
            <li> This product was great for one or two day use.  But any more consecutive day use leaves hair greasy, even with aggresive rinsing, my hair was greasy at the roots.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair and Wen helps keep it from being so dry and gives it body.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the cost. I could never use up all the product they want to sell you in the infomercial for $29/month; it seems to last me much longer than they expect, but I have short hair.</li>
            <li> My wife has used the product before and has been pleased with the results, so with this order, just replenished her supply.</li>
            <li> I just got done using WEN and all i can say is WOW!!!!!!!!! My mother has hair like a baby and so does some of my siblings, but not me. Because my mom didn&#x27;t believe in relaxing her girls hair, my hair had to be pressed out if i wanted it straight. I had nice soft,fine hair. It was heathy, until at 19 i decided to get my first relaxer. Well it stayed heathy for about 10 years. With relaxing,drying, and using a curling iron my poor soft and fine hair didn&#x27;t stand a chance. FINALLY, my hair looks heathy again, i actally see that baby texture after the first wash. By the way i&#x27;m in the process of growing my relaxer out. WEN, I&#x27;M SOLD!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product has left my hair extremely greasy.  I cannot believe how gross I feel right now.  Just want to go home and wash my hair.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the WEN Cleansing Conditioner for over a year on my fine color treated hair and I&#x27;m extrememly happy with the results.  It does take some getting used to ( believing you can get your hair and scalp clean without \\&quot;suds&#x27;) but the results will prove to you it works.   I even use it on my grandchildren.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product for quite some time that didn&#x27;t have all the detergents in it that other shampoos have.  I came across Wen on an infomercial one day and decided to look it up on line.  I found some great deals on amazon and read all of the great reviews and was excited to get my order, a 16oz bottle with 6 oz travel size.  I used the product the first night I got it, following the directions to the tee.  I have hair down to my middle back, it is somewhat thick and a little coarse from dying it about every 3 months.  After using the \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot;, my hair felt very greasy and heavy, so much so that I had to wash it again with a regular shampoo from Wal Mart.  I would not recommend this product to anyone and I am appalled at the reviews I ready before I bought it.  The other reviews stating that this is a good product must get compensation for doing so.  I am very irritated that I spent almost $50 for this \\&quot;cleansing conditioner\\&quot; and unfortunately will never use it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair ended up very unhealthy and dry since I went through a phase where I was having it highlighted a lot regularly for over a year.  I was constantly fighting my hair when it seems to constantly do the exact opposite of what I want it to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first read over the directions on how to use WEN, I thought it would take a long time.  I was also worried that it wouldn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as traditional shampoo.  I tend to have oily hair, and it shows if I don&#x27;t wash it every day.  Well, since using WEN now for a few weeks, I can say that I had nothing to worry about on both those items.  WEN is very simple to use and really doesn&#x27;t take long.  You just massage in the correct amount (which you will figure out by feel) into your hair and scalp, comb through with a wide-toothed comb and clip it up (a claw-clip works well) for the rest of your shower.  At the end of the shower, I turn the water temp down to a luke-warm setting to rinse WEN out of my hair.  My hair feels MUCH more clean after using WEN than it did with other shampoo &amp; conditioner products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did WEN improve all the problems I have with my hair?  No.  It still flips out where it wants to when I&#x27;m trying to straighten it (I&#x27;m going through the awkward growing-out stage of an inverted bob, however, so that is most of the reason for that).  My hair does seem much more healthy, soft and moisturized after using WEN.  And, it behaves a little bit better than it used to!  Not perfect, but it&#x27;s better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I going to continue to use WEN?  Definitely!  I think I&#x27;ll purchase the larger 32-oz bottle next time.  But, the 6-oz travel size bottle I got with this order is PERFECT for travel, to keep in your over-night bag, or to keep at your gym!  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does WEN smell?  I like the sweet almond mint.  It&#x27;s a very refreshing, invigorating scent.  The different scents that are available are actually formulated for different types of hair (dry, oily, normal, etc...), so do some research before you purchase one to make sure it with work with your hair type!  The Sweet Almond Mint is for normal hair and should work for most people.e research before you purchase one to make sure it with work with your hair type!  The Sweet Almond Mint is for normal hair and should work for most people.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would reccommend it to everyone! The price is a little high - but the product is worth it...</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my curly hair.  I will never use another brand of hair products.  I am going to recommend this product to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> My hair was nothing but a grease ball after using this product.  Could hardly blowdry my hair.  Called for pointers, was using the product correctly.  I guess it just doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical, but have to admit that I really think this works great.  Not too expensive and that 16oz bottle has lasted longer than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year and I love it.  I stopped using it several months ago because I&#x27;d run out and I thought I&#x27;d save some money.  My hair started drying out and getting frizzy at the ends again, so I started using the sweet almond mint again.  It makes my hair look like I just got it cut and it&#x27;s very soft and silky, like when I was a kid.   There are some things to get used to.  My hair has very fine strands but there is a lot of it, so it&#x27;s thick.  It&#x27;s a bit difficult to get the product all the way to the scalp but if you wet your hair very well before you apply it, then plenty gets to the scalp.  I also keep adding a little water as I massage the conditioner into my scalp.  It&#x27;s important to make sure the product is evenly distributed.  I also scrub my scalp with my fingernails to make sure it gets clean.  Then I just leave the product on while I take my shower.  The most important thing to do is rinse, rinse, rinse it all out until your hair is squeaky clean.  If you don&#x27;t do this, you&#x27;ll have very greasy results and your hair will be dull (this is the main complaint I see on these reviews).  Once all the product is rinsed out, add a tiny amount to the very ends of your hair and rinse it out like you would a normal conditioner (a really tiny amount to the very tips of your hair). I wash everyday and my hair always looks great.  My friends all comment on how healthy my hair always is.  About once every 2 weeks, I do shampoo with a sulfate-free clarifying shampoo but I would do that no matter what product I use. I use the Wen as a conditioner whenever I use my clarifying shampoo.   I have only used the sweet almond mint and fig and I like the sweet almond mint much better because the fig has a horrible smell (to me).  I have also used it to shave my legs and I get wonderful results.  It prevents irritation and leaves my legs very smooth.  I cannot stress enough that if your hair is greasy when you use this, then you need to make sureyou are getting it on your scalp and that you are rinsing it very thoroughly.  The only downside is the price.  I usually pay a premium for good hair products, so I&#x27;m no stranger to paying for quality but it is a bit higher than I&#x27;d like to pay for something that I have to replace every month.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after my best friend raved about it and I&#x27;m completely disappointed. First of all, I was sent a peach scent instead of the sweet almond mint I ordered. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and my hair is DISGUSTING! It&#x27;s a big ball of greasy nastiness. Greasy hair is not something I have ever had an issue with before. I will NOT be using this product again. Yuck.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, fine (but thick) hair which I blow dry straight and this product made my hair waxy, dull and lifeless. I used it 4 times to try and give it a solid chance but it just kept getting worse and worse. I didn&#x27;t like any of the products at all.</li>
            <li> You have got to try this product!!  Absolutely awesome product!  I am SOLD forever.  Not a detergent..no foaming or suds.  Nothing but nutrients and conditioner to clean and do everything needed for your hair!! I didn&#x27;t think my hair would be clean enough, but I was wrong. The results the longer you use it are incredible!  If you color your hair, you will NOT believe the difference this product makes with your hair.  I usually have to get my hair colored every 4 weeks, due to the fading and roots.  There is NO FADING of the color using WEN.  My hair and highlights last almost twice as long now!!  I cannot believe what a difference this product has made!  I am their biggest fan now and tell everyone about this product!!  My kids are using it as well.  Cuts down on split ends and smooths the hair.  TRY IT!!  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAAPOINTED!  I WILL NEVER USE REGULAR SHAMPOO AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my best friend has it and her hair is unbelievable!! She raves about it and has been using it for almost a year and her hair is better and better. Unfortunately, my hair never changed.. it was the same as when I used the much cheaper salon bought shampoo and conditioner. So I have decided to stick with the less expensive product for obvious reasons.. maybe my hair is already as good as it&#x27;s gonna get.. oh well.. I am happy I tried it though.. cause you never know unless you do :)</li>
            <li> I like the smell although I don&#x27; think this one work well for my hair. I have a color and flat hair. After use this one I could feel that my hair a little dry compaire to the WEN fig. But once at a while I still use it, I think it would be better that I did not use the same brand or same ingredient all the time.</li>
            <li> As always, Wenn products are fabulous. Any time I&#x27;ve placed an order for it through Amazon it arrives in excellant condition and sooner than promised. I always purchase through Amazon because I don&#x27;t want to commit to the auto-ship you have to do through the Chaz Dean website.</li>
