            <li>This is a beautiful color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great ordering my own gel colors.</li>
            <li>I love all my gelish polish colors, and this color is no exception!  </li>
            <li>I found it to be more successful to just go to a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Gelish is by far one of the best polishes out there!</li>
            <li>I think 3 coats would&#x27;ve been better, but I didn&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li>love the color of this polish .</li>
            <li>Love this color.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a spring/summer pink color and this seemed the best out of all the Gelish options.</li>
            <li>Super bright, fun color</li>
            <li>I used two layers to get a solid beautiful color on my nails.</li>
            <li>Very bright pink.</li>
            <li>This color is neon pink, and it is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received this color in the mail</li>
            <li>Fun to wear for SUMMER!</li>
            <li>In sunlight it&#x27;s a beautiful pink color.</li>
            <li>Thought it was a neon pink by was more of a bright salmon color.</li>
            <li>The shipment came faster than expected which was great.</li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect as well, not too runny and not too thick.</li>
            <li>I own 5 Gelish colors now and this is by far the runniest, thinnest color I have.</li>
            <li>im sure i will be looking at more of ths sellers product in the future</li>
            <li>came pretty quick</li>
            <li>Good price, but the color is not right.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous,  vibrant pink.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice, but has a coral tone...not as hot pink as the swatch.</li>
            <li>almost a neon pink great for spring and summer.(ill wear it year round:-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh and lively color for spring and summer.</li>
            <li>color turns out almost peachy in some of the pictures, but it really does seem like a mixture of bright pink with a tiny bit of orange/peach.</li>
            <li>When I tried this color people thought I tanned because of how much this color stands out.</li>
            <li>Suppose to be a neon pink and is more redish orange.</li>
            <li>Its a fun hot pink neon-esque color.</li>
            <li>It is completely opaque with two coats.  </li>
            <li>I expected something similar to a hot pink based on the picture, &amp; instead I received a color that looks more like a red.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot pink with an orange undertone.</li>
            <li>Just the hot pink I wanted!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very vibrant pink,</li>
            <li>So hard to really tell the exact color.</li>
            <li>Fun for time off of work, or if you are young, but not okay for the workplace.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this color, I just wish it weren&#x27;t so thin.</li>

            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my nails all the time because of how long the colors last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got multiple compliments on it over the last few days.</li>
            <li> After 2 coats it&#x27;s still slightly see through.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Can be a little hard to soak off though.</li>
            <li> With some of their colors I&#x27;m frustrated because of how thick it is, this one definitely doesn&#x27;t have that</li>
            <li> Its so watery and thin.</li>
            <li> I even tried it over a white base.</li>
            <li> so something&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> I have to wonder if the company I bought it from put the wrong color in the bottle because the bottle is labeled the color name that it&#x27;s supposed to be???</li>

            <li> I doubt this is actually gelish. Its so watery and thin. I put it on last night and it took six coats for actual semi-coverage. I even tried it over a white base. Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous,  vibrant pink.</li>
            <li> Just the hot pink I wanted! Long lasting. Can be a little hard to soak off though.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice, but has a coral tone...not as hot pink as the swatch.</li>
            <li> Gelish is by far one of the best polishes out there!</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my nails all the time because of how long the colors last. When I tried this color people thought I tanned because of how much this color stands out. (I don&#x27;t tan)</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color! I was so excited when I received this color in the mail and I immediately put it on my fingers and toes. It&#x27;s a fresh and lively color for spring and summer. The consistency is perfect as well, not too runny and not too thick. I used two layers to get a solid beautiful color on my nails. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very bright pink. Fun for time off of work, or if you are young, but not okay for the workplace.</li>
            <li> This is my go to color! It&#x27;s hot pink with an orange undertone.</li>
            <li> The shipment came faster than expected which was great. But the color wasn&#x27;t what I thought. So hard to really tell the exact color. Thought it was a neon pink by was more of a bright salmon color.</li>
            <li> I love all my gelish polish colors, and this color is no exception!  This color is neon pink, and it is gorgeous! It is completely opaque with two coats.  I will never buy another brand of gel polish!</li>
            <li> This was not neon at all! I found it to be more successful to just go to a beauty supply store. Opening the polish and looking at the actual brush is the only way to get the color you want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great ordering my own gel colors.</li>
            <li> Good price, but the color is not right. Suppose to be a neon pink and is more redish orange. This is the same color I always got at the salon so something&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> I expected something similar to a hot pink based on the picture, &amp; instead I received a color that looks more like a red.  I have to wonder if the company I bought it from put the wrong color in the bottle because the bottle is labeled the color name that it&#x27;s supposed to be???</li>
            <li> I adore this color. It is currently on my fingernails. Its a fun hot pink neon-esque color. Fun to wear for SUMMER!</li>
            <li> Super bright, fun color</li>
